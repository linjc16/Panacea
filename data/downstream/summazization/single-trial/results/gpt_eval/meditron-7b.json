        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

A group I and group II of 30 patients each were formed from the sampled patients. For the patients in group I, a bed with a cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was used. For the patients in group II, a viscoelastic mattress was used. The data of the study were collected with the ''Patient Identification Form'', ''Braden Scale'', ''Pressure Wound Observation Form'' and ''Wound Measurement Chart''. Number-percentage distributions, Chi-square, Fisher's Exact Probability Test and Mann-Whitney-U tests were used to evaluate the data.\nImplications for Clinical Practice: It was determined that the support surface used affected the pressure sore size and the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature created smaller sized wounds in the sacrum, trochanter, malleolus and heel regions. In the sacrum, scapula, and heel regions, although not statistically significant in terms of wound stage and the number of patients who developed pressure sores, it was seen that the mattress with cube/block system and vibration (massage) feature was more effective.",

        "summary": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axon damage. Affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals around the world and seen mostly in young adults, MS can cause different levels of disability in functional activities, cause limitations in social and professional life, and impair quality of life. Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that develops on the basis of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Nutritional habits and physical activity are important environmental factors. These can be effective in the course of MS and change the quality of life. Compatibility of nutrition with the Mediterranean diet and providing adequate physical activity may be beneficial in increasing physical and mental well-being in general, and therefore the quality of life of the person.\nIn our country, there is not enough information about the ongoing nutritional habits and physical activity levels of MS patients in their daily lives, and quality of life studies are limited. Our limited knowledge on these issues narrows the possibility of movement in an area that can be corrected in MS patients and thus have a positive impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters.",

The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population. The latter broadly describes a population with ethnical, cultural, religious and/or language characteristics and is a general accepted measure of diversity.\nIn the current study, the investigators aim to describe the different (dis)advantages of both second line treatments for OAB in a discrete choice experiment. The study population will consist of a diverse group of patients with OAB from different hospitals. The goal is to investigate if CALD patients make a different choice in treatment and what factors contribute to that decision in order to provide more tailored information regarding the treatment options in the future. Taking a patient's context into account in the shared decision making between a patient and physician increases therapy compliance and satisfaction of the chosen treatment.\nThe total questionnaire will consist out of general demographic info, the EQ-5D, the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire (ICIQ)-OAB and the discrete choice questionnaire in which patients make a choice between two fictional treatment options consisting of a combination of different therapy characteristics.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae[3]. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[4].

The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed[7]. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal [8].

An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team.

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients. That is why we conducted the present study to present our experience with the modified mini-incision technique and compare its outcomes to the conventional open approach.",

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

        "summary": "A randomized, controlled, and evaluator-blinded trial will be carried out to investigate the effects of 8 weeks of upper limb somatosensory discrimination therapy compared to an equal dose of motor therapy on sensorimotor outcomes in children and adolescents with spastic unilateral cerebral palsy aged 7 to 15 years old. Additionally, the potential role of clinical and neurological baseline characteristics on treatment response will be explored, including the extent of the brain lesion, age and baseline somatosensory function. The researchers primarily expect that the bimanual performance will improve equally in children and adolescents from both intervention groups, as measured immediately after the intervention has ended. The researchers hypothesize, however, that there will be a better retention effect in children and adolescents that received somatosensory discrimination therapy, resulting in differences between both groups in bimanual performance as measured at 6-months follow-up. The researchers further expect larger improvements in somatosensory function for children and adolescents in the somatosensory discrimination group and this both immediately after the intervention and at 6-month follow-up.",

        "summary": "Sepsis, characterized by severe organ dysfunction related to a dysregulated immune response to infection, is often life-threatening in clinical settings. Sepsis can progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), causing a great risk of mortality. As a vital immune and metabolic organ, liver often suffers damage in this process and often associated with severe adverse consequences. Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection. Study found that APRI was a good predictor of SALD occurrence in pediatric patients with sepsis. Furthermore, APRI has also been used to predict the prognostic in septic patients with no history of chronic liver disease.\nWe conducted a retrospective study based on data from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV version 2.2 (MIMIC-IV, v2.2) and our own hospital to explore the potential association of APRI with the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. Furthermore, we also evaluated the performance of APRI in hypoxic hepatitis and sepsis induced cholestasis (SIC), which are two subtypes of SALD.",

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

The patient physical and psychological sufferings in ALS are immense, and apart from Riluzole, there is no effective treatment. Care of advanced ALS have an estimated cost of 4-8 million NOK per year. Perhaps the most challenging topic of ALS care is the decision to extend ventilation support into the stages of disease that require treatment both during day and night. In these cases, treatment is clearly life-sustaining and although quality of life may be maintained, the burden of caregiving imposed upon family or health care workers is huge, regardless of tracheostomy (TIV) or non-invasive (NIV) modality.\nThe present study is a longitudinal questionnaire study in Norway measuring overall quality of life, health-related quality of life, and disease-specific quality of life in ALS patients, partners and children before and after the introduction of life sustaining ventilation support. The investigators aim to increase the knowledge on how life-sustaining ventilation support with NIV or TIV affects the quality of life in ALS patients, life partners and children. The results from the study may provide crucial information for clinicians and patients on one of the most difficult ethical issues of ALS treatment.

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

Around 80% of the patients who present with a colon cancer and is in a condition where surgery is possible will be offered resection of the tumor. A part of the colon is always removed together with the lymph nodes in order to ensure that cancer cells are not left behind. The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques. This new organ sparing approach is called Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS).

        "summary": "This is an observational study to compare the utility of the novel aMRI approach in human brain to the standard of care imaging approach for diagnosing and assessing glioma. Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity. Via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET, this clinical trial will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach for evaluating neurological disease in patients with glioma.",

Tamsulosin is an alpha-blocker widely used in urological practice to relax smooth muscle of the prostate and bladder neck. Its role as part of medical expulsion therapy for the treatment of patients with kidney and ureteric stones has proved to be of considerable success. However, its role in clearing upper ureteric stones as an adjunct to ESWL is controversial. Therefore, this study will be conducted to evaluate its role in stone clearance along with extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in patients with upper ureteric stones",

To do this, the tracheal cannula is first unblocked, so that patients no longer breathe in and out through the cannula, but (at least partially) passing the cannula by the natural route. In the presence of tracheal stenosis there is increased breathing effort, possibly restlessness and stridor. This constellation of symptoms suggests the suspicion of tracheal stenosis, so in the next step a tracheoscopy is performed to confirm or exclude tracheal stenosis. In case of symptomatic tracheal stenosis and at least 30-50% stenosis of the trachea (clinical symptoms can be expected from a 30-50% stenosis) then appropriate therapy (here: cryotherapy, other techniques only in exceptional cases) is planned. The goal is to be able to remove the tracheal cannula (long term) after successful therapy, so that patients do not have to be permanently provided with a tracheal cannula. There is no definitive/evidence-based standard therapy for the treatment of tracheal stenosis. Cryotherapy is a gentle therapy that has already been applied and described for the treatment of tracheal stenosis (see above). The examination is performed as part of an analgesic dose, as is routine for a bronchoscopy (in-house SOP). After treatment, a follow-up is planned for about 10 days later.",

        "summary": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, such as bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. The behavioral and social complications often marginalize the population, impact on life satisfaction, undermined societal values that impact on economic and financial fairness, and so forth. Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania. The study protocol, Psychiatric Orders in Psychoanalytic Treatment of ASD, is therefore designed for an evidence-based approach in treating complex psychiatric disorders with psychoanalytic guidance.",

The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research.

Our project (The PIVCO study) aims to determine a more standardized procedure representing optimal ablation strategy for patients suffering from PsAF using PFA and multielectrode ablation catheters. The central hypothesis is that ablation of the posterior LA wall (PWI), together with mitral and cavotricuspid isthmus ablation added on top of PVI, will be associated with better effects in terms of rhythm control. Given the speed, safety, and ease of standardization of ablation using electroporation, a demonstration of the superiority of either approach could significantly impact the current standard of clinical care.",

The investigators intend to follow families and their children until the children in the study graduate from high-school or turn 19 years of age.\nThe study, as a template, uses the eight outcome domains listed and described in the Home Visiting Evidence of Effectiveness website (http://homvee.acf.hhs.gov/outcomes.aspx). These eight domains are:\nChild development and school readiness\nFamily economic self-sufficiency\nMaternal health\nReductions in child maltreatment\nChild health\nLinkages and referrals\nPositive parenting practices\nReductions in juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime\nThe investigators expect to observe significant differences among the two groups with respect to the primary outcome domains listed. The investigators expect study group members randomized to the CHI SJC program will perform better on the eight outcome domains.\nOther hypotheses include:\nOther Hypotheses:\nHypothesis 1. Randomization to CHI SJC will be associated with higher quality functioning and better child health and well-being.\nHypothesis 2. Randomization to CHI SJC will result in more connections to community resources.\nHypothesis 3.

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

Serial neurochecks are part of guideline recommendations, but there is equipoise between hourly (Q1) and every-other-hour (Q2) evaluation. In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks. Once randomized, patients will undergo placement of electroencephalogram (EEG) with video, electrooculogram, and chin lead. The video EEG will be in place for at least 8 hours to include the overnight (10PM-6AM) time period. Following completion of the recording, the signals obtained will be reviewed by a blinded polysomnographic sleep technician for sleep characteristics including quantitative assessments of wakefulness, deep (N3) sleep, REM sleep, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation and arousals.

It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests.

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision. From a data analysis point of view, EVAs also have the advantage of offering a continuous quantitative response, allowing the use of all statistical approaches. If some questionnaires have already been validated in the form of EVA, such as the EVA stress versus the  Perceived Stress Scale  questionnaire (PSS), the EVA workload and EVA autonomy at work versus the Karasek questionnaire, the other reference questionnaires are not yet validated in EVA (burnout, anxiety, efforts / rewards, work addiction, etc.).",

In an attempt to attenuate the loss of hard and soft tissue after tooth loss, alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) immediately after complete tooth extraction could minimize the need for ancillary ridge augmentation or soft tissue grafting. Different techniques and barrier membranes has been proposed to achieve the sealing of extraction socket.\nAim:\nTo investigate the effect of different techniques and barrier membranes for the soft tissue contour and morphological change of alveolar ridge after ARP\nMethods:\nThe study was designed as a randomized controlled trial and recruited patients, who require ARP for the purpose of implant placement or prosthodontic rehabilitation. After the tooth extraction, patients were randomly allocated to one of the following groups: ridge preservation with a xenogeneic bone substitute and (a) spontaneous healing (control), (b) covered with a free palatal graft, (c) or covered with pedical palatal graft, (d) covered with a collagen membrane, (e) covered with a non-resorbable high-density polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks following tooth extraction and ARP, clinical profilometric and radiographic evaluations were performed to analyze the change of hard and soft tissue contour.

Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery and so on. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption.\nThe incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%.\nThe reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications.\nNumerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation.

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity. BLEX 404 enhances hematopoiesis by increasing mouse bone marrow cell and human cord blood cell differentiation into granulocytes-macrophages (GMs), granulopoiesis and mobilization of granulocytes, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF production. One related phase I healthy human trial by treating with Maitake D-fraction was examined in Italy.

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

        "summary": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20% percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5% in Asia. GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores. Further the modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia is examined.",

Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices. These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS.

New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised. Data will be obtained through a range of measures to monitor safety (incidence and types of adverse events), adherence (sessions/time attended, movement repetitions) and through interviews with participants, their family/carers, and staff to understand user acceptability.",

Recent research has shown Egypt to be the third-largest country globally, with an estimated 52% cesarean sections (3). However, the cesarean section has many serious complications, including the primary postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) (4). During labor, the average blood loss is about 300 to 400 ml. Bleeding postpartum is known as losing over five hundred milliliter of blood following a vaginal birth and losing over one thousand milliliter after the cesarean section (5). The prime cause of maternal death rate is postpartum bleeding, predominately in poor countries, and the estimated mortality number due to postpartum bleeding is one hundred thousand per year (6). Therefore, it is essential to reduce bleeding during and after CS to diminish maternal mortality and morbidity (7). The most successful technique for decreasing PPH is the active third stage labor management, requiring prophylactic uterotonic drugs like oxytocin, ergometrine malate, prostaglandins (E1, E2, and F2\u03b1), and combinations of them, or hemostatic agent as tranexamic acid (Kapron) and Etamsylate (Dicynon) (8, 9).",

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

Palatoglossal air space shadow error is one of the most common positioning errors and it's due to the tongue not sticking to the roof of the palate. Techniques used to deal with this error might help prevent unnecessary radiation to patients and save them time and money. The study aimed to investigate to investigate the effects of using celluloid matrix and edible tapes (fruit leather and chewing gum) on reducing the palatoglossal air space shadow error in panoramic imaging Methods: In our study, 270 patients referred to the Department of Radiology were randomised into three groups: a control group, a celluloid matrix group, and an edible tapes group. Before panoramic imaging, all patients were instructed to adhere their tongues to the roof of their mouths, with the distinction that for the celluloid matrix and edible tapes groups, patients were asked to place celluloid tapes, fruit leathers, or chewing gums on their tongues before doing so. The routine imaging process was then performed, and the results were compared across groups to evaluate the incidence of palatoglossal air space shadow error.\nResults: *** Conclusion: ***",

At present, there are 66 million patients with moderate to severe OSA in China, and the current diagnosis and treatment of OSA is mainly completed in the sleep center of the hospital, which is time-consuming and laborious, resulting in the delayed diagnosis and treatment of a large number of patients, making about 80% of potential OSA patients have not been diagnosed and treated in time. With the development of the Internet technologies, telemedicine has been increasingly applied to the diagnosis, treatment and management of chronic diseases with its advantages of convenience, interactivity, efficiency, sharing, coherence and breaking through the limitations of time and space. Our center has initially built a remote diagnosis and treatment management model for OSA. Compared with the traditional medical model, the medical and health economic analysis shows that the OSA diagnosis and treatment model based on telemedicine is more cost-effective, but its clinical efficacy needs to be further verified. Hypertension is a common complication in OSA patients, and continuous positive airway pressure (PAP) has a significant hypertensive effect in the treatment of OSA. However, whether clinical management based on remote diagnosis and treatment mode can achieve the same therapeutic effect as traditional face-to-face diagnosis and treatment mode in improving ambulate blood pressure in OSA patients needs to be further clarified. This study will compare the improvement of ambulatory blood pressure management in patients with hypertension under the new telemedicine mode and the traditional medical mode through a single-center randomized controlled trial, so as to optimize the diagnosis and treatment process of OSA patients with hypertension, establish a more convenient and efficient remote diagnosis and treatment mode with reliable clinical outcome, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent multi-center research and promotion",

        "summary": "Low-dose CT (LDCT) screening for lung cancer (LCS) has been shown to reduce lung cancer specific mortality in multiple randomised controlled trials. However, although LDCT screening has been demonstrated to reduce cancer- specific mortality, there remain outstanding questions regarding how screening can be implemented. In particular, indeterminate nodules are common, and can be challenging to distinguish from benign nodules on CT appearances alone. Furthermore, distinguishing cancers which are likely to become clinically significant from those that will remain indolent is challenging, but essential to prevent over-treatment and overdiagnosis. There is significant interest in using a multi-modal approach to LCS, incorporating biomarkers obtained from minimally-invasive samples alongside LDCT to improve ability to recognise clinically-significant lung cancers at an early stage.\nThe Targeted Lung Health Check (TLHC) programme is an NHS programme with the aim of using LDCT screening in appropriately high-risk individuals to improve early diagnosis and survival in lung cancer. The North Central London TLHC programme started in December 2022.\nThe purpose of the ALPINE study is to develop a platform to allow collection of minimally-invasive samples from participants undergoing screening within the North Central London TLHC programme. The use of such biomarkers in the diagnosis of lung cancer is a rapidly developing field and novel techniques and technologies are continuously under development. The ALPINE study will generate a cohort with matched biosamples, CT scans and clinical data which will be uniquely well placed to serve to develop or validate biomarkers in lung cancer screening and risk prediction.",

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes and results in high mortality. However, the epidemiology and treatment strategy for ARDS may have changed significantly due to the accumulation of a large body of knowledge, following the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) of which the primary manifestation is ARDS. To improve the quality of ICU care that patients receive after admission to the ICU, a variety of academic societies, including the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, are currently developing evidence-based guidelines and consensus guidelines and statements regarding ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, ICU diary. The ABCDEF bundle, nutritional therapy, and ICU diary have been developed and are being promoted for implementation in hospitals around the world. The implementation of evidence-based ICU care is strongly recommended, especially for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who frequently require ventilators to maintain their lives, because their patient outcomes are worse than those who were admitted to ICU with other causes.\nHowever, there is still little evidence on how the quality of ICU care (compliance rate) correlates with patient prognosis and outcomes, and there are currently no clear goals or indicators for the ICU care we should develop.\nThis study aims to investigate the epidemiology and treatments given to the patients and evaluate the implementation of evidence-based ICU care and its association with the outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to the ICU. The contents of mechanical ventilation settings, respiratory conditions, and the evidence-based ICU care, such as analgesia, sedation, rehabilitation, and nutrition, given to the patients will be collected in a daily basis.\nAim 1: Epidemiology Aim 2: Treatments Aim 3: Evidence-based ICU care Aim 4: ARDS related Post Intensive Care Syndrome",

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated. We propose a phase I clinical trial to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a weekly infusion of WJ-MSC administered as GvHD prophylaxis and as a support for a faster hematological reconstitution after haplo-identical allo-SCT.",

In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the corrugator supercilii muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 +/-1.4 mm medially and 6.6 +/-1.4mm laterally and recommended BoTN injections at the depth of 4mm.

Active music therapy involves the patient playing an instrument, including voice and body movement in rhythm, without requiring any musical skills. The presence of a qualified music therapy professional is essential, particularly in the reception of the emotions that may be generated during the sessions.

Color selection in the clinic is a very sensitive process and is affected by environmental factors and operator-related variables. This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. In recent years, monochromatic universal composites have been developed that are supposed to be compatible with all Vita Classic Scale shades from A1 to D4. Manufacturers report that single-color universal composites can be applied to teeth of all colors without using the layering technique using different color composites.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) and World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria.",

The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",

There is a lack of educational opportunities focused on survivorship care for health providers. Although progress has been made with the development of survivorship guidelines, physicians continue to express barriers to addressing concerns of cancer survivors.

The investigators aim to enroll 4 participants with skin tones associated with those of African descent (Group A), 4 of East Asian descent (Group B), and 4 of European descent (Group C). Additionally, the investigators aim to ensure half of group is male, and the other half female. For the duration of the study, two wearable devices will be placed on the participant: a Nonin PureSat pulse oximeter on a forefinger, and the novel wearable pulse oximeter - MABOS - on the other forefinger. Prior to testing, an Ocean HR2 XR Spectrometer will be used to assess the absorbance of three wavelengths of light - 410, 660, 940 nm - on each patient's inner wrist. Following this, the two devices will be placed on the patient, set up, and calibrated for 10 minutes. During the calibration period, MABOS will be used to measure the same three wavelengths of light utilized by the Ocean HR2 XR Spectrometer (410, 660, and 940 nm).

Improving sleep quality in critically ill patients is a major challenge to promote ICU patient's recovery.\nA very promising treatment is the application of a nocturnal  quiet-time  during which non urgent care, comfort care, systematic measures of vital parameters are delayed and clustered in order to limit room entries. However,  quiet time  procedures have failed to improve sleep quality to date.\nA miniaturized medical device recording one EEG channel and embedding an automated sleep scoring algorithm running in real-time was devised.

At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients. The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the burden of HBV infection in China and contribute to the goal of global elimination of hepatitis B and C by 2030 (WHO 2030).",

        "summary": "More than 30% of Black women with obesity binge eat. Binge eating may increase the risk for the development of metabolic syndrome and binge-eating-disorder (BED), which is associated with severe obesity. Though several effective treatments for binge eating exist, Black women have not fared well. Not only has their inclusion in treatment trials been limited, but when participating, they are more likely to drop out, and/or lose less weight, compared to their White counterparts. Furthermore, treatment for binge eating is often not available in primary care and community-based settings places where Black women are more likely to receive treatment for their eating and weight-related concerns. Currently, there is scant intervention research to treat binge eating in Black women. With the highest rates of obesity (57%) nationally, Black women are in need of culturally-relevant treatments for binge eating and weight gain prevention. Given the established relationship between frequent binge eating and subsequent weight gain, addressing binge eating among Black women with obesity is imperative.",

However, limited data are available that have examined the potential performance enhancing effect of beetroot juice in resistance exercise. Moreover, there is no information on the dose of nitrate required for performance enhancing effects during resistance exercise which limits its widespread use to enhance performance. Therefore, the investigators will assess if supplementing the diet with nitrate-rich beetroot juice impacts resistance exercise performance (e.g., power, velocity), when compared to supplementing the diet with nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (i.e. placebo). The investigators will also investigate the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance by providing a low, moderate, and high nitrate dose of concentrated beetroot juice. The results of this study will improve understanding of whether beetroot juice influences resistance exercise performance and will provide insight on whether different doses of beetroot juice influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance. Together, these data will guide supplementation strategies for enhancing resistance exercise performance.",

Both pressure values applied to the patients intraoperatively are within safe ranges.\nThe mechanical power of ventilation (MP) is the amount of energy transferred per unit time from the mechanical ventilator to the respiratory system. Although this energy is mainly used to overcome airway resistance, some of it directly affects the lung tissue, potentially causing ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). To prevent ventilator-associated lung injury, it requires the mechanical ventilator to be adjusted so that the least amount of energy is transferred to the respiratory system per unit time for each patient. In the results obtained in the published studies; increased mechanical strength has been associated with increased in-hospital mortality, higher hospital stay and higher ICU follow-up requirement.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of two different intra-operative intra-abdominal pressure levels applied to patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia on 'Mechanical Power (MP)'.",

        "summary": "Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.",

        "summary": "Research purpose\nCombined with multi-omics data and advanced data mining methods, we explored the pathogenesis and potential application pathway of intestinal microbiome mediated by specific cardiovascular diseases (such as idiopathic ventricular tachycardia, stenosis after coronary artery stenting injury, etc.) and nervous system diseases (such as carotid atherosclerosis, moyamoya disease, etc.).\nThe secondary goal of this study is the construction of risk prediction model. Based on the pathogenesis identified by multi-omics association analysis, detailed dietary information and clinical information related to cardiovascular and nervous system diseases, the risk of cardiovascular and nervous system diseases was assessed and the disease risk model was constructed.\nBased on the key genes and microorganisms excavated, disease-related machine learning models can be built, and models can be built to prevent and treat diseases.\nResearch background Cardiovascular and nervous system diseases such as arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, postoperative vascular stenosis injury, etc.), heart failure, atherosclerosis (coronary heart disease, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, carotid atherosclerosis, etc.), epilepsy, moyamoya disease, etc., are currently leading to the main diseases affecting the health and death of residents in China.\nThrough the unremitting efforts of many scientists, the research on the association between intestinal flora and cardiovascular diseases (ventricular tachycardia/atrial fibrillation, carotid atherosclerosis, etc.) and nervous system diseases (Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, carotid atherosclerosis, etc.) has made breakthrough progress. However, the study of gut microbiota is still in its infancy, and it is not possible to deeply understand the complex regulatory processes between heart disease and nervous system diseases and gut microbiota, involving a large number of host genes, host metabolites, and associated bacteria and bacteria-related metabolites. Based on multi-omics data, the data integration method combined with machine learning analyzes the connection between cardiovascular and nervous system and gut microbes, helping to deepen the research on the mechanism related to heart disease and nervous system under the regulation of gut microbes and providing new ideas for the prevention and treatment of related diseases. This study will also promote the implementation of clinical interventions with precise flora and provide new ideas for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases and neurological diseases.",

        "summary": "Pembrolizumab has been approved for first-line locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a tumor proportion score (TPS) \u226550% for PDL1, based on the results of KEYNOTE-024.\nHowever, even with a positive PDL1 status, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy. In the KEYNOTE-024 study evaluating pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS \u226550%, the response rate in the pembrolizumab arm alone was 45%. NFE2L2 is a transcription factor that directs the expression of free radical defense genes that may interfere with radiation-induced DNA damage. KEAP1 is an adaptor protein that targets NFE2L2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction as part of normal homeostasis. These new biomarkers are of clinical interest, as KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations predict radiation resistance in patients with localized NSCLC treated with radiotherapy but not surgery. Some data also suggest a role for the KEAP1/NFE2L2 axis in response to immunotherapy.\nEstablishing a predictive model for the presence of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutation would provide a tool for predicting survival (progression-free and overall), even before the patient starts immunotherapy.",

According to statistics, the incidence of nerve root injury under spinal endoscope is 1.8-2.5%. Damage to nerve roots may lead to postoperative sensory retardation and motor weakness, thereby impairing the physical function of patients. A real-time auxiliary intraoperative nerve identification technology is necessary.\nIn this prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel controlled trial, 40 patients who undergo endoscopic spinal surgery are included. Subjects are randomly divided into control group and low, medium and high Indocyanine green(ICG) preoperative administration experimental group. Standard endoscopic spinal surgery is performed in the control group. Patients in the experimental group received an intravenous injection of ICG before surgery, and a standard endoscopic spinal surgery is performed with the use of a fluoroscopic endoscopic surgical imaging system to assist the surgeon in identifying and protecting the nerve roots.\nThe main objectives of this experiment are (i) to explore the safety and feasibility of ICG fluorescence imaging to assist in nerve root identification during endoscopic spinal surgery and (ii) the effectiveness of this technique for endoscopic search for nerve roots.

        "summary": "Background: Parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) have a tendency to provide insufficient caregiving and often need parenting support to prevent neglect and child removal. However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.\nMethods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.\nDiscussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

Unintentional dural puncture (UDP) occurs in 0.4-1.5% of labour epidural analgesia, representing therefore the most common complication. Up to 80% of patients with a UDP may develop a post-dural puncture headache (PDPH).\nWhen a UDP occurs, two possible strategies have been proposed in order to ensure analgesia during labour: either resiting the epidural catheter in a different intervertebral space, or inserting an intrathecal catheter. Both strategies proved to equally provide analgesia during labour, but their relative contribution in preventing PDPH is still not known.\nThe primary aim of this multicenter randomized controlled trial is therefore to compare these two strategies in the occurrence of PDPH at 24 hours from the UDP.",

        "summary": "Healthcare systems in the United States (U.S.) have long faced the considerable challenge of managing budgetary pressures while at the same time helping people with serious mental illness and/or addiction. One potential way to address this challenge is to offer community-based services for individuals who are high-utilizers of expensive emergency and inpatient psychiatric services. Due to the decentralized nature of California governance, responsibility for mental health services falls primarily to the individual counties. The County of Santa Clara, CA invests significantly in community-based services as well as 24-hour care settings. This County adopted an innovative Pay for Performance (PFP) model and contracted with a new care provider to better meet the needs of this patient population and, in turn, reduce demand on the County's 24-hour psychiatric services. Whether this innovative contracting framework will help individuals who thus far have not responded well to mental health services is unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the quality of care for these high-need patients was improved and at a sustainable cost. To this end, a randomized clinical trial (RCT) was conducted to determine whether this innovative quality improvement initiative, referred to as Partners in Wellness, was successful at reducing the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric care used by enrollees compared to individuals who concurrently received services from the county. Individuals were randomly assigned to the Usual Care (UC) or Pay-For-Performance (PFP) conditions. The primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.\nthe primary outcome of this evaluation was reduction in the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services in the target population.",

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent. We propose that rintatolimod/durvalumab-combination therapy is feasible and may induce synergistic anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.",

Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects.

        "summary": "For children with severe cerebral palsy (CP) in whom other options are insufficient, intrathecal baclofen (ITB) treatment could be an option. Literature provides some evidence for the effect of ITB, however we notice that not all children benefit equally. Furthermore long term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with CP have not yet been described in literature. To improve selection for ITB physicians need to know which factors influence outcome on the long term. In order to accomplish these goals prospectively, real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed.\nThe investigators will therefore conduct a prospective observational cohort study using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals.\nAll children and adolescents with CP, who start ITB treatment in the Netherlands under the age of 16, diagnosed with spastic or dyskinetic CP, are eligible for inclusion in the study.\nThe primary outcome measure is goal attainment scaling (GAS) in which achievement of individual goals can be quantified. Factors that potentially influence outcome including spasticity, dystonia, scoliosis and complications will be secondary outcome measures.\nMeasurements will be done before initiation of ITB, after 3 months, after 1 year and after 2 years.\nStatistical analysis will include effect size Cohen's d for all outcome measures. To assess which factors are possibly associated with GAS T-score outcome at follow-up multiple regression analysis will be conducted.",

At the same time, there is little research evidence on which mechanisms of psychotherapy are most effective and best feasible for the acute setting. Therefore, we want to run a pilot study to test specific psychotherapeutic interventions for patients with psychosis on acute psychiatric wards.\nThe method of Motivational Interviewing is a well-known and established interviewing technique, which originally comes from the treatment of addictive disorders. In our study, it is used to strengthen the therapeutic alliance between patient and practitioner already in the acute phase of the disease, to increase adherence, and thus to achieve the overall goal of better integrating patients with pronounced positive symptoms into treatment. This appears to be extremely important, as non-adherence represents one of the greatest risks for chronification of the disease. The intervention will subsequently be evaluated in comparison to treatment as usual.",

        "summary": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) refers to ongoing chromosome segregation errors throughout consecutive cell divisions. CIN is a hallmark of human cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Analyzing CIN of the DNA extracted from cast-off cells in bile samples seems a promising method for diagnosing, monitoring, and predicting the prognosis of biliary tract carcinoma patients. CIN can be assessed using experimental techniques such as bulk DNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or conventional karyotyping. However, these techniques are either time-consuming or non-specific. The investigators here intend to study whether a new method named Bile Ultrasensitive Chromosomal Aneuploidy Detection (BileCAD), which is based on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, can be used to analyze CIN and microbial infection analysis thus help diagnosing and treating biliary tract carcinoma patients.",

Do not explain how you summarize it.\nInput Text: Application of Chromosomal Instability in Early Diagnosis of Biliary Tract Carcinoma\n\nStudy Overview\n=================\nDetailed Description\n-----------------\nBiliary tract carcinoma account for about 3% of all digestive system tumors, with potential high metastasis and invasion ability. Their early clinical symptoms lack specificity, and they are often found in late stage with poor prognosis. CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially way to detect CIN in the cast-off cells from the bile samples for diagnosing and monitoring biliary tract carcinoma patients. BileCAD is a new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from bile, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of biliary tract carcinoma patients.The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing bile samples from gallbladder cancers and cholangiocarcinoma patients and control groups that without any tumor in the Bile duct and gallbladder or other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of BileCAD test for diagnosing biliary tract carcinoma to other modal",

        "summary": "Schizophrenia represents a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, with this burden disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings. We will address the following aims: 1) evaluate whether the use of the mindLAMP digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness of task-shared community-based psychosocial rehabilitation (COPSI) for individuals with schizophrenia, and 2) determine whether the addition of mindLAMP to the delivery of the COPSI program has an impact on implementation metrics when compared to delivery of COPSI alone.",

        "summary": "Approximately 65, 000 hip fractures occur in the United Kingdom (UK) each year, and more than 99% are repaired by surgery. Roughly half of patients receive spinal anaesthesia, where a small amount (usually less than half a teaspoonful) of local anaesthetic is injected into the lower back, around the nerves that go to and from the hip.\nLow blood pressure is very common during surgery (at least > 30%, depending on definition), and appears to be linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery.\nThere are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. National guidelines recommend that lower doses are given, but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately or often enough.\nThe Anaesthesia Sprint Audit of Practice (ASAP) 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.5 mls of spinal anaesthesia is given, and the investigator has been using this amount in Brighton since 2011. Recently, the investigator has reported a way of transferring vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (e.g. in Coroner's investigations: approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery).\nHowever, analyzing such observational data should also allow the investigator to describe accurately how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (e.g. the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, the investigator hopes to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery, potentially improving people's survival and recovery after hip fracture.",

In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition.",

Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of",

        "summary": "The unexpected changes caused by the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can lead individuals to question their beliefs, life meanings, and goals, prompting a search for meaning. According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group. A number of reliable and valid measurement tools were used to compare the MCCP group with the waitlist control group and to examine the effect of the program. Compared with the control group, significant improvements were expected in the level of meaning in life, post-traumatic growth, situational meanings, psychological inflexibility, and psychological well-being in the MCCP group.",

Though anaesthesia is usually thought to be safe and necessary to improve health, concerns remain the effects that the drugs used may have on brain development in children and the potential long-term consequences for health. The two techniques used to keep someone asleep during anaesthesia are either giving the appropriate drugs through a small plastic tube into a vein or introducing different drugs into the lungs in gas form.\nGene expression is the process by which instructions in DNA are used to make products such as proteins. Anaesthetic drugs may change how a child's genes are expressed\u037e a process called epigenetics. Studies have shown that different anaesthetic drugs can cause epigenetic changes in animals and affect the processing ability of their brains.\nThis study will focus on children aged under 3 undergoing general anaesthesia for planned hypospadias surgery (a developmental condition where the look and function of the penis may not be completely normally). Participants will either receive their general anaesthetic in gas form or through directly into their veins - both techniques are commonly used. A small blood sample (between 1 and 2 teaspoons) will be collected at the start and end of the operation whilst under anaesthetic. Samples will be analysed to look for any changes in signals on DNA (epigenetic changes) and other markers. Further analysis may then look at other measures of gene expression and additional processes/markers that could be affected.\nThere is relatively less medical research carried out in children and this work will show whether this type of study is possible in this age-group and provide information for future trials.

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.",

Parents of these infants report lower self-efficacy and worse mental health when compared to parents of term infants. There is an urgent need to use effective ways to improve parental self-efficacy and associated parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes. To improve parent and baby outcomes, the investigators will build on an existing eHealth solution to create Chez NICU Home+ (CNH+), which offers web-based, parent-targeted, interactive educational tools, virtual communication, and text message support during a baby's NICU stay. We will evaluate whether Chez NICU Home+ improves parental self-efficacy (primary outcome), parent psychosocial, and infant health outcomes in parents of babies requiring a NICU stay, and the implementation (ease and uptake) of Chez NICU Home+ in multiple sites. This study will be a multicentre implementation study, with a stepped wedge cluster randomized controlled trial across four Canadian NICUs. At the beginning of the study, data regarding current care will be collected from all sites to determine a baseline. Following baseline data collection, every five months one of the sites will start using the Chez NICU Home+ solution. A total of 800 parents and their babies, who are expected to stay at least 5 days in the NICU, will be recruited. Parents will complete a survey on psychosocial adjustment and infant outcomes when the study begins, as well as at 14 and 21 days after enrollment, at infant discharge from the NICU, and at 6 months post-discharge. Infant health and development outcomes will be collected at discharge, 6 and 18 months post-discharge via health records. The investigators predict that Chez NICU Home+ will be a positive, interactive care option, combining virtual parent education, tailored communication, and support, which will improve parental self-efficacy and parent psychosocial and infant health outcomes, and have long-term benefits for families.",

This will be done in groups of 4-8 caregivers and led by a trained facilitator. During each session, participants will write about their deepest thoughts and feelings about their loved one's cancer and their experiences as a caregiver. They will then discuss as a group any reactions to the writing process.\nParticipants will be randomly assigned to either active intervention (receiving the intervention as soon as a group is formed) or waitlist control.

        "summary": "Gender affirming surgeries (GAS) have been steadily increasing in the US, with the gender affirming mastectomy (GAM) being the most common surgery performed. Complications associated with these surgeries include hematoma and seroma. Prior studies in orthopedics, plastic surgery, and trauma have shown significant reduction of bleeding and ecchymosis with the use of tranexamic acid (TXA). TXA is a synthetic amino acid that blocks plasminogen conversion to plasmin, to stabilize clot formation. The intravenous (IV) efficacy in reducing hematoma rates has been established in implant-based breast reconstruction, as well as in reduction mammaplasty. However, there are currently no studies investigating the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing GAM.\nThe investigators propose a single-center, prospective randomized control trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravenous tranexamic acid in decreasing hematoma and seroma rates for top surgery patients at UCSF. Patients will be randomized into two groups, an experimental group receiving IV TXA and a control group that will not receive IV TXA.\nPatients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Patients will be excluded if they have a history of coagulopathy, bleeding disorders or prior chest surgery. Demographic data, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes will also be recorded and analyzed. The investigators hypothesize that the use of IV TXA will significantly reduce hematoma, seroma, postoperative drain output, and time to drain removal in patients undergoing GAM.\nAim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of IV TXA in reducing intraoperative bleeding, post-operative hematoma and seroma formation, drain output, and time to drain removal in patients undergoing GAM.\nAim 2: To compare the incidence of thromboembolic events and wound complications between patients receiving IV TXA and those who do not after GAM.",

        "summary": "The proposed project seeks to achieve four objectives that will, collectively, evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP-1) -a model for a home visitation and case management program for parents who used substances during pregnancy. First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families. With a strong backing by state agencies and community partners, the evaluation of PCAP-1 will contribute to a knowledge gap in the field for in-home program models serving a highly vulnerable population with high rates of child welfare involvement and use of foster care.",

        "summary": "Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is well-recognized to be extremely distressing and stressful for the patient and family. As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",

Many autism interventions were developed and tested with only White participants, assuming they could be transferable to minority populations. However, research has found that this is not the case and that interventions that are not adapted to an individual's culture and ethnicity do not work as well and are not used as frequently. In this project, we compare two methods of stakeholder engagement, Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG), to determine which is better at getting input on the facilitators and barriers to access therapy for autistic children. We focus on Hispanics and Latinos as this is the largest minority group in the US, with one of the fastest-growing groups of autistic children. Our long-term objective is to improve the functional skills and health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and their families by improving access to an occupational therapy intervention designed to improve daily living skills, socialization, and quality of life. Occupational therapy using Ayres Sensory Integration (OT/ASI) is the only evidence-based intervention that addresses the sensory symptoms in autism. We will use input from these engagement sessions to adapt two versions of the OT/ASI manual: one using DT data and the other using FG data. Outcomes are evaluated following each step. Following the completion of this project, the planned outputs of the study are data on the most effective minority stakeholder engagement method and a culturally adapted OT/ASI manual for Hispanic and Latino autistic children for clinicians and researchers. This information can support future researchers who are engaging Hispanic/Latino",

The strategy will be to offer 325 smokers four weeks of NRT of their choice (gum, lozenge, or nicotine patch) and assess them for quit-smoking status at the end of the period. Seven-day point abstinence will be used to determine responder status at the end of the four-week period (CO of <6 ppm at both CO collection points during that seven-day period and self-report of no smoking during that seven-day period). Those who have not quit, and who therefore have a very low chance of later success (a consistent finding in prior studies and to be verified in the proposed study), will be randomly assigned to either receive a potential rescue product (nicotine pouch or ENDS (electronic nicotine delivery system), or remain on NRT (control group).",

Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea. Thus, selecting the patients who benefit most from speech-improving surgery is therefore of great importance.\nThe aim with the current study is evaluation of speech function through patient- and parent-response outcome measurements following surgical treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with isolated or combined cleft palate.",

        "summary": "Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide, with more than 400,000 hysterectomies performed annually in the United States. As a consequence, even uncommon complications can affect large numbers of patients. Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

        "summary": "Laparoscopy has become an indispensable part of modern surgery. Vision is an important and defining element of laparoscopy and significantly affects the outcome of an operation in regard to time, mistakes and precision. Several new imaging systems have become available for laparoscopic surgery, including three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD), and two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high-resolution (4K) monitors. In experimental and clinical settings, several studies have been published in recent years suggesting that 3D systems present a number of potential benefits for surgeons and patients compared to the conventional 2D systems. The 3D HD system significantly reduces operation time and blood loss, and additionally shortens hospital stay. However, the performance of 3D systems against the new, ultra-high-definition 4K systems is barely known and highly controversial. There is a paucity of studies comparing these two imaging systems in clinical settings. The goal of this clinical trial is to compare 2D 4K versus 3D HD imaging systems in a complex bariatric surgery, more precisely a gastric bypass operation. The investigators aim to investigate the hypothesis stating that the use of the 3D HD system yields a significant improvement in operating time compared to a 2D 4K system in bariatric laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, in order to give a comprehensive overview of the comparison of 2D 4K and 3D HD laparoscopy in a clinical setting, the investigators will assess the workload of the surgeon as well as the intraoperative and postoperative complications including the hospitalization time.",

Specifically, the investigators will test whether efavirenz produces CYP2B6 genotype dependent unanticipated DDIs with CYP2B6 (methadone) and CYP1A2 (tizanidine), leading to lack of efficacy or increased toxicity. Healthy volunteers genotyped for CYP2B6*6 and *18 alleles will be grouped in to three genotype predicted phenotype groups: 20 normal metabolizer (NM) (CYP2B6*1/*1); 20 intermediate metabolizer (IM) (*1/*6, or *1/*18); and 20 poor metabolizer (PM) (*6/*6, *6/*18 or *18/*18).

All patients with clinical stage T1-T4N0-N1M0 amenable to radical cystectomy with curative intent and FloRIN reconfiguration were included. The sample size for a non-inferiority trial was calculated for different endpoints. Preoperative work-up included chest and abdomen contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan. Main exclusion criteria were: 1) presence of one or multiple tumor metastases at preoperative staging; 2) histopathological confirmation of bladder tumor at the level of prostatic urethra; 3) treatment without curative intent (cT4b, salvage or palliative cystectomies); 4) presence of urethral stricture. After preliminary multidisciplinary evaluation, patients were randomly assigned with 1:1 ratio to the mono-J stent placement or the stentless group. For the present study, only patients with a minimum 6 month-follow up were evaluated. Patient demographics, including ASA score and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), peri- and postoperative features including operative time, conversion rate, estimated blood loss (EBL), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain intensity scale, length of hospital stay (LOS) early (\u226430 days) and delayed (>30 days) complications rate, and pathological data were thoroughly gathered.\nFollow-up schedule included blood analysis and CT scan performed three months after surgery, then every 6 months from the first to the third postoperative year, followed by annual imaging assessment according to individual risk profile, as postulated by the EAU guidelines.

        "summary": "This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib in treating patients with sarcoma that has spread from where it first started, to other places in the body (metastatic), or cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable) and for which no known cure is available (advanced). Doxorubicin is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Doxorubicin damages the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. It also blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair. Liposomal doxorubicin is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal doxorubicin may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also enhance the activity of chemo- and radiotherapy. There is some pre-clinical evidence in animal models that combining peposertib with liposomal doxorubicin can shrink or stabilize certain types of cancer for longer than either drug alone, but it is not known if this will happen in people. Combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib may be effective in patients with advanced sarcoma.",

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and aims to reveal the individual's internal motivation. It is thought that the university years, which are an important period in terms of developing and maintaining health-protective and preventive behaviors, will both increase students' health responsibility and protect them from health-threatening behaviors with the healthy lifestyle behaviors acquired during this period. In line with all this information, this study was planned to determine the effect of the Transtheoretical model and motivational interview-based online intervention program on smartphone addiction and sleep quality levels in nursing students who are in the smartphone addiction risk group.",

Rosacea is classified into 3 types: erythemato-teleangiectatica, papulopustulosa and phymatosa. Treatments depend on the type and include topical and systemic antibiotics, azelaic acid, topical ivermectin, topical brimonidine, systemic isotretinoin as well as intense pulsed light (IPL) and laser therapies.\nFor treatment of telangiectasia and redness, laser and IPL therapies are the first choice. Vascular lasers, such as pulsed dye lasers (PDL) and potassium-titanyl phosphate (KTP) lasers as well as IPL, have demonstrated good efficacy in reduction of erythema and telangiectasias in patients with rosacea. However, these treatments are expensive and mostly not covered by the health insurance. Therefore, for patients it is important to receive the maximal effect and improvement after each single laser session.\nIvermectin is a semi-synthetic derivative of avermectin and has an anti-inflammatory effect as well as an antiparasitic effect on demodex mite. The latter is playing an important pathogenetic role in rosacea.\nThis randomized controlled study aims to compare the effect of KTP laser in combination with ivermectin 1% cream vs KTP laser alone in patients with facial rosacea.",

It is unclear whether the relatively low number of reported cases of COVID-19 in people with CF (pwCF) is due to enhanced infection prevention practices or whether pwCF has protective genetic/immune factors. This study aims to prospectively assess the proportion of pwCF, including both adults and children with CF who have evidence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies over a two-year period. This study will also examine whether pwCF who have antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 have a different clinical presentation and what impact this has on their CF disease. The proposed study will recruit pwCF from paediatric and adult CF centres in Europe. Serological testing to detect antibodies will be performed on blood samples taken at month 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 with additional time-points if bloodwork is available via normal clinical care. Clinical data on, lung function, CF-related medical history, pulmonary exacerbations, antibiotic use, and microbiology and vaccination receipt, will be collected during routine clinical assessments.\nAssociations will be examined between sociodemographic and clinical variables and serologic testing. The effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on clinical outcomes and analyze end-points will be examined to explore any age-related or gender-based differences, as well as a subgroup analysis of outcomes in lung transplant recipients and pwCF receiving CFTR modulator therapies. As pwCF receive COVID-19 vaccination a comparison of the development and progression of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in pwCF following natural infection and vaccination SARS-CoV-2 over time will be performed.",

If pain is not controlled, it increases the frequency of postoperative pulmonary complications and postoperative morbidity. It can even cause chronic pain in the future. Thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) is the gold standard method in the treatment of pain after thoracotomy. Thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is known as the most effective method after TEA. The fact that TPVB has fewer side effects than TEA increases the use of TPVB. There is no consensus on the dose of analgesia in studies. In the literature, volumes between 20 ml and 30 ml are frequently used for TPVB in recent years.

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the association between esophagogastric histopathology and colorectal neoplasms in patients under the age of 50 and whether these risks factor could be combined with to guide earlier CRC screening.",

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",

        "summary": "In a society with increased life expectancy, the economic, social and personal burden of dementia increases. Dementia is often caused by a combination of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired brain clearance is suggested to be closely related to dementia development, as waste products (e.g. amyloid beta) accumulate in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most common neurovascular disease that even contributes to about 45% of dementia pathophysiology in patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are the key brain MRI manifestation of cerebral SVD. There is evidence that the currently known and MRI-visible WMH are landmarks of an already progressed stage of the underlying pathology. The pathophysiology of WMH has been attributed to multiple underlying mechanisms, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, different anatomical locations and different types of WMH are related to different underlying pathological changes. Using ultra-high field 7T MR imaging techniques WMH lesions can be detected with a higher sensitivity and resolution than on 3T MRI. The hypothesis is that different pathological mechanisms of cerebral SVD lead to variations in WMH shape. Moreover, the brain clearance ('glymphatic') system of the brain appears to be tightly connected to dementia pathology. Thus, novel markers of glymphatic activity could aid to describe and understand the pathology.",

Nearly half the waste of cataract surgery is recyclable, as reported by a prospective Malaysian study 8.\nDespite the increasing evidence of reusing the operative supplies, numerous healthcare professionals may be reluctant to consider it due to worries about cross-contamination among patients2.\nAccording to the Aravind Eye Care System (AECS) in Tamil Nadu, India, endophthalmitis rated 0.02% in over a million consecutive cataract cases despite the observation that cannulas, irrigation/ aspiration tubing, gowns, surgical gloves, irrigating bottles, as well as topical and intraocular drugs are normally recycled to cut cost and waste3,4.\nOn the other hand, health care plays a key role in climate change, as well as financial and environmental waste2. Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, making cataract surgery one of the most performed surgical procedures5. The carbon footprint of cataract surgery, especially phacoemulsification, is a significant research field6-8.\nIn the United Kingdom, cataract surgery releases 180 kg of CO2- equivalents per eye, causing over half of the emissions due to obtaining large disposable medical equipment9.

Currently, rare studies have been conducted on dTMS targeting ACC as an intervention in patients with AN. In this research, dTMS, a neuroregulatory technology, was used for the first time to intervene with ACC in the treatment of adult AN. A randomized controlled study design was adopted, in which patients with AN were divided into the dTMS treatment group and the pseudo-stimulation group by 1:1 randomization, followed by 6-week intervention and half-year follow up, to clarify the near-term and long-term efficacy and safety of the dTMS treatment. Meanwhile, baseline fMRI data were extracted and combined with clinical features to establish an efficacy prediction model, which will provide theoretical and practical basis for the pioneering ACC-targeted dTMS treatment in China, helping to establish a new type of intervention program for AN, with expected results of innovation.",

The waiting time for elective surgery for IBD-patients at Sahlgrenska University Hospital/\u00d6stra is still affected which might have impact on patient health outcomes as well as health economics, due to the risk of complications and need of emergency and planned care while waiting for surgery.\nThe primary object is to evaluate how long an IBD patient can wait for surgery before affecting health economy and quality of life. In the operation program Orbit, we identify all patients with ulcerative colitits (UC) and Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) that stands in line for elective surgery (not including dysplasia/cancer). The date when operation was decided is registered including time of delay. Patient characteristics are registered in CRF, including diagnosis, age and reason for scheduled surgery.

Cystinosis and hyperoxaluria are very rare diseases. They are inherited autosomal-recessively. Neither disease can be detected by the methods established in routine NBS. However, common genetic mutations are known for both diseases.\nThe aim of the study is to provide a scientific basis for molecular genetic NBS for cystinosis and primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Specifically, the study will investigate whether the inclusion of these diseases into general NBS should be recommended. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis.\nThe screening laboratory Hannover, Germany is involved in the project. Hospitals that send their dry blood spot cards for routine NBS to Hannover are offered participation in the project.\nParents who want to participate receive an additional information sheet. A parent and the attending physician sign the information sheet as documentation of informed consent, which allows data transfer and patient referral to a specialist in case of a positive result. Molecular genetic screening in the pilot project is performed from the same dry blood spot card used for routine NBS.\nIn both diseases, testing is performed for 2 known mutations: In cystinosis for the 2 mutations most common in Germany, and in PH for the most common mutation in infantile hyperoxaluria (PH1) and in Europe (PH3).\nNormal findings are not communicated to the parents, which may contact the laboratory to ask for them. Parents of newborns with two mutations in the cystinosis gene are immediately informed about the disease by a physician. Further diagnostics to confirm the disease are organized close to home.\nIn contrast, parents of newborns with only one mutation in one of the two hyperoxaluria genes are informed. They are asked to send spot urines of the newborn to the hyperoxaluria center. Only if these are abnormal, further evaluation will be performed.\nThe study started on 15.03.2022. The aim is to screen 200,000 newborns until 2025.

The superficial SSI is an infection of skin and subcutaneous layer, clinically presented by pus oozing. Furthermore, seroma hematoma and wound dehiscence are also clinical signs of superficial SSI.\nNowadays, there are studies which report methods reducing SSI by placing negative pressure drain within surgical wound. It can reduce serum in subcutaneous layer which is found in every surgical wound, especially in clean-contaminated and contaminated wound. Many studies show that placing negative pressure drainage within a surgical wound can reduce superficial SSI and decrease hospital length of stay by comparing with the control group.\nThe objective in this study to compare the rate of SSI of clean-contaminated and contaminated surgical wounds between the patients whose wounds are placed with negative pressure drainage and patients who were not placed with negative pressure drainage.",

        "summary": "Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation is one of the most common genetic mutations associated with tumor development in various human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that KRAS mutations are present in approximately 70% of pancreatic cancer patients, 35% of colorectal cancer patients, 20% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and 15% of cervical cancer patients. Patients with KRAS mutations generally have a shorter overall survival and increased resistance to treatment compared to wild-type tumors. KRAS mutations have been known for decades, but they have been considered undruggable as effective therapies targeting them were lacking.\nPreclinical studies focusing on colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have suggested that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit a stronger response to EGFR signaling and activation of multiple RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) than non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. As a result, they show poorer responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors, leading to the development of initial and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition. Based on this hypothesis, a phase 1-2 clinical trial, known as the KRYSTAL-1 study, was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study demonstrated that the objective response rate was 19% with adagrasib monotherapy and 46% with the combination of adagrasib and cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor), indicating that the addition of an EGFR inhibitor can overcome resistance. Building on this hypothesis, a phase 3 trial is currently underway for KRAS G12C inhibition plus EGFR blockade in metastatic colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04793958, NCT05198934).\nIn this study, the aim is to investigate the efficacy of sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) plus panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, who have failed standard treatments.",

        "summary": "Gingival recessions (GR) are often associated with non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL), resulting, thus, in a combined defect. This mucogingival condition has a different treatment prognosis when compared with a GR without wearing surface associated and frequently requires a surgical-restorative approach to achieve better esthetics and functional results. A limited number of clinical studies assessed different multidisciplinary protocols for the management of single combined defects and there is evidence that the use of dental materials does not harm the periodontal tissues and does not influence the root coverage obtained by means of subepithelial connective tissue graft (CTG). Although the association between coronally advanced flap (CAF) and CTG provides more predictable and stable outcomes in the long term, its use is related to some drawbacks. Different biomaterials have been developed to overcome these limitations as a possible alternative to autogenous graft. However, despite its potential, there is a lack of studies evaluating its use in treating this type of condition. Thus, this study aims to assess from a clinical and esthetics point of view and patient-centered outcomes, the use of a new collagen matrix (Geistlich Fibro-Gide\u00ae) associated with CAF for the management of single combined defects. For such purpose, 50 patients with single RT1 gingival recessions associated with NCCL will be enrolled and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: control group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap for root coverage (PR+CAF) and test group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap associated with volume stable collagen matrix (PR+CAF+VCMX). The two groups will be compared regarding the clinical parameters, among which bleeding on probing (BOP), biofilm accumulation (IP), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession reduction (RecRed), and the percentage of combined defect coverage (%CDC). Patient-reported outcomes such as post-surgery pain and discomfort, time to recover, the decrease of dentin hypersensitive, and aesthetics will be gathered. A professional assessment will be carried out regarding the aesthetic parameters. All these evaluations will be performed at the baseline and three and six months postoperatively.",

To proactively address the mental health needs of this population, St. John's Rehab recruited two psychiatrists to provide mental health support to their inpatient population groups.

Our designed psychosocial group therapy is led by a psychiatrist and an occupational therapist who create a structured process for inpatients to discuss their challenges and identify coping strategies that will help them transition back into the community. The investigators will recruit 130 inpatients with limb loss, with 65 taking part in a weekly psychosocial group therapy program and 65 receiving treatment as usual. The investigators will evaluate if anxiety and depression significantly decreases in our treatment group compared to those who received treatment as usual.

        "summary": "Ulcerative-necrotizing enterocolitis (ECUN) is an infectious and inflammatory disease of the digestive tract, which can lead to intestinal necrosis or perforation.\nThis severe pathology of the newborn , often premature, requires urgent medical and surgical treatment in 25 to 50% of cases. The morbidity is high, both digestive and neurological. ECUN can lead to complications at short-term (death, intestinal stenosis) and at long-term (neuro-cognitive disorders). The challenge of preserving the neurological development is a major issue. It involves control of inflammation. This inflammation causes neurological lesions and is responsible for a disorder of the long-term neurocognitive development.\nAt Robert-Debr\u00e9 and Trousseau, the management of newborns with ECUN is focused on the control of this inflammation. A laparoscopy is performed first. The carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflated into the abdomen during a laparoscopy is thought to have an anti-inflammatory effect according to several experimental and clinical studies. A preliminary retrospective study at Robert-Debr\u00e9 showed a decrease in postoperative inflammation (decrease in C reactive protein at Day2 and Day 7 post-op) as well as a decrease in morbimortality (decrease in the rate of stoma and reoperation) in children who had a laparoscopic first operation compared to those who had a laparotomy alone. However, in many hospitals, laparotomy alone is currently the only surgical option.\nThis preliminary study may demonstrate that laparoscopy decreases early morbidity and mortality in children with ECUN through reduced inflammation, as reflected by postoperative C reactive protein.",

Currently available clinical algorithms lack the capacity to continuously track the dynamic evolution of how the primary core progresses to a final infarct, which, however, is a major determinant of stroke progression,8-10 and is associated with functional outcome.9,11,12 Previously studied blood-based biomarkers such as Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL),13 neuron-specific enolase (NSE),14 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),15,16 and S 100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B)17 either failed to capture the extent of brain injury within the acute phase of stroke or lack specificity. Plasma levels of brain-derived tau (BD-tau) were recently found to show high value for monitoring brain injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke: In 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome.18 While informing on the relation of BD-tau with imaging-based metrics of brain injury after onset and to evaluate whether BD-tau plateaus at different time points",

Living with acquired blindness not only lowers the quality of life of these individuals, but also strains society's limited resources for assistance, care and rehabilitation. However, to date, there is no effective treatment for man patients who are visually handicapped as a result of degeneration or damage to the inner layers of the retina, the optic nerve or the visual pathways. Therefore, there are compelling reasons to pursue the development of a cortical visual prosthesis capable of restoring some useful sight in these profoundly blind patients.\nHowever, the quality of current prosthetic vision is still rudimentary. A major outstanding challenge is translating electrode stimulation into a code that the brain can understand. Interactions between the device electronics and the retinal neurophysiology lead to distortions that can severely limit the quality of the generated visual experience. Rather than aiming to one day restore natural vision (which may remain elusive until the neural code of vision is fully understood), one might be better off thinking about how to create practical and useful artificial vision now.\nThe goal of this work is to address fundamental questions that will allow the development of a Smart Bionic Eye, a device that relies on AI-powered scene understanding to augment the visual scene (similar to the Microsoft HoloLens), tailored to specific real-world tasks that are known to diminish the quality of life of people who are blind (e.g., face recognition, outdoor navigation, reading, self-care).",

There has been evidence that lifestyle modifications such as physical activity (PA), dietary intake, sleep, and stress management can prevent or delay type 2 diabetes (T2D). The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy of a holistic lifestyle digital health intervention with post-GDM women in large community settings in Singapore. The study consists of a 1-year randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 3 years follow-up. Women who are eligible for the study will be randomized to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (Control) at baseline. Both groups will be followed in years 2-4. Women from both groups will be provided with an Oura ring for tracking physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability (a proxy for stress), and the HAPPY app, which will provide health promotion information about physical activity, diet, sleep, and mental wellbeing, as well as display the information collected (such as body mass index, blood pressure, and OGTT results). The active group will receive the LVL UP app a smartphone-based chatbot-delivered intervention, designed to provide personalized recommendations through multiple digital coaching sessions aimed at improving health literacy and practicing healthy lifestyles to prevent Type 2 diabetes and common mental disorders (i.e., anxiety, depression).",

        "summary": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have long been linked to mental health problems in adulthood. In the case of cancer, no study has considered that such an anteriority could make patients more vulnerable emotionally, even though the presence of reactionary disorders such as stress, anxiety or depression are characteristic of such a pathology. Activated during periods of stress and therefore during the illness, even the attachment system is mobilized and must be considered to allow more understanding of the illness experience. The attachment style can be seen here as an individual dimension that plays a role in the emotional regulation and resilience of patients. It is also particularly solicited during the remission phase, a complex and singular period of cancer disease that confronts patients with an ambivalence of hope and fear. The fear of recurrence is a concern that the cancer may return or progress in the same organ or in another part of the body. This is a determining factor in the occurrence of anxiety-depressive disorders. Finally, several studies have shown a strong association between depression/anxiety and Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) after treatment, especially during the remission phase.\nACEs leave physiological and epigenetic impact that can nowadays be easily evaluated, thus providing additional evidence between adversity, physiological and epigenetic vulnerability and the ability to adapt to life's challenges such as cancer. Life history changes are mediated by changes in cellular mechanisms affecting genome expression. It is currently widely demonstrated that ACEs increases epigenetic modifications.\nThe interest of this project is therefore to highlight the psychological consequences related to the occurrence of cancer in the developmental history (in terms of adversities) of patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, taking into account the patients' previous attachments, resilience, fear of recurrence and perceived fatigue in order to consider their interactions and their effects on their psychological health and ultimately on their quality of life.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a cancer of grave prognosis, with only about 10% of patients alive at 5 years after diagnosis. Primary surgical resection is feasible in about 10-15% of patients with an early-stage disease. Another 30-35% of patients have locally advanced disease with invasion into major vasculature but without detectable metastases. Surgery offers a chance of cure. The introduction of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy has improved prognosis after surgery.\nIn the management of patients with PDAC, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is less certain. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of having no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor (R0 resection). In the The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC-5) study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS).\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein not expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed about 80% of PDAC.\nThere are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CAR-T cell therapy.\nThe safety of CAR-T cells targeting MSLN in the treatment of cancers has also been verified in several clinical trials on lung cancers (NCT01583686, NCT02414269, NCT01355965). Professor Li Peng's group at the Chinese Academy of Science designed third generation CAR-T cells targeting MSLN and validated their use in both human PDAC cell lines, animal models, and in 4 patients with advanced malignancies. In a 42-year-old man with metastatic PDAC, the MSLN targeted CAR-T treatment led to complete response follow several hepatic artery infusion and intravenous infusion. These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells.\nIn the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesise that Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival.",

It is usually associated with physical growth delays, mild to moderate intellectual disability, and characteristic facial features. There is no cure for Down syndrome. Education and proper care have been shown to improve quality of life. Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical school classes, while others require more specialized education. Those with Down syndrome nearly always have physical and intellectual disabilities. They also typically have poor immune function and generally reach developmental milestones at a later age. They have an increased risk of a number of other health problems, including congenital heart defect, epilepsy, leukemia, thyroid diseases, and mental disorders. This study will determine effects of weight bearing exercises with and without Jaffery's core stability exercise training on dynamic balance and trunk muscles strength in children with Down syndrome. Randomized controlled study will be conducted in which data will be collected from children with down syndrome with calculated sample size of 18 which will randomly assigned into group A and group B. Group A would receive weight bearing exercises (I.e.\nstanding on preferred foot, standing with close eyes, walking forward on a line using normal stride and heel to toe gait, stepping over response speed stick on balance beam ).Group B would receive weight bearing exercises along with the jaffrey's core stability exercises (I.e.\ncontracting muscles, sitting on Swiss ball, Bridging, Squatting side lying bridge etc.).Frequency will be 5 sessions per week, of 1 hour and duration is of 5 months. Balance and trunk muscle strength will be pre assessed using pediatric balance scale and trunk control measurement scale respectively. The improvement will be measured with same tools.

        "summary": "Cardiac surgery is a frequent procedure that can lead to serious complications, including acute kidney injury (AKI) or postoperative delirium. During the intervention, a cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is used to ensure tissue perfusion and oxygen delivery (DO2). The hypothesisis that an individualized strategy to optimize DO2 during CPB could decrease complications rate after cardiac surgery. Indeed, it is known that DO2 depends on CPB output, hemoglobin level and O2 tension. To this day, a DO2 threshold below 280 mL is known to be associated with postoperative AKI. From these data, a Goal Directed Perfusion strategy is widely used to maintain a DO2 above this threshold during CPB. But DO2 decrease in unpredictable, and the other factors influencing DO2 interindividual variability are not known. Moreover, the relation between DO2 and tissue perfusion is not well established, as DO2 requirement could differ between individuals or organs. Population approach using nonlinear mixed models is a method used to optimize drug administration with pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics models. Using this method, the aim of this study is to evaluate DO2 variability during CPB and develop a model to optimize GDP strategy.",

        "summary": "Background: One of the main goals of the Cardiopulmonary By-Pass (CPB) is targeting an adequate Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), in order to maintain appropriate perfusion pressures in all end-organs during heart surgery. As inheritance of early studies, a value of 50-60 mmHg has been historically accepted as the gold standard MAP. However, in the last decades, the CPB management has remarkably changed, thanks to the evolution of technology and the availability of new biomaterials. Therefore, as already highlighted by the latest European Guidelines, the current management of CPB can no longer refer to those pioneering studies. To date, only few single-centre studies have compared different strategies of MAP management during CPB, but with contradictory findings and without achieving a real consensus. Therefore, what should be the ideal strategy of MAP management during CPB is still on debate. This trial will be the first multicentre, randomized, controlled study to compare three different strategies of MAP management during the CPB.\nMethods: We described herein the methodology of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing three different approaches to MAP targeting during CPB in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery: the historically accepted standard MAP (50-60 mmHg), the high MAP (70-80 mmHg) and the patient-tailored MAP (comparable to the patient's preoperative MAP). It is the aim of the study to find the most suitable management in order to obtain the most adequate perfusion of end-organs during cardiac surgery. For this purpose, the primary endpoint will be the peak of serum lactate (Lmax) released during CPB, as index of tissue hypoxia. The secondary outcomes will include all the intraoperative parameters of tissues oxygenation and major post-operative complications related to organ malperfusion.\nDiscussion: This trial will assess the best strategy to target the MAP during CPB to further improve the outcomes of cardiac surgery.",

        "summary": "Alcohol use is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions (see ICD-10) and in France, alcohol is the first cause of hospitalization. Binge drinking (BD) has emerged as a major public health issue among student populations and is associated with negative consequences and social, cognitive and brain alterations. More than half of French university students have reported BD in the past month and are at increased risk of several alcohol-related consequences such as memory and sleep impairments, and reduced quality of life. BD is also a major risk factor in the development of alcohol addiction, with individual and environmental factors playing a role that is still poorly understood. Moreover, most students and young adults are reluctant to seek interventions when it is provided by health care professionals (only 4-5%) and have poor insight with regard to their alcohol use patterns / habits. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing effective prevention and intervention programs to reduce alcohol drinking in students. Recent studies have demonstrated that new types of technology-delivered interventions are promising tools for addressing unhealthy alcohol use. For example, an uncontrolled trial pilot study using a smartphone application-delivered intervention produced a reduction in both number of drinks per week and BD from baseline to 3-month follow-up. A recent review also showed significant outcomes of a mobile health intervention for self-control of unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators hypothesize that a timeline follow-back and personalized feedback based on the use of a mobile application can reduce excessive alcohol intake at 3-months. This study will provide scientific knowledge about BD in students, but also regarding a new type of intervention that could be effective for prevention in non-treatment seeking individuals and reducing the severity of health problems associated with excessive alcohol intake.",

        "summary": "This phase II trial compares the effect of retreatment with 177Lu-DOTATATE peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (PRRT) to the usual approach of treatment with everolimus in patients who have previously received 177Lu-DOTATATE for midgut neuroendocrine tumor (NET) that has spread from where it first started (primary site) to other places in the body (metastatic) and that cannot be removed by surgery (unresectable). PRRT is a type of radiation therapy for which a radioactive chemical is linked to a peptide (small protein) that targets cancer cells. When this radioactive peptide is injected into the body, it binds to a specific receptor found on some cancer cells. The radioactive peptide builds up in these cells and helps kill the cancer cells without harming normal cells. In this trial 177Lu-DOTATATE is used for PRRT. 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT may increase the length of time until worsening of the midgut NET compared to the usual approach. Everolimus is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is also a type of angiogenesis inhibitor. Everolimus works by stopping cancer cells from reproducing and by decreasing blood supply to the cancer cells. Retreating with 177Lu-DOTATATE may work better than everolimus in shrinking or stabilizing tumor in patients with metastatic and unresectable NET who were previously treated with 177Lu-DOTATATE.",

Surgery for early stage rectal cancer can be either a radical surgery (RS) or a local excision (LE).\nA radical surgery removes the rectum including the tumor and the lymph nodes through which it spreads, improving survival but with a possible impact in the patients quality of life (QoL). A local excision only removes the tumor and a safety margin of healthy rectum. This has the potential to avoid the possible complications and QoL decrease.

Exemestane is in a class of medications called aromatase inhibitors which has anti-estrogen and anticancer activities. Exemestane binds to and inhibits the enzyme aromatase, thereby blocking the conversion of androgens to estrogens. This lowers estrogen levels in the blood circulation causing the tumor cells to grow more slowly or stop growing completely.

This study also aims to opportunistically measure lung function and structure using MRI and explore how the liver can be measured using MRI in this age group.\nThe study is split into 2 stages. The first is a pilot stage using the modified GIFT-CF protocol recruiting 3 children with CF before starting ETI and 3 healthy volunteers. This is to determine we are able to successfully perform these scans in these age groups. If successful, the second stage will recruit a further 12 children with CF before they start ETI. This will take our cohort up to 15 children with CF. This cohort will then be rescanned 6 months after starting ETI using the same scan protocol.",

The grades of MG loss (i.e. meiboscore) is calculated as the ratio between the area of the MGs and the eyelids, and this calculation is based on the two-dimensional digital infrared images.In the current formula, the area of the eyelid is the denominator. However, because the eyelids need to be flipped over for the examination and evaluation, and there may be interobserver variability in the measurement of the area of the eyelids. Aging and involutional eyelid disorders, such as ptosis, ectropion, and entropion, may lead to laxity or deformation of eyelids, and impact the shape and area of eyelid area consequently.These factors could cause inaccuracy in current evaluation method, and impact the grading and evaluation of treatment efficacy of MGD, especially in self-controlled studies, such as in clinical trials.\nIn this study, the investigators propose to use a modified calculation formula for the grading of MGs. The investigators could measure the white to white (WTW) distance of cornea, and then calculate the area of cornea (i.e. corneal base area) accordingly.Unlike the eyelid, the WTW distance does not change significantly during aging or between sexes.Thus, the investigators hypothesize that using the corneal base area as the new denominator in the formula for the grading of MG loss is a better way comparing with the conventional method.",

Some epidemiological studies report that infants experience an average of 7.5-14 painful procedures per day per infant during the first 14 days of their hospitalization.\nThe most significant problem encountered in understanding pain in infants is the lack of verbal expression of pain. Newborns express their pain with nonverbal behavioral expressions. Therefore, any pain assessment is based on the ability to recognize the pain symptoms of others. The pain experienced may cause physiological imbalances and abnormalities in brain development and stress response in infants in the short and long term. It can negatively affect family-infant communication, as well as cause emotional and psychosomatic problems later in life.\nToday, music therapy has positive effects on reducing stress, reducing pain, oxygen saturation level, and peak heart rate values in providing individualized developmental care of the infant in neonatal intensive care units. Heart sound, babies hear the mother's heart sound the most during the intrauterine period in the womb. Therefore, when babies hear the sound, they are familiar with in the womb, they will feel safe and a sense of relaxation will occur in the baby. Several studies have proven that playing heartbeat sounds to newborn babies can positively affect their physiological indicators, feeding, length of hospital stay and pain outcomes. The current literature shows that the presence of rhythmic sound can positively affect the neurobehavioral development of the infant and reduce pain. Rhythmic sounds have healing/positive effects on newborns; listening to white noise reduces preterms' pain scores, stabilizes vital signs, and plays an active role in preterms' sleep-wake period.\nIn line with all this information, this study was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study in order to determine the effects of music played during heel spear application, white noise and heart sound in infants.",

However, some sequelae may persist in the form of sensory deficits, residual pain, retractile scars hindering function in this highly mobile area, or even aesthetic sequelae.\nThe aim of our study was to perform a descriptive analysis of the aesthetic and functional sequelae related to hand burns that required acute realeasing incisions using objective and subjective tools available in the medical records (demographic, clinical and follow-up data in the context of routine care). This retrospective, non-interventional, data-driven study would provide an overview of the sequelae of hand burns with current therapies.",

        "summary": "More than 70% of chronic illnesses can be prevented or reversed with a whole-food, plant-based diet (WFPBD). This dietary pattern is also more sustainable for our planetary health. The majority of physicians receive fewer than 20 hours of nutrition education during the entire course of their medical training. Although many physicians are aware of the importance of diet on their well-being, they face significant barriers in following a healthy diet. Because physicians' own habits strongly influence patient health habits, the investigators theorize that physicians who eat a WFPBD themselves will be much more likely to successfully counsel their patients on nutrition and recommend a WFPBD.\nThe most effective methods that can be successfully used to encourage busy physicians to adopt a WFPBD have not yet been identified. Given the increasing rates of diet-related chronic illnesses, if proven effective, this study may offer a new scalable approach to encourage physicians, and ultimately their patients, to adopt a WFPBD.\nThe aims of this study are to:\nAssess the impact of a multimodal 6-week educational program on WFPBD on a) change in physicians' diet type and quality, b) change in mindset about WFPBD, and c) stage of change based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change (Figure 1), compared to the delayed-intervention (control group) from baseline to week 6.\nAssess the impact of the 6-week educational program on the development of skills and knowledge required to a) adopt a WFPBD and b) counsel patients on the same.",

Based on scientific literature, it is still controversial whether electroencephalography-based neurofeedback (EEG-NFB) represents an effective technique for enhancing healthy adults' executive function.

The subjects are an uniform group of healthy young right-handed males divided into two equal groups. The trained group (TR) performs 3-week EEG-NFB training (three sessions per week) focused on a cognitive self-regulation of TBR (to achieve the lower TBR values as beneficial cognitive effect), while the control group (CO) does not participate in the EEG-NFB training. Cognitive function are rated before and after 3-week EEG-NFB training by psychological tests: Trail Making Test (TMT, parts A and B) and the Stroop Test (ST, parts I and II).

Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) is commonly caused by cerebrovascular stenosis or occlusion. The most effective treatment for AIS is timely and successful angiographic reperfusion.\nDue to the large diameter and obvious positioning of bilateral femoral arteries, the transfemoral artery (TFA) using Seldinger's technique has been the most commonly used approach for endovascular treatment. However, recent studies have suggested that the radial artery is an ideal puncture site for cerebrovascular intervention. Small sample studies have confirmed that endovascular recanalization for acute anterior circulation large vessel occlusion via TRA has been safe and effective. Still, there are some complex approaches needed to be converted to TFA. There has been no difference in total operation duration and fluoroscopy time between TRA and TFA, but the TRA group had higher radiation dose and shorter hospital stays than the TFA group. In addition, TRA tends to be more convenient than TFA, especially for posterior circulation lesions.\nHowever, the current studies are based on a single center with a small sample size, and there has been still a lack of large-sample randomized controlled experiments to verify the safety and effectiveness of posterior endovascular recanalization via TRA.",

Intrauterine retention of trophoblastic debris is not an uncommon phenomenon. These retentions may initially be asymptomatic but are often responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis. This symptomatology often accentuates the psychological distress of patients mourning the pregnancy. Incomplete miscarriages are mainly managed by the gynecological emergency department. The recommendations of the Coll\u00e8ge National des Gyn\u00e9cologues et Obst\u00e9triciens Fran\u00e7ais (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care. The choice between the two is left to the discretion of the doctor and the patient. there are no clear recommendations as to the choice between hysteroscopy and aspiration. Within the teams, the choice is often made according to the habits and protocols of the service, according to the equipment available and the skills of the gynaecologists.\nAim: The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration vs. management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound.\nMethods: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arms, parallel therapeutic clinical trial comparing hysteroscopy versus endouterine aspiration for the management of trophoblastic retention after spontaneous miscarriage.\nPatients will be randomized (110 per arm) after verification of eligibility criteria and signature of consent, on the day of the operation:\nArm A: 110 patients treated by operative hysteroscopy\nArm B: 110 patients treated by endo-uterine aspiration",

        "summary": "Insomnia is a highly common, chronic disorder that is distressful for the patient but also for caregivers and can give rise to a heavy burden on the healthcare team. Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults.\nSome patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty. Lemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other traditional sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events.\nWhile lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with an early onset dementia. Understanding the effectiveness and tolerability of lemborexant will be helpful in an N of 1 trial to understand the details of effect and effectiveness in individual patients.",

Post-operative delirium is a devastating complication, leading to longer ICU and hospital stay, increased incidence of discharge to nursing facility and poorer long-term cognitive outcome.\nDespite the impact this complication has on individuals, their families and healthcare resources, little is known about the causes and potential preventative measures.\nIt is thought that systemic inflammation compromising the integrity of the blood brain barrier is an important contributing factor. Recent data suggests that antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid (TXA) might be able to lessen the inflammation of the nervous system caused by surgery and CPB through the inhibition of plasmin production, thereby stabilising the blood brain barrier. Worldwide, the use of TXA has become standard of care in cardiac surgery and other types of surgery with a high risk of bleeding. It has been shown to reduce bleeding by 25% and significantly reduce the rate of transfusion in cardiac and noncardiac surgery.\nAt Royal Papworth hospital it is routine practice to administer 2g of TXA before commencing CPB irrespective of patients' body weight. We are hypothesising that there is a weight-based effect of TXA on neurological outcomes after cardiac surgery, showing a signal that a higher dose per kg bodyweight will lead to less delirium measured with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS).

Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition.

        "summary": "Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction Surgery (NOSES), which involves obtaining specimens from the abdominal cavity without any incisions, has attracted much attention in recent years, and it has been widely popularized in the treatment of rectal cancer because of its postoperative non-incision, advantages of less trauma, quicker recovery, and postoperative aesthetics. Anastomotic fistula is a serious complication of rectal cancer surgery. For patients at high risk of anastomotic fistula, prophylactic ileostomy is often performed intraoperatively to divert feces and protect the anastomosis. For such patients, rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma (NOSES with specimen extraction via stoma) is usually performed, borrowing a prophylactic stoma incision to retrieve the specimen, and also realizing the absence of additional abdominal incision. However, this procedure is prone to stoma infection and has a high complication rate (20-40%), which limits the popularization of NOSES surgery and is an urgent clinical problem. Our center has proposed a new stoma closure method (Dumpling Suture Method), which reduces the size of the incision by folding the suture to achieve the effect of hiding the skin incision and reduce stoma infection. In our previous study, 17 cases of the new procedure were completed in our center, and 25 patients with stoma closure by the traditional method were included in the same period for control purposes. After six months of follow-up, we found that the dumpling suture method significantly reduced the incidence of stoma complications compared with the traditional suture method (5.8% vs. 36%), and no additional adverse effects were observed. This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical study planned to recruit 66 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the trial and control groups. The primary endpoint is stoma complication rate at 30 days postoperatively. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dumpling suture method  compared with the traditional stoma suture in reducing postoperative stoma complications through a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial, which is of great significance for the improvement of the rectal NOSES procedure and the reduction of the incidence of stoma complications.",

        "summary": "Mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is one of the greatest risk factors for future Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). A recent meta-analysis found that, on average, 31% of patients with PD-MCI converted to PDD within seven years; however, 24% of patients with PD-MCI reverted back to normal cognitive function. Consequently, the false positive rate for predicting PDD among patients with PD-MCI is high, and better predictive markers to define patients at high risk for PDD development are urgently needed. Therefore, a combination of different markers, including clinical, genetic, and other biomarker data, are proposed to increase ability to predict cognitive worsening and dementia. Based on data of the first follow-up of this cohort results indicated that presence of both mild cognitive instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment and PD-MCI dramatically increases the risk for PDD (PubMed ID: 36240089). This study evaluates markers predicting cognitive and IADL long-term outcome in our sample. Additionally, focus of the study is the investigation whether ratings of patients or informants best predicted decline of cognitive impairment and/or everyday function.

        "summary": "Specific language and learning disorders (SLLD) affect around 5-10% of school-aged children, or 1-2 child(ren) per class. SLLDs correspond to the impairment of a specific cognitive function and are divided into 5 categories: dyslexia, dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (DSM-5). In recent years, real progress has been made in their clinical diagnosis and management, thanks to a better description of these disorders in the DSM-5 and the advent of rehabilitative treatments (neuropsychology, speech therapy, occupational therapy, orthoptics, etc.). SLLD can occur in a sporadic or familial context (sibling involvement, a symptomatic parent, other relatives who may mimic dominant inheritance with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance).\nIt has long been suspected that SLLD is secondary to multifactorial inheritance, with a combination of frequent genetic variations and environmental factors. In France, in the absence of an obvious syndromic diagnosis, the current strategy is to prescribe array CGH, combined in girls with a search for fragile X syndrome (in boys, this syndrome leads to systematic intellectual disability, which does not justify its study in SLLD). A few genes have been described as being specifically involved in a small proportion of SLLD, most often with de novo variations or inherited from a symptomatic parent. There are no distinctive clinical features to guide targeted sequencing of these genes. Moreover, our recent experience shows that genes implicated in intellectual disability may also be involved in SLLD. Very few studies have been published in the literature evaluating the value of exome sequencing in SLLD. Only two studies have been identified, involving 10 and 43 patients with specific SLLD.\nIn view of the roll-out of the French Genomic Medicine Plan (PFMG 2025), it is important to set up a study aimed at assessing the value of genome-wide sequencing in the etiological work-up for SLLD.\nParticipation in the study consists of:\nan inclusion visit, where an additional blood sample will be taken during the baseline work-up\na results visit (4 months after the inclusion visit)\nOptional qualitative study: semi-structured interview 1 year after the inclusion visit proposed to 20 patients or families with a positive result and to 10 patients with a negative result.",

        "summary": "Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP); It is a disease of premature and low birth weight infants, characterized by incomplete vascularization of the retina, etiology and pathogenesis of which is unknown, and causes vision loss. There is an increase in the incidence and severity of ROP development in direct proportion to the decrease in birth week and birth weight. While ROP is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks was 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce the pain and increase the comfort level of the premature newborn. As a pharmacological method, there is no other routine method used to reduce pain other than the administration of local anesthetic drops before the examination. Because of this situation, nurses apply various non-pharmacological methods to alleviate pain. These methods are; breast milk, sucrose use, oral dextrose use, non-nutritive sucking, positioning, listening to music and mother's voice. In the literature, no specific study was found in which music was used to reduce pain and increase the comfort level during the ROP examination. Therefore, this research will be carried out to determine the effect of different music played on the pain and comfort level of premature babies during the retinopathy examination.",

Several trials have been conducted and are in progress using different pharmacological agents, but none of the studies involve the stimulation of ETB receptors to treat cerebral ischemic stroke. Sovateltide (IRL-1620, PMZ-1620) has been effective in animal models of cerebral ischemic stroke. Its safety and tolerability have been demonstrated in a human phase I study with 7 subjects. Clinical phase II and III results indicate that sovateltide is a novel, first-in-class, highly effective drug candidate for treating cerebral ischemic stroke. Safety and significant efficacy in improving the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), Modified Rankin scale (mRS), and Barthel index (BI) obtained in phase II and III studies in patients with cerebral ischemic stroke in India are convincing and encouraged us to investigate its safety and efficacy in cerebral ischemic stroke patients in the United States. Therefore, the plan is to conduct a phase III clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of sovateltide therapy along with standard of care in patients of acute ischemic stroke.",

Long COVID can affects any type of patient and has polymorphic and fluctuating symptoms over time.\nThe Reunion Island is a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean accounting more than 860,000 inhabitants.

This specific context makes this island a particular study site for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Long COVID.\nIn addition, some studies have confirmed the involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the symptomatology of Long COVID and demonstrated that patients with a Long COVID present a dysfunction of their ANS which is objectified by a reduced Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The regulation of heart rate by the ANS is strongly favored by respiration. A regular slow and deep breathing training helps to adjust the baroreflex, which connect heart rate, breathing and blood pressure.

Ibrutinib has also been found to be effective in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma. However, ibrutinib treatment is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), with an estimated 2-year AF rate of 16% in patients treated with ibrutinib during a median follow-up of 28 months. In most studies, AF was identified by reports as a treatment-related adverse event, and systematic screening for AF was not performed. As AF is often paroxysmal, the more intensive the screening, the higher the incidence. In a prospective cohort study of 53 patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL, patients were monitored by pulse palpation and ECG every 3 months. The cumulative incidence rate of ibrutinib-associated AF was 23% at 12 months and 38% at 2 years. The management of ibrutinib-associated AF is challenging due to difficulties in balancing the benefits of anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of stroke and the bleeding risk associated with ibrutinib. AF is a frequent reason for discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy, and can result in significant morbidity.\nIn addition to this arrhythmogenic effect, ibrutinib is also significantly associated with the onset or worsening of arterial hypertension. Finally, an increased risk of serious ventricular rhythm disorders has also been suggested by pharmacovigilance databases, but not yet confirmed by prospective clinical studies.\nThe study proposes a comprehensive cardiovascular approach, at baseline and during follow-up of patients on Ibrutinib, using innovative markers to anticipate patients most at risk of developing these cardiovascular effects, but also to detect them as early as possible in order to avoid the complications they may generate.",

However, it is important to consider the GI bleeding risk when using DAPT and to determine whether Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed to prevent such accidents. DAPT, or aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, complementarily reduce platelet activation and aggregation and consequently reduce the progression of coronary thrombosis. We have reported whether PPI use is associated with ischemic events or mortality in patients with DAPT up to date, but we have shown conflicting results depending on the type of study conducted. Observational studies generally show that PPI increases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, angina and stroke, while RCT studies show that it does not. This difference can be explained by the selection bias. This is because observational studies attempt to reduce selective bias through correction of basic patient characteristics, but unmeasured differences in underlying variables continue to affect the results. method : Among patients who performed PCI in patients with CAD, enrollment is performed in patients with moderate risk in gastrointestinal risk assessment indicators.

The blood test for PSA is regularly monitored as standard of care.\nAdditionally, the impact of apalutamide on fatigue, cognitive function, patients reported outcomes, health related quality of life will be evaluated using patient questionnaires answered at defined timepoints. The questionnaires will be sent either electronically or via post at week 12, 24, 36, 48, 72 and 104 weeks after commencement of apalutamide.\nCurrently, the majority of data regarding tolerability and biochemical response to apalutamide has been from large phase III trials, where there are strict eligibility criteria. Real-world data as from the ADAPT study can provide valuable complementary data to randomised controlled trials, which can be used to address the 'generalizability' limitations of randomised control trials and can provide evidence on the external validity of their findings.

It was first recognized and described by Austrian radiologist Robert Kienb\u00f6ck's in 1910\nThe lunate is the central bone in the proximal row, and it articulates with the scaphoid, capitate, triquetrum, and occasionally the hamate. More proximally, the lunate is a component of the radiocarpal joint, and it also articulates with the ulna via the triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC)\nThe exact cause of Kienb\u00f6ck's is not known, though there are thought to be a number of factors predisposing a person to Kienb\u00f6ck's. Although there is no evidence that Kienb\u00f6ck's disease is inherited, it is possible that unidentified genetic factors could contribute to the development of the condition, It is multifactorial, related to the following variables:Ulnar negative variance (or ulna minus),Vascular supply to the lunate bone,Lunatemorphology,Radial inclination angle,multiple wrist trauma\nKienb\u00f6ck's disease is the second most common type of avascular necrosis of the carpal bones, preceded only by avascular necrosis of the scaphoid. The typically affected population is males aged 20-40 years\nPatients usually present with unilateral pain over the dorsal aspect of the wrist, limited wrist motion, weakness, or a combination of the three. Wrist extension and axial loading exacerbate pain. Symptoms range from mild to debilitating. It is rarely bilateral, and trauma is often absent. Physical examination commonly reveals wrist swelling, tenderness over the expected location of the lunate, synovitis, and loss of grip strength\nKienb\u00f6ck's disease is a clinical and imaging diagnosis. Both radiography/computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are highly specific. However, MRI is the most sensitive and detects radiographically occult cases",

        "summary": "The project aims at implementing a more pro-active surveillance of potential transmission of influenza viruses to humans (zoonotic transmission). Clinical surveillance of influenza in humans and avian species is well organized and has been operating for decades, but currently there is no pro-active systematic surveillance of potential transmission of animal (avian or swine) influenza viruses to humans, only follow-up of people showing clinical symptoms. People working with potentially infected animals have the highest risk. Moreover, they can represent the first steps in a pandemic: if the virus adapts to humans, infected workers could potentially spread the virus to other people.\nCurrently, highly pathogenic clade2.3.4.4b H5 avian influenza viruses are continuously circulating in wild birds in Belgium and the number of introduction in poultry farms has raised, increasing the contact opportunities with high viral concentrations. Several reports of suspected human infection have been made by different countries. In addition, the virus was detected in sick non-human mammals. The large circulation in wild birds thus represents an increase risk of spill-over to mammalian species, including humans, (by contact directly with wild birds, or via outbreaks in poultry). This increased opportunity for accidental spillover to new host species increases the chances for the avian virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.\nLikewise, there have also been an increased number of human cases of swine influenza reported by several European countries. A pro-active surveillance aiming at also detecting asymptomatic infections would allow an early detection of transmission that could help to prevent a new pandemic.\nAs a piloting approach during this specific project, some dedicated sentinel networks among at-risk workers will be initiated: people in poultry farms involved with the management of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza; people working at bird (or more generally wild life) rehabilitation centres or poultry farms; veterinarians working in pig farms/slaughterhouses.",

        "summary": "Pes planus is a foot deformity characterized by a low medial longitudinal arch. It is more common in young adults. With low arch, tension occurs in the plantar fascia. Fascia and soft tissue loading may lead to different musculoskeletal problems such as plantar fasciitis, medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral disorders and back pain. In addition, pes planus can affect individuals' activities of daily living, productivity in occupational settings, and injury risk and performance in sports.\nTreatment of pes planus includes strengthening, stretching, taping and orthotics for the foot muscles. Among these applications, strengthening of the foot core muscles is one of the most common and effective methods. By strengthening the foot core muscles, it is aimed to reduce the effect of the kinetic chain. Pes planus is a postural deformity that affects the kinetic and fascial chain, but the treatment program is usually planned regionally. With fascial continuity and fascial conduction, the tension on the plantar fascia in pes planus affects the gastro-soleus, peroneus longus and brevis, hamstring muscles, iliotibial band and thoracolumbar fascia. Stretching of the plantar fascia, which is included in current treatment programs, has only a local effect and thus cannot prevent fascial chain involvement. Myofascial release, one of the methods used to reduce the tension in the fascia, has been used frequently in recent years. Myofascial release is performed with methods such as manual, foam roller and instrument assisted release. Foam roller (cylinder foam) is a practical myofascial release method that can be self-applied by the individual.\nIn addition to strengthening the intrinsic muscles of the foot in individuals with pes planus, it has been reported that fascial chain involvement should also be taken into consideration due to the tension in the plantar fascia with low arch. This study was planned to investigate the effect of myofascial release methods on lower extremity performance in addition to foot core exercises used effectively in the treatment of pes planus.",

Duodenoscopes used for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in order to treat different biliary and pancreatic disorders, have been recently linked to infections transmission following the procedures. Given their reusability and their complex design of the tip with a moving metallic component, named the elevator, these instruments must be reprocessed through high level disinfection (HLD) in order to prevent the spread of nosocomial infections. Even strict adherence to all HLD procedures results in a residual level of potentially infectious microbes. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postmarket surveillance communication reported duodenoscope culture results demonstrating contamination rates of up to 3.6% for low and moderate-concern organisms and up to 5.4% for high-concern organisms in reprocessed conventional duodenoscopes. As a consequence, at least 20 outbreaks of duodenoscope-transmitted multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) infections occurred between 2012 and 2015, despite reported compliance with duodenoscope reprocessing guidelines. The increasing concern that currents practices of reprocessing reusable duodenoscopes is insufficient, has led the FDA to released recommendation suggesting to develope a newly designed duodenoscopes. On one hand, a way is to generate duodenoscope with disposable components, such as a one-use end cap, which can be removed and allow access to the components of the elevator and other areas of the duodenoscope for reprocessing. On the other hand, an alternative is to produce a fully disposable single-use duodenoscope. The evident advantage of a single use duodenoscope, over disposable components, is that it completely eliminates the need for reprocessing and more important the risk of transmitting microbial infection from patient to patient.",

It improves exercise levels and breathlessness and is a recommended treatment for people with lung diseases and symptoms. Standard pulmonary rehabilitation programmes involve individuals attending group classes at hospitals or community centres, twice a week for 8 weeks. These classes are supervised by physiotherapists. At the moment, there are long waiting times for pulmonary rehabilitation in the NHS.\nSome patients may prefer more pulmonary rehabilitation based in their own home. This might be because they find it difficult to travel to classes. Some would like to do more home pulmonary rehabilitation in between supervised classes or continue pulmonary rehabilitation after the 8-week supervised programme. The blending between supervised classes and home pulmonary rehabilitation is known as HYBRID PULMONARY REHABILITATION. Hybrid pulmonary rehabilitation is not being provided routinely in the NHS, but the NHS would like to see it used more as it might help reduce waiting times and give patients more choice on how to access pulmonary rehabilitation.\nThe study will assess the feasibility of a larger study to provide strong evidence on patients' uptake and adherence to the hybrid programme, and the impact on patients' health outcomes and service delivery. The investigators will also look at what measures would be best to use in a larger study.\nThe study will recruit up to 100 patients.

CMC osteoarthritis of the thumb is one of the most common degenerative conditions of the hand in 11% of men and 33% of women (Gillis et al., 2011). Patients with CMC arthritis may experience pain, decreased range of motion, loss of grip and pinch strength, often limiting participation in activities of daily living (Bertozzi et al., 2014). In 1979, two physicians identified a variation of a tendinous connection in the wrist between the tip of the index finger and the tip of the thumb known as the Linburg-Comstock variation (LCV) (Linburg & Comstock, 1979). The prevalence of the LCV varies respectively from 13-66% in both males and females (Eri\u0107 et al., 2019). A physical examination of patients with LCV reveals concurrent flexion of the flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger and flexor pollicis longus. The study aims to gain more insight into patients diagnosed with CMC arthritis through clinical examination for LCV to consider an association of the diagnoses.\nCurrently, there is no evidence surrounding patients with symptomatic CMC arthritis and LCV. The hypothesis is that there is an association between symptomatic CMC arthritis and LCV. Patients with a LCV may then be more likely to develop painful CMC arthritis.",

Due to the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, PD patients experience difficulties with motor learning and more specifically with the consolidation of motor memory. Recent work showed that intensive writing training improved writing skills in PD. Although consolidation effects were present, difficulties with retention were also still apparent. Besides impacting writing, manual dexterity deficits in PD can also affect the use of touchscreens. Researchers from our lab demonstrated that impairments were most pronounced in multi-direction sliding motions, indicating the need for training of these motor skills. Our lab demonstrated the classic difficulties with retention in PD after one session of training of a swipe and slide pattern on a tablet (SSP-task) as single task (ST), although immediate gains were demonstrated. Therefore, in this study the investigators will examine whether a two-week home-based training program of a tablet-based SSP-training program will lead to immediate and consolidated improvements that are retained in time. This program will combine ST and dual task (DT) training to provide variation during the training period, but also to increase the cognitive challenge during learning, thereby stimulation consolidation of learning. The primary aim of this study consists of investigating the learning effects after two weeks of targeted touchscreen training. Secondary, the investigators will examine whether these effects will also be retained after four weeks without practice and whether targeted training results in consolidated improvements, in terms of automaticity and transfer towards an untrained task. Given the objective recording of compliance to the training protocol, the investigators will explore the association between compliance rates and learning effects.",

These symptoms are caused by structural or biomechanical changes of the joint, which becomes exacerbated by activities such as going up and down stairs, sit for a prolonged period, squatting or kneeling, resulting in increased compressive forces in the joint patellofemoral. It is characterized by defused pain in front of knee. Other signs also present are the patellar crepitus, swelling, and joint blockage despite being deemed a multifactorial condition with no single cure, PFPS is commonly attributed to muscular dysfunction, for which conservative rehabilitation is the treatment of choice.

American football players are exposed to various magnitudes and frequencies of head impacts throughout the season. Accordingly, during the American football season, there is an increase in biomarkers that may be associated with brain damage and the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases later in life. In addition, oxidative stress and inflammation can also increase in athletes during the American football season. This study was planned with the thought that the MIND diet, which is beneficial for brain health with its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, may have positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players.\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to examine the effects of the MIND diet on oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players. The main question it aims to answer are:\n\u2022 [Question] Does the MIND diet lowers or reduce the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players?\nParticipants will be randomized into 2 groups MIND diet and control group. The current diet of the players in the control group will not be interfered with during the competition period, but the current nutrition of the players in the MIND diet group will be adapted to the MIND diet according to the food groups in the MIND diet components and their consumption frequencies.\nThe players in the MIND diet group will be asked to include the food groups in the MIND diet in their diet in accordance with their consumption frequency.\nResearchers will compare the MIND diet and control groups to see if the MIND diet improves oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers.",

        "summary": "After a hip, knee or shoulder arthroplasty, the evolution is not always favorable. It can be marked by an infectious or non-infectious complication, most often implant failure. In this context, joint fluid aspiration (JFA) is indicated to document a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) or to bring to light arguments for implant failure. Nevertheless, opinions differ on its indication for microbiological identification. Some teams perform it systematically when faced with a prosthesis dysfunction. Others, only in the presence of suggestive signs of PJI. Finally, others never perform it.\nBased on clinical, radiological and biological (CRP) signs, at the preoperative stage and before JFA, we classify our patients into 3 groups: supposedly septic (chronic joint infection), supposedly aseptic (implant failure) or intermediate (Unknown). This last group, often encountered in consultation, poses a diagnosis problem more than the others.\nIn our experience, JFA is an essential diagnosis tool in these 3 groups of patients. It helps to choose the surgical strategy. In addition, the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid as the alpha defensin, the leucocyte esterase and the CRP could provide an additional argument to investigate the infectious origin or not, in particular in difficult cases.\nIn summary, the disagreement on the usefulness of JFA in case of PJI suspicion and any other prosthetic dysfunction, the lack of data on large prospective studies and our questioning about the contribution of JFA in the aseptic and intermediate group of patients, motivated us to set up this study to evaluate the interest of the JFA for the preoperative diagnosis, as well as that of the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid.",

        "summary": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common chronic disease. It is the main cause of morbidity and disability in the world with, among other things, an increase in cardio-metabolic risk and a reduction in life expectancy, regardless of suicide risk. MDD is the most expensive medical condition: 10-20 billion \u20ac/year in France. This cost is mainly attributable to the functional consequences of the disease, highlighting the medico-economic challenge represented by the optimization of the organization of care.\nIn France, more than 80% of MDD patients are enrolled in non-psychiatric care pathways, mainly primary care or MSO hospital care (medicine, surgery, obstetrics). Unfortunately, less than half of patients benefit from treatment at an appropriate dosage or duration, thus exposing them to the risks of relapse, recurrence and chronic evolution. It is necessary to optimize this management, in particular by improving secondary prevention, which consists of maintaining treatment in the months following symptomatic remission.\nSeveral support programs (monitoring with assessment of symptomatology) have shown their effectiveness on depressive symptomatology with a favorable medico-economic report, in particular by allowing maintenance of antidepressant treatment. None of these studies have been conducted on French care pathways.\nInvestigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine management (added to usual care) in non-psychiatric care pathways on the evolution of depressive symptomatology for MDD patients. Investigators hypothesize that telemedicine monitoring downstream of MSO hospitalization will increase the response rate to antidepressants at 6 months and reduce the costs attributed to depressive symptoms compared to usual care, in particular by optimizing secondary prevention strategies by maintaining treatment.\nThe main objective of the research is to assess the efficacy of telemedicine monitoring on depressive symptoms and treatments, added to the out-of-hospital downstream care pathways for patients initially hospitalized in MSO (medicine-surgery-obstetrics), compared to usual care.",

        "summary": "The periodontal phenotype has been defined as the combination of gingival phenotype and buccal bone plate thickness (bone morphotype).Periodontal phenotype cannot be fully assessed but gingival phenotype can be evaluated through a standard and reproducible way.\nGingival recession is usually observed in the presence of trauma and inflammation in individuals with thin phenotypes, whereas pocket formation has been reported in individuals with thick phenotypes.\nVarious soft tissue augmentation procedures include: sub-epithelial connective tissue graft, free gingival graft, modified roll technique and use of acellular dermal matrix. The drawbacks of these techniques include second surgical site creation, post-operative discomfort, time consuming procedure, etc.\nRecent studies have shown i-PRF, microneedeling and hyaluronic acid procedures to be effective in increasing gingival tissue thickness.\nHA has been widely used in the dental field, specially periodontology, due to its bacteriostatic, fungistatic, anti-inflammatory, anti-edematous, osteoinductive, and pro-angiogenetic properties. HA's role in tissue regeneration and wound healing has gained huge interest in recent studies.\nMicroneedling (MN) is also known as percutaneous collagen induction therapy. Microinjuries created by MN result in minimal superficial bleedings and create a wound-healing cascade from which various growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factors, transforming growth factors, connective tissue growth factor and fibroblast growth factors, are released.Study has shown a statistically significant increase in gingival thickness when microneedling was performed along with i-PRF in comparison to standalone i-PRF.\nFew human trials have been conducted using MN and Hyaluronic acids in literature for gingival augmentation in thin periodontal phenotype. Considering the effects of MN and hyaluronic acid on the biological potential, neoangiogenesis, neocollagenesis and wound, the present Randomized clinical trial is designed to evaluate the effects of MN alone and MN along with hyaluronic acid in thin gingival phenotype.",

        "summary": "Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols were developed to standardize perioperative practice in colon surgery to reduce morbidity, improve recovery, and shorten length of stay (LOS). Better protocol adherence translates into fewer readmissions and complications, and better 5-year survival. Preoperative elements, especially nutrition and immunonutrition, are topics that need further development to become the standard of care. It has been widely reported that the prevalence of malnutrition reaches 40% in cancer patients at the time of diagnosis. Impaired nutritional status at the time of surgery and cancer-induced inflammation, along with postoperative inflammatory responses to major surgery, increase the risk of postoperative complications, along with a decrease in perceived quality of life.\nImmunonutrition can modulate inflammation and reduce postoperative infections and shorten length of stay by counteracting the immune response induced by cancer. Adipose tissue has been shown to be a relevant source of inflammatory mediators, which may play a role in the promotion of tumor cachexia.\nThe present study is a multicenter randomized control study (RCT) designed to evaluate the effect of preoperative immunonutrition in patients with colorectal cancer eligible for elective minimally invasive procedures, evaluating in particular surgical site infection and length of hospital stay. A biopsy of subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue will also be performed, in order to evaluate the differences between inflammatory infiltrate, degree of fibrosis and cross-sectional area of adipocytes compared to controls.",

Several barriers for successful implementation of CDSS have been identified: over-alerting, lack of specificity of rules, and physician interruption during prescription. The effectiveness of CDSS could be increased in two ways. Firstly, by creating rules that are more specific to a given adverse drug reaction: the current study focuses on acute renal failure and hyperkalemia (two serious and frequent ADR in older hospitalized patients). Secondly, by involving the pharmacist in the review of the alerts so that he/she can transmit, if deemed necessary, a pharmaceutical recommendation to the clinician. This procedure will reduce over-alerting and prevent task interruption.\nThe hypothesis is that the use of specific rules created by a multidisciplinary team and implemented in a CDSS, combined with a strategy for managing and transmitting alerts, can reduce specific ADRs such as hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.",

        "summary": "Mesenteric fat can be invaded by gut bacteria through a process called bacterial translocation, which is the invasion of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to extraintestinal sites (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, bloodstream, etc.). In Crohn's disease (CD), bacterial translocation could increase the disproportionate inflammatory response already present and contribute to disease progression by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune-cell infiltration in the mesentery. Several mechanisms may promote bacterial translocation, such as bacterial overgrowth, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier and alterations in the immune system.\nIleocecal surgical resection is required in some patients with complicated or refractory CD. Unfortunately, post-surgical disease recurrence happens in up to 40% of cases, probably defining a subgroup of CD patients with a particular aggressive form of the disease. The complete microbiome (in gastrointestinal and extraintestinal sites) in CD patients that develop early post-surgical recurrence, as well as the association to innate immunity alterations, has not yet been studied.\nThe primary aim of the study is to explore the bacterial microbiome of CD patients and its association with early post-surgical recurrence and clinical or genetic variables related to innate immunity. To achieve this, the bacterial DNA present in mesenteric fat and ileal tissue (inflamed and non-inflamed) from surgical resection samples as well as blood samples from CD patients will be studied. Genetic polymorphisms, relevant clinical data and disease recurrence will also be evaluated.\nThe investigators hypothesize that bacterial translocation to the mesentery fat near the inflamed intestine is one of the mechanisms for perpetuation and chronicity of inflammation and therefore post-surgical recurrence in CD. The investigators expect to find a distinctive bacterial profile (in quantity and quality) in the mesenteric fat of patients with early post-surgical recurrence and/or with genetic variants that cause alterations in innate immunity.\nThe study of the microbiome in CD could help to identify the patients with a more aggressive disease form that will probably present early post-surgical recurrence, and could raise the possibility of microbial modulation as therapy for CD.",

The primary question is to examine whether a community intervention (Community Model) enhances the demand for, and improves the outcomes of, an evidence-based, brief psychological treatment for depression delivered by non-specialist health workers in primary health care facilities (Facility Model). Participants in the Facility Model arm will receive only a psychosocial intervention for depression (the Healthy Activity Program - HAP) while participants in the Community Model will receive both the HAP and the community intervention. We will compare the Facility Model and the Community Model to assess if the latter is superior in increasing the demand for depression treatment in primary care, increasing uptake of treatment by people with depression, increasing treatment completion rates, and reducing the severity of depression.",

Systemic analgesics in the form of opioid analgesics may give rise to side effects like nausea ,vomiting , constipation , allergy or drowsiness and often provide insufficient analgesia. Hence, other methods of postoperative pain management are desired. Sensory level target according to the incision site Flank (T9-T11) , Thoraco-abdominal (T7-T12 ) and Trans-abdominal (T6-T10). Ultrasound (US) guided erector spinae plane (ESP) block is one of the interfascial plane blocks that target the dorsal and ventral rami of the spinal nerves. Although there is no sufficient evidence for the spread of local anesthetic to the ventral rami, recent reports demonstrated effective postoperative analgesia after thoracic and lumbar surgeries affecting both the ventral and dorsal rami. Paravertebral block (PVB) is a technique where a local anesthetic is deposited into a space found on both sides of the spine, called the paravertebral space. It is a block with a dermatomal distribution of pain relief depending on the level of the spine at which the block is sited and the quantity and type of deposited local anesthetic.\nPVB is effective for pain relief in the thoracic, abdominal and limb regions. primary aim was to compare postoperative opioid consumption rates at 24 h.

The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors.

This breathing machine is called noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV). The use of NiPPV has been shown to improve quality of life and survival in children. Before it is used, NiPPV must first be tested to see what the correct 'machine settings' are for each child. This is usually done in the sleep laboratory at the hospital during a one-night stay. However, sleep studies in the hospital are disruptive and hard for CMC and their families because of the new environment and limited access to the equipment, supplies, comfort items and the routine their child has at home. Patients and families would prefer to start NiPPV at home but there needs to be more research on this to make sure it is possible and safe. This study will evaluate a new model of care to start NiPPV in the home. CMC aged 5-17 years old and starting NiPPV will be assigned at random, like a coin toss, to start NiPPV in the home or to start NiPPV in the sleep laboratory. The investigators will assess the feasibility and safety of the two ways to start NiPPV. This study will be the first step towards developing a study to evaluate if home NiPPV starts are effective. Starting NiPPV at home has the potential to improve the use of NiPPV (ie early adherence predicts long-term use) resulting in both medical benefits as well as improved quality of life for CMC and their families.",

Prior case reports have documented radioactive iodine detection in the tears of patients following radioiodine therapy. It is possible that radioactive uptake by the cells in the lacrimal sac and nasolacrimal duct lead to inflammation, fibrosis, and obstruction of the tear duct over time. A recent study has shown that the administration of artificial tears decreases the level of detectable radioiodine in the tears of patients undergoing radioiodine therapy for thyroid cancer.

        "summary": "This clinical trial tests whether atorvastatin prevents metastasis of resected high-risk stage IIA melanoma.The vast majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early, localized stage. However, approximately 10-15% of these localized melanomas will eventually metastasize, despite appropriate local treatment. Once metastasis occurs, median survival is less than two years. Melanomas at high risk of metastasis can be identified by gene expression profiling. The investigators aim to treat these high risk melanomas to prevent future metastasis. Statin drugs, like atorvastatin, have been used to treat high cholesterol for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events, but not for preventing melanoma metastasis. Statins could prevent melanoma metastasis through decreasing tumor cell migration, decreasing tumor cell adhesion, and increasing immune system response. Statins are also efficient inhibitors of new lymphatic vessels formation. Since tumor lymphatic vessels serve as highways to lymph nodes and may suppress immune system responses, statins may block a critical step towards melanoma metastasis. Using atorvastatin may have the potential to prevent metastasis and improve outcomes in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.",

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. Some solid tumor cells have an L1CAM protein on their surface, and T cells can be modified with a receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), to help recognize this protein and kill these tumor cells. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. These L1CAM mutation specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill L1CAM locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancers' tumor cells.",

We hypothesize that both of these difficulties reflect disrupted communication between a deep brain structure, the thalamus, and the brain's outer layer, the cortex. This communication is mediated by the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Due to its small size and location deep in the brain, we cannot assess TRN function without invasive techniques. Fortunately, sleep spindles, a specific brain rhythm provide a noninvasive read-out of TRN function. In Aim 1 we will examine whether reduced sleep spindles are related to worse sleep quality, impaired selective attention during wake, and sensory sensitivities in children with autism. In Aim 2, we will determine whether melatonin, which is commonly used to improve sleep, also increases sleep spindles in autism. If successful, this study will introduce TRN as a target for treatment of sleep disruption and guide larger home-based sleep studies.",

The pathophysiology of sepsis is based on an inappropriate host response to infection. Certain medical devices with higher adsorption capacity make it possible to limit this inappropriate response and could thus improve the hemodynamics of patients in septic or vasoplegic shock. The preliminary experience of the investigators from clinical data of vasopressor withdrawal in pediatric patients treated with oXiris shows a 50% reduction in the vasopressor score, Vaso Inotropic Score (VIS), for 40% of patients within 24 hours following the start of treatment. Similar results were found in adult patients treated for severe COVID-19 or vasoplegic shock by the other centers participating in the study.\nCytokine purification is an important physiological effect of purification membranes. However, this may not fully explain the rapid hemodynamic improvement of patients treated with an oXiris membrane.\nThe role of angiotensin metabolites (Ang 1-5, 1-7, 1-9) in the systemic vascular tone of patients has been recently discussed. The administration of angiotensin 2 in vasoplegic shock in adults helps correct hypotension. In the group of patients with increased renin, this treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality. Indeed, increased renin associated with dysfunction of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) leads to an accumulation of Angiotensin 1 which degrades to Ang 1-7.\nThe hypothesis f the investigators is that the concentration of Ang 1 and Ang 1-7 is elevated in cases of vasoplegic shock and that the clearance of these vasodilator peptides by blood purification is associated with clinical improvement.",

However, if the uterus is scarred, there can be adhesions not only between the uterus and the bladder but also to the anterior abdominal wall, which can make dissection challenging. Studies of the effects of closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum during cesarean delivery on adhesion formation have concluded that insufficient data are available and that adequately powered and designed trials are needed.\nAs regards the lateral approach, this space was first described by Dr. Shrish Sheth utilizing the utero-cervical broad ligament in post cesarean cases during vaginal hysterectomy. He described that the lateral area; the two leaves of broad ligament remains free and allows easy possibility for entry to dissect whether vaginally or abdominally.

        "summary": "The most suitable food for babies is breast milk. It is known that breastfeeding, beyond providing nutrition, has many health benefits for the baby and the mother. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that babies start breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth and breastfeed exclusively without any additional food, including water, for the first 6 months. After six months, complementary foods should be started, and the baby should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. On the other hand, between 2015-2020, the rates of infants aged 0-6 months fed with breast milk alone are approximately 44% worldwide.\nThere are many factors that affect the time of initiation of breastfeeding and the duration of breastfeeding. Some of those; maternal education, mode of delivery, birth weight and socio-economic status. Another influential factor is paternal support. Fathers may want to be involved in breastfeeding education and support their spouses in this process. However, the reasons such as not taking part in the trainings and not being asked direct questions about breastfeeding may cause fathers to feel excluded in this process. It is important to include fathers in education and interventions to achieve breastfeeding goals. Mothers who are supported by their spouses during the breastfeeding process experience breastfeeding problems less and can cope with these problems better.\nToday, it is known that fathers are not given sufficient importance in promoting breastfeeding. Including fathers in breastfeeding education can increase the rate and duration of breastfeeding of infants. This study was planned to determine the effect of breastfeeding education given to mothers and/or fathers in the postnatal period on breastfeeding, parent-infant attachment and breastfeeding self-efficacy. The aim of the study is to draw attention to the importance of father support in breastfeeding.",

        "summary": "It is known that the development of colorectal adenoma is dependent on the appearance of somatic mutations in protooncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. Based on our previous mutation analyses of 120 patients with high-risk adenoma removed by enbloc resection with subsequent colonoscopy after 1 year, there is a correlation between mutation in exon 7 of the TP53 gene and risk of early metachronous lesions development. The results also indicate that mutation phenotype (mutation profile and burden) of all lesions detected on index colonoscopy can determine risk of metachronous lesions. As not all synchronous lesions were analyzed and the surveillance colonoscopy interval was less than 3 years, this assumption could not be confirmed. In this study it is planned to perform mutation analysis of all synchronous lesions in 200 patients and correlate the data with appearance of metachronous lesions after 1, 3 and 5 years. Moreover, the mutation profile of all metachronous lesions developed during the 5 years of surveillance will be determinated and compared with mutation profile of index lesions from the same localization to verify their common biological origin. This all could help personalize the surveillance program in terms of reduction of the burden on the patient and endoscopic workplaces and risk of developing colorectal cancer in a particular patient.",

        "summary": "Covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen patients during or shortly after surgery, and may result in long-term disability. Fortunately, stroke that occurs during non-cardiac surgery is most commonly caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain and is, therefore, preventable if it can be detected early. Current clinical tools used to monitor the brain during surgery do not have the accuracy nor the spatial coverage - they only monitor one small region of the brain. In this study, the investigators plan to apply a cutting-edge optical device, tr-fNIRS, to monitor the whole brain during shoulder surgery. The primary aim is to determine any regional differences in cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) and cerebral autoregulation (CA)between brain regions during surgery and especially during various physiological challenges, such as hypotension. The investigators hypothesize that certain brain regions are more likely to develop cerebral desaturation and impaired CA, and are more prone to brain injury than the frontal lobe region which is the traditional monitoring site. The investigators also hypothesize that cerebral desaturation (or hypoxic injury) events correlate with adverse postoperative neurological outcomes such as covert stroke, overt stroke and/or postoperative delirium.",

Researchers will compare the group of participants receiving schema therapy to a group receiving standard psychotherapeutic treatment to see if schema therapy is more effective on depression symptoms and other important issues for the participant.\nThe main question the study aims to answer is:\n- Can schema therapy be a more effective treatment for difficult-to-treat depression than other forms of psychotherapy offered in psychiatry today?\nPeople who have difficult-to-treat depression are a special group of patients who are more strained in a wide range of areas of life than other people with depression. They also more often have childhood trauma, as well as simultaneous personality disorder or personality traits that brings challenges in everyday life. Currently we can not offer a sufficiently effective psychiatric treatment for this group of people.\nSchema therapy was developed to help patients who do not have sufficient effect of the usual psychotherapeutic treatments. It also addresses personality disorders or problematic traits and childhood trauma directly in the therapy.\nThe project will include 129 participants in total, of which half will receive schema therapy.\nTreatment is provided at four psychiatric centers at both the Southern and the Capital Region of Denmark.\nParticipants receiving schema therapy will be given 30 sessions of weekly therapy, as well as the opportunity for the rest of the standard care package in the Danish secondary mental health system, that is, treatment with psychopharmacological medicine and meetings with next-to-kin and other parts of the participant's support system.\nParticipants receiving the standard treatment will receive 6-16 sessions of individual or group therapy with a range of other psychotherapies that are not schema therapy, as well as the other parts of the standard care package as listed above.\nIf schema therapy proves to be more effective for treatment of difficult-to-treat depression than the treatment offered today, it may give rise to more extended use of schema therapy in and outside psychiatry.

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent pathology in intensive care (around 10% of patients admitted to intensive care and almost a quarter of patients on mechanical ventilation) and a serious one, with a hospital mortality rate of 40%. The main measures that have an effect on mortality in ARDS involve adjustments to the ventilator, known as protective ventilation. In the most severe patients, adjuvant measures such as prone positioning and the use of curarisation in the initial phase of the disease can improve survival. All these measures have been included in the latest national and international recommendations. However, a vast observational study carried out in 50 countries revealed low compliance with these recommendations. More than a third of patients did not receive protective ventilation, and the majority did not receive prone positioning when this was indicated. During weaning from artificial ventilation, it has been widely demonstrated that replacing clinician judgement with the implementation of paramedical care protocols improved weaning and significantly reduced the duration of artificial ventilation. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a paramedical care protocol for ventilation in the acute phase of ARDS improves compliance with recommendations and thus reduces mortality and the duration of artificial ventilation. However, implementation of such a protocol requires operational training for all the nurses in the participating departments. Simulation appears to be the training method of choice, as it is a teaching technique that enables technical and non-technical skills to be passed on with good retention of what has been learnt, as well as assessing what has been learnt. To make it possible to train several dozen nurses within a tight timescale, a partially dematerialized simulation model incorporating innovative e-learning tools will be developed.",

The study will create a dataset of 500 plain X-Rays involving standard images of all bones other than the skull and cervical spine, with 50% normal cases and 50% containing fractures. A reference 'ground truth' for each image to confirm the presence or absence of a fracture will be established by a senior radiologist panel. This dataset will then be inferenced by the Gleamer Boneview algorithm to identify fractures. Performance of the algorithm will be compared against the reference standard. The study will then undertake a Multiple-Reader Multiple-Case study in which clinicians interpret all images without AI and then subsequently with access to the output of the AI algorithm. 18 clinicians will be recruited as readers with 3 from each of six distinct clinical groups: Emergency Medicine, Trauma and Orthopedic Surgery, Emergency Nurse Practitioners, Physiotherapy, Radiology and Radiographers, with three levels of seniority in each group. Changes in reporting accuracy (sensitivity, specificity), confidence, and speed of readers in two sessions will be compared.

SLD; According to DSM-5, the academic difficulties experienced are explained in detail by dividing them into three subgroups. These are dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The incidence of SLD is approximately 33% in girls and 67% in boys between the ages of 6-12. The ethology of SLD is multifactorial. It is associated with multiple genes and environmental risk factors. Structural imaging studies in children with SLD have revealed that grey matter is reduced. As a result of low grey matter, early literacy education seems to be negatively affected, and fine motor skills such as writing play an important role in this influence. Writing is a complex activity that includes perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Writing activities require a high level of fine motor coordination, postural control, adjustable grip strength, visual perception, and language skills. Considering the studies, it is stated that children who go to primary school spend 31%-60% of their academic days with tasks involving fine motor skills, and most of them do activities such as writing and painting. In addition to their academic and writing performances, children with SLD perform differently in daily life compared to their healthy peers. In general, they have difficulties during self-care activities such as tying shoes, clipping their nails, buttoning/zipping, shaving, and performing activities that require sequencing. At the same time, children with SLD have difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control. Difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control seen in children with SLD affect proximal",

The transmission of skills in this care practice is essentially based on the experience of peers.

This long-acting antipsychotic treatment considerably reduces the risk of relapse and hospitalization. It is administered by IMI.

Nurses must ensure that the treatment is as painless as possible, and adapt their practice in line with current recommendations.\nAmong the various IMI techniques available, the Z-track and the Airlock limit leakage into subcutaneous tissues when the needle is withdrawn, by locking the active product into the muscular tissues. According to an exploratory study (n=303), 73% of nurses observe active product leakage after injections, and 89% of nurses are not familiar with either the Z-track or Airlock techniques.\nMany foreign studies have been carried out to demonstrate the relevance of these techniques, particularly in terms of pain reduction during treatment, but the results have yet to be confirmed.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the combined use of the Z-track and Airlock techniques during intramuscular injection of Haloperidol decanoate is more effective in reducing patient pain than usual practice.",

The primary objective is to assess the uptake of 5-day HFRT in patients with STS who are candidates for preoperative radiotherapy and limb preserving surgery. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the rates of favorable pathologic response, major wound complications, local control, acute toxicity, and 1-year late toxicity will be assessed. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of the impact of preoperative 5-day HFRT on access to care, the socio-demographic profile of the trial participants will be compared to that of extremity STS patients seen within Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) and recommended preoperative conventional fractionation radiotherapy (CFRT) in the 3 years prior to the study opening. The retention rate for radiotherapy at HCC in patients meeting trial criteria during the prior 3 years will be compared with the retention rate for radiotherapy during the study period. An exploratory analysis will measure serum SFRP2 pre- and post- radiotherapy to assess changes in response to preoperative 5-day HFRT. Changes in serum SFRP2 will be evaluated for association with a favorable pathologic response to determine the potential of serum SFRP2 as a predictive biomarker. Patient satisfaction with the decision to participate in a trial of preoperative 5-day HFRT will be assessed.",

Traditionally, some Chinese parents teach the very young kids to recite Tang poems even before the kids know how to read and write. Reciting Tang poems resembles singing a song without understanding the verses, and some kids can do so better than adults. Tang poems sound musical and should be easier to remember and recite than other texts. Learning and reciting poems at home could be happy and fun family activities in Chinese families. Whether using fun activities on small groups of kids in a community setting to promote Tang poem reciting and happiness could have the same effects of Tang poem reciting in Chinese kids is unknown for non-Chinese. This is a pilot pre-post interventional trial with no controls, with 10-20 South Asian children in primary schools (Grades 1-2, age 6-9) being recruited. In most primary schools, grades 1-2 students have not started learning Tang poems. Students and their parents will be actively approached by Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS). An information sheet will be provided to the parents of eligible children, and their contact information will be asked. Parents give written consent if they agree for their children to participate. Parents will be invited to join the intervention sessions to show support for students' participation but they will only sit at the back of the room without active interaction or learning requirements. The intervention comprises three 1.5-hour sessions of Tang poem reciting and one session for participant performances. Experienced instructors from Bestreben Drama Association Limited will lead each session, and adherence to the protocol will be assessed by independent reviewers.

Even if effective, current treatment protocols may require 6-12 months of therapy to return individuals to pain-free activity. Photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT) uses non-ionizing light to elicit biological changes in tissues resulting in beneficial therapeutic outcomes. Evidence supports use of PBM for other degenerative connective tissue conditions, such as achilles tendinopathy and epicondylitis. A previous pilot study was completed in an active-duty military and civilian population, which demonstrated a positive effect of two PBM dose parameters on function and pain levels in participants with chronic PF when combined with stretching and ice. These positive findings from the aforementioned study are promising in the treatment of this common and debilitating issue, but require the addition of a sham comparison to rigorously eliminate any potential placebo effect of the treatment protocol, and further refine the treatment protocol in order to make evidence-based clinical recommendations. As such, proposing a follow-up study and the addition of an objective outcome measure will strengthen the impact of the study.\nSPECIFIC AIM 1: To assess the clinical effectiveness of photobiomodulation compared to sham photobiomodulation to improve function and decrease pain.\nSPECIFIC AIM 2: To evaluate the effectiveness of photobiomodulation compared to sham photobiomodulation to resolve plantar fascial thickening. DESIGN: A prospective randomized sham-controlled trial to meet the aims of the study.\nMETHOD: A sample of up to 100 active-duty military members will be randomly assigned to the Sham-PBMT or PBMT group.

Brain function and structure span broad spatial scales (from single neurons to brain-wide networks) as well as temporal scales (from milliseconds to years). Currently, none of the tools available for studying the brain can fully capture its structure and function across these diverse scales - the neuroimaging puzzle. This poses crucial limitations to understanding how the brain works, and how it is affected by numerous diseases.\nThe central goal of this project is to expand currently available tools for non-invasive human brain imaging, to bridge critical gaps in the neuroimaging puzzle. New methodologies will be developed, focused on ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF MRI) and its combination with electroencephalography (EEG). New contrast mechanisms and technological advances enabled by UHF MRI and EEG will be explored to allow unprecedented views into the microstructure of brain regions like the thalamus, and to capture the activity of large-scale neuronal networks in the brain with high sensitivity, temporal and spatial specificity. These advances will be directly applied to address open questions in the diagnosis and treatment of essential tremor, and psychosis.\nIn general, improved brain imaging techniques are critical for a deeper understanding of how the brain works, and to detect and characterize diseases more effectively, thereby improving clinical management and leading to a healthier population.

Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain iron deficiency secondary to obesity. Among the most studied is the deficit in dietary iron intake or the increase in blood volume that increases the need for the metal. However, one of the most plausible mechanisms linking obesity and iron deficiency is low-grade systemic inflammation, through the iron metabolism intermediate known as hepcidin. The investigators objective is to evaluate the effect of weight loss by caloric restriction on hepcidin and serum iron concentration in people living with obesity and iron deficiency. The study will be divided into two phases: Phase 1: A cross-sectional study (cases and controls) to compare hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers in people living with and without obesity. The second phase consists of an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial. Individuals living with obesity who are iron deficient will be recruited and randomized to one of 2 dietary intervention groups with 60-day follow-up. The intervention groups will be: diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (with red meat) and diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (without red meat). Hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers will be determined at the beginning and end of the intervention.

By definition, individuals who die from an infection have defective immunity to the pathogen in question (immune agent (immune deficiency).\nThe investigation of individual variability in the development of infectious diseases began in the early 20th.

Finally, studies comparing the rate of concordance of infectious diseases between monozygotic and dizygotic twins also implicate genetic factors in disease susceptibility.\nThese observations were validated by the discovery of genetic defects associated with severe infectious diseases, leading to proof of concept. While a number of hereditary immune deficiencies associated with susceptibility to multiple pathogens or microorganisms, a growing number of new and rare new and rare immune deficiencies conferring restricted susceptibility to infections caused by a single caused by a single pathogen family, or even a single pathogen, in otherwise healthy children, have recently been identified (one gene, one pathogen). As a result, a dozen Mendelian clinical syndromes characterized by restricted susceptibility are now known. Over the last 20 years, it has been proven that these idiopathic infections were immune deficiencies.\nThe investigators now wish to study new severe infections, including but not limited to viral, fungal and bacterial infections. viral, fungal, bacterial and parasitic infections. This should lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of each disease, the development of new therapeutics and better patient care.",

        "summary": "Background: Few large randomized controlled trials provide strong evidence to guide surgical repair of primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair. The purpose of this factorial, single-blind, randomized controlled trial is to analyze and compare the surgical outcomes, functional visual outcomes, complications, and quality of life associated with RRD repair using (A) pars plana vitrectomy only (PPV) or PPV with scleral buckle (PPV-SB) and (B) sulfur hexafluoride gas (SF6) or perfluoropropane gas (C3F8) tamponade.\nMethods: Eligible patients with moderately complex RRD will be randomized 1:1 to PPV or PPV-SB and 1:1 to SF6 or C3F8 gas tamponade. Approximately 560 patients will be recruited to be able to detect a difference of around 10% in SSAS rate between groups. Patients will be followed using multimodal imaging and quality of life questionnaires before and after the surgical repair until 1 year postoperative. The primary outcome will be single surgery anatomic success (SSAS), defined as absence of reoperation for recurrent RRD in the operating room. Secondary outcomes will be pinhole visual acuity (PHVA) at 8-10 weeks and 6 months, final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), final retina status (i.e., attached or detached), time to onset of RRD recurrence, severity and number of complications, and questionnaire results.\nDiscussion: This will be the first 2 \u00d7 2 factorial randomized controlled trial examining repair techniques in primary RRD. It will also be the first randomized controlled trial to compare gas tamponade between the two most common agents. Notably, it will be adequately powered to detect a clinically significant effect size. The use of multimodal imaging will also be a novel aspect of this study, allowing us to compare head-to-head the impact of adding an SB to the retina's recovery after RRD repair and of differing gas tamponades. Until now, the treatment of RRD has been largely guided by pragmatic retrospective cohort studies. There is a lack of strong evidence guiding therapeutic decisions and this trial will address (1) whether supplemental SB is justified and (2) whether longer duration gas tamponade with C3F8 is necessary.",

Given the rising age of global populations, reducing the burden associated with lost physical function is essential to minimise health and social care costs. Unfortunately, very few older adults engage in sufficient S&B exercise to reap these benefits, with a lack of time, self-efficacy and access to leisure facilities cited as the key barriers. Finding innovative ways promote an acceptable and engaging format of S&B exercise is consequently a public health priority.\nOne novel way that aims to address typical barriers to participation in older adults is through the promotion of exercise 'snacks', as opposed to a more traditional, lengthy structured exercise session at a leisure centre. Exercise snacking describes short bursts of exercise that are designed to be undertaken over a short period in the home environment and without the need for any specialised exercise clothing or equipment. In the initial laboratory and cross-sectional and pilot intervention research, the investigators have been testing two formats of 5-minute, twice-daily, strength exercise- and tai-chi-snacking, which has been shown to be acceptable and feasible to implement in older adults. This protocol presents initial efficacy for evoking improved physical function in people aged 65 years or more. The investigators' remote study demonstrated that remote assessment and delivery of 4-week exercise and tai-chi snacking interventions were acceptable and feasible. However, qualitative feedback indicated that exercise programmes may be more acceptable and interesting with simpler tai-chi movements and exercise snacking programme with upper body movements. Nevertheless, the investigators only recruited healthy older adults, doing short-term interventions in previous studies. This study aims to test the effectiveness of progressive S&B interventions over a sustained period in pre-frail older adults.",

Perioperative pain following spine surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal analgesia can be effectively given preemptively to alleviate pain and facilitate early mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine.

Nevertheless, with increasing incidence of cancer, it may be assumed that availability of radiotherapy service for heel spur patients will be further limited including limitations related to potential pandemic or other emergency situation. This represents upcoming unmet clinical need, where alternative approaches with dramatically abbreviated fractionation schedules are needed in order to keep availability as well as effectivity of heel spur (and other non-malignant disorders) radiotherapy.\nThe aim to presented single institutional prospective randomized open-lable clinical trial is to evaluate low dose radiotherapy delivered in single fraction manner in the treatment of heel spur syndrome.\nThe project aims to design a randomized trial that compared fractionated and single fraction radiotherapy (non-inferiority).

Despite the growing body of scientific literature pointing towards the close interaction between overweight/obesity and CLBP, few treatment programs for people with CLBP nowadays take overweight into account. Therefore this study will examine the added value of a behavioral weight reduction program (changes in diet, behavior and physical exercise) to current best evidence rehabilitation (pain neuroscience education plus cognition-targeted exercise therapy) for overweight or obese people with CLBP. An international, multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing a behavioral weight reduction program combined with pain neuroscience education and cognition-targeted exercise therapy versus pain neuroscience education and cognition-targeted exercise therapy alone, will be conducted. The primary outcome is pain and the primary endpoint was chosen at 12 months follow-up; secondary outcomes include health care use and daily functioning (see detailed description of outcomes for an overview of all secondary outcomes). If the promising results of the proof of concept study are corroborated, the new intervention will have a high socio-economic impact, including an annual health care cost reduction of \u20ac66 million in Switzerland, and \u20ac60 million in Flanders, and is expected to increase life expectancy in the long term.",

However, during surgery, anesthesia can affect this relationship in different ways. Some types of anesthesia can decrease blood flow to the brain, while others can increase it. Anesthesiologists need to be careful to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain during surgery, especially when blood pressure drops. Drugs may be used to increase blood pressure, but some of these drugs can also affect blood flow to the brain. It is still unclear how to best maintain blood flow to the brain during surgery and how different types of anesthesia and drugs affect this process.\nThe study aims to assess the clinical utility of a new technique that uses light-based neuromonitoring to measure changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. The investigators will recruit 80 adult patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia and randomize them into one of four groups to evaluate the effects of different anesthetic agents and vasopressors on brain hemodynamics and metabolism. The study will include patients over 18 years of age with no history of neurological conditions, substance abuse, or contraindications to cerebral oximetry devices or specific anesthetic agents. The patients will receive standard anesthesia care and be monitored with our light-based neuromonitoring system.

        "summary": "Shaft fractures account for 20% of humeral fractures and 3% of all adult fractures in France, with an estimated incidence of 13 to 20/100,000 people. Men aged 21 to 30 years and women aged 60 to 80 years are particularly affected. Intramedullary nailing is among the standard treatments for humeral shaft fractures (when surgery is required). Once inserted, the nail is locked in order to limit stress on the fractured bone, as well as possible secondary rotational displacements or malunion. Bipolar interlocking (BI) is typically performed on both sides (proximal and distal) of the fracture site. This procedure is performed under radiological control, exposing the patient and care team to radiation (during the entire procedure). The objective of the treatment is to obtain consolidation of the fracture within 12 months, and to limit the occurrence of irreversible complications such as malunion or nonunion (2-10% at 12 months post-surgery). The unipolar interlocking (UI) technique has recently been introduced. In this technique, locking is performed only on the proximal side of the fracture site. By avoiding the distal approach, potential complications such as radial nerve damage, with the risk of irreversible paralysis (3.8-14.2% in studies of the BI technique in this indication) or the risk of infection on the distal side can be avoided. It also reduces operative time, and consequently the radiation received by patients and caregivers. However, the UI may be poorly positioned, resulting in malunion that requires revision surgery.\nDespite the absence of recommendations due to the lack of existing data, several teams use the UI in routine care. In this context, a descriptive cohort of 121 patients operated on at the Dijon University Hospital5 showed similar rates of consolidation between the 2 techniques (93.8% for UI versus 95.2% for BI, p=0.64), functional scores, and complications, as well as a significant 29% decrease in operating time in the UI group (mean + SD: 63.1\u00b121.3 min versus 88.0\u00b130.1 min for VB, p<0.01). These encouraging results, although limited by the retrospective and observational nature of the data, justify a prospective randomized trial comparing these two techniques.",

This service is now being run remotely, however, there is little existing evidence to support the best practice for this. Currently, baseline fitness is assessed remotely using either a sit to stand test or a step test. Once completed people are prescribed regular exercises and asked to exercise to a level of intensity using a measure called Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). However, these measurements may not be reliable. We are carrying out a study to assess if another waking test (modified Rockport test) and asking patients to exercise to a target heart rate are better measures of assessing baseline fitness and exercise intensity.\nAll participants will receive weekly telephone calls to check their progress and be provided with a wrist worn fitness tracker (Fitbit). Participants will be randomised to one of two groups. The only difference between the groups will be the way the exercise is prescribed. In one group participants will be asked to complete the exercises to an exercise level they find somewhat hard. The other group will be asked to complete the exercises to maintain a set heart rate.\nAll participants will be asked to complete an activity log (submitted weekly) as an online form. A small group of people (maximum 10) will be asked if they would like to complete an in-person baseline fitness assessment also, this is optional.\nThis study runs for up to eight weeks with participation ending after eight weeks or at the time of surgery, whichever is sooner.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of hepatocellular carcinoma patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\nOn the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models. However, a robust and concrete evidence of abscopal effect with combinational immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation or external radiation therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still lacking.\nThis study investigates the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation as first-line treatment for previously untreated metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.",

        "summary": "Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding one atmosphere absolute. HBOT has been applied worldwide, mostly for chronic non-healing wounds. Our team demonstrated that HBOT induced hippocampal neuroplasticity in veterans with long-standing treatment-resistant PTSD; this led to enhanced memory recovery and significant improvement in PTSD symptoms.\nBoth physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, and cognitive training were shown to support neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate whether hippocampal training, induced by physical and cognitive training, will augment the hippocampal neuroplasticity effect of HBOT and further enhance recovery of inaccessible memories in veterans with PTSD.\nThe protocol will include forty male veterans aged 25 to 60 years, with combat-associated PTSD and peritraumatic amnesia, who will receive either HBOT alone or HBOT and hippocampal training. The HBOT protocol will consist of 60 daily sessions, 90-minutes each, five days a week. Hippocampal training will combine physical and cognitive training 3 times per week, prior to HBOT sessions. Detailed psychological evaluation, anatomic and functional MRI, electroencephalogram and autonomic nervous system data will be obtained at baseline, and during and after treatment.\nThe proposed study offers a new approach of biological treatment for memory manipulations. The findings will help elucidate the mechanism of PTSD-related memory impairment and is expected to contribute to the development of biological memory manipulations for treating PTSD and other memory-related conditions.",

        "summary": "Peri-implantitis is defined as the pathological condition around dental implants characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and progressive bone loss, eventually leading to implant loss. Peri-implantitis is thought to be a disease analogous to periodontitis with a prevalence reaching 22%. Though peri-implantitis is readily recognized as a part of modern dentistry, the exact etiology or an effective treatment regimen hasn't been established yet. Thus, contemporary research is orientating toward acknowledging the aetiologic and risk factors of the disease and of course establishing prognostic markers for disease prevention. Microbiota residing in the subgingival plaque are considered the main etiologic factor of the disease, however, current literature has not concluded on the exact microbial composition of peri-implant lesions. In addition, genetic predisposition has been recognized as a risk factor for disease initiation and progression and several observational studies have addressed the potential association between various gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of peri-implantitis. Lastly, to establish effective preventive measures, several biomarkers have been evaluated as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease progression.\nObjectives:\nTo identify the relationship of peri-implantitis with Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and MMP-8 gene polymorphisms. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the production of prostaglandins (PGs) which are an important inflammatory mediator participating in the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. In addition, PGE2 expression in the peri-implant crevicular fluid will be assessed.\nTo characterize the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis lesions, using novel identification techniques enabling the identification of specific opportunistic bacteria associated with the disease.\nTo test the diagnostic accuracy of a modern chairside test, using metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), an enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, as a biomarker of disease progression.",

        "summary": "Virtual reality (VR) glasses are technological devices that are often used in medical fields recently and are seen as suitable for distracting children. In the last few years, many studies have been conducted to facilitate pediatric patients against painful or frightening medical procedures. For uncomfortable procedures, distracting the child's attention is seen as the most important point. VR technology has been used for procedures such as burn cases, tooth extraction, intramuscular injection, intravenous cannula, lumbar puncture, and the results of the research have been found to be satisfactory. Using VR glasses alone or in combination with standard care is effective in reducing pain and anxiety. So far, there is no study in the literature on distraction with VR during inhaler treatment in pediatric patients. Children cannot receive inhaler treatment efficiently due to reasons such as restlessness, crying, and pulling the mask during inhaler treatment, and their hospital stay is prolonged. In this study, the investigators planned to compare the patients who received inhaler treatment with VR glasses with the patients who received treatment without the aid of any device in terms of treatment compliance.\nThus, the investigators aimed to make the inhaler treatment more comfortable with VR technology.",

A composite of harvested healthy autologous bone fragments from the tunnel and autologous thrombin and fibrin, generated from the patient's PrP could be used at the interface between tunnel and ACL graft at the tibia and femur to reduce frequency of tunnel widening and therefore improve graft-bone-integration. The study seeks primarily to determine less tibial tunnel widening when a bone/PrP-composite is applied directly in the tibial tunnel compared to the same surgery without using the composite, measured with CT and MRI. Secondary study objectives are to evaluate femoral tunnel widening, tibial and femoral graft incorporation, graft maturation and knee function (clinical, functional, patient reported) over the course of 24 months follow-up and to evaluate occurrence of procedure- and product-related adverse events and complications.

The most important factor for survival for many cancer types is the presence of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes (metastasis). Lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck cancer reduce the 5-year survival by half. Sometimes, the disease is too small to be found on clinical and imaging exams before surgery. 111In-panitumumab is in a class of medications called radioimmunoconjugates. It is composed of a radioactive substance (indium In 111) linked to a monoclonal antibody (panitumumab). Panitumumab binds to EGFR receptors, a receptor that is over-expressed on the surface of many tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell growth. Once 111In-panitumumab binds to tumor cells, it is able to be seen using an imaging technique called single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). SPECT/CT can be used to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body and to visualize areas where the radioactive drug has been taken up by the cells. Using 111In-panitumumab with SPECT/CT imaging may improve identification of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer undergoing surgery.",

The chance of recurrance over five years is 15-40%. Ischemic stroke is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in the neck or brain becomes blocked. Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis).Hemorrhagic stroke is because of bleeding into the brain through the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemiparetic gait is characterised by using particular spatiotemporal features (1) restoring muscle characteristic by assisting weakened muscles,(2) reducing congestion through improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing ache by way of stimulating neurological system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm. Depending on the direction of application and tape tension increasing proprioception and increasing or inhibiting muscle recruitment can be obtained. The effect and positive result of Kinesio Taping greatly centers on increase in neuromuscular recruitment.RCT was conducted by S.Choi et.al in 2020 on immediate effects of lower leg kinesiotaping on ankle dorsiflexion and gait parameters in patients with chronic stroke with foot drop.The aim of the study was to estimate the immediate effects kinesiotaping of lower leg on ankle dorsiflexion as compared to no taping.\n\nOfficial Title\n=================\nImmediate Effects of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation With Lower Leg Kinesiotaping",

        "summary": "Two billion catheters are placed annually worldwide. Of all the people requiring vascular access, nearly a quarter have Difficult Intravenous access (DIVA), a source of multiple punctures. The increased risk of haematomas, haemorrhages, infection, pain and associated trauma is responsible for increased human costs and economic impact.\nTo limit the risks posed by the DIVA, practitioners have solutions such as the per-bone line, other types of lines, and placement of peripheral venous catheter with ultrasound or transluminescence. However, these solutions are not always applicable, depending on the care situation (non-substitutable venous access, fragile patient, etc.) or on the technical platform (available personnel and training, configuration of the premises, available equipment). Moreover, these actions are often taken after failures, in a non-anticipated and non-consensual manner.\nIn order to assess the risk of DIVA, F.Van Loon et al developed in 2016, and then modified in 2018, a DIVA Scale (the A-DIVA Scale) which allows a rapid scoring upstream of peripheral venous catheter placement to classify patients according to the risk of DIVA.\nComposed of five items (non-palpable and non-visible vein, diameter < 3mm, history of DIVA, operator experience) worth one point each, the score allows three categories to be established: low risk, moderate risk, high risk. The study showed that the proportion of first puncture failures increased with the risk of the patients (defined according to the categorized score).\nThe use of a tool such as the A-DIVA Scale is of interest if it allows the definition of actions to be taken in relation to the risk it identifies. In view of this, it appears essential to optimize the management of peripheral venous catheters, particularly for patients with DIVAs. The aim of this study is to develop a graduate and specific response to the issue of multiple punctures. Our project is to create and evaluate a specific algorithm, consisting of a risk assessment (the A-DIVA Scale) and a co-construct decision-making tree (the A-DIVA Tool). Built on the basis of objective clinical data collection and adapted to the possibilities and competencies, this new tool would bring real benefits to the patient in terms of safety (reduction of risks) and comfort (reduction of pain and duration of management), as well as a medico-economic benefit for the institutions. To date, such an algorithm does not exist and its beneficial effects have not been evaluated.",

About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk clinico-pathologic features that can increase risk of local recurrence (LR).\nAdjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence.

Non invasive breast neoplasia accounts for 25% of all 'breast cancers' detected through breast screening and includes ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS). Atypical hyperplasias are high risk but benign lesions found in 10% of benign biopsies performed through the NHS breast screening programme. The importance of these lesions rests on the increased risk of subsequently developing invasive breast cancer, with DCIS at highest risk (20 times greater than the general population) followed by LCIS (10 times greater) and atypical breast hyperplasia (4 times greater).\nThe Sloane Project data are held by Public Health England (PHE) and provide full and detailed information about the patients' journey from diagnosis to treatment and outcome. The project aims to increase the understanding of how best to manage these early lesions which can lead to breast cancer.\nAll NHS breast screening units in the UK are invited to submit data for the Sloane Project. Historically an exceptional \n90% of centres in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have participated on a voluntary basis.\nThe objective of this research protocol is the collection of anonymised formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks from women whose data is held within the Sloane Project database in order to allow detailed analysis of the biological, molecular and genomic changes in these cases of in situ carcinoma and atypical hyperplasia and how these relate to the corresponding annotated clinical, pathological and radiological data already collected by and held in PHE.

        "summary": "papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and has a good prognosis. Surgery is the primary treatment for PTC, and occult lymph node metastasis is not uncommon (20%-80%).The lymph node metastasis of PTC is mostly along the lymphatic drainage path station by station, and most of the first metastasis is to the central lymph node. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association recommendation, prophylactic central lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with primary T3-4 or cN1b without central lymph node involvement. However, PTC with primary site T1-2, no external invasion and cN0 could not be dissected by central lymph node.Previous studies have suggested that prophylactic dissection should be performed to improve disease-specific survival, reduce local recurrence, improve recurrence risk and treatment response assessment, and help RAI decision making. Although routine prophylactic central lymph node dissection may detect occult lymph node metastasis, the need for further dissection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland may lead to an increased incidence of complications, while its effect on reducing the risk of recurrence and improving prognosis is unclear, and the impact on long-term outcomes may be small.Previous retrospective studies in our institution have shown that routine central neck dissection does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. This study was designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in cT1b-T2N0 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. In order to ameliorate the effects of relapse and long time of death of PTC, thyroglobulin and its antibodies were also evaluated for short-term treatment response after surgery.",

The aim of the study is to ensure that the side effects of the 3-dose treatment are the same or potentially lower than those already published when using the 5-dose treatment as used in the UK PACE-B trial (NCT01584258). The name of this type of radiotherapy is Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) or participants may see it referred to as Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). The study is a two-stage single arm Phase II study open to those Centres that use the RayPilot HypoCath tumour tracking system (Micropos Medical). This commercially available system was not available at the time of the original PACE-B study. The system acts like a Global Positioning Device (GPS) to continuously track the prostate position during radiotherapy. If the prostate moves more than 2mm (about 0.08 in) from its intended position during the treatment, then the radiotherapy team are alerted, and the treatment halted until the prostate moves back into the correct position. The ability to understand exactly where the prostate is throughout the treatment ensures the intended dose hits the cancer and does not accidentally increase the dose to the nearby bladder and rectum. The system is a modification of a standard urinary catheter which sits within the bladder with the GPS placed within the wall of the catheter as it passes through the prostate. The investigators are not testing the system as it is commercially available but using it to improve the accuracy of radiotherapy delivery, reducing the number of days of treatment, minimizing side effects and helping ease the burden on busy radiotherapy Departments.",

        "summary": "Balance and weak postural control are most common in children with severe to profound hearing deficits. Children with hearing deficits also indicate behavioral problems related to impulse control, distraction, and disability to maintain attention in the visual modality. Hearing deficit is mostly defined as a communication deficit. Although the communication deficit is an important disorder, hearing deficit co-occurs with other physical impairments such as vestibular disorders. Development and control of the posture are important prerequisites for skill motor function. Children with hearing deficits and impaired sensory organization had weak balance and motor efficiency in many fields. Various studies on motor skills in deaf children have reported deficits in balance, general dynamic coordination, visual-motor skills, ball catching ability, and some disturbances in reaction time and speed of movements. Teachers of children with hearing impairment often complain of non-coordination, clumsiness, and balance deficit in such children, preventing the child from the desired function. So the aim of the study is to determine the effects of Cawthorne Cooksey Exercises on Balance and quality of life in children with hearing deficit It will be a Randomized Controlled Trial and children fulfilling exclusion-inclusion criteria will participate in the study. They will be divided randomly into two groups, using computer generated randomization, into control group and experimental group. After performing the pre-test measurements, the control group will perform Swiss Ball Exercises for 45 minutes and the interventional group will perform Cawthorne Cooksey Training Program Swiss Ball Exercises in addition, will also perform of 45 min session three times a week for 8 weeks of training. the study subjects will be evaluated again by Pediatrics Berg Balance Scale, Four-Step Square test and Quality of life questionnaire for children to measure the quality of life.

        "summary": "INTRODUCTION A variety of bone grafts and substitutes are available for filling bone defects in the distal radius after corrective osteotomy, but the harvesting of bone from the iliac crest is the gold standard as it allows easy access to corticocancellous bone of a desirable quality and quantity. The idea behind bone grafting is to provide optimal bone formation and structural stability, which is crucial for bone healing. However, the harvesting and use of bone from the iliac crest potentially comes with the risk of complications such as delayed union of the osteotomy defect; size mismatch between the graft and the osteotomy defect; longer operation time; donor site morbidity including nerve, arterial, and ureteral injury; herniation of abdominal contents; sacroiliac joint instability; pelvic fractures; hematoma and infection. As these disadvantages of bone grafting can have a major impact on patients' everyday lives, research is needed on whether bone grafting is genuinely necessary during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation of the distal radius\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to investigate whether harvested bone graft from the iliac crest necessary is during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation in patients with malunited distal radius fractures.\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study. Patients will undergo the following examinations once before the operation and five times afterwards: 1) the patients will fill out three questionnaires, 2) complications will be noted, 3) the wrist function will be measured, and 4) radiographs/CT scans will be made.\nSTUDY POPULATION All patients over the age of 18 years who have a symptomatic malunion after distal radius fracture and are eligible for surgical correction.\nINTERVENTION Surgical correction in the form of open wedge corrective osteotomy and plate fixation without bone grafting.\nUSUAL CARE Open wedge corrective osteotomy and plate fixation with harvesting bone from the iliac crest.\nOUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcomes: complications and quality of life. Secondary outcomes: time to complete bone healing, functional outcomes, and cost effectiveness.",

Moreover, due to the lack of early diagnostic marker, most patients with HCC are often diagnosed in an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further understand the possible aetiological factors and surgical treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC. Liver transplantation is an ideal choice for patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC, which can significantly improve the postoperative survival rate. But the most serious problem facing such patients is the shortage of donor livers. In 2015, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment (2-3 segment) transplantation combined with delayed total hepatectomy can greatly alleviate the shortage of liver donors in the above-mentioned patients. Based on the experience of clinical operation, our center proposes and designs a clinical study of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation (SALT) for the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC.

While DCM causes a range of symptoms, one of the most disabling is loss of hand dexterity. Surgical decompression is standard treatment for DCM, but reduced dexterity often remains.\nThe investigators have developed a portable, easy-to-use dexterity assessment tool for measuring hand dexterity. Hand function is often assessed using tools incapable of measuring subtle changes in function, limiting a clinician's ability to monitor progression of or recovery from a disease over time. The hope is that if subtle changes in function are identified early, leading to an early DCM diagnosis and treatment, this may prevent patients from experiencing a greater loss of hand function.\nThe goals of this study are to determine the relationship between dexterity and myelopathy severity, as well as to establish the validity and reliability of the dexterity tool. This will be done by assessing dexterity using the dexterity tool in DCM patients (to determine the relationship between disease severity and dexterity, and measure validity) and healthy participants (to establish reliability).",

        "summary": "Abnormal lipid metabolism is a common complication after organ transplantation, with pathological changes in lipid parameters occurring in approximately 60-80% of cardiac transplant recipients receiving triple immunotherapy with cyclosporine, imid azathioprine, and methylprednisolone. With the significant increase in long-term survival and increasing age of transplant patients, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, such as those caused by dyslipidemia, have become a major cause of transplant organ failure and recipient death. However, the causes of dyslipidemia after organ transplantation, as well as the effects and mechanisms of dyslipidemia on transplant rejection, are unknown.\nPrevious studies have found that 1. increased lipid levels occur in recipients after heart transplantation; 2. during rejection, hepatic PCSK9 expression is increased in recipients; 3. a high-fat environment increases the immunoreactivity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is suggested that PCSK9-lipid disorder-immune cell interactions may be associated with the development of transplant rejection.\nIn this project, we propose to (1) establish a long-term follow-up system for postoperative cardiac transplantation patients in our department to track the characteristics of lipid changes in transplantation patients, to clarify the link between dyslipidemia and rejection, and to provide a strong evidence-based medical basis for the management of lipids during the perioperative period and in the postoperative period; (2) expand the dimensions of lipid-related assays under the support of the above system, and to incorporate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research methods to elucidate transplantation rejection in a multidimensional manner. (ii) Expanding the dimensions of lipid-related assays to include transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic studies to elucidate the relationship between PCSK9 and dyslipidemia in transplant patients; (iii) Adopting single-cell sequencing technology to deeply reveal the potential mechanism by which changes in lipids affect T-cell-mediated rejection of cardiac transplants. The mechanism of T-cell-mediated cardiac transplantation rejection is revealed by single-cell sequencing.",

While the etiology underpinning this inequity is complex, the root cause of these issues has been traced to social determinants of health (SDH; e.g., stigma; poverty; barriers to education, housing, and employment). Funded by the National Institute for Minority Health Disparities (NIMHD 5R01MD010629), in partnership with the Critical Consciousness Collaborative Board (3CB), we developed Community Wise (CW), a multi-level manualized behavioral intervention to decrease ASM frequency in a population of self-identified men with histories of substance use disorder (SUD) and incarceration in Essex County, NJ, U.S. The 3CB was founded in 2010 and developed and pilot-tested the original CW. Over the past six years, our team used the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), and community based participatory research (CBPR) principles to develop and optimize CW for efficacy in reducing ASM. MOST is an innovative methodological framework that employs experimental designs to engineer efficient and effective behavioral interventions. MOST guided the optimization of CW with delivery cost of less than $2,000 per intervention cycle serving up to ten individuals simultaneously (this was the Medicaid allowable reimbursement cost for SUD group treatment services in 2015).

However, patients may experience intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, which can lead to inactivity, increased risk of complications, and greater consumption of opioids, resulting in adverse effects and prolonged hospital stays. Pain management is challenging due to a large number of dermatomes covered. The interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block seems to cover the thoracic dermatomes.

Additional anesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of the multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to manage acute pain better. Inadequate treatment can lead to persistent pain conditions. Although numerous nerve blocks exist for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the thoracic dermatomes or their entire innervation.

Half of people older than 50 years of age will suffer from hemorrhoids in a period of their life, of which only 5-10% will require surgical intervention while most of the remainders become asymptomatic and improved with the conservative treatment.\nConservative treatment in the form of diet modification as well as some medical treatment, is usually effective. On the other hand, a few patients require surgical intervention. Surgery is indicated for those not responding to conservative management, those with grade III, and grade IV hemorrhoids.\nSurgical treatment is the only curative method for hemorrhoidal disease and indicated for advanced and complicated disease. The most radical operations with the best results are the Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy .\nHowever, the major concern of hemorrhoidectomy is the post-operative pain that occurs in 20-40 % of patients and it is considered the main cause of refusing surgery. The cause of postoperative pain is multifactorial, including the type of anesthesia , hemorrhoidectomy technique. and spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) that becomes exposed after hemorrhoidectomy. The spasm of the IAS is considered the target to relieve pain post operatively. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is widely used as an adjunct to relieve pain post hemorrhoidectomy as it release the spasm of the sphincter and subsequently relieve pain. However, this procedure is not accepted by many surgeons due to its recorded complications as bleeding and mild degree of fecal incontinence, so its role following hemorrhoidectomy is still controversial.\nOn the other hand, the spasm of the anal sphincter can be abolished by injection of the botulinum toxin which acts on the acetylcholine receptor and consequently temporary muscle paralysis occurs that is followed by decreased pain and wound healing.\nOur hypothesis is botulinum toxin relaxes the internal sphincter, so prevent its spasm and so reducing the pain and promoting wound healing more rapidly.",

Ruxolitinib is a type of medication called a kinase inhibitor. It works by blocking the signals of cells that cause inflammation and cell proliferation, which may help prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD). Tacrolimus is a drug used to help reduce the risk of rejection by the body of organ and bone marrow transplants by suppressing the immune system. Methotrexate stops cells from making DNA, may kill cancer cells, and also suppress the immune system, which may reduce the risk of GVHD. Giving ruxolitinib with tacrolimus and methotrexate may prevent GVHD in pediatric and young adults undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplants.",

He estimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than that of men.\nDisabled women coexist in a dual state of vulnerability where being a woman and being a disabled person have two social disadvantages. Among people with disabilities, women with disabilities (WWD) have higher unmet healthcare needs than women without disabilities.\nCancer is an important public health problem and cause of death all over the world. Among the most common cancers in women; breast, uterine corpus, ovarian and cervix cancers are seen to be prominent, respectively. It is known that with regular examinations and screenings, early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer increases the chance of treatment.\nInternational studies show that women face barriers and difficulties in accessing reproductive health and cancer screening services. In studies, it was stated that especially women with disabilities living in rural areas had lower mammography and Pap-smear tests compared to women without disabilities. In recent years, the Health Belief Model has been used frequently to examine the effect of health beliefs on cancer screening behaviors in women and to increase screening rates. The model explains the beliefs and attitudes that affect individuals' behaviors. According to the model; If a person has a desire to prevent illness or a belief in recovery, he recommends taking a specific health action to prevent illness as a positive behavior. It was emphasized that nurses have important roles and responsibilities in the protection and development of health, and that they can identify individuals with disabilities who are considered fragile, and provide health education and counseling to these groups. It is thought that the disabled-friendly accessible health care practices under the guidance of the Health Belief Model will bring the preventive health care behavior of women with disabilities to the desired level.\nDisabled women experience inequalities in benefiting from routine health services and health screening services in special areas such as reproductive health and protection from women's cancers. Being diagnosed with cancer is undoubtedly devastating for anyone. For this reason, it becomes more important to raise awareness about the prevention, prevention, early diagnosis and development of a healthy lifestyle in women with physical disabilities, and to encourage health-seeking behaviors.",

        "summary": "Rationale: Osteoarthritis (OA) is mainly characterized by cartilage degeneration. In knee OA, measuring the distance between the tibia and femur, known as the joint space width (JSW), is an often-used method to quantify the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatments, because it is an indirect measure of cartilage degeneration. However, JSW is often measured while the patient is standing (weight-bearing) with slightly flexed knees, with a flexion angle of around 7-10 degrees, while direct cartilage thickness measurements are usually performed while the patient is lying down (non-weight-bearing) with an extended leg [1]. Because of this difference in positioning, it is difficult to compare different JSW and cartilage thickness measures, as it is not clear what happens with the JSW distribution in the joint when a patient changes position between weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension. In this study, we aim to identify the changes that occur in the knee of OA patients under the influence of weight-bearing and/or flexion, to enable comparing joint space measures from different positions. In this research we want to use MRI as a three-dimensional imaging technique because there is no radiation involved..\nObjective: To evaluate how the 3D knee joint space distribution in knee OA patients changes under the influence of weight-bearing (upright) and flexion MRI scanning.\nStudy design: Explorative cross-sectional study. Study population: 21 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3) are included from the orthopaedics department of Medisch Spectrum Twente in Enschede.\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary study parameter is the change in medial joint space width between the different positions (weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension).",

        "summary": "Aspiration pneumonia due to dysphagia is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysphagia intervention in the United States involves evaluation at onset of dysphagia symptoms followed by short-term therapy. Traditional therapy relies on verbal instruction and low-tech at-home exercise regimens without visual biofeedback; lacking a monitoring of accuracy or strength of exercise. Available biofeedback is office-based, bulky and expensive, thus, not readily used. The Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) is a well-researched office based biofeedback system that has recently been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application. This study aims to investigate the impact of swallowing therapy using the BiSSKit app on airway protective outcomes in patients with PD. Thirty participants with PD and dysphagia will be recruited for this study. Participants will undergo a baseline-modified barium swallowing (MBS) evaluation followed by 12 weekly sessions of swallowing therapy. Participants will be randomized to two swallowing therapy groups (1) traditional (2) BiSSKit app. Participants will undergo MBS following therapy completion. Outcome measures include swallowing safety, pharyngeal kinematics, and swallowing-related quality of life. We hypothesize that use of the BiSSKit will result in improved swallowing function compared to the traditional swallowing therapy group.",

Recently, the use of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), a type of non-invasive brain stimulation, has been combined with adaptive working memory training interventions in healthy older adults, providing evidence for a significant improvement in memory functions. To the best of our knowledge, no study addressed the use of strategic memory training coupled with the use of tDCS in normal aging. Strategic memory trainings allow to improve participants' performance in the practiced task and to generalize the use of memory strategies to new materials. This Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a combined intervention associating strategic memory training with the use of tDCS. Healthy older adults and participants with subjective cognitive decline will be recruited and randomly assigned to the experimental group (strategic memory training + ACTIVE tDCS) or the control group (strategic memory training + SHAM tDCS). All participants will be evaluated on transfer and practiced tasks before (T0) and after (T1) the treatment and during follow-up visits, scheduled at 1 month (T2) and 3 months (T3) after the intervention.",

New medications are now available which can alter the disease trajectory and reduce clinical events. However, many cases of HF remain undetected until presentation with more advanced symptoms, often requiring hospitalisation. Earlier identification and treatment of HF could reduce downstream healthcare impact, but predicting HF incidence is challenging due to the complexity and varying course of HF. The investigators will use routinely collected hospital-linked primary care data and focus on the use of artificial intelligence methods to develop and validate a prediction model for incident HF. Using clinical factors readily accessible in primary care, the investigators will provide a method for the identification of individuals in the community who are at risk of HF, as well as when incident HF will occur in those at risk, thus accelerating research assessing technologies for the improvement of risk prediction, and the targeting of high-risk individuals for preventive measures and screening.",

The optimal selection of the potency and duration of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in HBR patients is still a matter of debate. Multiple strategies to reduce bleeding during secondary prevention, such as reducing the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, using single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor, or de-escalating to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor, have been proposed. De-escalation to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor is particularly attractive because it maintains efficient pharmacological inhibition of multiple platelet pathways while potentially reducing bleeding through less aggressive activity. Yet, there has been no study comparing the effects of different de-escalation strategies with the standard potent P2Y12 inhibitors in HBR patients. The aim of the DESC-HBR study is to assess the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid in HBR patients, in comparison with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors, on the proportion of patients with optimal platelet reactivity (OPR).

FASD is completely preventable if women do not drink during pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol use frequently co-occurs with other substance use, especially tobacco and cannabis. The adverse effect on birth outcomes by alcohol and tobacco use together is worse than either substance alone. Recent evidence from animal models shows that prenatal exposure to both cannabinoids and alcohol potentiate the likelihood of alcohol-induced birth defects.\nData from Cape Metropole, SA, showed that all women who reported prenatal alcohol use also tested positive for tobacco use, with 25% also reporting cannabis use. Alcohol use while breastfeeding also occurs at a relatively high rate in SA. Despite tremendous health benefits from breastfeeding,maternal alcohol use while breastfeeding significantly compromises infant development. Contingency management (CM) has been efficacious in reducing prenatal cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco use in the United States (U.S.). The Women's Health CoOp (WHC) is an evidence-based brief intervention addressing women-focused syndemic issues and resulting disparities associated with substance and alcohol use. These evidence-based interventions need to be combined and adapted for addressing maternal polysubstance use and associated health and behavioral issues during pregnancy and lactation in SA. The Specific Aims are as follows: (1) R61 Aim 1- Conduct formative qualitative research with women who are pregnant or breastfeeding with a recent history of polysubstance use, clinic and community stakeholders, and an established Community Collaborative Board. (2) R61 Aim 2-Test feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the adapted intervention with 48 women (24 pregnant and 24 breastfeeding) in Cape Metropole, SA.

More importantly, whether it can used simultaneously for accurate volume and invasive hemodynamic monitoring. For the purpose of support of cardiopulmonary function, the ideal position of the catheter tip is vital with regard to an accurate CVP and hemodynamic monitoring. Cannulation of the axillary vein is ideal for patients with severe poly-trauma because it avoids the thoracic cavity, intercostal arteries, tracheostomy, and clavicle, and is prone to compression even if the artery is injured. At present, there is no systematic introduction of ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in the trauma ICU in the literature. Since Oct 2021, the investigators have attempted to practice axillary vein catheterization for this crucial trauma population; unfortunately, the investigators have not know till now whether this procedure is associated with accurate tip placement and its safety should also be weighted.

This increases the risk of stroke through clot formation in the atrium, but also of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is a major cause of stroke, accounting for more than 25% of all strokes. In addition, a quarter of ischemic strokes remain without an obvious cause at the end of hospitalization, and it is recommended that atrial fibrillation be detected intensively with long-term heart rhythm recording. Implantable loop recorders can detect 30% of atrial fibrillation cases over the 3-year battery life of these devices, after a stroke of undetermined origin. However, these devices require a small operation to implant them under the skin, and they are expensive.\nThe hypothesis of this study is that MRI imaging of the left atrium would enable better selection of patients to receive an implantable loop recorder. MRI can quantify the proportion of the left atrium with scar tissue, which is likely to favour the onset of atrial fibrillation. If the results confirm this hypothesis, the number of patients requiring an implantable loop recorder could be reduced, and perhaps an anticoagulation strategy based on MRI data could be introduced.\nIn addition to the usual follow-up by cardiologists and neurologists, participation in this study involves a cardiac MRI (with contrast agent) within 3 months of the stroke.",

        "summary": "This study will look to implement a plan for enhanced transitional care for patients at high risk of unplanned hospital readmission in hopes of reducing their risk for readmission in the first 30 days post discharge from an inpatient encounter. Hospital readmissions are an undesirable occurrence that can increase cost for hospitals, and can cause further negative outcomes for patients. Identifying factors that increase a patient's chances of being readmitted to the hospital, as well as developing an intervention to effectively reduce this risk, has historically been challenging.\nOur new method uses a combination of common features such as diagnosis and length of hospital stay, with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, the RecuR Score model developed by the University of Maryland Medical System, that identifies patients at the highest risk of having an unplanned hospital readmission. Participants identified as higher risk will then be enrolled into our pilot where they will be randomized to receive either the standard of care treatment or an enhanced protocol that includes additional disease education, coordination of home health services, and a focus on their readmission during existing multidisciplinary team huddles.\nThe main goal of this study is to reduce unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of initial discharge, in those most at risk of being readmitted, using the aforementioned novel methods for identifying these participants and a transitional care intervention. This success of this goal will be analyzed across different readmission risk levels in the study population. Secondary goals of this study include reducing unplanned hospital readmission within 90 days, reducing 30-day post-discharge mortality, and reducing 30- and 90-day emergency department (ED) usage after an initial hospitalization.",

Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial uses a standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - to open the nose and affect underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time, to maintain its nose opening effect.

This procedure is called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (or primary PCI for short).\nAn angiogram is a routine procedure that involves insertion of fine plastic tube (catheter) into either the groin or wrist under local anaesthetic. The tube is passed into the artery in the heart and X-ray pictures are taken to find out if the arteries are blocked. Blocked arteries can usually be opened by passing a small balloon into the artery, via the fine plastic tube followed by placement of a stent (a fine metal coil) into the artery to prevent it from blocking again.\nAlthough this treatment is very successful, it can result in damage to the heart muscle when the artery is opened. Cooling the entire body has been shown to reduce heart muscle damage during heart attacks in some patients but not in others; however, it is uncomfortable due to the shivering, expensive and can result in delays in opening the blocked artery.\nThe investigators are conducting a series of research studies to find out if cooling the heart muscle directly through the catheter being used for the normal primary angioplasty treatment using room temperature may be effective in preserving heart muscle, without the shortcomings of entire body cooling.\nThe investigators have already published an initial series of ten cases in which this treatment appeared to be feasible without causing significant clinical problems.\nThe present study is a pilot study designed to assess the rate of patient recruitment and feasibility of this new treatment while exploring some detailed outcomes measuring the restoration of blood flow within the coronary artery at the end of the procedure.\nUltimately if the present pilot study is successful, the investigators plan to go on to undertake a much larger randomised outcome study to determine definitively whether this treatment can help reduce heart attack size.",

Women with a history of depression have a 20 fold higher risk of PDA at subsequent pregnancies. The adverse outcomes extend beyond maternal well-being to long-term deficits in children and families. The gut-brain axis is a newly recognized key player in mental health disorders. Specifically, the microbial composition of the gut along with their metabolites are directly involved in disease onset and course. Recent clinical studies have identified diet as the most powerful environmental factor in manipulating gut microbiome. Given vulnerability and resistance of pregnant women to pharmacotherapy, particularly in those with a predisposition to mood disorders, as well as pregnant women's high motivation and commitment to improving gestational diet, a dietary/supplemental intervention to 'optimize' gut microbiome, is a favored approach in disease management. The study investigators aim to exploit microbial responsiveness to diet together with this maternal motivation, to alter the risk and severity of a universal public health concern that has dire and long-term consequences for new moms and their children.\nThe investigators of this trial, will first study the challenges in pursuing a study aimed at changing the microbiome of pregnant women with a history of mood disorders. Pregnant women in their second trimester will be recruited.

        "summary": "This exploratory experiment is designed to determine the extent to which the socialization experiences and social, behavioral, and linguistic skills of preschoolers with language impairment (LI) can be improved. The investigators implement a peer-mediated intervention in inclusive preschool classrooms, randomly assigned to treatment (n=12) or control (n=13) conditions. A focal child is identified in each classroom, representing a child with LI (3 to 5 years of age) who exhibits the poorest pragmatic-language skills and highest level of social exclusion in the classroom. Over a 12-week period, the focal children will receive peer-mediated intervention from identified peers, who use strategies to engage the focal child socially during center time, as supported by a classroom facilitator (teacher, aide). Outcomes of interest include the overarching classroom social network and its embedded socialization processes (e.g., frequency of child-to-child interaction), the focal child's interactions with peers and exposure to peer talk, and the focal child's social, behavioral, and linguistic skills. The study employs state-of-the-art social network analyses to represent the classroom network at the child, dyad, and network level and is dynamically modeled over the academic year using advanced location-tracking technologies and voice-activated recorders to capture incoming and outgoing peer talk for the focal child. The investigators anticipate the results of this study to yield significant theoretical and scientific impact. Theoretically, the investigators propose that improved socialization experiences in the preschool classroom can disrupt the social exclusion and peer maltreatment experienced by children with LI, leading to accelerated growth in linguistic, social, and behavioral outcomes for children with LI.",

        "summary": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive lung cancer subtypes, accounting for approximately 15-20% of total lung cancer cases. Although SCLC is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy, it is highly susceptible to recurrence. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the clinical practice of oncology, and the newly released results of the ASTRUM-005 study have led to the incorporation of Serplulimab into the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. Although immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is currently the most promising regimen, due to the limited understanding of genetic alterations and the marked genetic heterogeneity of SCLC, treatment responsiveness varies greatly. Thus, there is an urgent need to find molecular biomarkers that can effectively predict prognosis and further suggest the effectiveness of this new treatment mode.\nMinimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of tumor cells disseminated from the primary lesion to distant organs in patients who lack any clinical or radiological signs of metastasis or residual tumor cells left behind after local therapy that eventually lead to local recurrence. These years, the development of real-time, high-sensitivity liquid biopsy assays have enabled the identification of MRD in individual patients with cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that detection of MRD dynamics following definitive therapy for solid cancers is strongly prognostic and has extremely high positive predictive value for risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the predictive value of MRD dynamics on disease prognosis before and after the first-line treatment of Serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC.",

While some preliminary findings in oxytocin administration trials have been promising, a complete understanding of the effects of long-term oxytocin administration in autism remains elusive, as participant numbers in oxytocin administration studies in autism have been small, most studies exclusively recruit males, and reproducibility has been inconsistent.\nTo address this critical knowledge gap, this project will include a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled crossover trial of a four-week intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 international units, twice-daily) in 128 male and female youth with ASD aged 12-20, with social and repetitive behaviors as primary outcome measures. The investigators predict that intranasal oxytocin treatments will increase performance on social behavior measures and reduce repetitive behaviors using caregiver-reported measures.\nAlong with the investigation of oxytocin's long-term effects, the investigators will also assess the impact of oxytocin administration on computer-based laboratory tasks that can precisely measure how participants process social cues and disengage with repetitive behaviours.

        "summary": "Every year in France, 60,000 children are born prematurely (before 37 weeks of amenorrhea), and present an immaturity of their various systems, in particular the digestive system. This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.\nIn the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.\nDevelopmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed. It is therefore essential to properly assess the digestive status of premature babies in order to determine whether they have feeding intolerance and whether they require treatment with abdominal massage.\nTo date, the investigators have not found measurable criteria or existing scales that can describe the digestive status of newborns. The main objective of the study is therefore to create and validate a clinical assessment scale for the abdominal status of preterm infants.",

        "summary": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective approach for treating both benign and malignant blood disorders. It primarily involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate tumor cells within the patient's body, as well as to suppress the recipient's hematopoiesis and immune function. The transplantation replaces the recipient's original hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with donor-derived HSCs, thereby reconstructing the donor's hematopoietic and immune functions to achieve disease cure.\nPoor graft function (PGF) following transplantation, which refers to inadequate engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells, is one of the major factors limiting the effectiveness of allo-HSCT. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), identified within the bone marrow stroma, are a type of non-hematopoietic multipotent stem cells. Several studies, including previous research by our research team, suggest that MSCs can improve the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment by secreting various cytokines. This leads to the promotion of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of hematopoietic function, and support for hematopoiesis as well as direct or indirect promotion of vascular regeneration in damaged tissues and organs.\nTherefore, exploring the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in treating poor graft function after allo-HSCT, observing the recovery of blood parameters in patients with poor engraftment, monitoring transplantation-related complications and immune reconstitution, and conducting preliminary investigations into the underlying mechanisms can contribute to the exploration of new clinical techniques for the treatment of PGF following allo-HSCT.",

The investigators have identified a significant tumor burden in non-enhancing (NE) regions beyond the contrast-enhancing (CE) portion of tumor.

Taken together, these effects explain why PP improves oxygenation, limits the occurrence of ventilator-induced lung injury and improves survival.\nProne position is simple to perform in infants and in some neonatal and pediatric intensive care units is already commonly accomplished. However, a detailed analysis of the respective effects of high PEEP and prone position is lacking in infants/children with ARDS, while these two tools may interfere and/or act coherently. A recent multicenter, retrospective analysis of patients with pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) describes how patients managed with lower PEEP relative to FIO2 than recommended by the ARDSNet model had higher mortality, suggesting that future clinical trials targeting PEEP management in PARDS are needed. We designed a physiological study to investigate the physiological effects of prone positioning on lung recruitability in infants/children with acute respiratory distress syndrome.",

        "summary": "Background Anal fissure is one of the most common anorectal problems. After an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from China to almost all over the world, it nearly affected all countries. In spite of its typical presentation in the form of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and pneumonia, other GIT manifestations were reported. We found some of COVID-19 survivors who had complained from anal fissure problem. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of acute anal fissure among COVID-19 patients, its possible risk factors and outcome.\nMethods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 at Mansoura university isolation hospital, on COVID-19 patients' who were diagnosed with anal fissure. Those who survived and were discharged home safely were telephone called to pick up whether they suffered from any symptoms of anal pain, difficulty in defecation suggesting anal fissure, in order to identify their outcomes, the risk factors for anal fissure development and how they were managed.\nResults A total of 176 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were categorized into two groups. The first group included patients who developed anal fissure (n=65) and the 2nd group included patients who did not develop anal fissure (n=111). No significant difference was noted in demographic data apart from the age which was younger in the fissure group. The incidence of anal fissure was 36.9% of total population. The majority of patients' anal fissure problem resolved spontaneously after patients improved from the COVID symptoms without receiving any treatment (43.1%).\nConclusion Anal fissure is quite common problem after COVID-19. Young and middle age patients are more vulnerable to develop anal fissure after COVID-19 infection.",

        "summary": "Palatal-tissue harvesting is a routinely performed procedure in periodontal plastic surgery. Subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) is considered the gold standard in root coverage. However, over the years, several materials have been attempted to accelerate wound healing and to decrease the post-operative patient discomfort and pain, which are considered the most common disadvantages of tissue harvesting from the palate. Reharvesting from the same region could be necessary in some complicated gingical recessions. For this reason, patients may face long treatment times due to recovery periods of the palate between surgeries.\nPlatelet-rich fibrin (PRF) which has 3-dimensional fibrin matrix structure contributes to regeneration of surgical wounds by releasing growth factors for 10-14 days and showing angiogenic properties.\nIn medicine and dentistry, ultrasonography (USG) method can be used to measure tissue thickness, vascularization, elasticity and blood flow. USG, as a non-invasive method, can provide objective data in evaluating the effects of surgical techniques and biomaterials used on soft tissue healing dynamics and tissue perfusion.\nThe investigators hypothesised that leukocyte rich PRF (L-PRF) application to the palatal area after sCTG harvesting could increase palatal tissue thickness and vascularity throughout 3-month follow-up period compared to the controls. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of the L-PRF membrane on soft tissue donor site healing after harvesting sCTG in terms of wound healing dynamics using USG method.",

        "summary": "TMD (temporomandibular disorders) is the name for a collective syndrome of disorders that includes abnormal function of the muscles of mastication, the temporomandibular joints and surrounding structures. It is one of the most significant causes of orofacial pain, along with dental pain. In TMD syndrome, the cause of pain is often due to overloading of the masticatory muscles rather than primary changes in the joints themselves.\nNowadays, doctors who treat patients with TMD have no doubt that one of the very important etiological factors of this condition is psycho-emotional disorders (excessive nervous excitability, anxiety, depression), which has been confirmed by numerous authors of studies on this subject [4-11].\nThe etiology of TMD is complex and multifactorial. Numerous factors may also contribute to the development of the disorder. An important factor affecting the state of masticatory function is an increase in stress levels (psycho-emotional tension). Structures such as the hypothalamus, reticular formation and limbic system have a decisive influence on the emotional state of each patient The activity of the limbic system, which governs the emotions of adults, and the additional connections of the gamma loops to the masticatory muscles, determine that increased emotional tension translates into a significant increase in the contractile activity of the masticatory muscles.\nTMD and functional disorder of the masticatory muscles are the most common complaint of the patients, seeking treatment in dental office. The two main symptoms of TMD problems are pain and dysfunction. Myalgia -the most common cause is an increased level of muscle use. It is related to vasocontraction of relevant arteries and accumulation of metabolic waste product in the muscles. Activities such as daytime clenching of the teeth and bruxism, habits of chewing gum, biting lips, finger nails or cheeks are factors that cause significant strain on the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joints.",

        "summary": "Allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis affect more than 25% of the world population and are the leading cause of illness in children. The complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors results in the manifestation of allergic diseases . The pathological presentation of allergic disease involves the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a multifaceted response in specific target tissues such as the airways . This response results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to target tissues and the production of specific IgE antibodies, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [11], [12]. It is well established that allergic inflammation triggers neuronal dysfunction, which activates specific inflammatory mechanisms, potentially leading to structural changes in the diseased tissue . Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related proteins initially discovered to be involved in regulating neuronal development and now known to govern both peripheral and central nerve growth.\nBDNF is a secretory protein belonging to the neurotrophin family and is involved in a range of neural processes during human development [19], [20]. In the early stages of development BDNF is essential for neurogenesis, survival and maturation of neuronal pathways. In the adult, alongside neurotransmitters, hormones and other neurotrophins, BDNF maintains synaptic plasticity, dendritic growth and the consolidation of long-term memory. The biological effect of BDNF is mediated via its binding to the trkB receptor. The activation of these receptors on eosinophils may be important in regulating the inflammatory cascade leading to allergic disease [15], [24]. Neurotrophin mediated activation of bronchial eosinophils might therefore play a role in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in allergic asthma .\nThe BDNF gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and is alternatively spliced resulting in several different transcripts [26]. Genetic polymorphisms in BDNF have been associated with allergic phenotypes such atopic dermatitis [27] and asthma [28], [29], [30], [31] in different populations. The functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) has been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking and affect the secretion of BDNF [32]. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is expressed in the glandular, nasal epithelium, and peripheral nerves in the nasal mucosa, has been shown to induce biochemical and structural changes in nerves that can lead to hyper-responsiveness [33], [34], [35] The biological effects of neurotrophins are mediated by binding either to the high-affinity tyrosine kinase (trk) receptors or to the low-affinity receptors known as pan-neurotrophin receptor p-75.",

Up to 10% of community dwelling older adults have depressive symptoms in Europe. Older adults are also subject to chronic illnesses which further exacerbate psychological symptoms. Furthermore, normal aging is associated with decline in cognitive functioning. Given the prevalence of mental health problems and cognitive difficulties in older adults, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could be helpful in this population. Accordingly, a growing number of studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions in the elderly have beneficial effects on psychological health (decrease in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and increase in general mood and positive affect) and cognition (enhanced attention, executive functions).\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique which can be useful to study the neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness, and give neurobiological evidence of its beneficial effect in the elderly. Studies that examined spectral power outcomes between mindfulness and control state showed (i) increased alpha and theta power, as a marker of internally-directed attention processing and executive functioning and (ii) a shift towards left-sided anterior alpha activation, a pattern associated previously with positive emotions.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate short and long-term cognitive, psychological, and physiological effects of a standard 8-week MBI in healthy older adults.

        "summary": "There is increasing awareness of the importance of providing mental health services and support that promote a recovery-oriented and human rights-based approach. A mental health service system that is guided by a rehabilitation and recovery perspective places emphasis on treating the consequences of the illness rather than just the illness per se, and on empowering people to regain control of their identity and life, and to have hope for the future. Within this philosophy, mental health policies in several countries advocate for the introduction of peer workers in mental health services, people with lived experience of mental health issues and recovery, who are employed to use their lived experience to support those who access mental health services. However, more effectiveness and implementation research is needed. Evidence also suggests that the period following hospital discharge is of high risk of treatment dropout for people with serious mental illness, thus interrupting their recovery process. Therefore, this vulnerable population may particularly benefit from more targeted interventions during this transitional period.\nThe research project will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and implementation of the Critical Time Intervention-Peer Support model, a recovery-oriented based model for people with serious mental illness discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Portugal. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in three psychiatric services in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and their catchment areas. People with diagnoses of psychotic disorders discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities will be recruited and randomly divided into CTI-PS intervention or usual care. Those allocated to the intervention group will additionally receive CTI-PS rather than usual care alone over a 9-month period. Outcomes at baseline, 9- and 18-months will be analyzed by multilevel models, considering the observations clustered within sites. Longitudinal analyses will be used to examine trends over time of the outcomes of interest.\nThe implementation of the CTI-PS model will introduce a novel approach to community mental health care that has not yet been tried in Portugal. This study aims to explore to what extent this intervention can be effective and implemented in countries with the characteristics of Portugal. Additionally, the proposed research aims to contribute to the global knowledge about peer interventions by investigating whether the CTI model maintains its effectiveness using peers.",

This study will also investigate whether it is possible to find out which patients are likely to feel a lot better after the procedure.

There are a number of different reasons patients may not feel better, for example if the lung is not able to fully re-expand. The study aims to look at whether it is possible to predict these problems before the procedure using ultrasound. If it is possible to find the answers to some of these questions it might be possible to prevent patients undergoing treatments which are not likely to benefit them.

        "summary": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality in western countries. Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) is the first-line imaging test in patients with suspected obstructive CAD. However, in most patients, cCTA shows non-obstructive CAD. The management of patients with non-obstructive CAD is unclear. This is due to the lack of cCTA-based methods capable to assess the risk of disease progression towards developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) based on the atherosclerosis characteristics of each patient. A solution for prognostication in these patients is particularly appealing since it could allow to identify patients who can benefit of a more aggressive medical treatment and management, thus improving outcome.\nProposed methods, which include qualitative evaluations such as the identification of adverse atherosclerotic plaque characteristics or quantitative evaluations such as the quantification of atherosclerotic plaque burden, may in some cases suffer of limited reproducibility between operators and software. Most importantly, each single biomarker is insufficient to accurately predict patient risk, hence potential synergic integration of cCTA and clinical biomarkers is the key to efficiently guide the personalization of patient's management. Furthermore, the few risk stratification methods that have been proposed are not designed to work on platforms capable of deploying the solution to other clinical settings, promoting prospective or external validation",

It can be caused by treatments such as chemotherapy or by certain medical conditions. Neutropenic sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when patients with neutropenia develop an infection. There is currently no way to test for neutropenic sepsis outside of hospitals. Neutrocheck is being developed for use as a self-test by patients at home alongside remote consultation with a HCP or at point-of-care by a HCP. This will allow rapid identification of patients requiring urgent intravenous antibiotics and medical assessment. In cases where Neutrocheck has eliminated the possibility of neutropenic sepsis, patients can avoid unnecessary and stressful hospital visits and valuable hospital resources will be saved.\nParticipants in this study will be invited to use the Neutrocheck test kit in a setting similar to a home environment to carry out a test, whilst being observed by a study moderator.\nThe Neutrocheck devices used in the study will be for investigational use only. This study will not be testing the accuracy of the Neutrocheck result, rather if Neutrocheck can be used safely and in a user-friendly way. Results will not be considered valid. Planned study duration is 2 months. This approach will enable us to complete the current phase of development and advance to a clinical validation study of Neutrocheck, assessing the diagnostic accuracy of Neutrocheck amongst users including those at risk of neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis.",

        "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that often results in motor and/or cognitive impairment. Epidemiologically, the onset occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, with a peak around the age of 30.\nMS is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of signs and symptoms, both in terms of the neurological systems involved and the degree of impairment and severity. The most common symptoms include, among others, difficulty walking and lack of balance. The lack of stability and coordination reduces independence and mobility, predisposing people with MS to accidental falls and compromising mobility in daily life. Another symptom that characterises MS is cognitive impairment, which mainly alters information processing speed and short- and long-term memory. MS-related cognitive impairment is detectable at every stage of the disease. Very often, people with MS have co-existing cognitive and motor deficits, which add to the complexity of managing MS. In order to address this condition, a treatment strategy that combines cognitive and motor rehabilitation needs to be identified. Despite the increasing availability of effective drug therapies that may impact on balance, rehabilitation is a very important means to counteract the progression of disability and improve physical function, affecting social participation and improving quality of life. In recent years, rehabilitation makes use of various robotic devices, which are based on repeatable, intense and motivating exercises, integrated with an enriched virtual environment, capable of improving the quality of movement. In light of the literature, which mainly focuses on robotic therapy for walking, this pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of a specific robotic treatment for balance in MS patients.\nThe primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT) on static balance.\nThe secondary objective is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT)\non dynamic balance and walking (assessed with clinical and instrumental scales)\non fatigue and cognitive performance in terms of sustained attention, dual-task cost and cognitive-motor interference;\non quality of life.",

Gemelli over 12 months.the TMA diagnostic algorithm has been implemented in the laboratory software of the hospital and applied whenever a patient in the Emergency ward or any other department undergoes blood tests that include platelet count and lactate dehydrogenase. The basic profile in the Emergency ward always has these two parameters. The algorithm automatically identifies patients with a predicted probability of TMA >90% (6); if this criterion is associated with a platelet count<100 x 109/L, an automated warning to the hematologist on-call is issued with an SMS, and the patient enters the TMA diagnostic process defined in the diagnostic and treatment pathways (Percorso Diagnostico e Terapeutico Assistensiale, PDTA). The on-duty hematologist urgently evaluates the patient for whom a warning has been issued, relating with the clinician(s) of the ward in which the patient is located. If the suspicion of TMA is confirmed, the diagnostic procedures outlined in the PDTA are performed, with the immediate execution of 2nd level tests. If the on-duty hematologist considers the diagnosis of aHUS possible, they contact the on-call Nephrologist directly for immediate diagnostic investigation and specific urgent therapeutic measures, as needed. The TMA-expert Hematologist and/or TMA-expert Nephrologist is notified as soon as possible by the on-duty hematologist of all cases, both highly suspected and uncertain, and follow up all patients to complete the diagnostic workup to confirm or rule out the diagnosis and implement the appropriate clinical measures.\nTherefore, the treatment in smaller hospitals that do not have a 24-hour hematological guard service available and the same awareness for TMA.\nThe present study aims to validate these results by testing the system in a multicenter study involving centers with different availability of the hematologist and awareness for TMA.",

Although most verrucae will disappear spontaneously, many patients do seek treatment. Current wart treatments do not target the cause of the lesion directly, resulting in variable treatment efficacies and high wart recurrence rates. AV2 is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, that is capable of deactivating HPV. It is however not able to destruct the already infected cells, which raises the need for an additional ablative treatment i.e. salicylic acid (SA). Implementation of AV2-Salicylic acid (AV2-SA) combination therapy would ensure permanent lesion clearance by on the one hand inactivation of HPV by AV2, and on the other hand elimination of the lesion by SA treatment. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of AV2-SA treatment versus standard SA treatment, by comparing cure and recurrence rates of cutaneous warts between the two treatment groups (at 12 weeks and six months after randomization). The second aim is to assess the safety and tolerability of AV2-SA therapy. The third aim is to identify subgroups of cutaneous warts that have favorable response to treatment, by comparing cure rates in an HPV genotype-specific manner. This randomized controlled trial will enroll 260 participants with cutaneous warts who will either receive the AV2-SA combination therapy or SA control treatment. Real time monitoring will be possible by daily photographs sent via WhatsApp TM (a messaging application) as well as online follow-up questionnaires administered on several occasions.

Indeed, thyroid differentiation genes are silenced by a mechanism controlled by NOX4-derived OS. On the other hand, TERT contributes to mitochondrial OS protection, which could increase the resistance of cancer cells to therapeutic agents. The investigators aim to address the role of OS and mitochondrial TERT in the progression and therapeutic resistance of PTC. OS and TERT subcellular localization will be investigated in 150 PTCs and correlated to the genetic and expression profile of the tumors and to the clinical and prognostic features of the patients. Mechanisms implicated in TERT mitochondrial migration and the contribution of mitochondrial TERT to tumor progression will be investigated in cancer cell lines and primary cell cultures. This study will allow to identify OS as a marker of therapeutic resistance in PTC and will open new opportunities for the development of novel treatments targeting ROS generation/TERT nuclear export.",

        "summary": "Despite technical advances in Medically Assisted Reproduction (AMP), the success of fertility treatments is sometimes limited by embryo implantation failure. The coordinated development of the embryo and the uterine endometrium requires close communication between the maternal tissue and the embryo. In in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer generally takes place between the 2nd (D2) and the 6th (D6) day following oocyte fertilization. Recent studies have shown the advantages of sequential transfer (transfer of an embryo on D2/D3 followed by the transfer of another embryo on D5/D6), with higher implantation and clinical pregnancy rate, fewer miscarriages, more live births, and yet no increase in multiple pregnancies. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations continue to prioritize the transfer of a single embryo for all patients aged under 38. To improve pregnancy rates for patients having a single embryo transferred, the study investigators wish to carry out on blank transfer, based on the principle of sequential transfer. The study investigators hypothesize that a culture medium, placed in the uterus before the time of embryo transfer, will modify immune tolerance. The study will test whether transferring the same culture medium in an equivalent quantity as during the real transfer into the uterus 2/3 days before the embryo transfer will improve tolerance to this foreign medium and, therefore, embryo implantation. The aim of this study is thus to evaluate the impact of a blank transfer with culture medium alone, on the results of frozen embryo transfers (FET) from IVF.",

MN can be fabricated from a variety of materials, preferably biocompatible polymers. Maltose, a natural carbohydrate, is a safe and biocompatible product that can be fabricated into MNs that are biodegradable and soluble within several minutes. Besides, local anaesthetic agents such as lignocaine can be impregnated within the MN matrix, facilitating its transdermal delivery more efficiently which results in enhanced efficacy. So far, maltose MN efficacy in enhancing the transdermal drug delivery (TDD) of lignocaine and thus reducing the pain experienced by healthy patients requiring intravenous cannulation prior to routine eye surgeries (phacoemulsification, trabeculectomy etc) has not been extensively studied. Hence, the objectives of this research are: 1) To evaluate the safety profile of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch as a means of pain reduction in adult patients requiring routine vein-puncturing procedures; 2) To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lignocaine in the systemic circulation when the transdermal lignocaine delivery is enhanced through microneedle usage; 3) To compare the efficacy of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch with standard 5% Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) dermal patch for pain reduction during venepuncture procedure based on mean changes in VAS scores and skin algesimeter index (pharmacodynamic (PD) study).",

        "summary": "The most recent evidence showed that the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019, National Institutes of Health) pandemic caused an increase in low back pain (LBP) prevalence and intensity among young people. This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time, next to reduced level of physical activity. Young people spend most of their time in a sitting position while studying (in school class, during homework) and using electronic devices (using the computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablets, or watching TV), and now using e-learning methods. E-learning, and thus prolonged sitting, is a topic that returned to higher education at the beginning of the 2022-2023 academic year because of the current energy crisis. Re-education on sitting posture is a common aspect of LBP management. Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat the negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Studies showed that sitting posture with the backrest on the chair induced minimal changes in lumbar lordosis and significantly lesser pain compared to other types of the chair. Even though the sitting posture will be followed by proper ergonomic principles, every position (lordotic or kyphotic) maintained for a prolonged time leads to discomfort and soft tissue symptoms. Studies showed that body perceived discomfort scores increased over time during sitting and after 30 min of sitting is significantly greater than those at baseline. Currently, breaks are recommended for mitigating the adverse of prolonged sitting, but more evidence is needed to verify effectiveness of breaks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP. Optimal combination of sitting and breaks will help to develop ergonomic recommendations for young people. Main research outcomes - exercise protocol and intervention - will be developed to match the needs of young people with LBP and the possibilities of the environment, in order to reduce LBP and musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting, and consequently, maintain health and quality of life. The intervention will address the social and health needs of a particular social group: young people, with the possibility of extending the recommendations to other groups.",

However, I can provide an explanation for each criterion:\n\nGoal Alignment:\nThis criterion assesses whether the goals described in the generated summary align with the goals mentioned in the groundtruth summary. A score of 0 would indicate that the goals are completely different, while a score of 1 would suggest that the goals have partial overlap or similarity.\n\nPatient Recruiting Method:\nThis criterion evaluates the similarity between the methods of patient recruitment described in the generated summary and the groundtruth summary. A score of 0 would mean that the recruitment methods are entirely different, while a score of 1 would indicate some similarity, but not an exact match.\n\nStudy Arm Consistency:\nThis criterion assesses the consistency between the descriptions of the study arms in the generated summary and the groundtruth summary. A score of 0 would suggest that the descriptions are completely different, while a score of 1 would indicate some overlap in the descriptions.\n\nConclusion Similarity:\nThis criterion evaluates the similarity between the conclusions drawn in the generated summary and the groundtruth summary. A score of 0 would mean that the conclusions are completely different, while a score of 1 would suggest that the conclusions are somewhat similar but not identical.\n\nWithout a generated summary, I cannot provide specific scores. However, the format for summarizing the scores would be:\n\nGoal Alignment: [0 or 1], Patient Recruiting Method: [0 or 1], Study Arm Consistency: [0 or 1], Conclusion Similarity: [0 or 1]"
