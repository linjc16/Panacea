        "model_output": "=================\n\nThe study aims to identify specific clusters of variables that are specific to the onset and maintenance of chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia. The hypothesis is that specific psychological factors (clusters of high number of early traumatic events, high levels of central sensitization, and specific traits and defense mechanisms) characterize FM, CM, and VU groups compared to controls. The study will involve the administration of a protocol of self-report questionnaires consisting of two parts: the main (about 25 minutes for the administration) and the optional one (additional 20 minutes). The primary outcome measures will be central sensitivity index, traumatic experiences index, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, and environmental sensitivity. The secondary outcome measures will be presence and intensity of psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychosomatics, physical and psychological quality of life index, alexithymic traits, perceived social support, sexual satisfaction, genital pain, and sexual functioning."
