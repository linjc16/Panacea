The main questions it aims to answer are: What are the differences in changes in heart rate variability modulation between chronic renal patients who undergo conventional physical exercise before and during hemodialysis sessions, and those who engage in virtual environment exercise? How does the virtual environment influence changes in heart rate variability modulation compared to conventional exercise in chronic renal patients before and during hemodialysis sessions? Group A will participate in 10 interventions, each intervention consisting of playing 3 rounds of a Virtual Reality game lasting 5 minutes, totaling 15 minutes of exercise. Group B will participate in 10 interventions, each intervention consisting of 15 minutes of physical exercise on a cycle ergometer, referred to here as conventional exercise. After the initial 10 interventions,there will be a 1-week washout period and the groups will switch. Heart rate and respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, systemic blood pressure, laboratory tests, as well as the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form questionnaire, the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventory, and the International Physical Activity Questionnaire will be assessed in all groups."

There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without (including reduced diversity, decreased prevalence of beneficial and increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria) but there are only a handful of small scale studies exploring the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Hypothesis and Objectives: This pilot study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including: Patients who develop complications of gallstone disease(including but not limited to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis and gallstone ileus) following diagnosis and Patients who develop post-operative complications including short (hospital stay, wound healing etc) and intermediate (development of post-cholecystectomy diarrhoea) outcomes. Design and Methods: A prospective cohort design will be used to collect data from 75 adult patients presenting to East Kent University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Hospitals with newly diagnosed gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging investigations. Data will be collected from electronic patient records including clinical history and diagnostic investigations, anthropometry, blood and imaging results (if taken as part of routine clinical care) for the initial presentation and subsequent readmissions/planned follow-up timepoints. Stool samples will be collected from patients either during admission or at home at each timepoint. Patients will also be asked to provide a 3 day food diary card Patients will have a sample collected at time of diagnosis and then at 6 monthly intervals whilst awaiting cholecystectomy. A pre-operative sample will be required within 6 weeks of any surgical intervention. Following cholecystectomy an immediate post-operative sample (within the first week) will be collected as well as a sample at"

        "model_output": "[/INST] The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as tight muscle bands, trigger points, and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker)."

Some NLP techniques adapted for children include: (1) Anchoring involves linking a particular emotional or sensory state with a physical stimulus, such as a touch or a visual cue. For example, a teacher might use a specific gesture or word to help a child feel more confident before a test. (2) Reframing: This technique involves helping a child see a situation or problem differently. For example, a teacher might help a child reframe a difficult math problem as a fun challenge. And (3) Meta-modeling: This technique involves helping children become more aware of their language patterns and the language patterns of others, which can improve communication skills and self-awareness."

Characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter k\u1d62\u2092*V differs in the tumor versus (vs) normal brain. Researchers will assess the validity of aMRI as a metabolic imaging approach via direct comparison with a standard metabolic imaging approach, \u00b9\u2078FDG PET. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Post-gadolinium (Gd) T1 MRI will be used to distinguish the contrast-enhancing ring region indicating the metabolically active tumor periphery from the less viable and/or necrotic tumor core. The utility of aMRI to differentially assess the metabolically active tumor periphery and necrotic core regions will be determined and compared to that of \u00b9\u2078FDG PET (SUVmax). II. Characterize how the metabolic aMRI parameter k\u1d62\u2092*V differs in the various normal appearing brain sub-regions unaffected by tumor, in comparison to \u00b9\u2078FDG PET. EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE: I. To compare how the aMRI metabolic parameter k\u1d62\u2092*V within disease lesions changes with different disease types, their disease stage, and their treatment status. OUTLINE: Patients receive \u00b9\u2078FDG IV, then 60 minutes later undergo simultaneous MRI and PET scanning. During this scanning period, patients will receive gadoterate meglumine IV to obtain post-contrast MRI. Total scanning time will take 45-60 minutes."

Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical therapy has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet therapy is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissue, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this type of physical therapy are based on the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this type of physical therapy are based on the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body.

This period of interest corresponds to the period of empirical antibiotic therapy (=within 3 days before report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing) and the period of directed antibiotic therapy (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing). A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out by varying the time window for broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing around the date of the antibiotic susceptibility testing result, up to a maximum of 7 days before and 14 days after.\nThe secondary endpoints will include the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, and the characteristics of the GPs.\nThe study will also include the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing GPs, antibiogram, and antibiogram, and narrow-spectrum, and antibiogram, and treatment.\nThe study will be a clear and treatment.
