This decision stems from the realization of the length of the protocol, to increase the collection of data in pursuit of the main objective of the study (cluster analysis).\nThe study involves the administration of a protocol of self-report questionnaires consisting of two parts: the main (about 25 minutes for the administration) and the optional one (additional 20 minutes).
