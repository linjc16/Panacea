In the same report, it was stated that there are approximately 26 thousand children aged 19 and under with T1DM in Turkey. T1DM, whose treatment and management is complex, causes both children and their parents to encounter many problems. These problems cause deterioration in quality of life and perceived well-being in children with T1DM. The problems experienced in this direction, adaptation problems and decreased quality of life lead to deterioration of metabolic control in children with T1DM. Children with T1DM who cannot adapt to their disease may have acute and chronic complications that lead to deterioration of metabolic control. One of the most important complications seen in children with T1DM is osteopenia, which tends to increase gradually. Proper nutrition, physical activity, insulin therapy and follow-up of complications have an important place in preventing complications that may develop in children with T1DM, ensuring metabolic control and increasing their quality of life. Exercise in T1DM; reducing the need for insulin and increasing its effect, providing blood glucose control, increasing muscle strength, providing weight control, increasing body fat and muscle mass, increasing body fluid ratio, increasing bone mineralization, positively affecting the cardiovascular system, reducing blood fats, increasing self-conditioning, It provides many benefits such as increasing confidence and reducing stress. Despite the numerous benefits of exercise, studies have shown that children with T1DM do not exercise regularly and do not want to do traditional (walking, running, cycling, swimming, etc.) exercises. In this direction, exercise that requires continuity in diabetes management can be made dynamic for children with T1DM by using different approaches.

The control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their gestational age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations.\nThe primary endpoint is the rate of CPAP/NIS weaning failure. Secondary endpoints include the rate of BPD, length of hospital stay, use of postnatal steroids, use of antibiotics, rate of re-intubation, total duration of positive pressure respiratory support, total time of supplemental oxygen, number of participants experiencing pul"

The questionnaires were developed based on variables used in clinical practice. The committee agreed that the scale needed to meet four objectives: (i) be composed of variables used by physical therapists working in the hospital; (ii) have valid content for hospitalized adult patients; (iii) be viable; and (iv) have inter-examiner reliability. In the first meeting, every committee member was asked to report relevant variables. After that, the committee was asked to classify each informed variable as unimportant, important, or essential for the physical therapy assessment to provide quality care to the patient during hospitalization. The validity of this construct was performed using the Delphi technique, and the consensus was defined with a minimum percentage of at least 75% agreement as important or essential.

These outcomes are dependent on disease burden and patient characteristics and independent of treatment modality. Significant treatment related side effects exist despite advances in radiotherapy technology, surgical techniques, and supportive care. In addition to common acute toxicities, their favorable overall survival potentially places these patients at increased risk for developing long-term treatment-induced side-effects. Therefore, it is important to establish novel management approaches that maintain excellent current clinical outcomes while effectively reducing acute and long-term side effects. The de-escalation trials for surgical management have explored various combinations of dose-reduction, while preserving favorable oncologic outcomes for patients. Prospective trials have demonstrated efficacy, safety, and functional benefit following treatment reduction to the primary tumor, regional lymph node metastasis, and the elective nodal volume. Therefore, newer approaches of combining the treatment modifications from each of these treatment fields offer the potential to have substantial harm reduction for future patients. Cell free HPV tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a method to monitor the presence of disease and is a promising biomarker. Changes in expression of ctDNA post treatment with TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) or radiation therapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy are observed and clearance of ctDNA is associated with a favorable prognosis. These promising findings have led several groups to initiate clinical trials evaluating observation in patients after definitive oropharyngeal cancer removal and subsequent clearance of ctDNA levels. Data suggests that patients who initially undergo observation following TORS have similar rates of distant metastases and favorable rates of salvage. To date, an observation-based approach has not been adopted for intermediate risk patients due to challenges identifying optimal cohorts for observation and concern for increased treatment related toxicity for patients who do require salvage. In this trial, the investigators propose use of ctDNA clearance to identify patients who are optimal for observation post-TORS.

This improvement in treatment outcomes is accompanied by significant risk for toxicities such a neutropenia and subsequent infections which themselves can be life-threatening. Several studies indicate a high symptom burden and poor health-related quality of life for individuals with multiple myeloma, with most of what is known from clinical trials of highly selective populations or qualitative studies conducted outside of the US among mostly white patients. These factors, coupled with the rapidly changing multiple myeloma treatment landscape, limits the generalizability to wider population as well as an understanding of MM's impact across the disease course.

Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and non-ablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics.

We retrospectively analyzed the data of 10,000 adult sepsis patients from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC IV) database. The primary outcome was the occurrence of SALD. The secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality. We first used the MIMIC IV database to assess the correlation between APRI and the occurrence of SALD using association analysis. We then validated these results using our own data. The results showed that elevated initial APRI value was associated with the development of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. Our study suggests that APRI may be a useful biomarker for predicting SALD in patients with sepsis. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings."

Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as taught muscle bands, trigger points (TPs), and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a common neurological condition that occurs when blood collects between the brain and the inner skull. It is often seen in elderly patients who have suffered a head injury. The condition can cause a variety of symptoms, including headaches, confusion, and weakness on one side of the body. In some cases, cSDH can lead to permanent brain damage.\nThe standard treatment for cSDH is surgical removal of the blood clot. However, some patients do not improve after surgery. In fact, some patients get worse. The reason for this is not well understood.\nRecently, researchers have discovered a phenomenon called spreading depolarization (SD). SD is a wave of electrical activity that sweeps across the surface of the brain. It is thought to be involved in a number of neurological conditions, including epilepsy and migraines.\nSome researchers believe that SD may be responsible for the neurological deficits that occur after cSDH surgery. To test this theory, they are using a technique called electroencephalography (EEG) to look for SD in patients with cSDH. EEG is a non-invasive test that records the electrical activity of the brain.\nIf SD is found to be responsible for neurological deficits after cSDH surgery, then new treatments can be developed to prevent or treat SD. This could lead to better outcomes for patients with cSDH."

The incidence of CRC increases with age, and the majority of patients with CRC are 75 years or older. In this age group, the 5-year survival rate is 60-70%, and the main cause of death is disease recurrence.\nThe standard treatment of colon cancer is surgical resection of the tumor with a margin of healthy tissue. The surgery is associated with a risk of complications and a reduced functional capacity in the postoperative period. This is especially the case in elderly patients, who often have other age-related diseases.\nIn the SPARCOL study, we investigate whether the new surgical method Combined Endoscopic Laparoscopic Surgery (CELS) can be an organ-preserving alternative to standard surgery in elderly patients with early colon cancer.\nCELS is a hybrid procedure that enables large local excisions of the colon without segmental resection while under general anaesthesia. In our study, CELS refers only to endoscopic assisted laparoscopic resection.\nThe main surgical advantage in this procedure is the ability to view the colon intra- and extraluminal simultaneously. The laparoscopic approach enables manipulation and mobilization of the colon, while the endoscopic view secures that the resection is complete and not overlapping the ileal valve or creating stenosis.\nCompared to the traditional oncological colon resection, the CELS resection is a minimally invasive procedure - organ sparing procedure leading to a reduced surgical stress response.\nThe aim of the SPARCOL study is to investigate whether CELS can reduce the negative effects of surgery in elderly patients with early colon cancer.\nThe study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with 1:1 randomization. The study population consists of patients aged 75 years or older with early colon cancer. The primary endpoint is postoperative recovery measured by the Quality of Recovery 15 (QoR-15) questionnaire.

The core symptoms of ASD are present from early childhood and can have a significant impact on daily functioning and quality of life. While the exact cause of ASD is not fully understood, it is believed to be a result of a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\nPsychoanalysis is a form of psychotherapy that focuses on unconscious motivations and conflicts. It has been used to treat a variety of mental health disorders, including ASD. However, the use of psychoanalysis in the treatment of ASD is controversial, and there is limited research on its effectiveness.\nThis case study aims to explore the use of psychoanalysis in the treatment of ASD. The study will focus on a single case study of a 40-year-old man with ASD. The participant will receive psychoanalysis as part of his treatment. The study will use a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative data.\nThe study will use a variety of measures to assess the participant's progress, including clinical interviews, questionnaires, and physiological measures. The study will also use qualitative data, such as session recordings and the therapist's notes, to gain a deeper understanding of the participant's experience of psychoanalysis.\nThe study will be conducted over a period of 90 days. The participant will receive psychoanalysis twice a week during this time.

Considering the current scale of the recent earthquakes in T\u00fcrkiye, implementing and disseminating evidence-based psychosocial interventions, especially trauma-focused treatment approaches such as Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), is crucial in order to respond to the increasing mental health needs of the earthquake survivors. CPT is a cognitive behavioral treatment for PTSD consisting of 12 one-hour sessions. CPT is delivered in three phases: education, processing, and challenging. The manualized treatment focuses on challenging beliefs and assumptions related to the trauma, oneself, and the world. Randomized clinical trials have revealed that CPT is an effective treatment for PTSD and other comorbid conditions in a variety of civilian trauma populations. The study will be designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial, and the potential effectiveness of individual CPT will be tested compared to the Enhanced-Care as Usual (E-CAU) control group. CPT will be implemented on Zoom, which is an online platform with HIPAA compliance. After the baseline assessment, 30 eligible participants will be randomized to two arms: in either the CPT (n =15) or only the control group (E-CAU; n=15). The first session will take place no longer than one week after the pre-intervention assessment. The post-intervention assessment through the same measures will be scheduled six weeks after the pre-intervention assessment (i.e., one week after the 12th CPT session). The follow-up assessment will be conducted one month after the post-assessment. All study participants, including dropouts, will be invited to all outcome assessments.

The most common ablation strategy is pulmonary vein isolation (PVI), which is aimed at electrical isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) from the left atrium (LA). However, PVI is successful in terminating AF in only 20-50% of patients. The most common reason for PVI failure is re-conduction between the LA and the PVs due to gaps in the ablation lesion.

This procedure is typically performed under sedation and local anesthesia. After coiling, patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring.\nNeurochecks are a standard part of care for patients in the ICU after aneurysm coiling. These are brief neurological examinations performed by nurses or physicians to assess the patient's neurological status. Neurochecks are typically performed every hour. However, there is no evidence that this frequency is necessary. In fact, frequent awakening may disrupt sleep and contribute to delirium, which is common in ICU patients.\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the impact of hourly neurochecks to every-other-hour neurochecks on sleep in patients after aneurysm coiling. We hypothesize that patients who have neurochecks every-other-hour will have improved sleep quality compared to patients who have hourly neurochecks.\nThis is a randomized controlled trial.

Subjective measures include questionnaires that assess sleep quality and daytime sleepiness.\nThe results of this study will help to determine the optimal frequency of neurochecks in patients after aneurysm coiling.

DFO, which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone sample for culture which is underused in clinical practice for various reasons including lack of availability, cost, and delay. To overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind bone biopsy procedure performed by a physician at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB procedure is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO.

Instead, families are more likely to be labeled as difficult if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians' recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment, and healthcare institutional contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism.\nOur research group began to address this need with 'African American Community Speaks', a proof-of-concept prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illnesses. The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US.

Evolution of oral sexual practices seems to be one of the explanations for the progression of these cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and oral cavity HPV positive. Some studies show a difference in the expression of certain genes within the two groups of tumors (HPV+ and HPV-) including some that confer sensitivity to certain chemotherapies (CCND1, TYMS) and others to radiotherapy (RBBP4). However, patients with HPV+ Head and Neck cancers are treated according to the same referential as HPV- Head and Neck cancers. There is therefore a real need for studies identifying predictive markers in order to be able to offer patients a more effective suitable and less invasive treatment.

The Convergent validity will be assessed by comparing the VAS to the French version of the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WASAS), the Maslach Burn-out Inventory (MBI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Job Demand-Control-Support (JDSC) questionnaire, the Effort-Reward Imbalance Questionnaire (ERI), the Work Addiction Risk Test (WART) and the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (MSQ). The Discriminant validity will be assessed by comparing the VAS to the sociodemographic and work characteristics. The Known-Groups validity will be assessed by comparing the VAS between the three groups of workers defined by the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaire (satisfaction group vs dissatisfaction group, high well-being group vs low well-being group). The investigators will also assess the reliability of the VAS. The investigators will conduct a first measurement (T0) and a second measurement (T1) one week later. The investigators will also assess the convergent validity of the VAS in a sub-sample of 100 volunteers by comparing the VAS to the WASAS, MBI, HADS, JDSC, ERI, WART and MSQ questionnaires."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nColorectal cancer is a common digestive tract tumor in China. At present, laparoscopic surgery has become the classic operation of colorectal cancer surgery compared with the traditional open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) refer to the clinical abnormal changes in the lungs after surgery, These include lung infections (pneumonia), atelectasis, pleural effusion, bronchospasm, acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%. The reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications. Numerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning has been used for more than 40 years to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of the positive physiological effects of prone positioning on transpulmonary pressure, lung compression and ventilation perfusion ratio, it has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. Currently, the mechanisms of prone position training are decreased lung compression in the gravity dependant zone,homogenisation of transpulmonary pressure, improvement of ventilation/perfusion ratio, and reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) or patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). By placing the patient in the prone position, the lungs compression due to its own weight is reduced via"

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required. Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments. However, we are still in the dark about the amount of functional recovery of geriatric post-COVID patients. We do know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious. Before being able to assure the best outcomes for older post-COVID geriatric rehabilitation patients, we first have to be informed about what the clinical characteristics are, what treatment is provided, and what outcomes geriatric post-COVID-19 patients have in geriatric rehabilitation.

Several retention systems are available. These retention systems can be roughly divided into bar-retained IODs, in which multiple implants are splinted and the overdenture is attached through retentive clips, and into retention systems using non-splinted solitary attachments. Bar-retained IODs provide good retention, require little maintenance, but are more expensive than solitary attachments. Medium term results of bar-retained IODs are promising with high implant and overdenture survival and low incidence of complications and may be considered the gold standard. Solitary attachments serve as an alternative to bars. These attachments are more economical and are easy to clean by the patient, but wear more easily, which can cause lack of retention. However, replacement of these attachments can often be done chair side. A recent review reported that, when a maxillary IOD is supported by four implants, both types show equal implant survival, overdenture survival and patient satisfaction. However, these conclusions are based on a limited amount of randomized controlled trials. Moreover, most studies reporting on solitary attachments were retrospective. Evidence on maxillary IOD attachment systems has been mostly short to medium term, non-comparing or retrospective and therefore inconclusive. This underlines the need for studies comparing different attachment systems with a longer follow-up. The study design is an observational study to compare treatment outcomes of fully edentulous patients with maxillary IODs, supported by four implants, retained by either bars or Locators. Patients were treated 10 years ago with dental implants and an overdenture in the maxilla because of problems with retention and stability with their conventional denture. Outcomes: primary outcome is the change in marginal peri-implant bone level 10 years after placing the overdenture. Secondary outcome measures will be implant and overdenture survival, peri-implant mucosa health and patients' satisfaction using a questionnaire."

Important differential diagnosis are benign functional disorders of the esophagus such as is functional heartburn or functional dysphagia. Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. The results are inconsistent: In younger patients (18 - 40 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) the prevalence of anxiety and depression is higher than in those without GERD. There is an independent association between GERD, anxiety and current depression. Patients with anxiety are more likely to experience GERD symptoms and these symptoms seem to be more severe in anxious patients. Anxiety and depression intensify symptom perception. Patients with GERD have a higher incidence of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances than those without GERD, and there is an association between psychosocial disorders and an increased risk of anxiety. Thus, there is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders, which has been discussed as the psychoemotional effects of GERD. GERD is considered to be an independent source of stress.

Patients with bronchiectasis suffer of chronic cough and sputum production, and are predisposed to recurrent airway infections. Many systemic diseases can cause bronchiectasis: cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiencies (PID) and idiopathic bronchiectasis (IB) represent a significant proportion of patients with bronchiectasis starting in early age.\nPulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. The improvement in FEV1 after inhalation of bronchodilators can be attributed to bronchodilation or improved mucociliary clearance. It can be speculated that for some of the bronchiectasis patients, hyper-reactive airways or asthma can contribute to the reversible pattern.\nDespite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations.\nAccording to ATS/ERS statement, the proper way to determine BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered a positive BDR.\nWhile in most scenarios it is reasonable to assume that the change in FEV1 measured after the waiting time can be attributed solely to the affect of bronchodilators, this is not necessarily the case in bronchiectasis.

Rehabilitation delivered by a multi-disciplinary team including Allied Health Professionals (occupational therapists [OT's], physiotherapists [PT's], and speech and language therapists [SLT's]) is known to improve functional recovery after stroke, particularly if it can be applied intensively and within enriched, stimulating environments. However, a large gap exists between the minimum recommendations for stroke rehabilitation (three hours of multidisciplinary therapy a day, at least 5 days out of 7) and what the NHS are currently able to provide, given the majority of in-patient stroke units are operating below the staffing levels recommended in national clinical guidelines, and are therefore challenged to provide the amount of therapy to facilitate optimum recovery for stroke patients. Commercially available technology, such as robotics, adapted treadmills, virtual reality, and mobile digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors, have been shown to be a safe and feasible method of increasing rehabilitation intensity, under the prescription and supervision of therapy staff. It can be used to enhance usual therapy and can allow stroke patients to work on physical, cognitive, visual, and communication goals, without one-to-one or 'hands on' treatment from a therapist.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIschemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells. Patients with acute ischemic stroke included in the study will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline were given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The investigators evaluate whether sodium valproate can improve clinical outcomes and increase peripheral CD177+ neutrophil levels."

As a response to this demand, there is an understanding that these approaches need to be integrated in cancer care. In 90% of large comprehensive cancer centers in the US and in many others in Europe and elsewhere, complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) is being integrated into supportive patient care. In Israel similar trend is observed and 8 integrative oncology services has been established around the country in the majority of oncology centers. Homeopathy is one of the CIM modalities utilized by patients with cancer. It is widely practiced worldwide, especially in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, during the 1990s, sales of homeopathic medicines grew at an annual rate of 20-25%, and in the 2015 US National health statistics report, homeopathy was mentioned as used by over 5 million people. This modality involves detailed interview that emphasizes the unique characteristics of symptoms experienced by patients followed by utilizing highly diluted substances. Dilutions that are above 12c (dilution of 10-24 actually do not have the original substance), which are commonly used in homeopathy, reflect that the original material is not in this remedy. As a result of this understanding this complementary therapy remains one of the debated modalities in CIM. Some mention that patients seek that method of care due to the fact that this approach emphasizes empathic listening to patients' concerns and worries, and the effect of the actual remedy, due to its high dilution, reflect a placebo response. On the other hand, some clinical studies reveal that the use of homeopathy in cancer care, as a supportive approach, reflects clinical benefit that is not attributed to placebo, without risk of side effects or interactions with the conventional oncology approach.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPostoperative radiotherapy is widely practiced and highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety.

Hyperlipidemia is characterized as the overproduction of very low density cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (i.e. bad cholesterol) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) (i.e. good cholesterol). Amongst individuals with mild to moderate hyperlipidemia, lifestyle changes is the first treatment option, such as a healthy diet. Therefore, seeking to develop food-based approaches for hyperlipidemia therapy is a timely endeavour. Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive option, as it is a spice throughout the world which possesses medicinal properties in regulating human nutrient metabolism. In a recent review of the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperlipidemia in humans with diabetes and prediabetes, this analysis suggested that fenugreek has total cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The effects of fenugreek on triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol showed a trend towards reduction and an incremental trend for HDL-cholesterol but needed further confirmation. The effect of fenugreek in human subjects with hyperlipidaemia without diabetes has not been investigated.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIntroduction: Panoramic radiography is an extra-oral imaging technique and is considered an effective, fast, and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tool to examine dentofacial structures. Various errors such as open lips, shifted or tilted head position, inappropriate exposure parameters, movement of the patients, etc., have been reported for panoramic imaging, which reduce the quality of the images. The low quality of the radiographic images can result in misinterpretation by dentists, eventually leading to incorrect treatment plans. In addition, panoramic imaging errors ultimately can cause the repetition of radiography. Thus, numerous studies have highlighted the necessity of minimising medical and dental diagnostic radiation exposure as much as possible. Patient positional errors have been identified as the most frequent panoramic imaging errors, with some studies suggesting this is the case for nearly 95 percent of reported errors. Thus, it is suggested that all dental radiography staff receive regular training focused on correct positioning techniques and reduction of patient movement. The typical patient positioning errors in panoramic radiography include failure to rest the tongue against the palate, head positioned forward, head positioned backward, head twisted towards the left or right, head tilted to the left or right, the chin too high, the chin too low, a slumped position and inadequate neck extension, not resting the chin on the chin support, failing to use the bite guide, lips opened, patient movement during imaging and not removing the metal objects or prostheses. Among all the positional errors mentioned above, the most common error is the failure to hold the tongue against the palate. Due to the failure of holding the tongue against the palate, the palatoglossal airspace (PGA) appears in panoramic radiographs as a dark radiolucent band under the hard palate and on the apices of the anterior maxillary teeth. This artefact significantly reduces the quality of the panoramic radiograph as it may be difficult or impossible to interpret the desired periapical region for correct diagnosis and treatment planning (for example, making it difficult to interpret cystic lesions in the anterior area of the upper jaw). Also, when PGA falls on the ramus of the mandible, it may be mistaken for a fracture. PGA may be seen unilaterally and asymmetrically as a localised radiolucent area if"

The international epidemiological study (2016) reported a mortality rate of 35-46% for ARDS, and this is very high mortality compared to other ICU diseases. Furthermore, ARDS survivors present with many functional impairments, including physical, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunction (Post Intensive Care Syndrome, PICS), and their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of Life (QOL) are impaired and many other functional impairments have been pointed out. Their inability to get their original life has attracted significant research attention and become a significantly important research topic. Many patients who are unable to return to work due to functional disability require nursing care, and there is concern about the increased burden on the patient, the family supporting the patient, and the social economy. Therefore, the development of effective strategies for patients with ARDS that take into account not only mortality but also functional prognosis is strongly needed. Recent studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume and airway pressure control), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, noninvasive mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have improved outcomes, including mortality, in patients with ARDS. However, the mortality of patients with ARDS is still as high as 40%. In addition, the complete reintegration ratio of patients with ARDS after 1 year of hospital discharge reported in 2003 was only 50%, and recent reports have shown little progress in this aspect. Strategies to improve outcomes (mortality and functional prognosis) of ARDS patients by improving not only treatment but also the quality of ICU care have become a hot topic in recent years.

Interestingly, although the incidence of indolent (latent) PCa is very similar throughout the globe, there is a remarkable global age-adjusted incidence variation (up to 40-fold difference between highest and lowest incidences). Epidemiological data suggest that aging in men is associated with neoplastic processes in the prostate but only a subset of men will develop a true malignancy potentially affecting their life-span or quality of life. Genetic factors have a significant effect on PCa risk, but very likely life-style (e.g. diet and physical activity) affect PCa risk as well, but the mechanisms mediating protective or harmful effects of life-style remain unclear. Gut microbiota, i.e. the collection of microbes colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, is acknowledged to play significant role in many metabolic pathways and pathogenic processes in the human body. Although there is some evidence suggesting that gut microbiota affects therapy responses (especially androgen deprivation) in PCa, it \u0301s potential role in prostate carcinogenesis is not well documented.

The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults.\nBackground: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention.\nPreliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIn individuals with type 1 diabetes, adjusting insulin doses to accommodate the ever-changing conditions of daily life is crucial for achieving satisfactory metabolic control. To address this challenge, researchers have developed an Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system, commonly known as an artificial pancreas. This system comprises of an insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor, and a sophisticated control algorithm. The algorithm uses CGM data to calculate the insulin dose required to maintain good glycemic control, and it automatically commands the insulin infusion. However, artificial pancreas systems can experience malfunctions, some of which are highly risky. The most dangerous malfunctions include insulin pump failures and infusion set occlusions, which lead to prolonged interruptions in insulin delivery. This exposes the patient to the risk of hyperglycemia and, even more dangerously, ketoacidosis, a severe complication that can result in hospitalization and, in severe cases, death. Unfortunately, patients do not always notice these issues in a timely manner. This study aims to test new algorithms for detecting pump/infusion set malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery. The study consists of three phases: Phase 1: Preliminary Data Collection (Free-living Data) In this phase, data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions are collected. This data is obtained from a download form the patient's artificial pancreas. The one-month session is designed to gather a substantial amount of patient-specific data to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals impact the patient's glycemia as recorded by the CGM sensor. During this phase, the patient continues to use their artificial pancreas in their daily life. Phase 2: Induction of Hyperglycemia The second phase involves the patient visiting the clinic, where, according to a specific protocol and a defined schedule, insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump malfunction. The resulting episode of hyperglycemia is closely monitored under medical supervision. At the end of the experiment, the study team assists the patient in restoring euglycemia before returning home. Phase 3: Retrospective Data Analysis In this phase,"

In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBipolar disorder is a chronic illness characterised by periods of illness and recovery, which can cause significant psychosocial impairment and disability. It affects more than 1% of the world population regardless of demographic characteristics such as ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status and is one of the leading causes of global disability. Bipolar disorder can cause serious cognitive and functional impairments and maintaining life with this disorder involves some difficulties for the individual. Functional impairments such as deterioration in family relationships, problems in work life and incompatibilities in social relationships negatively affect both the well-being and quality of life of the individual. Many individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder have functional disorders that can cause low quality of life. Quality of life is recognised as an important outcome measure for the effectiveness of treatment of mental disorders. Compared to healthy individuals, the quality of life of patients with bipolar disorder is significantly impaired in both the euthymic and symptomatic periods. The ability to cope with difficulties is assumed to be a protective factor for quality of life. However, individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are exposed to more stressful events due to their illness and experience coping problems, including in the euthymic period. For these reasons, developing coping skills is among the targets in the treatment process of bipolar disorder. The stress coping strategies of these individuals may even affect the risk of suicide. Bipolar disorder is a serious illness that causes increased mortality, including death by suicide. Approximately 10-20% of these individuals end their lives and approximately one third of these individuals attempt suicide at least once. Patients with bipolar disorder and previous suicide attempts have a worse quality of life. One of the most important factors associated with suicide and morbidity in bipolar disorder is impulsivity. Impulsivity, which can be defined as a predisposition to unplanned reactions to internal and external stimuli regardless of negative consequences and the absence of behavioural inhibition, is one of the clinical features of bipolar disorder. Although it is more common during manic episode, it can also be found in other mood phases. Bipolar disorder is characterised by high impulsivity even during recovery periods. Increased impulsivity is not only associated with suicide attempts but may also lead to functional impairment. Impulsive behaviours may cause long"

This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection.

The most important of these problems are re-injury anxiety, rehabilitation adherence, rehabilitation self-efficacy problems, and kinesiophobia. Although some interventions have been proposed for the solution of these problems, a structured intervention approach has not been put forward yet. With this research project, our aim is to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (CBT+VR) enriched with the contribution of virtual reality (VR), which the investigators prepared to intervene in psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. If the CBT+VR protocol is effective, it can be used to increase the quality of physical rehabilitation and therefore to ensure that the perceptions of athletes regarding their psychological outcomes about their return to sport are positive. CBT+VR protocol will be tested, and if it is found effective, it will make a significant contribution to both the literature and practice.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAdministration of intravenous fluids is one of the most commonly performed procedures in anaesthesia, critical care and emergency medicine. Intravenous fluids can be given to achieve specific goals depending on the type of fluid, but often, fluid is given simply to expand the intravascular volume. The volume-expanding effect of intravenous fluids is however time-dependent, and often of limited duration as fluid is distributed out of the intravascular space and eliminated mainly in the kidneys. The goal of intravascular volume expansion is to improve haemodynamic variables, such as SV, CO and ABP. The reasoning is that volume expansion increases SV mainly mediated by the Frank-Starling mechanism. The degree to which SV increases with volume expansion is termed fluid responsiveness.1 The increase in SV does however in most cases seem to be transient. The reason for the transient nature of the hemodynamic response is not known, but may be related to reduction in intravascular volume expansion as described above or other factors, such as vasodilation.\nCalculation of volume expansion: The volume-expanding effect of intravenous fluids has been studied by measuring concentration of hemoglobin. Under the assumption that hemoglobin is evenly distributed in, and does not leave the intravascular space, intravascular volume can be calculated and kinetic studies of the volume effect (volume kinetics) can be performed. Hb = intravascular amount of hemoglobin V0 = Intravascular volume at time 0 Vt = Intravascular volume at time t [Hb]0 = Hemoglobin concentration at time 0 [Hb]t = Hemoglobin concentration at time t Eq1: (Hb)o= Hb/Vo. Vo = Hb/(Hb)o Eq 2: (Hb)t= Hb/Vt. Vo = Hb/(Hb)t. Assuming that the amount of hemoglobin is constant, from Eq 1 ang Eq 2, it follows that: Eq 3: Vt_rel=Vt/V0=(Hb)o/(Hb)t which therefore gives the relative value of intravascular volume at time=t to compared to time=0; Vt_rel.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPulse oximetry is a non-invasive, reliable, and accurate method of measuring oxygen saturation in arterial blood. It is used in a variety of clinical settings, including anesthesia, intensive care, and home healthcare. However, the accuracy of pulse oximetry is dependent on the wavelengths of light used to detect oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin. The current pulse oximeters are calibrated for Caucasian skin tones, and thus are less accurate in patients with darker skin tones. This is due to the fact that melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color, absorbs light at the same wavelengths as hemoglobin. As a result, the signal-to-noise ratio is decreased, leading to less accurate readings.\nThe investigators have developed a novel pulse oximeter that uses three wavelengths of light to detect oxygen saturation. The device also includes a melanin sensor that measures the amount of melanin in the skin. The device uses this information to adjust the calibration of the pulse oximeter, allowing for more accurate readings in patients with darker skin tones.\nThe investigators aim to evaluate the accuracy of the novel pulse oximeter in patients with darker skin tones. The investigators will also assess the comfort and safety of the device.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the novel pulse oximeter will be more accurate in patients with darker skin tones.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHeart failure is a common condition with a high prevalence and a poor prognosis. The main symptoms of heart failure are fatigue and dyspnea, which are caused by a reduced cardiac output and an increased peripheral vascular resistance. In addition, patients with heart failure often have symptoms of volume overload, such as edema and dyspnea. Volume overload is caused by an imbalance between fluid intake and fluid excretion. In heart failure patients, the kidneys retain sodium and water, leading to an expansion of the extracellular fluid volume. The increased extracellular fluid volume causes an increase in venous pressure and a reduction in cardiac output. In addition, volume overload is associated with a reduced sensitivity to vasodilators and an increased peripheral vascular resistance.\nThe endothelial glycocalyx (GCX) is a gel-like structure that lines the inner wall of blood vessels. The GCX is composed of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), proteoglycans, and glycoproteins. The GCX plays an important role in maintaining vascular homeostasis. The GCX is responsible for the selective permeability of the vascular endothelium and regulates the interaction between blood components and the vascular wall. In heart failure patients, the GCX is degraded, leading to an increase in vascular permeability and a loss of endothelial function. The degradation of the GCX is caused by an increase in oxidative stress and inflammation. The degradation of the GCX is associated with an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and a reduction in cardiac output.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the degradation of the GCX contributes to the development of volume overload in heart failure patients.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCarpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compression neuropathy. CTS results from the compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The main symptoms include pain and other unpleasant sensations in hand and wrist. In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and other muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of manual performance. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) remain the method of choice in diagnosing CTS. However ultrasonography (US) is increasingly used along with or instead of NCS. Most frequently, the increase of the cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the inlet to the carpal tunnel is regarded as the marker of CTS. A number of other measurements such as median nerve mobility, volar bulging of flexor retinaculum and others were also studied to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In this study the investigators aim to assess the utility of measurements made at the point of the maximal stenosis of the median nerve in the tunnel to diagnose CTS. So far, there were only few studies, which visualized the maximal nerve stenosis, which is the essential pathological feature of CTS. In general, the group of patients with CTS and controls will undergo NCS of symptomatic median and ipsilateral ulnar nerves and US of the symptomatic median nerve with measurements of the cross-sectional area, diameter and echogenicity at various points, including the point of the maximal stenosis. The location of the maximal stenosis with respect to external (distal crease) and internal (wrist and hand bones and thenar musculature) will also be evaluated. Subjects will also be asked to fill out the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) and a demographic questionnaire. US measurements will be compared between patients and healthy volunteers. US measurements will be correlated among patients with clinical severity of CTS, reflected by the score in BCTQ and with the grade of electrophysiological severity as introduced by Padua et al. [1]."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAutologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is a standard treatment for multiple myeloma (MM). However, ASCT is often accompanied by a series of adverse reactions, including neurotoxicity, peripheral neuropathy, etc., which seriously affect the quality of life of patients. Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the activity of interleukin-6 (IL-6). It is widely used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Studies have shown that IL-6 is closely related to the occurrence of peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, we speculate that tocilizumab can reduce the incidence of peripheral neuropathy and other adverse reactions caused by ASCT. This study is a single-center, randomized, controlled, double-blind, phase II clinical trial. Patients with MM who are about to undergo ASCT will be randomly divided into two groups: tocilizumab group and control group. Patients in the tocilizumab group will receive tocilizumab (8mg/kg) at day -7 before transfusion of stem cells. Patients in the control group will receive the same volume of normal saline.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nInfertility is a common problem in couples who desire to have children. In approximately 50% of infertile couples, the male partner is the sole or main cause of infertility. In these men, the sperm cells have abnormalities in their shape, movement, or genetic material. These abnormalities can reduce the chance of pregnancy. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) is a common treatment for infertility caused by sperm abnormalities. In ICSI, a single sperm is injected directly into an egg to help the egg to fertilize. However, even with ICSI, the chance of pregnancy may be lower if the sperm has a high percentage of genetic abnormalities.\nOne way to improve the chance of pregnancy in these cases is to use sperm that has been separated to remove sperm with genetic abnormalities. This can be done using a technique called microfluidic sperm separation. In this technique, sperm is mixed with a liquid and passed through a small channel. The sperm with the best movement and shape are able to swim through the channel, while the sperm with abnormalities are trapped. The sperm that comes out of the other side of the channel is then used for ICSI.\nAnother way to obtain sperm for ICSI is through a procedure called testicular sperm extraction (TESA). In this procedure, sperm is directly extracted from the testicle. TESA is often used when there is a low sperm count or no sperm in the semen.\nIn this study, the investigators will compare the outcomes of ICSI using sperm that has been separated using microfluidic sperm separation (Zymot) with the outcomes of ICSI using sperm obtained through TESA in couples where the sperm has a high percentage of genetic abnormalities. The investigators will also compare the cost and the number of eggs that need to be injected in each case. The investigators hope that this study will help to improve the chance of pregnancy in couples where the sperm has a high percentage of genetic abnormalities."

Skill in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow to a given target in a certain time span with accuracy. The discipline is described as a three-phase (the stance, the drawing and the sighting) movement. Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and follow-through. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. An archer pushes the bow with an extended arm, which is statically held in the direction of the target, while the other arm exerts a dynamic pulling of the bowstring from the beginning of the drawing phase, until the release is dynamically executed. The release phase must be well balanced and highly reproducible to achieve commendable results in a competition. The bowstring is released when an audible impulse is received from a device called clicker that is used as a draw length check. Each arrow can be drawn to an exact distance and a standard release can be obtained using the device. The clicker is reputed to improve the archer's score and used by all target archers. The archer should react to the clicker as quickly as possible.

The baseline data will be obtained prior to the pacing implantation. Depending on the needs of the subject, the screening and implantation procedures may be performed on the same day.\nImplant data will include lead measurements, implant technique, and lead positioning. After completion of pacemaker implantation, subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or until lead failure (dislodgment, high capture threshold, or inadequate sensing requiring revision of the lead) or death. During follow-up, a determination will be made whether the system is able to provide appropriate pacing and sensing."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nRationale: Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). The investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs. An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy. In conclusion, nutritional intervention with high energy/high protein nutritional supplements, especially if enriched with nutrients known for their immune- or microbiome-modulation properties, may have a positive impact on several mechanisms underlying cachexia-induced PD-1 ICI efficacy impairment.\nObjective: The primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.\nStudy design: NutriCim is a feasibility study specifically designed to gather information on: (i) the rate of NSCLC patient recruit"

However, even with a positive PDL1 status, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy. In the KEYNOTE-024 study evaluating pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS \u226550%, the response rate in the pembrolizumab arm alone was 45%. This result led to the approval of pembrolizumab for first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS \u2265 50%, which nevertheless represents only 22% of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Early identification of biomarkers for patients unlikely to benefit from first-line pembrolizumab is therefore a crucial step in selecting suitable candidates. Furthermore, in cancer, genomic alterations in NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 result in constitutive activation of NRF2-dependent gene transcription, which promotes cellular resistance to oxidative stress, xenobiotic efflux, proliferation and metabolic reprogramming. Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 are found in 3.5-15% and 12-17% of NSCLC patients respectively. NFE2L2 is a transcription factor that directs the expression of free radical defense genes that may interfere with radiation-induced DNA damage. KEAP1 is an adaptor protein that targets NFE2L2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction as part of normal homeostasis. These new biomarkers are of clinical interest, as KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations predict radiation resistance in patients with localized NSCLC treated with radiotherapy but not surgery. Some data also suggest a role for the KEAP1/NFE2L2 axis in response to immunotherapy. Establishing a predictive model for the presence of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutation would provide a tool for predicting survival (progression-"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nWith the accelerated pace of the global aging society, the prevalence of degenerative diseases is increasing. At present, spinal degenerative diseases caused by body degeneration have become the most common type. With the continuous deepening of the research on spinal degenerative diseases and the continuous development, update and promotion of minimally invasive surgery technology and instruments, minimally invasive surgery has attracted more and more attention of spine surgeons due to its advantages of rapid recovery, small trauma and fewer complications. The core of endoscopic spinal surgery is nerve root decompression. The procedure is centered on the nerve roots, which can be damaged with the slightest carelessness. According to statistics, the incidence of nerve root injury under spinal endoscope is 1.8-2.5%. Most of the injuries include the stimulation and edema of the nerve root during the operation, which may lead to postoperative sensory retardation and motor weakness, which will damage the patient's physical function and reduce overall satisfaction. The intraoperative nerve exploration is time-consuming and critical, and the variability of the patient's nerve anatomy will also add difficulties to the operation. A real-time auxiliary intraoperative nerve identification technology is necessary. With the progress of optical technology, fluorescent-guided surgery has shown considerable prospects in assisting in identifying nerves. Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only fluorophore approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intraoperative near-infrared imaging. It can emit near-infrared light after being irradiated by excitation light, which has the characteristics of high penetration depth, low spontaneous fluorescence and high sensitivity.

The disease is common in the elderly and the number of patients is increasing with the aging population. The treatment is symptomatic and includes salt restriction, diuretics, ACE-inhibitors and cardiac drugs. In some patients the heart beat is irregular and the heart muscle is not activated in a coordinated way. This is called dyssynchrony and can be treated with a pacemaker called cardiac resynchronization therapy, CRT. CRT improves symptoms and survival in selected patients. However, the response to CRT is variable and it is difficult to predict who will benefit. The investigators have previously shown that the heart muscle of patients with heart failure is stiffer than normal. The investigators have also shown that the heart muscle of patients with heart failure is not activated in a coordinated way. The investigators now want to study whether CRT improves the stiffness and the coordinated activation of the heart muscle. The investigators will also study the blood vessels and blood cells to see if these are improved by CRT.

PROs are a powerful tool to bridge the gap between patients and clinical teams, amplifying the patient experience and improving communication between patients and clinicians. A seminal clinical trial was conducted in which weekly PRO symptom assessments with care team alerts led to reduced care utilization, improved quality of life, and lengthened overall survival among patients receiving active treatment for advanced solid tumors. Subsequent randomized trials have corroborated the quality of life and survival advantages of PRO monitoring in other cancer populations and practice settings. Real-world adherence to PRO monitoring is lower than in seminal clinical trials, with potential racial/ethnic disparities. Multilevel barriers to PRO implementation exist at the patient, clinician, practice, and system levels. While patient adherence to PRO monitoring in seminal trials ranged from 70 to 90 percent, real-world adherence is much lower and more variable. Moreover, compared to non-Hispanic White patients, Black and Hispanic patients were 9% and 4% less likely to complete PRO questionnaires, respectively, but more likely to report more severe symptoms. These results highlight that historically marginalized subgroups may benefit less from current methods of PRO administration, potentially reinforcing existing disparities in symptom management if not remediated. This will be the first study to apply behavioral economic strategies to align clinicians and patients in achieving sustained patient-level PRO adherence, and addresses limitations of current PRO approaches. Current approaches to PRO collection are limited by: (1) suboptimal clinician engagement, (2) encounter-based assessments which preclude longitudinal monitoring of PROs outside of the clinic, and (3) insufficient automated effectors actively linking reported symptoms with clinical response. This proposal addresses these limitations by employing behavioral strategies directly targeting clinician engagement, utilizing novel electronic remote monitoring methods to maximize real-time PRO capture, and linking these with pathway-driven automated effectors."

While medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications should always be included. Besides physical activity and a balanced diet, there are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine. One very important part in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended. Even though hydrotherapy has been a part of complementary medicine for more than a century now some therapeutic approaches lack of scientific evidence - especially when it comes to their effect on arterial hypertension. This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual). All 50 participants will be monitored with three 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure measurements (24h ABPM) at the beginning of the trial after randomization, at 8 weeks and at 6 months. The intervention group will be advised to perform the armbaths on 5 of 7 days per week for 8 weeks total.

After 6 months, each participant of the control group will be offered to be instructed on performing the armbaths as well.

Vaccination is the most effective strategy to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and its variants, but vaccine uptake in the US has lagged behind other countries. A recent survey found that 20% of unvaccinated Americans report that they will never get the vaccine. Misinformation and mistrust in science and government are key drivers of vaccine hesitancy. Individuals with anxiety and depression are particularly vulnerable to misinformation and are less likely to be vaccinated.\nThe investigators propose to test the effectiveness of two brief digital interventions to increase vaccine uptake among individuals with anxiety or depressive symptoms. The investigators will use a nationally-representative community cohort to identify individuals who are undervaccinated and have symptoms of anxiety or depression. The investigators will then randomly assign participants to one of three interventions: 1) an attitudinal inoculation intervention; 2), a CBT-informed intervention; or 3) a conventional public health messaging intervention. The investigators will examine the outcome of COVID-19 vaccination at 4 weeks post-intervention, conducting intent-to-treat comparisons between arms.\nThe investigators hypothesize that both interventions will be more effective than conventional public health messaging at increasing vaccine uptake among individuals with anxiety or depressive symptoms.

Today, organ transplantation procedures are carried out successfully in many centers in our country. Liver transplantation has become the most effective treatment method for acute and chronic liver failure due to different reasons. The life expectancy of individuals with advanced liver disease, which was limited to months before liver transplantation, was extended with liver transplantation and the quality of life was improved with this treatment method. However, since most of the organ transplants are made from genetically different donors, tissue compatibility between the donor and the recipient remains a problem. Therefore, the recipient's immune response to donor graft antigens should be considered. In recent years, the application of advanced surgery and new immunosuppressive approaches has made it possible to successfully transplant almost any vital organ or tissue. However, due to both infection and genetic factors, an immune response to the donor organ may develop and cause organ rejection. At this point, we think that early diagnosis and discovery of immune response parameters that distinguish infection from rejection may be important.

However, chemotherapy only provides a limited benefit in terms of survival. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop new treatment strategies for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.\nImmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising results in several types of cancer. However, the results in pancreatic cancer have been disappointing.\nRintatolimid is a drug that has been studied for the treatment of cancer for more than 20 years. It is a so-called TLR-3 agonist. TLR-3 is a protein that is present on immune cells. Rintatolimid activates TLR-3 and thereby stimulates the immune system.\nDurvalumab is an immune checkpoint inhibitor that blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and PD-1 and thereby releases the brake on the immune system, allowing T cells to attack and kill cancer cells.\nCombining rintatolimid with durvalumab might be more effective than either drug alone.\nObjective:\nTo determine the safety and effectiveness of the combination of rintatolimid and durvalumab in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.\nEligibility:\nAdults with advanced pancreatic cancer that has not responded to standard chemotherapy.\nDesign:\nParticipants will be screened with:\nMedical history\nPhysical exam\nBlood and urine tests\nHeart function test\nScan or x-ray of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis\nScan or x-ray of the head (brain)\nParticipants will receive the study treatment in 28-day cycles.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood disability with a prevalence of 2.11 per 1000 live births in high income countries. CP enfolds a group of developmental disorders of movement and posture, attributed to non-progressive disturbances which occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. An advanced treatment option for individuals with severe CP is Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) treatment. This treatment can be considered when other options, such as oral medication, are insufficient or cause side effects. Previous studies have shown mostly low level evidence for the effect of ITB on spasticity in children with spastic CP. For children with dyskinetic CP, The Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC previously conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial, which provides evidence for the effect of ITB on attaining personal treatment goals after three months of ITB treatment. It was furthermore found that after one year of ITB treatment, personal treatment goals were at least partially achieved in 97% of children and adolescents. Not all children show similar response to ITB: some benefit more than others in attaining treatment goals. The investigators previous research on the effect of ITB in children with dyskinetic CP, found that a higher level of dystonia prior to ITB and reduction of pain during ITB were associated, for a small part, with attainment of treatment goals. Sample size was not sufficient to look at specific factors associated with specific types of treatment goals. For example, goals on the level of personal care could be influenced by other factors than goals related to sitting or transfers. Long-term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with spastic and dyskinetic CP have not yet been described in literature. Furthermore, knowing which factors influence outcome on the long term, preferably related to specific types of treatment goals, can be used to inform and select children better before initiating ITB. In order to accomplish these goals prospectively, real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed.

Therefore, at present, intravenous anesthesia is often used in clinical practice to reduce discomfort, and intravenous propofol combined with fentanyl is the most widely used in clinical practice. But intravenous general anesthesia can lead to hemodynamic fluctuations and an increase in anesthesiation-related complications such as longer stays in the hospital after surgery. Complications related to sedation and analgesia have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Studies have shown that most of the adverse events in endoscopy are related to the sedation and analgesia drugs used. With the successful application of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in the field of postoperative analgesia, this technique has also been used in the sedation and analgesia of gastroenteroscopy in recent years. Propofol has the characteristics of quick action, short time of action and rapid recovery, so it is very suitable for the anesthesia and sedation of painless abortion and painless gastroenteroscopy. Remifentanil, as an opioid \u03bc receptor agonist, is easily hydrolyzed rapidly by non-specific esterases in plasma and tissues due to the ester bond contained in its chemical structure. Therefore, it has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics such as rapid intravenous injection, small volume of distribution, rapid clearance after drug withdrawal, no accumulation, metabolism is not affected by liver and kidney function, and has been widely used in various surgeries in recent years, especially in the anesthesia of short surgeries."

The incidence of RAII is closely related to the radiation dose and the volume of small bowel and rectum receiving the radiation dose. With the development of radiotherapy technology, the dose of radiotherapy has been increased, and the incidence of RAII has also increased. RAII can be divided into acute phase and chronic phase. The acute phase of RAII occurs within 90 days after radiotherapy, and the chronic phase occurs after 90 days. The acute phase of RAII is usually self-limited and can be relieved by symptomatic treatment. However, the chronic phase of RAII can be progressive and even life-threatening. The chronic phase of RAII is mainly manifested as radiation-induced intestinal fibrosis, radiation-induced intestinal stricture, radiation-induced intestinal fistula, and radiation-induced intestinal bleeding. The chronic phase of RAII can lead to malnutrition, diarrhea, and even intestinal obstruction, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients and increases the medical burden. Therefore, it is very important to predict the chronicization of RAII.\nThe pathogenesis of RAII is closely related to the immune response. Studies have shown that the expression of immune factors in the intestinal mucosa can predict the occurrence of RAII. However, there are few studies on the prediction of the chronicization of RAII. In this study, the investigators will collect the clinical data and intestinal tissue samples of patients with RAII, and detect the expression of immune factors in the intestinal tissue samples.

These findings demonstrate the importance of sufficient treatment for psychotic disorders and, most importantly, point to a need for research so that more effective treatments can be developed in the future. In the recent decade, various psychotherapeutic programs with cognitive-behavioral background have been developed for patients with psychosis, and their efficacy has been investigated. Meta-analyses have shown superiority of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis over standard treatment, both in combination with antipsychotic medication and without. Many of the psychological approaches have focused primarily on treating the deficits associated with psychosis, as for example cognitive remediation or social skills training. However, these methods are not feasible in the acute setting and there are only a few psychotherapeutic instruments that can be used within a short period of time for inpatient treatment. The guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia recommend a combination of antipsychotic medication and psychosis-specific cognitive behavioral therapy. This includes all stages of the illness, also in the acute phase. The best evidence currently exists for cognitive-behavioral approaches, [\u2026].

Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSchizophrenia is one of the leading causes of disability due to mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as India, with this burden disproportionately impacting lower income individuals who primarily access health care services through publicly run facilities. In 2017, it was estimated that there were over 3.5 million people in India living with schizophrenia, with this burden expected to increase as the population ages and disease burden shifts to chronic conditions experienced in adulthood. Importantly, the burden of disability due to schizophrenia is often underestimated as many epidemiological studies do not adequately account for the added burden of chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes that disproportionately impact individuals living with schizophrenia. Recent epidemiological studies in India have further observed a mortality rate among individuals living with schizophrenia that is twice the rate observed in the general population, with calls for greater efforts to address this significant health disparity. In addition to recognizing the need to address the care gap, where in India it is estimated that upwards of 75% of individuals living with schizophrenia do not have access to essential mental health care, urgent attention is also needed towards responding to the medical and physical health needs of this vulnerable patient population. Psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness and integration of an evidence-based psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India. We will build on important preliminary work led by project collaborators to support our aims to evaluate whether a novel digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness (Aim 1) and the integration (Aim 2) of an evidence-based psychosocial"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after acute illness is increasing. Their long-term outcome is poor and has not improved significantly over the past 20 years. The symptom burden for patients is considerable, and family members often suffer from significant physical and emotional strain. Long-term survivors report lasting physical limitations, but their emotional health is generally good. Care for many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is shifting t post-intensive care unit settings. While this trend has resulted in cost savings for hospitals and payers, it has not had a major impact on patient outcomes. Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources and clinician time. Measurement and knowledge of their outcomes will guide efforts to improve their care. This study will be conducted in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from August 2023 to January 2024. A retrospective cohort study will be conducted. Data will be checked, coded, entered, and analyzed using SPSS version 22 software. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data, tables, and figures for display results. Bivariate and multivariate analyses will be used to see the effect of the independent variable on the outcome variable. Variables that are significant on bivariate analysis at a p-value less than 0.2 will be taken to multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, a p-value of less than 0.05 will be used as a cut-off point for the presence of association. The strength of the association will be measured by 95% confidence interval and odd ratio."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nDual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the standard of care for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition. To this extent, two strategies have both proven to be effective in reducing bleeding complications while preserving efficacy compared with maintaining long-term DAPT with aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor: a) DAPT de-escalation (i.e., switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel while maintaining aspirin) and b) potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (i.e., maintaining prasugrel or ticagrelor"

However, a direct comparative analysis between Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization is conspicuously absent, prompting this study to unveil potential distinctions in their impact on shoulder pain, range of motion, and functional mobility.\nThe research design involves the random allocation of participants into two groups: Group A, receiving Gong's mobilization, and Group B, undergoing Kaltenborn's mobilization. This allocation will be done through a lottery method, ensuring a fair and unbiased selection process. The study will follow a single-blind design, with the assessor remaining unaware of the treatment group assignment. Participants in both groups will also receive routine physical therapy, including 15 minutes of electrical muscle stimulation with heat therapy. This approach, supported by existing literature, aims to create a standardized baseline for assessing the additional impact of mobilization techniques.\nThe study's duration is projected to be nine months, with data collection points at baseline, the end of 1.5 weeks, and the conclusion of the 3rd week. Outcome variables include pain assessment using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, evaluation of function through the Shoulder Pain & Disability Index, and measurement of range of motion using goniometry.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Radiotherapy (RT) is an important treatment option for HCC. However, the residual tumors and early recurrence/metastasis after RT compromise the patient survival. Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for HBV-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies. The investigators will first use our previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing RT. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases.

The MCCP was developed by drawing upon Meaning-Making Model (Park, 2010; Park and Folkman,1997), principles of meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), the literature on meaning, and existing meaning centered psychotherapy approaches. Additionally, considering limitations such as potential program changes, transportation difficulties, and inadequate physical conditions, online interventions offer a reliable alternative that provides numerous advantages for individuals diagnosed with breast cancer. Therefore, the intervention program was implemented online via video conference for women diagnosed with breast cancer in the current study. After the program was developed, a pilot study was conducted. According to the expert's feedback, the final version of MCCP was developed. The primary aim was to test the effectiveness of MCCP among women with breast cancer. The research hypotheses are 1) compared to control grup, MCCP group would show better improvement in meaning in life and PTG scores 2) compared to control grup, MCCP group would show better improvements in situational meaning (i.e. stress appraisal and violations in general meaning) 3) Compared to control group, the MCCP group would report significant decrease in automatic meaning making efforts (i.e. intrusion and avoidance) 4) Compared to control group, the MCCP group would report a significantly higher level of psychological flexibility and lower level of psychological distress.

In recent years, with the development of endovascular techniques and devices, endovascular treatment has become an important treatment method for IA. However, the occurrence of perioperative ischemic events and bleeding events after endovascular treatment of IA is still a major problem. Antiplatelet drugs are the main method to prevent perioperative ischemic events and bleeding events. However, the antiplatelet drug regimen used in the treatment of IA is not standardized, and the optimal antiplatelet drug regimen is still unclear. Platelet function testing (PFT) is a new technology that can dynamically monitor the effect of antiplatelet drugs in vivo. The LTA test is a new type of PFT, which can quickly and accurately reflect the effect of antiplatelet drugs on the body.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCerebral palsy (CP) is primarily a neuromotor disorder that affects the development of movement, muscle tone and posture. The underlying pathophysiology is an injury to the developing brain in the prenatal through neonatal period. Although the initial neuro pathologic lesion is non-progressive, children with cerebral palsy may develop a range of secondary conditions over time that will variably affect their functional abilities. The prevalence of CP varies between 1.5 to more than 4 cases per 1,000 live births worldwide. The motor impairments associated with CP can range from mild to severe, affecting different muscle groups and leading to limitations in activities and participation. Children with CP often experience motor impairments that affect their gross motor function, leading to limitations in activities and participation. These motor impairments can also have a negative impact on bone health, resulting in reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of skeletal complications. Gross motor function (GMF) refers to the ability to perform coordinated movements using large muscle groups, such as walking, running, and jumping. It is a key aspect of physical ability and independence in daily activities for children with CP. Previous research has shown that gross motor function is closely associated with bone health in this population. However, further investigation is needed to explore the specific nature of this correlation and its implications for intervention strategies. Gross motor function is commonly assessed using standardized tools such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical, psychological, and social well-being. In the context of cerebral palsy, understanding the impact of gross motor function on quality of life is crucial for comprehensive care and intervention planning. Children with CP may face limitations in mobility, participation in activities, and social interactions, which can significantly affect their overall quality of life. Exploring the relationship between gross motor function and quality of life can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the holistic well-being of children with CP. The quality of life in children with CP is not only influenced by their motor function but also by their overall health and well-being. Bone health plays a crucial role in maintaining the physical abilities and independence of individuals, as well as their overall quality of"

BP values among adolescents tend to be less heterogeneous than in adults, and the impact of genetic factors, even if small, may be the expression of pathogenic mechanisms that have been present since birth. With this study, named HYGEF (Hypertension in high school students: Genetic and Environmental Factors), authors wanted to: 1. determine the prevalence of obesity and hypertension (HT) in a cohort of adolescents, 2. perform genetic analyses to determine a link between specific polymorphisms of genes involved in the development of HT in adults like the Adducin genes and Endogenous Ouabain (EO) and HT and 3. explore whether urine Na+/K+ excretion and urinary markers of inflammation and oxidative stress are linked to HT and cardiovascular risk in participants with the selected genotypes. Adolescents will be enrolled for the study in high schools in the north (Milan), center (Livorno) and south (Grottaglie) of Italy, to obtain a sample that could be representative of the italian adolescents.

The effect on the developing brain is an area that has received growing attention over the last decade. Pre-clinical studies, including those looking at cells and animal models, have demonstrated the harmful effect that anaesthetic drugs can cause in nerve cells. Large studies of children have suggested that early age exposure to anaesthetic drugs may impact cognitive and behavioural outcomes however, although this has not been a universal finding. In 2016 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the use of anaesthetic drugs for children aged under 3 years, with the highest level of concern afforded to those who have prolonged and/or repeat exposures, showing the importance of this topic. This importance is further highlighted by the annual paediatric anaesthetic caseload - more than half a million children have an anaesthetic each year in the UK.\nThere have been pre-clinical studies that have suggested that the way in which anaesthetic drugs can impact on neurodevelopment and cognition is through modifying the way in which genes are expressed by altering signals on DNA (epigenetics). This research aims to explore whether these changes in signals on DNA (epigenetic changes) can be seen in children undergoing anaesthesia and whether this is impacted by the type of anaesthetic given. To do this, the trial has been designed as a randomised, clinical, feasibility trial in which participants undergoing hypospadias surgery will be randomised to one of the two anaesthetic maintenance approaches that are used routinely in clinical practice: intravenous or inhalational. Baseline data, including demographics, will be collected.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroid patients have a thyroid hormone deficiency characterized by a shortage of thyroid hormone (TH) in the circulation and at the organ level and are normally treated with a synthetic form of thyroid hormone (L-T4 or levothyroxine). Thyroxine (T4) is a prohormone, produced by the thyroid gland and converted into the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. A minor percentage (20%) of circulating T3 is directly produced by the thyroid gland. Although L-T4 treatment accounts for all patients with hypothyroidism, the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism differs. Most patients suffer from primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), which is an auto-immune disorder, but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease are commonly seen. Currently, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are measured in serum to monitor the treatment efficacy of L-T4. TSH is produced by the pituitary to stimulate the production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland and due to the negative feedback loop considered as a good reflection of thyroid hormone status. Target concentrations of TSH and fT4 differ depending on the cause of hypothyroidism. In patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, TSH levels are measured to monitor treatment and TSH levels within the reference intervals are pursued. TSH is measured to monitor treatment in patients with hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma as well, although a suppressed TSH is warranted in this group. The extent of TSH suppression is determined based on the type and stage of the carcinoma. In patients who are hypothyroid due to therapy of Graves' disease, other target values apply.

The standard clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients. Generating a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation. We aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion.

It is estimated that 300 million people in the world are affected by osteoporosis. In Turkey, the prevalence of osteoporosis in women over the age of 50 is 30.8%. Osteoporosis is a major public health problem that is responsible for approximately 8.9 million fractures worldwide. The most common fracture sites in osteoporosis are the wrist, spine and hip. The most important factor in the treatment of osteoporosis is the prevention of fractures. In addition to pharmacological treatment, lifestyle changes such as regular exercise are also important in the treatment of osteoporosis. Exercise is recommended for all osteoporosis patients, regardless of their fracture status. Exercise has many benefits in osteoporosis. It increases bone mineral density, improves muscle strength, balance and coordination, and reduces the risk of falling and fractures. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of physical activity on physical fitness parameters, functional fitness age and quality of life in women at risk of osteoporosis. The study was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study. The sample of the study consisted of 40 women at risk of osteoporosis. The women were divided into two groups as experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated in the Otago Exercise Program, which lasted 3 days a week and an average of 30 minutes per day for 12 weeks in total.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nA diagnosis of cancer reverberates throughout the family. Family caregivers take on a wide range of responsibilities, such as monitoring medical symptoms, communicating with the patient's medical team, managing insurance claims, providing transportation, and assisting with activities of daily living. Psychological distress is common. Caregivers often feel unprepared for their role, and socially isolated from others. Physical impacts have also been documented, from fatigue to sleep disturbance to immune dysfunction. To alleviate some of these difficult sequelae of cancer caregiving, we propose to test the utility of a brief, low-cost, non-pharmacologic, behavioral intervention for persons providing care for a loved one with cancer. Specifically, we will test the effects of an expressive writing (EW) intervention. The basic paradigm asks participants to write for 20 minutes on four separate occasions about a trauma or stressor. Initial work conducted with undergraduate samples showed benefit of EW. Since then, EW studies have been conducted across a variety of populations including persons coping with chronic illness. Benefits have ranged from better lung function among asthmatics to fewer physical symptoms among women with breast cancer. One meta-analysis of 146 studies across 10,94 participants reported positive effect sizes (mental or physical health benefits) for 102 of the studies (70%). Notable gaps in this literature include testing with cancer caregivers (with some exceptions) and use of novel delivery formats. Specific aims are: (1) To examine the effects of a group-based, videoconference-delivered EW program on emotional, social, and physical well-being among informal caregivers of persons diagnosed with cancer; (2) To identify social and linguistic mechanisms by which participation in the group-based EW intervention may improve distress; and (3) To identify potential moderators of benefit including age, gender identity, relationship to the patient, and baseline social constraints."

SL is now recognized as a core symptom of long COVID (LC), which also includes other impairments in mood, cognition, and sleep. Given that SL itself can negatively impact many of the same problems being recognized in the symptomatology of LC, it is likely that SL is both a symptom of LC and a contributing factor that worsens other LC symptoms (i.e. mood, cognition, sleep, etc.). As such, successful treatment of SL could also help to improve these other LC symptoms. Smell/olfactory training (ST) is currently being studied as a treatment for COVID-related SL. Classic ST requires twice daily practice of sniffing odorants over the course of 3 months to regenerate olfactory neurons, engage smell-related cognitive functions, and retrain the brain to smell. ST is promising as a stand-alone treatment. However, its limitations include the burden of many months of daily practice that often leads to sub-optimal compliance and dropout. The current study aims to determine whether the benefits of ST can be accelerated and enhanced by using a novel, adjunct neuromodulatory intervention to conventional ST. Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) is a non-invasive, pain-free, method of neuromodulation that delivers low levels of electrical stimulation to the trigeminal circuit, having potential to enhance smell function through activation of the highly connected olfactory-intranasal trigeminal brain circuits. Prior work demonstrated TNS-enhanced psychophysical detection of odorants. Yet the effects of TNS are extensive, i.e. improved executive functioning (e.g. attention), sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness, as well as therapeutic efficacy across a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, TNS-as an adjunct to ST-may not only improve overall efficacy and"

Many autism interventions were developed and tested with only White participants, assuming they could be transferable to minority populations. However, research has found that this is not the case and that interventions that are not adapted to an individual's culture and ethnicity do not work as well and are not used as frequently. In this project, we compare two methods of stakeholder engagement, Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG), to determine which is better at getting input on the facilitators and barriers to access therapy for autistic children. We focus on Hispanics and Latinos as this is the largest minority group in the US, with one of the fastest-growing groups of autistic children. Our long-term objective is to improve the functional skills and health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and their families by improving access to an occupational therapy intervention designed to improve daily living skills, socialization, and quality of life.\nOccupational therapy using Ayres Sensory Integration (OT/ASI) is the only evidence-based intervention that addresses the sensory symptoms in autism. We will use input from these engagement sessions to adapt two versions of the OT/ASI manual: one using DT data and the other using FG data. Outcomes are evaluated following each step. Following the completion of this project, the planned outputs of the study are data on the most effective minority stakeholder engagement method and a culturally adapted OT/ASI manual for Hispanic and Latino autistic children for clinicians and researchers. This information can support future researchers who are engaging Hispanic/Latino individuals or other minority groups in research."

SN causes people to ignore or be unaware of objects and people on the left side of their body and space. This can cause dangerous consequences, such as not realizing they are in the middle of the road when walking, or not being able to use their left arm or leg. Although Veterans with SN are half as likely to return home, have one-third the community mobility, require 3x as much caregiver supervision, and have longer hospitalizations compared with similar right brain stroke survivors, a personalized approach to SN rehabilitation is not available in Veteran-specific systems of care. The investigators discovered that frontal lobe damage and Aiming SN both predict optimal recovery of functional independence after prism adaptation treatment (PAT). These findings argue for the development of an objective, biomarker-based process to identify patients who should be administered PAT. The algorithm will be developed by identifying specific neurobiological features predictive of PAT treatment response. Thus, the investigators expect this research will deliver a critical missing element to rehabilitation, eliminating clinician uncertainty about SN diagnosis and appropriateness of PAT, and allowing a more personalized health care approach to SN rehabilitation. The team of researchers at three high-performing VA medical centers, distinguished in cognitive neurology analysis of brain imaging predictors, and stroke rehabilitation, from both advanced and clinical data, will develop the first biological parameter that can be used to assign SN rehabilitation.

The determination of the type of tumor, as well as its grading, is usually done subsequently with a biopsy of the tissue, where different solid samples are extracted as representative as possible to analyze them in the Pathological Anatomy service. Nevertheless, there are some factors that limit surgical access, such as: the advanced age of the patient, the location of the tumor in eloquent or risky areas, as well as the presence of large tumors with very diffuse borders. In these cases, the diagnosis of the brain tumor is usually made directly with the magnetic resonance image, which implies a risk of error due to the lack of clinical information from this test. Limitations like these make the minimally invasive procedure of liquid biopsy an extremely necessary diagnostic tool. For this reason, the investigators want to start a pilot study of this technique in those patients with brain lesions in the resonance images compatible with a glioma-like tumor. In particular, the main aim of the study is to analyze the blood samples obtained from these patients in order to detect and quantify the circulating DNA (ctDNA) of tumor cells on it. These DNA fragments are expelled into the bloodstream by mechanisms still unknown as a result of numerous processes of apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells. By analyzing them through a ddPCR, the investigators will try to detect the specific mutations present in this tumoral ctDNA, allowing the team to confirm the presence of a glioma-type tumor, and providing real-time information of its classification as astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma."

The most common cause of rib fractures is direct trauma, such as from a motor vehicle accident or a fall. Less commonly, rib fractures can be caused by indirect trauma, such as from a crushing injury. Rib fractures can be classified according to the number of fractures, the location of the fractures, and the severity of the fractures. Multiple rib fractures are defined as three or more fractures. The most common location for rib fractures is the posterior ribs, followed by the anterior ribs. The severity of rib fractures is classified according to the degree of displacement of the fractured ends. Non-displaced fractures are those in which the fractured ends are in contact with each other. Displaced fractures are those in which the fractured ends are not in contact with each other. Displaced fractures can be further classified according to the degree of displacement. Minimally displaced fractures are those in which the fractured ends are separated by less than 5 mm. Moderately displaced fractures are those in which the fractured ends are separated by 5-10 mm. Severely displaced fractures are those in which the fractured ends are separated by more than 10 mm.

Although a number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies.\nThe aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction.\nPrimary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional gamblers, respectively.\nSecondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers."

SIBO occurs when the homeostatic mechanisms of the small intestine are disturbed. The two main conditions that favor microbial overgrowth in the small intestine are decreased acid secretion from the stomach and small bowel dyskinesia. The literature is scarce concerning the effects of SIBO on critically ill patients. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effects of SIBO on mechanically ventilated patients. It is a non-invasive observational study employing a modified technique to obtain exhaled air from the ventilator tubes to perform a standard hydrogen breath test for SIBO diagnosis. Lactulose is used as a substrate. Specifically, each patient is administered 20 g of lactulose diluted in 400 ml of water through the nasogastric tube. Measurements are performed at 0-15-30-45-60-90-120-180 min from lactulose administration. During measurements, a valve attached to a collecting bag at the end of the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, is kept open and the collecting bag is filled by several patient exhalations. After valve closure and bag isolation, the air is drawn by a 50 ml polyethylene syringe which is connected to the valve system to prevent losses and/or contamination. Then the air is blown into the breath hydrogen monitor and the expired hydrogen measurement is recorded.

The model has been developed to facilitate cross-referrals and transmission of structured nutrition care documentation from an acute care hospital setting to a meal provision organization and then for the meal provision organization to use the referral data to increase delivery of nutrition care (medical nutrition therapy- MNT) and meals (medically tailored meals - MTM). The primary subjects for this study are adults older than 60 years of age with malnutrition, with particular emphasis on recruiting sites who serve individuals who are Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native Americans and individuals living in rural areas of the country. The components of the proposed new model of cross-referral, data transfer, and nutrition care across settings has the potential to be scalable throughout the US. However, barriers and facilitators to data transfer and MNT/MTM provision, cost of implementation, and potential impact on outcomes must be evaluated for the model to be replicable.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPuzzles, which are among the active learning tools, are frequently preferred today because they make learning fun, are economical, improve problem-solving skills and offer understandable learning. Puzzles increase students' motivation and self-confidence by turning complex concepts into a hobby. In the literature, studies investigating the learning situation with puzzles have examined undergraduate students in different sciences. Even though there are different disciplines, undergraduate students' efforts to search for the right answer, their self-confidence in finding the right answer, and their involvement in the active learning process rather than passive memorization reveal the increase in their knowledge levels. It has been observed that the teaching method with puzzles not only facilitates learning, but also guides students to better recognize their knowledge gaps and weaknesses. Considering nursing education, it is obvious that teaching concepts encountered for the first time with puzzles by providing an active environment in the classroom will increase students' motivation and knowledge level. Despite research conducted with different disciplines in the literature, there are few studies examining the effect of puzzles on the level of learning concepts related to the nursing profession. In this research, the concepts of vital signs, which have an important place in both the student life and professional life of first-year nursing students, will be discussed. An active and fun environment will be provided to students with puzzles on the subjects of respiration, pulse and blood pressure, where students have difficulty in learning the conceptual structure. In this context, it is predicted that the education provided with puzzles will contribute positively to the knowledge level of the students. A pre-test will be given to all groups before the theoretical lesson on vital signs. Afterwards, the students in the experimental group will apply puzzles for two weeks (12-27/11/2023). Afterwards, final tests will be performed. The work will continue until 10/12/2023. Control group students will be educated only during the normal course."

By comparing the two ways directly, we hope to make it simpler for people with vulvar cancer to get their lymph nodes checked during surgery.\nIndocyanine green (ICG) is a fluorescent dye that has been used for the imaging of cancers in the body for more than 30 years. It is approved by the FDA for use in patients. It is given as an injection into the skin near the tumor. A special camera that detects the fluorescence of ICG is then used to look for lymph nodes that have taken up the dye. These lymph nodes are called sentinel lymph nodes. They are the first lymph nodes that the cancer is likely to spread to. Removal of these lymph nodes during surgery can help determine if the cancer has spread beyond the vulva.\nThe usual method of finding sentinel lymph nodes involves injecting a blue dye and a radioactive tracer into the skin near the tumor. The blue dye can be seen with the naked eye, and the radioactive tracer can be detected with a special probe. The lymph nodes that take up the dye and/or are hot (have the radioactive tracer) are then removed during surgery.\nIn this study, we will compare the results of using ICG alone with the usual method of using blue dye and a radioactive tracer. We will look at how many sentinel lymph nodes are found using each method, and we will compare the size and location of the sentinel lymph nodes. We will also look at how many patients have additional lymph nodes that need to be removed because they are hot or contain cancer cells.\nThe results of this study will help us determine if ICG alone can be used instead of the usual method for finding sentinel lymph nodes in patients with vulvar cancer."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is a severe fungal infection of the lungs, which is often lethal. It is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, especially in those with hematological malignancies and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The diagnosis of IPA is difficult and often delayed. The gold standard for diagnosis is histopathological evidence of invasive hyphal growth in tissue, but this is often unavailable. The diagnosis is therefore often made on the basis of imaging, serology and fungal culture. However, these methods are not very sensitive and the diagnosis is often made too late. This is especially problematic in the case of HSCT, where the diagnosis is often made too late, after the patient has already developed severe lung damage.\nThe development of a non-invasive diagnostic method for IPA is therefore of great importance. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) as a diagnostic tool for various diseases. VOCs are organic compounds that are present in the exhaled air of patients. These compounds can be used as markers for various diseases.\nIn this study, the investigators aim to investigate whether VOCs can be used to diagnose IPA in patients with hematological malignancies and HSCT. The investigators will collect breath samples from patients and analyze the VOC profile in these samples. The investigators will then compare the VOC profile of patients with IPA to the VOC profile of patients without IPA. The investigators hope that this study will contribute to the development of a non-invasive diagnostic method for IPA."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) is a regional anesthesia technique that is frequently used in thoracic surgery. It is a simple, safe, and effective technique. It is applied by injecting local anesthetic into the paravertebral space, which is located between the vertebra and the rib. It is a nerve block that provides analgesia by blocking the thoracic nerves. It is applied to the patients in the sitting position. It is applied to the side of the surgery. The local anesthetic is injected under ultrasound guidance. The most commonly used local anesthetic is bupivacaine. The most common side effects of TPVB are transient hypotension and bradycardia. In addition, pneumothorax, local anesthetic toxicity, and nerve damage are the other complications that may develop. The duration of analgesia provided by TPVB is 12-24 hours. The duration of analgesia may vary depending on the volume of local anesthetic used. In this study, the investigators aimed to investigate the effect of different volumes of local anesthetic on the duration of analgesia provided by TPVB."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple Sclerosis is the most common cause of neurologic chronic disability in young adults. Fatigue is one of the principal symptom in this disease. Fatigue in a subject with MS is present every day, gets worse as the day progresses, with the heat and humidity, it is sudden and more severe than normal, it interferes with physical performance. Fatigue is prevalent in the MS population and is a significant health problem, negatively impacting activities of daily living, ability to work, social life and quality of life.\nIn 1963 it was demonstrated how mechanical vibration, applied to a single muscle, at suitable amplitudes and frequencies, was capable of selectively and differentially activating primary (Ia), secondary (IIb) or GTO spindle afferents, depending on the characteristics of the stimulus. So with appropriate frequencies and amplitude of vibration, it is possible both to select the activated afferents, and to determine the frequency of action potentials sent to the Central Nervous System.\nThe purpose of this study is to verify how the use of vibrations can induce positive effects on the mobility and postural control of patients with MS, as well as reduce fatigue. The study is an interventional type. The subjects are undergoing to baseline examinations (T0) including 3D gait analysis (using a BTS system), stabilometric analysis, and a battery of neuropsychological assessments. Subsequently, eligible subjects are undergoing to intensive multidisciplinary training for a total of 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks, with a total of 20 treatment sessions. The experimental group receive additional vibration treatment. At the end of the treatment cycle (T1), the patients will undergo the same evaluation tests as at baseline.\nThe Clinical and instrumental exams used for this study (as per normal clinical practice) are: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), Borg Scale, Medical Research Council Scale (MRC), 6 minutes walking test.\nThe Psychological Assessment Battery used are: Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) scale"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nLung transplantation is the only treatment that can prolong survival for patients with end-stage lung disease. However, the long-term prognosis of lung transplantation is still poor, and the median survival time is only 5.5 years. The most common cause of death after lung transplantation is chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), which is a progressive deterioration of pulmonary function and gas exchange. The pathogenesis of CLAD is not fully understood, and there is currently no effective treatment. Therefore, it is very important to study the pathological changes of CLAD and explore new treatment methods.\nLung biopsy is an important method to study the pathological changes of CLAD. Traditional lung biopsy is performed by bronchoscopy with biopsy forceps, which can only obtain a small amount of tissue. The pathological changes of CLAD are diffuse and subtle, and it is easy to miss the lesions. In recent years, cryobiopsy has been widely used in the field of pulmonary interstitial disease. Compared with traditional biopsy, cryobiopsy can obtain larger tissue samples, which is conducive to the study of pathological changes. In addition, the use of cryoprobe can reduce the damage to the bronchial mucosa and reduce the complications of lung biopsy.\nIn this study, the investigators will use a 1.1mm flexible cryoprobe to perform transbronchial lung cryobiopsy in patients with lung transplantation. The investigators will compare the diagnostic efficacy of transbronchial cryobiopsy with traditional transbronchial lung biopsy. The investigators will also evaluate the incidence of complications and the quality of the biopsy specimens. The results of this study will provide a basis for the clinical application of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy in the field of lung transplantation."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSelective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) in monochorionic twins may negatively impact the pregnancy. There is a substantial risk of fetal deterioration resulting in (iatrogenic) preterm birth or even intrauterine demise of one, or both fetuses. There are important unresolved challenges on a diagnostic level and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of sFGR have not been fully clarified. The current diagnostic classification system based on three different umbilical artery flow patterns has no increasing scale of severity and the observed flow patterns may be volatile in nature. This hinders optimal diagnostic management and complicates outcome prediction as the survival outcome differs per umbilical artery flow type. Consequently, parents encounter a great deal of uncertainty during the pregnancy. Since there is no treatment available for sFGR, predicting fetal deterioration is key in preventing single or double demise. By testing several predictors, the investigators are aiming to improve outcome prediction at the time of sFGR diagnosis. The investigators furthermore hypothesize that additional ultrasound parameters could be of benefit in making the current classification system more accurate and less variable. Extensive histological placental examinations will shine a light on microscopic abnormalities which can increase our knowledge of the pathophysiology. Examining neurodevelopment of sFGR twins at two years of age will additionally be of great value for our understanding of the impact of sFGR and contribute to adequate patient counselling.\nOur study will evaluate the impact of a sFGR pregnancy on parental mental health and parent-to-infant(s) attachment, which has not been carried out this extensively before."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nType-2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Over time, high blood sugar levels can damage the blood vessels and nerves in the body, leading to serious health problems. One of the most common health problems associated with T2D is stroke. Stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted, either by a blockage or a bleed. This can cause brain cells to die, resulting in permanent damage.\nRecent studies have shown that a new drug called semaglutide can help to reduce the risk of stroke in people with T2D. Semaglutide is a type of drug called a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA). It works by mimicking the actions of a hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which is produced by the body in response to rising blood sugar levels. GLP-1 helps to control blood sugar levels by stimulating the production of insulin.\nThe exact mechanism by which semaglutide reduces the risk of stroke is not fully understood. It is possible that semaglutide improves blood flow to the brain, or that it reduces inflammation in the brain.\nIn this study, the investigators will use magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate the effects of semaglutide on blood flow to the brain and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in people with T2D. The BBB is a barrier that separates the blood from the brain tissue. It helps to protect the brain from harmful substances in the blood.\nThe investigators will also measure levels of inflammatory markers in the blood. Inflammation is a process that is involved in the development of stroke.\nThe investigators will recruit 100 people with T2D and randomly assign them to receive either semaglutide or a placebo (a dummy drug). The study will last for 1 year. During this time, the investigators will perform MRA and MRI scans at the beginning of the study and at the end of the study. The investigators will also take blood samples at the beginning of the study and at the end of the study."

It is likely that different patients will respond to different treatments, but the optimal treatment for each individual remains unknown (and which patients are unlikely to respond to either treatment and should be referred to specialist care). Enhancing our ability to determine the optimal intervention for a particular patient has the potential to enhance the overall effectiveness of mental health care delivery in a more cost-efficient manner.

The study has two specific aims and two exploratory aims:\nSpecific Aim 1 (Clinical and Functional Outcomes): To evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a precision treatment rule (PTR) on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either psychotherapy based on behavioral activation called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) or antidepressant medication (fluoxetine). The study will use machine learning to develop the PTR, using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe power of music to raise the spirits and to heal the soul should not be underestimated. There is growing recognition of the significance of music as a complementary treatment in palliative care, which is reflected in the growing body of scientific literature on the subject and in the popularly of music therapy among palliative care patients themselves. Palliative care describes the holistic approach in the treatment of patients with advanced or incurable diseases, such as terminal cancer. To this end, an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, psycho-oncologists, chaplains and music therapists is involved. Music therapy is defined as the systematic use of music within a therapeutic relationship which aims at restoring, maintaining and furthering emotional, physical and mental health. The aim of music therapy in palliative care, in contrast, is to relieve symptoms of distress and improve quality of life among patients in the advanced stages of oncological disease. Music therapy encompasses both active and receptive techniques. Active techniques involve the patient in the production of music, such that they sing or play a musical instrument, possibly making planned gifts of songs to loved ones or for memorial services, whereas receptive techniques guide the patient in listening to music, both prerecorded as well as performed for them live. In cancer patients, the focus is placed primarily on music-assisted relaxation, generation of imagery, songs and improvisation. This heterogeneity of techniques studied in the literature on music therapy precludes an understanding of precisely what aspects of music therapy are most beneficial. Despite a diversity of approach, findings are promising, which in itself may be an indication as to whether the whole of music therapy is perhaps greater than the sum of its parts. To practice music therapy according to the standards of evidence-based medicine, it is necessary to specify the intervention performed as well as the musical instrument(s) used. Moderators such as individual patient preferences and experience with music also may play an appreciable role; however, these are rarely systematically investigated. Music therapy is conventionally administered by a trained music therapist and individual therapy sessions typically last 20 minutes. Training backgrounds of therapists vary, whereby in the United States a bachelor's degree in music therapy is the minimum requirement and board certification must follow in order for professional practice.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCataract is the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, making cataract surgery one of the most performed surgical procedures. The carbon footprint of cataract surgery, especially phacoemulsification, is a significant research field. In the United Kingdom, cataract surgery generates 180 kg of CO2- equivalents per eye, causing over half of the emissions due to obtaining large disposable medical equipment. In the Aravind Eye Care System (AECS) in Tamil Nadu, India, endophthalmitis rated 0.02% in over a million consecutive cataract cases despite the observation that cannulas, irrigation/ aspiration tubing, gowns, surgical gloves, irrigating bottles, as well as topical and intraocular drugs are normally recycled to cut cost and waste. On the other hand, health care plays a key role in climate change, as well as financial and environmental waste. Being the most performed operation, cataract surgery and ophthalmology, in general, can meaningfully influence lowering environmental and economic waste in their surgical services. The aim of this work is to show if reusing the operative supplies to reduce financial costs, especially in developing countries, and to lower global warming and climate change will affect the rate of postoperative endophthalmitis after cataract surgery."

The pathogenesis of AN is complex and not fully understood. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is closely related to the core symptoms of AN, and proposed the hypothesis of AN-ACC pathological network, suggesting that ACC overactivation and abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions (anterior frontal lobe, parietal lobe, precuneus, and striatum) is the neuropathological mechanism for the onset of AN. Currently, rare studies have been conducted on dTMS targeting ACC as an intervention in patients with AN. In this research, dTMS, a neuroregulatory technology, was used for the first time to intervene with ACC in the treatment of adult AN. A randomized controlled study design was adopted, in which patients with AN were divided into the dTMS treatment group and the pseudo-stimulation group by 1:1 randomization, followed by 6-week intervention and half-year follow up, to clarify the near-term and long-term efficacy and safety of the dTMS treatment. Psychometric and fMRI examinations are performed at baseline in both groups. The rest of the time follow-up of symptoms and psychometrics and side-effects questionnaires are performed at week 2, 4, and 6 (during treatment) as well as at week 4, 12, and 24 ( after completion of treatment). Meanwhile, baseline fMRI data were extracted and combined with clinical features to establish an efficacy prediction model. We will explore factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group, divided into two groups according to whether dTMS was effective or not at the end of treatment (week 6) (effective is defined as BMI increasing by \u22651.2 kg/m2 at the end of treatment), using pre-treatment (baseline) demographic information, psychological assessment questionnaires, and neuroimaging data in the two groups. This will provide theoretical and practical basis for the pioneering ACC-targeted dTMS treatment in China, helping to establish a new type of intervention program for AN, with expected results of innovation."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nLow back pain (LBP) is a common health problem that affects 80% of the population at some point in their lives. LBP is the most common cause of job-related disability and a leading cause of activity limitations and work absenteeism. The total costs of LBP in the United States are estimated to be $100 billion annually. The prevalence of LBP is higher in adults with chronic conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the problem of LBP. People with LBP are more likely to have worse mental health, including anxiety and depression. The pandemic has also led to increased sedentary behavior, which is a risk factor for LBP. There is a need for effective, low-cost, and accessible interventions for LBP. Tai Chi and Qigong (TCQ) is a mind-body practice that has been shown to be effective in reducing LBP. TCQ is a form of exercise that integrates movement, meditation, and deep breathing. It has been shown to improve balance, flexibility, strength, and posture. It has also been shown to reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. TCQ is safe for people of all ages and physical abilities. It can be done at home or in a group setting. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a 12-week, twice-per-week TCQ program for reducing LBP. The investigators will recruit 100 adults with LBP and randomly assign them to either the TCQ program or usual care. The investigators will measure the impact of the TCQ program on LBP, mental health, and sedentary behavior. The investigators hypothesize that the TCQ program will be more effective than usual care in reducing LBP and improving mental health and sedentary behavior. The investigators will also explore the mechanisms by which the TCQ program reduces LBP. The investigators will use qualitative methods to understand the participants' experiences with the TCQ program. The investigators will also use wearable activity trackers to measure sedentary behavior. The investigators will use a mixed methods approach to analyze the data.

Population-based newborn screening (NBS) is an important public health program that has vastly improved the course of several diseases through early detection. The selection of screened disorders generally follows the 10 principles outlined by Wilson and Jungner. In Germany, NBS has been a voluntary National Health Service program since 1969 which currently covers 17 disorders. Current NBS methods, which employ tandem mass-spectrometric analysis of newborn dried blood spots, cannot detect many potentially treatable genetic conditions. At the same time, molecular-based NBS is increasingly feasible because DNA can be extracted from a dried blood spot, next generation sequencing has become economical, and molecular diagnostics have greater reliability and increased validity as genetic databases become more refined and comprehensive.\nNephropathic cystinosis and hyperoxaluria (PH) are eligible for molecular-based NBS because effective therapies are available. In a first pilot project, the scientific basis for NBS for cystinosis could already be established. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the transferability of genetic NBS for Cystinosis to other laboratories and to lay the scientific basis for screening for PH. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis.\nCystinosis. Nephropathic cystinosis, due to impaired transport of cystine out of lysosomes, occurs with an incidence of 1 in 100-200,000 live births. It is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome in the first year of life and glomerular dysfunction progression to end-stage kidney disease by approximately 10 years of age. Treatment with oral cysteamine therapy helps preserve glomerular function, but affected individuals eventually require kidney replacement therapy Cysteamine treatment generally begins at the time of diagnosis in the second year of life, but some glomerular and tubular damage has already occurred by then. This situation could be ameliorated by diagnosing patients shortly after birth, employing molecular genetics-based newborn screening.\nStandard mass spectrometry-based methods for newborn screening cannot"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 5-10%. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation, and polycystic ovaries. The pathogenesis of PCOS is not fully understood, but it is known that insulin resistance (IR) and inflammation play a role. IR is present in 60-70% of women with PCOS and is associated with hyperandrogenism and anovulation. In addition, IR is linked to obesity, which is a common feature of PCOS. IR is characterized by high levels of insulin, which can lead to compensatory beta-cell hyperfunction and hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia, in turn, can cause further IR by downregulating insulin receptors. IR is also associated with low-grade inflammation, which is characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6. IR and inflammation are interconnected, as IR can lead to inflammation and inflammation can contribute to IR. The link between IR and inflammation in PCOS is not well understood, but it is thought that inflammation may contribute to IR by reducing insulin sensitivity. Diosmin/hesperidin is a flavonoid complex that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It has been used in the treatment of varicose veins and chronic venous insufficiency. Recently, it has been suggested that diosmin/hesperidin may also be useful in the treatment of PCOS. In a study published in 2016, diosmin/hesperidin was shown to improve IR and inflammation in women with PCOS.

To date, radical surgery remains the best curative option in patients with early-stage lung cancer. Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to frequent diagnoses of indeterminate lung lesions, many requiring surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention. Nevertheless, minimally invasive surgery (e.g., video-assisted thoracic surgery -VATS- and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery -RATS- ) remains the surgical approach of choice in order to reduce the significant morbidity of classic surgery, the surgical trauma, to preserve organs function and to improve patient's quality of life. Nevertheless, minimally invasive surgery does not consent to manual lung palpation, making localizing the not superficial lung nodule problematic. Several approaches have been developed to enhance the localization of indeterminate lung nodules and decrease the time to diagnosis and rate of conversion to open surgery. Nevertheless, none of these is 100% sensitive or without complications, also of severe grade. Numerous pre-operative methods are being employed, including percutaneous CT-guided placement techniques, encompassing the use of microcoils, hook-wires, and spiral-wires. These devices can support nodule localization during minimally invasive lung procedures; nevertheless, they could be easily displaced during patient transport and positioning, intraoperative atelectasis, single lung ventilation, and surgeon manipulation. Moreover, some locations of the lung as the apex, near the diaphragm, and the proximity of mediastinum and great vessels. Furthermore, all these pre-operative localization techniques require two different procedures, one for the CT-guided referral placement and one for surgical treatment. Finally, the rate of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and subcutaneous emphysema are not insignificant, and these complications are mandatory to avoid in several sub-groups of patients. Of note, methylene blue has limited application in patients with anthracotic pigmentation. Moreover, also these procedures remain complicated"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHemodiafiltration (HDF) is a blood purification technology that combines hemodialysis and continuous hemofiltration. Compared with conventional hemodialysis (HD), HDF can effectively remove middle molecules and large molecules, and has the advantages of reducing the concentration gradient of small molecules, reducing the burden on the heart and vascular access, and improving the clearance of toxins and fluid. However, the clinical benefits of HDF are still controversial. The main reason is that the conventional HDF mode uses post-dilution to replace the dialysate with a large amount of substitution fluid, which will dilute the patient's blood and reduce the clearance of small molecules. In addition, the use of a large amount of substitution fluid will increase the burden of the circulation system and the risk of hypotension. In order to solve the above problems, the investigators developed a new HDF mode-hemodiafiltration with endogenous reinfusion (HFR). In this mode, the blood purification machine is equipped with a reinfusion pump, and the patient's own blood is reinfused after purification, which can effectively improve the clearance of small molecules and reduce the dilution of blood. In addition, the use of endogenous blood reinfusion can reduce the use of substitution fluid, reduce the burden on the circulation system, and reduce the risk of hypotension.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Liver transplantation (LT) is currently recognized as the most effective treatment for selected patients with HCC. However, recurrence of HCC remains a major challenge after LT, with a reported incidence of up to 70% within 5 years. The recurrence of HCC is mainly attributed to the presence of high-risk factors at the time of LT, such as exceeding the Milan criteria, the presence of major vascular invasion, microvascular invasion, satellite nodules, recurrence after liver resection, and incomplete tumor ablation.\nThe current standard of care for patients with HCC and high-risk recurrence factors after LT is surveillance and early re-intervention upon detection of recurrent tumors. However, the prognosis of patients with recurrent HCC after LT is generally poor, with a median survival of approximately 2 years. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective adjuvant therapies to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC and high-risk recurrence factors after LT.\nSorafenib, lenvatinib, and regorafenib are multikinase inhibitors that have been widely used in the treatment of advanced HCC. These drugs have been shown to inhibit the proliferation, angiogenesis, and metastasis of HCC cells, and have demonstrated survival benefits in patients with advanced HCC.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the use of multikinase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy after LT may effectively prevent the recurrence of HCC in patients with high-risk recurrence factors. The investigators plan to conduct a randomized, open-label, multicenter, phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multikinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy in patients with HCC and high-risk recurrence factors after LT.

This is pragmatic research trial that has stemmed from our feasibility trial involving therapy SEGT for dysvascular lower extremity amputation (LEA) inpatients. Pragmatic trials stand in contrast to randomized controlled trials (RCT's), which instead examine causal relationships and are characterized by rigorous designs, featuring randomization, blinding and allocation concealment, to eliminate bias. Despite yielding results with high internal validity and statistical credibility, RCT's are not always generalizable to real life practice. Perhaps to address this, pragmatic trials are growing in popularity. Pragmatic trials aim to test interventions in routine clinical settings to maximize applicability and generalizability as well as to determine whether an intervention works under real life conditions. As a complement to our previous feasibility trial, the goal of this work is to understand the effectiveness of SEGT upon mental health outcomes among individuals with limb loss. Hence, the objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic trial using a SEGT intervention for addressing anxiety and depression for inpatients with limb loss. This two-arm pragmatic trial will evaluate if SEGT leads to better mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety) for inpatients with limb loss compared to those patients who receive treatment as usual (TAU). Over a 2 year period, 130 inpatients will be recruited for this trial, with 65 being assigned to the SEGT arm and 65 to a TAU condition who receive standard care only (which may include an individual psychiatric consultation). The proposed intervention is based on the evidence-based supportive-expressive (SEGT) approach and was designed by an interprofessional team from psychiatry, social work, physiatry and occupational therapy, along with patient advisors. The SEGT approach fosters mutual support, promotes openness and emotional expression. It has been shown to yield improvements in anxiety, psychosocial functioning, health literacy, and social support in breast cancer survivors.

During continuous recruiting, sample size calculation is to be carried out to determine the actual number of patients included in this study.\nSurgical planning: The upper jaw of the patient is scanned using an intraoral scanner (IOS, Trios 4, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark). Cone beam tomography (CBCT) scans (Green X, Vatech, Hwaseong, Korea) are performed before surgical exposure to assess the position, angulation, possible dilaceration, and bone coverage of the impacted canines.\nIn the test group OnyxCeph\u00b3\u2122 software is used to register the standard tessellation language (STL) file of the digital impression with the Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) data of the pre-operative CBCT reconstruction by surface registration. A surgical template is designed to cover the palate, incisal, and occlusal surfaces of the dentition with an opening that outlines the window to be prepared to expose the impacted canine. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) is used for the rapid prototyping of the surgical template (FlashForge Creator Pro 4, Zhejiang Flashforge 3D Technology Co., Ltd, Jinhua City, China) using polylactic acid filament (PLA).\nSurgery: In both groups patients rinse their oral cavity with 0.2% chlorhexid"

CAVEAT is based on an amalgam of four existing evidence-based psychotherapy models (Child-Parent psychotherapy, Parental Mentalization, Interaction Guidance, Prolonged Exposure) for parents, infants and young children and traumatized adults that led to the novel, core therapeutic technique developed by Prof. Schechter and colleagues Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Session(s) or CAVES which has been shown to be successful in positively altering mothers' perception of their young children in two open trials. From the existing literature, the investigataors know that parent-child relationship-based psychotherapies improve significantly maternal sensitivity to their child's communication, which is in part based on maternal capacity to perceive more accurately the young child's emotional communication and to take the child's perspective. Moreover, dyadic psychotherapy models using video-feedback and support of parental mentalization have been shown across models more generally to improve the quality of mother-child interaction. Risk / Benefit Assessment The risks of participating in this study are estimated as minimal (category A). The proposed intervention involves standard, validated psychotherapeutic procedures with the addition of clinician-assisted videofeedback exposure to naturalistic challenges that are typically stressful for young children and that are in situation by the clinician in collaboration with the child's mother during the filmed parent-child interaction sessions. This latter technique has been used without complication in both mental health referred and non-referred pediatrics samples with positive clinical effects in both studies. The investigators estimate that the risks of such an intervention are therefore limited. Though, if a matter arises that is severe, urgent or cannot be dealt with in the psychotherapy as conceived in the model, based on the therapist assessment, proper interventions and/or referrals will be made.

GDM is diabetes diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy and has traditionally been considered a benign condition because typically glucose levels return to normal after delivery. Women with pregnancies complicated by GDM often progress to develop T2D later in life. There is evidence that holistic lifestyle modifications that include strategies to improve dietary intake, physical activity, and mental well-being can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. The use of digital health interventions can also assist in the prevention of T2D. However, limited studies have been conducted with Asian populations. This study aims (1) to identify post-GDM women from large community settings in Singapore and to assess the efficacy of a holistic lifestyle digital intervention (focusing on diet, physical activity, sleep, and mental well-being) on glucose regulation with those identified women. Secondary objectives are: (a) to examine the potential impacts of the proposed intervention on the health and well-being of subjects' family members (e.g., children); (b) to determine the diabetes risk of the subjects over a 3-year follow-up period; (c) to explore potential economic impacts of the proposed intervention (e.g., healthcare expenditures); (d) to study the importance of gut microbiota and epigenetic factors in relation to changes in glucose metabolism, and (e) to ascertain the safety of the proposed intervention.

The primary treatment goals of this disease consist in controlling local disease, reducing the risk of distant metastases, and avoiding enucleation whenever possible. Plaque brachytherapy is currently the standard treatment for small and medium-sized uveal melanomas. In clinical practice, ruthenium (Ru-106) or iodine (I-125) are the most commonly employed radioisotopes. Ruthenium is the most utilized radioisotope in Europe and South America due to its availability and good clinical outcomes. It is currently the only available option in Brazil's public health system (SUS). However, its use for large tumors (greater than 10 mm in thickness and/or 22 mm in diameter) is limited by the inability of delivering an adequate therapeutic dose of radiation without causing further damage to the surrounding retinal tissue. For this reason, researchers in medical physics have been investigating new treatment options in the last decades, including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radiosurgery (gamma knife or linear accelerator), and proton beam therapy. Although gamma knife radiosurgery and proton beam therapy are effective treatments with reliable tumor control rates, they are associated with poor visual outcomes, inadequate globe retention, and their use is reportedly limited in public health systems of low- or middle-income countries. EBRT carries potential side effects related to a broader radiation field, with an increased risk for complications in ocular and periocular structures, such as eyelids, sclera, lens, and retina. Finally, enucleation is an effective management for very large tumors, but it is usually a last resource. Considering the above-mentioned treatment limitations for large choroidal melanomas, our group explored an alternative approach using intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) for tumor chemoreduction, aiming to reduce thickness and allow subsequent brachytherapy using a Ru-106 plaque.

Non-pharmacologic epilepsy treatments, such as specialized diets like the low glycemic diet or the modified Atkins diet, are not well studied in pregnant people with epilepsy but have proven to be effective in reducing seizures in the non-pregnant population. Dietary influence on seizure control is likely multifactorial, and recent studies have shown that one mechanism of action is to cause changes in the gut microbiome and alter neuroactive downstream bacterial metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (Olson et al., 2018). The low glycemic index (LGI) diet is one of the most flexible dietary therapies for epilepsy, and it appears to be safe in pregnancy with positive health outcomes for both the mother and baby (Walsh et al., 2012).

The standard treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgical resection. However, only 10-20% of patients are diagnosed at an early stage when surgical resection is feasible. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of R0 resection. In the ESPAC-5 study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival. The Charit\u00e9 Onkologie (CONKO-007) trial showed that the addition of radiation to chemotherapy improved R0 resection rate and complete pathological response (pCR) but did not impact on OS. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein minimally expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed in about 80% of PDAC. Mesothelin plays a role in tumorigenesis by increasing cell proliferation, migration and S phase cell population. Its limited expression in normal human tissues and high expression in many cancers make it an attractive tumor-related antigen for cancer treatment. There are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CART cell therapy. EUS-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival."

CPB is an artificial circulation that replaces the function of the heart and lungs during surgery. It is a complex technique that can lead to multiple organ dysfunction. The main risk is related to the lack of oxygen and nutrients supply to the tissues. To date, the optimal management of oxygen supply during CPB remains unclear.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a new strategy of oxygen supply optimization during CPB on postoperative complications. The investigators will compare the standard care (calculation of oxygen supply using the traditional formula) to a new strategy based on the use of a new software (CONNECT, LivaNova, London, United Kingdom). This software allows a continuous calculation of oxygen supply using CPB output and hemoglobin values.\nThe investigators will also evaluate the incidence of postoperative complications (acute kidney injury, delirium, vital status checklist) in relation to the level of oxygen supply.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the new strategy of oxygen supply optimization during CPB will lead to a better postoperative outcome."

Over the past decades, the prevalence of ASD has increased worldwide. Scientists have been trying to explore the molecular mechanisms behind the pathology of ASD. Several evidence suggests that genetic factors such as chromosomal abnormalities and environmental factors like diet and stress are involved in the pathogenesis and advancement of ASD.\nAccumulating research has demonstrated the gut-brain axis or multiple biochemical signaling pathways that take place between the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the central nervous system (CNS), and its possible association with ASD. Mounting evidence explains that gut microbial dysbiosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), coeliac disease (CD), and ASD. A Recent Egyptian study showed that an evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of ASD children compared to the unrelated controls. However, the microbiome profile of siblings was more like that of autistic children than that of unrelated controls.

The prevalence of AF is increasing year by year, and the incidence of AF in people over the age of 80 is as high as 10%. AF is associated with a five-fold increased risk of stroke, a two-fold increased risk of heart failure and a 1.5-fold increased risk of all-cause mortality. The impact of AF on patients' quality of life (QoL) is significant. The symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, and dizziness caused by AF can seriously affect the physical, psychological, and social well-being of patients. In addition, the fear of stroke and the need for long-term anticoagulation therapy also have a negative impact on the mental health of patients. The impact of AF on patients' QoL is similar to that of other chronic diseases such as heart failure and coronary heart disease. The QoL of patients with AF is significantly lower than that of the general population. The QoL of patients with AF is closely related to the frequency and duration of AF episodes, the severity of symptoms, and the patient's coping ability. In addition, the patient's perception of the disease and the social support he or she receives also have a significant impact on the QoL. Therefore, it is very important to improve the QoL of patients with AF. The first step is to understand the factors that affect the QoL of patients with AF. At present, there are few studies on the QoL of patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF). The research on the QoL of patients with persistent AF (PeAF) and permanent AF (PerAF) is more.

The standard treatment for rectal cancer is total mesorectal excision (TME) followed by anastomosis. However, this approach may lead to postoperative complications, anastomotic leakage, and functional impairment. In selected patients with early rectal cancer, local excision (LE) has been proposed as an alternative to TME. LE is a minimally invasive technique that allows for the removal of the tumor with a low risk of complications and preservation of the anal sphincter function. The aim of this study is to evaluate the success rate of LE in the treatment of early rectal cancer. The investigators will also analyze the morbidity rate, radicality of resection, histological poor outcome predictor rate, and radical rescue surgery specimen quality. The investigators will conduct a prospective, multicenter, observational study. The investigators will include patients with clinical staging cT1N0M0 rectal cancer. The investigators will perform LE using transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM). The investigators will follow the patients for 36 months. The investigators will evaluate the success rate of LE in terms of the need for salvage TME. The investigators will also evaluate the morbidity rate, radicality of resection, histological poor outcome predictor rate, and radical rescue surgery specimen quality. The investigators will use the Kaplan-Meier method to estimate the overall survival, disease-free survival, local recurrence-free survival, and overall mesorectal resection-free survival.

In Korea, the prevalence of obesity in adults over 20 years old was 32.5% in 2015, which is the highest among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Obesity is closely related to various diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and is a major cause of cardiovascular disease and cancer.\nSleeve gastrectomy is a surgical method that removes a large portion of the stomach and is widely used in the treatment of obesity. General anesthesia is essential for this surgery. However, obese patients have a higher risk of anesthesia than normal weight patients. In particular, the incidence of hypotension during anesthesia induction is higher in obese patients than in normal weight patients. Propofol is a commonly used anesthetic for anesthesia induction. However, propofol can cause hypotension by reducing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output. Recently, remimazolam, a new ultra-short-acting benzodiazepine, has been used as an anesthetic induction agent. Remimazolam has the advantage of not causing hypotension during anesthesia induction, and it is expected that it can be used safely in obese patients.\nTherefore, in this study, the investigators will compare the incidence of hypotension during anesthesia induction in obese patients who underwent laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy with remimazolam and propofol."

It is caused by a defective protein, called CFTR, which regulates the movement of salt and water into and out of cells. This causes a build-up of thick sticky mucus in the organs, particularly the lungs and gut.\nThe thick mucus makes it easier for bacteria to infect the lungs and can cause permanent lung damage. Most children with CF are prescribed antibiotics to take every day to help prevent infections. These antibiotics are called tetracyclines and have been used for many years.\nIn 2019, a new drug called elexacaftor/ tezacaftor/ ivacaftor (ETI) became available.

As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedtomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal epidural blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nLung transplantation has become a standard treatment for patients suffering from end-stage lung diseases. One of the major obstacles in the modern transplant era is the fact that the need for organs by far exceeds availability. This leads to growing waiting lists with mortality rates ranging between 10-30%. On the other hand, up to 80% of offered lungs from brain dead donors are rejected because they do not meet predefined donor selection criteria. Recently, ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has become available as a tool to expand the donor pool. Based on experimental work by Stig Steen, the Toronto lung transplant group developed an EVLP system with the purpose to evaluate lungs with uncertain quality. Consequently, Aigner et al. have expanded the indications for EVLP by showing that primarily unacceptable donor lungs can be reconditioned and then become suitable for transplantation. This concept of organ repair by EVLP has recently been highlighted by a number of publications.\nHemodiafiltration (HDF) is a variation of conventional HD. By the addition of a substitution solution, convection forces are significantly increased. This substitution solution is added to the blood and is completely removed again in the dialyzer. This increases the negative pressure on the dialysate side and the removal of toxins through convection. The substitution solution can be added in a pre-dilution (before the dialyzer) or post-dilution (after the dialyzer) manner. Pre-dilution is associated with longer run times, less filter clotting, but is also less effective in removing toxins. Post-dilution offers a better toxin clearance capacity, but is associated with an increased risk of filter clotting. Several studies have shown that HDF provides higher clearance rates for both small and middle molecule solutes. Moreover, effective cytokine removal has been shown in HDF both in acute and chronic renal disease patients.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the addition of HDF to EVLP will improve the regeneration of marginal donor lungs. The investigators will conduct a prospective randomized pilot study in which the investigators will compare the effect of HDF to standard EVLP. The investigators will include 20 patients in total.

Therefore, finding effective interventions for retinopathy examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants.\nA randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The examination success rate was defined as the ability to complete the retinopathy examination without disturbances caused by infant distress or movement.\nThe study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed retinopathy examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups.\nThe findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated retinopathy examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants.

The diagnosis of MGD is based on the presence of typical clinical signs, such as loss of meibomian glands (MGs), MG dysfunction, and MG destruction. The most commonly used grading system for MGs was proposed by Westcott et al. in 2007. This grading system is based on the percentage of the eyelid surface occupied by MGs, which is calculated by dividing the area of the MGs by the area of the whole eyelid. The area of the MGs is determined by counting the number of MG orifices in a predetermined area of the eyelid and multiplying this number by the orifice density (ORI). The ORI is calculated by dividing the Wessel's test line length by the number of MG orifices. The area of the whole eyelid is calculated by dividing the WTW distance of the cornea by 2. The Westcott grading system has been widely used in clinical trials and research studies. However, the calculation of the area of the whole eyelid using the WTW distance of the cornea has been criticized because the WTW distance of the cornea varies among individuals. In this study, the investigators propose a modified calculation formula for the area of the whole eyelid. The investigators will compare the MG grading results using the original and modified calculation formulas in a group of 100 participants.

Improper pain management affects patients' psychological status with prolongation of hospital stay time and rehabilitation period, with the possibility of progression of the acute pain to chronic pain (McCartney CJ, Nelligan K., 2014). Many Pain management options following these surgeries are available: non-opioid analgesics, opioids and regional anesthesia techniques (epidural and peripheral nerve block). Multi-modal analgesia is considered the best option for pain management in knee surgeries. As non-opioid analgesics alone are not effective enough while opioids alone are associated with many risk factors: nausea, vomiting, decrease intestinal motility and respiratory depression with possibility of addiction (Goode VM, Morgan B, et al, 2019). Regarding the functional anatomy of the nerve supply to knee joint: The knee is innervated by genicular branches from the nerve to vastus medialis, saphenous nerve, sciatic nerve and the posterior division of obturator nerve. The skin around the knee is supplied by the cutaneous branches from the femoral nerve and the saphenous nerve (Ritesh Roy, Gaurav Agarwal, et al, 2018). The widespread use of ultrasound to advance peripheral nerve block techniques over the past decade has led to enormous growth in the utilization and efficiency of regional anesthesia (Cozowicz, Crispiana & Poeran, et al, 2015). The adductor canal block (ACB) is an interfascial plane block performed in the middle third of the medial side of the thigh. The adductor canal bounded anteriorly by the sartorius muscle, posteriorly and medially by the adductor longus and magnus muscles, and laterally by the vastus medialis muscle. It contains the femoral vein and artery, the saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus medialis, both are sensory branches of the femoral nerve.

It is defined as pain, muscle tension, or stiffness in the area between the lower ribs and the lower gluteal folds, with or without leg pain. The prevalence of low back pain is high, with an estimated 80% of the population experiencing low back pain at least once in their lifetime. Chronic low back pain, which lasts longer than 12 weeks, is a common type of low back pain that can significantly affect an individual's quality of life.\nThe aim of this study was to compare the effects of connective tissue massage and classical massage on pain, functional status, and quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. The study was designed as a 3-arm randomized controlled trial, parallel-group study with blind outcomes assessor. The study was conducted with 30 participants diagnosed with chronic non-specific low back pain. The participants were randomly divided into three groups: the CTM group (n=10), CM group (n=10), and control group (n=10). The intervention duration was uniform across all groups: 4 consecutive weeks, with 3 sessions per week lasting 15-20 minutes per session. Outcome measurements were taken at the beginning and 4 weeks after the completion of the program.\nThe CTM group was administered connective tissue massage, which involves manipulating the soft and deep tissues of the body. The CM group was administered classical massage, which involves manipulating the soft tissues of the body. The control group was administered a standardized physiotherapy program that included the application of superficial thermal heat, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and therapatic ultrasound.\nThe results showed that both connective tissue massage and classical massage were effective in reducing pain, improving functional status, and enhancing quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. However, connective tissue massage was found to be more effective in improving lumbar mobility compared to classical massage and the control group."

Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults. Some patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty.\nLemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events. While lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with dementia. Understanding the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of lemborexant will be helpful in an N of 1 trial to understand the details of effect and effectiveness in individual patients living with dementia and insomnia."

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women, according to the cancer registration report of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW), in 2014, up to 11,976 women suffered from breast cancer, which meant 33 women suffered from breast cancer daily. Recent epidemiology further disclosed that the incidence of breast cancer was top-ranked (70.74 per 100,000) among cancers of Taiwanese women in 2014. Due to the fact that majority of breast cancers are estrogen-receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive, tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are among the mainstay therapies to treat breast cancer. Prior clinical studies of tamoxifen suggested that up to 80 % of patients experienced hot flashes during therapy with tamoxifen, and 30 % defined their symptoms as severe.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nA stroke is a syndrome defined as an abrupt neurological outburst due to impaired blood flow to part of the brain. There are two types of stroke: hemorrhagic stroke and ischemic stroke. A hemorrhagic stroke follows the rupture of a weakened blood vessel in the brain causing accumulation of blood and compression of the surrounding brain tissue. An ischemic stroke follows a blocked blood vessel by a thrombus (blood clot) or embolism. In both types of strokes, the specific region of the brain supplied by the affected blood vessel is deprived of oxygenated blood, causing local hypoxia that damages the brain tissue and cells. Both types of stroke are very serious, however ischemic stroke is more common. The global burden of ischemic stroke is nearly 4-fold greater than hemorrhagic stroke with close to 87% of the total incidence of stroke attributed to acute cerebral ischemic stroke (ACIS). ACIS is a critical care emergency caused by a significant reduction in blood flow to the brain by a blood clot or embolism. This nearly halts cerebral blood flow to the affected region leading to neuronal death. Neuronal cell death is followed by plasma membrane disruption, swelling of organelles, leaking of cell contents into extracellular space, and loss of neuronal function. Other events that take place include inflammation, excitotoxicity, free radical mediated toxicity, cytokine mediated cytotoxicity, impaired blood-brain-barrier, and oxidative stress. Therapeutic management of ACIS is a multidisciplinary approach with a primary goal of revascularization and limiting neuronal injury.\nSovateltide (PMZ-1620, IRL-1620) is a highly selective ETB receptor agonist and a synthetic analog of ET-1. Studies conducted to determine the effects brought about by sovateltide upon its interaction with neural ETB receptors and have found that it enhances angiogenesis and neurogenesis as well as promotes neural repair and regeneration.

MGD is defined as ''a chronic, diffuse anomaly of the meibomian glands, often characterized by terminal duct blockage and/or qualitative/quantitative alterations in glandular secretion'' by the International Workshop on MGD. These glands are modified sebaceous glands that release meibum directly onto the ocular surface. Signs and symptoms of EDE and MGD can be addressed by improving the quality and quantity of meibum secretion. Intense pulsed light (IPL) is widely used to treat dermatological conditions, and its noncoherent polychromatic light source with wide wavelength range of 500-1200 nm has been reported to stimulate facial sebaceous glands. The photothermal effect of IPL is postulated to relieve inflammation by removing aberrant surface microvasculature and enhances meibomian gland function. Furthermore, an increase in fibroblast proliferation, collagen formation and local blood flow has been associated with the application of IPL on the skin. Several studies have documented the benefits of IPL in alleviating signs and symptoms of DED on the periocular skin. Diquafosol ophthalmic solution (DQS) is a dinucleotide polyphosphate which a purinoceptor agonist, when administered to the ocular surface, it binds to P2Y2 receptors and stimulates mucin and tear secretion. The corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium, lacrimal gland ductal epithelium, meibomian gland sebaceous cells, and meibomian gland ductal cells all express the P2Y2 receptor. Subsequently, enhanced secretion of mucin and tear secretion due to DQS ophthalmic solution leads to stabilization of the tear film, minimizes tear evaporation, and reduces mechanical friction thereby protecting the corneal epitheli"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground:\nImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are a new class of cancer therapy that have revolutionized the treatment of many cancers. They work by blocking proteins called immune checkpoints, which are proteins that can act as a brake on the immune system. Blocking these proteins allows the immune system to attack cancer cells more effectively. However, while ICI can be very effective at treating cancer, they can also cause side effects, some of which can be serious or even life-threatening. One of the most common side effects of ICI is inflammation of the joints, known as immune-related arthritis (irAA).\nThis study will evaluate the use of methotrexate to treat irAA in patients receiving ICI therapy. Methotrexate is a drug that is commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It works by suppressing the immune system.\nObjective:\nThe primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of methotrexate in treating irAA in patients receiving ICI therapy.\nEligibility:\nPatients who have developed irAA while receiving ICI therapy for cancer.\nDesign:\nParticipants will be treated with methotrexate for 12 weeks. The starting dose of methotrexate will be 20 mg per week. If the irAA improves, the dose of methotrexate may be reduced after 4 weeks of treatment.\nParticipants will also be given a steroid called prednisone to take for the first 8 weeks of the study. The dose of prednisone will be gradually reduced over the course of the study.\nParticipants will have regular follow-up visits during the study. At these visits, the participant's condition will be assessed and the dose of methotrexate may be adjusted as needed.\nAfter the 12-week treatment period, participants will have a follow-up visit 4 weeks later. If the irAA has improved, the participant will stop taking methotrexate. If the irAA has not improved, the participant may continue taking methotrexate for an additional 12 weeks.\nAfter the study is completed, participants will be followed for 6 months to see if the irAA recurs."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSleep is one of the basic physiological needs of man and is necessary for the normal functioning of the body. Sleep disorders can impair cognitive function, decision-making ability, exercise capacity, and immune system. Sleep disorders, which may occur in the perioperative period as short-term or long-term, affect many patients. Studies have shown that approximately 8.8-79.1% of patients experience perioperative sleep disorders, and this situation can continue for a long time after surgery. According to animal and human studies, anesthetic agents may cause sleep disturbances in the postoperative period. Anesthetics can disrupt the normal sleep-wake cycle and thus cause sleep insufficiency and poor sleep quality. Since postoperative pain and emotional changes will also cause sleep disturbances, the view that general anesthesia impairs postoperative sleep quality has not yet been proven. Pain is the most important risk factor for sleep disturbance in the perioperative period. There is a very serious interaction between pain and sleep. Pain can exacerbate sleep disorders. At the same time, sleep disorders can make the pain worse. Perioperative pain accompanies physical discomfort and is very common, especially in osteoarthritis patients. The goals of total hip arthroplasty (TKA) include relief of these pains and improvement of physical function. Different types of surgery have varying effects on sleep quality. Patients report that they experience more sleep disruption due to pain after orthopedic surgery. Depending on the greater trauma caused by major surgery, the sleep quality of the patients may be worse. The elderly and female gender are more likely to experience sleep disorders. Environmental factors and healthcare practices in the hospital may contribute to sleep disorders. Postoperative environment change, inadequate beds, noise and lights in the ward, medical staff, night treatment and nursing controls, machine noises, postoperative diets and warnings from the urinary catheter are additional factors that affect patients' sleep. Evaluation of sleep disorders is mainly based on clinical symptoms (difficulty falling asleep, early awakening, night terrors, nightmares or abnormal behavior during the sleep period) and auxiliary objective scales.

The intervention involves the use of a neuro-stimulation technique, the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS), combined with a psychotherapy intervention, metacognitive therapy (MetaCognitive Therapy, MCT). TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique involving the transcranial application of a low-amperage electric current at a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been demonstrated how such stimulation has a neuromodulating effect on synaptic plasticity, with efficacy in unipolar major depression. The technique also has a good safety, as it is not associated with major side effects. MCT is based on the metacognitive model, according to which psychopathological processes are consequent to a cognitive style characterized by repetitive forms of thinking (such as rumination) and maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and thought suppression. The MCT, through attention training techniques, detached mindfulness and behavioral interventions on metacognitions, has shown effectiveness in major depressive disorder comparable to that of psychotherapies considered, within psychotherapies, to be first-line such as cognitive-behavioral therapy.

However, it is important to consider the GI bleeding risk when using DAPT and to determine whether Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed to prevent such accidents. DAPT, or aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, complementarily reduce platelet activation and aggregation and consequently reduce the progression of coronary thrombosis. We have reported whether PPI use is associated with ischemic events or mortality in patients with DAPT up to date, but we have shown conflicting results depending on the type of study conducted. Observational studies generally show that PPI increases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, angina and stroke, while RCT studies show that it does not. This difference can be explained by the selection bias. This is because observational studies generally attempt to reduce selective bias through correction of basic patient characteristics, but unmeasured differences in underlying variables continue to affect the results. method : Among patients who performed PCI in patients with CAD, enrollment is performed in patients with moderate risk in gastrointestinal risk assessment indicators. After obtaining the consent form, patients are randomly assigned to the gastric acid secretion inhibitor group and the non-dose group. Researchers and subjects proceed with the treatment group assignment, treatment-group assignment uses a random number table and the assigned drug is disclosed. Random checks are generated by statisticians and managed by the researchers. In the test group, the incidence of gastrointestinal clinical events in DAPT patients is expected to be low while taking PPI, but there is a burden of PPI costs. In the case of the control group, the burden of PPI costs is reduced, but there is a possibility that the incidence of clinical events may occur, although it"

The incidence of lower back pain among workers is approximately 13%. Out of which, CRLBP is responsible for 11%. In the lumbosacral region, radicular pain has an occurrence rate of 10 % to 25%. Key interventions by physical therapists involve pain relieving modalities, stretching, muscle conditioning, lumbar traction, and awareness about correct postures that lead to useful exercises. As the reason behind the radicular low back pain is the spinal nerve compression due to the spinal canal impingement, the lumbar traction lightens the pain through vertebral separation producing decompression on the pressed nerve. Radicular low back pain shows diverse symptoms, it can be self-limiting, staying only for a short interval with no aftereffects, or can be a key concern behind long-term disability and work loss. The narrative on the effectiveness of vertical traction as a component of physical therapy modalities is contradictory. Despite the fact that lumbar traction has been preferred over other methods for the treatment of lumbar disk disorders, it is usually not advised in the treatment of acute low back pain because of the efficiency of more active treatment options. The aim of the study is to determine the effects of vertical sitting versus supine lying traction on pain, range of motion, and function in patients with radicular low back pain. This study may help physiotherapists to have an estimate of the best possible position for applying traction in patients with radicular low back pain.

The tool also allows patients to identify their personal preferences for stroke prevention, and to see how these preferences match with the different OACs. The tool then summarizes the patient's risk and preferences in a report that can be shared with their doctor.\nThe investigators are now conducting a pilot study to evaluate the impact of this decision aid on the process of shared decision-making for stroke prevention in patients with AF. The investigators will compare patients who use the decision aid with patients who do not. The investigators will measure the impact of the decision aid on patient knowledge, decision quality, and the concordance between patient preferences and their selected stroke prevention therapy.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nRespiratory failure is a common problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). It is defined as an inability of the respiratory system to provide adequate gas exchange to the tissues. It is classified into two types: hypoxemic respiratory failure (type 1) and hypercapnic respiratory failure (type 2). Type 2 respiratory failure is characterized by hypoventilation and retention of carbon dioxide (CO2). It is often caused by a failure of the central nervous system to drive ventilation, a decrease in the compliance of the respiratory system, or a combination of both.\nNon-invasive ventilation (NIV) and high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy (HFNC) are two methods of non-invasive respiratory support that are commonly used in patients with acute respiratory failure. NIV is delivered through a mask that covers the nose and mouth. It works by applying positive pressure to the airways during inspiration, which helps to open the lungs and improve breathing. HFNC delivers warm and humidified oxygen through prongs that fit into the nostrils. It provides a high flow of oxygen, which helps to open the airways and improve breathing.\nThe aim of this study is to compare the efficiency of HFNC and NIV in patients with acute moderate hypercapnic respiratory failure. The study will be conducted in the ICU of Kasr El Ainy hospital. The study will include 100 patients who will be randomly assigned to receive either HFNC or NIV. The study will last for 2 years.\nThe primary outcome of the study will be the failure of treatment modality. The secondary outcomes will be mortality, ICU stay, length of mechanical ventilation, and the number of complications.\nThe study will help to determine the efficiency of HFNC in patients with acute moderate hypercapnic respiratory failure. It will also help to determine the rate of complications associated with HFNC and NIV."

The disease is common in young adults, and the most common symptom is wrist pain. The disease is classified into four stages based on the degree of bone collapse and arthritic changes. The treatment of Kienbock's disease is controversial. In early stages, conservative treatments such as immobilization, anti-inflammatory drugs, and activity modification may be effective. In more advanced stages, surgical treatments such as vascularized bone grafts, osteotomies, and arthrodesis may be necessary.\nOsteotomies are bone surgeries in which a section of bone is cut and repositioned. In Kienbock's disease, osteotomies are performed to relieve pressure on the lunate bone and improve blood flow. There are two types of osteotomies that are commonly used in Kienbock's disease: radius shortening and capitate shortening.\nRadius shortening involves shortening the radius bone, which is located on the thumb side of the wrist. This reduces the distance between the radius and the lunate, which relieves pressure on the lunate.\nCapitate shortening involves shortening the capitate bone, which is located in the middle of the wrist. This also reduces the distance between the radius and the lunate, which relieves pressure on the lunate.\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of radius shortening and capitate shortening in the treatment of Kienbock's disease.

The etiology of pregnancy loss remains largely unknown, although genetic, anatomical, endocrinological and immunological abnormalities have been implicated. It is known that embryonic/fetal chromosomal aberrations contributed to approximately 50% of early pregnancy loss, among which 60-70% were aneuploidies, largely can be detected by the current gold standard karyotyping approach recommended by various international societies. However, the drawbacks of conventional karyotyping included the risk of culture failure, maternal cell contamination (MCC), limited detection resolution (5-10 Mb), and differential growth of specific cell lineages which could hinder the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities, particularly mosaicisms. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has brought genetic testing to new frontiers, expanding the scope of detectable genomic variants. Our customized shallow read-depth genome sequencing analytical pipeline, namely low-pass genome sequencing (GS), enables efficient and cost-effective detection of genome-wide copy-number variants (CNVs, >50 kb) and low-level chromosomal mosaicisms (as low as 10%). Furthermore, the roles of cryptic structural rearrangements, absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) were less understood in current studies. Various versions of sequencing platforms targeting at different variants were already established and validated in the Prenatal Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, including FetalSeq, ChromoSeq, and 30xWGS.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nFrostbite injury has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for as long as humans have experienced cold winters. When frostbite occurs, there are two primary mechanisms through which tissue damage occurs, though the main mechanism focused on here is systemic cooling. Frostbite is a multiphase process that starts with systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury, but it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. At Regions Hospital, the main diagnostic method that has been used for over 20 years is conventional angiography. This clearly demonstrates the microvasculature of the tissues and allows the intra-arterial catheter directed sheaths to be placed to start thrombolytics, heparin, and vasodilators to treat the tissue ischemia. Other diagnostic modalities used elsewhere include Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT imaging, and indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography. All of these imaging modalities demonstrate the perfusion of the affected tissue but do not allow for directed delivery of thrombolytics. In institutions that use these imaging techniques, th"

According to studies conducted in recent years, these athletes have a high risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) later in life. It has been reported that there are increases in the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers and that some other biomarkers (such as BDNF, zonulin, telomere length, etc.) that may be associated with these may be adversely affected in American football players. It is necessary to develop new approaches to determine the preventive factors against the risk of neurodegenerative diseases that may occur in the later years of life due to contact sports such as American football. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has antioxidant (vitamins, flavonoids, phytosterols, minerals, terpenes and phenols) and anti-inflammatory (oleic acid, polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids) properties that are thought to be effective in improving oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers.

Soft tissue sarcomas are a type of cancer that can appear anywhere in the body where there is soft tissue such as muscle or fat. While sarcomas are rare, benign lumps in soft tissue are common and it is currently very difficult to tell the difference between the two using imaging. This means many patients with benign masses are referred for painful biopsies and waiting lists for biopsies are long due to the large diagnostic workload. This research aims to develop an AI algorithm that can differentiate between benign and malignant soft tissue masses. While an algorithm can be developed using existing routine data the researchers would like to investigate if adding quantitative MR images could make it more accurate. Patients who are already having a scan for sarcoma will be asked if they consent to extra MR images being acquired. These images will be used to provide extra information to the AI. The extra images will add a maximum of 10 minutes to the patients' standard MRI scan, meaning patients will not need to make an extra trip or undergo any extra procedures. Study participants will not need to receive MR contrast as part of this research. The extra images will not be used to make a diagnosis during this research.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMigraine is a neurological disease/disorder originating in the central nervous system with difficulty modulating responses to common sensory stimuli. It is characterized by being unilateral, frontotemporal, pulsatile, of moderate or severe intensity, nausea and/or vomiting, sensitivity to movement, visual, auditory, and other afferent stimuli may appear. In addition, other symptoms such as fatigue, neck stiffness, decreased concentration, mood swings and yawning may appear, and the headache may be anticipated up to 48 hours. It has been hypothesized that the possible relationship between the eyes and the pathophysiology of migraine is due to the trigeminal-cervical complex, since if there is an alteration it would be established by a nociceptive impulse that can trigger central sensitization in the trigeminal nuclei. Today, the quintessential treatment is pharmacological where the excessive use of medications can trigger possible side effects such as depression, anxiety, weight gain, fatigue and drowsiness, among others, causing an alteration in the patient's quality of life more than of the migraine attack. Several studies show that there are other non-pharmacological treatment options such as manual physiotherapy and therapeutic exercise for migraines, and that it is effective for reducing the intensity and frequency of attacks, the use of medication and improving the quality of life. Being preventive treatments in order to avoid the frequency and intensity of these attacks. At present, the role of oculomotricity in headache, although it may be promising, has not been extensively studied. In the literature that the investigators have reviewed, the investigators have found very few studies that investigate manual therapy directly on the eyeball, despite the great relationship of the trigeminal-vascular nerve with migraines and how it influences the different variables. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the impact and possible additional benefits of adding an oculomotor treatment to a manual therapy protocol of the cervical region in patients with migraine."

It is performed at the level of the lumbar plexus, which is located in the retro-muscular plane of the psoas major muscle. The BPLE can be performed blindly or with ultrasound guidance. The ultrasound guidance allows a better precision and a lower number of side effects. The lumbar plexus is located at the level of the anterior aspect of the vertebral bodies, between the psoas major muscle and the posterior aspect of the quadratus lumborum muscle.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men significantly increases with age and is estimated to impact over 80% of men 70 to 80 years of age. HoLEP is one of many treatments for BPH and associated lower urinary tract symptoms. Compared to other minimally invasive surgical techniques for treatment of BPH, HoLEP has been found to have superior outcomes and is a prostate size-independent procedure with excellent durability, high efficacy, and low complications rates. However, transient stress urinary incontinence (SUI) following HoLEP may last for several months after surgery and can lead to diminished patient quality of life during the recovery period. Measures to prevent or reduce post-operative SUI following HoLEP, including pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT), may improve patient outcomes. SUI is also commonly documented after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. The mechanism for incontinence in both RP and HoLEP is thought to at least partially be related to temporary weakness of the external urinary sphincter, which is part of the pelvic floor musculature. While it is unclear if post-operative PFPT alone reduces SUI for patients who have undergone RP, there is evidence that PFPT started pre-operatively and continued post-operatively can decrease SUI following RP. The utilization of pre-operative PFPT for patients undergoing HoLEP to reduce SUI is currently not well documented. To date, only one study has demonstrated evidence that PFPT prior to HoLEP may improve continence at 3 months. However, the study included patients with a BMI significantly lower than average in the United States, utilized an unclear PFPT program, and had a relatively small median prostate size ( 60 mL), which is important as studies have shown that prostate size can affect post-operative incontinence. We propose a prospective randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of standardized pre-operative PFPT in reducing SUI and improving patient QoL following HoLEP. This study will help determine the role of pre-operative PFPT in the management of HoLEP associated SUI."

The disease often presents with swollen lymph glands in the neck, groin or armpits. The disease can remain stable for many years, but eventually most patients will need treatment. The most common first line treatments are rituximab plus chemotherapy or rituximab alone. About 20-40% of patients do not respond to or relapse within 2 years of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24). These patients have a poorer prognosis and risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival.\nThe investigational drug mosunetuzumab is a new antibody that has shown very high response rates and long response duration in patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to standard treatments. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients with POD24.\nThe main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients.\nObjectives:\nThe main objective is to investigate the efficacy of mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24.\nThe secondary objectives are to investigate safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event\nprognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab\nrate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab\npatients\u00b4 self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab\nresource usage related to mosunetuzumab\nInterventions:\nMosunetuzumab is administered subcutaneously (SC) as described below.

Survivors of critical illness experience cognitive, psychological and physical impairments, known as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS), that can last months to years following critical illness. Across the lifespan, ICU recovery has far-reaching implications for independent functioning, employment, and healthcare utilization, costing billions annually. Older adults are at risk for ICU- acquired cognitive decline discernible from clinical, biological, and imaging-related changes in the brain following delirium and critical illness. Similar to other forms of dementia, the combination of normal aging paired with cognitive deficits associated with critical illness survivorship places these older adults at high risk of automobile crashes. To address ICU-acquired cognitive decline, driving assessments to characterize risky driving behaviors are promising to guide driving rehabilitation and intervention development. Rigorous and reproducible driving safety assessment programs have demonstrated success in post-stroke and dementia contexts, established via in-vehicle and virtual modes. The investigators hypothesize that in-vehicle driving assessment and monitoring is a feasible and acceptable approach to assess and address ICU survivor driving safety. The investigators seek to implement novel in-vehicle cloud-data collection technology developed by the investigators' team.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and surgery is the preferred treatment method for primary resectable GIST. The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors. Existing studies have explored the drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection assisting patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to use TKI. Therefore, this one-arm prospective observational clinical study will assist some high-risk GIST patients who have been treated with imatinib for 3 years after surgery and have achieved disease control to adopt the treatment mode of drug holiday based on MRD detection, aiming to evaluate the value of MRD detection in monitoring postoperative recurrence of high-risk GIST, investigate the effect of drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection on disease recurrence and patient survival, and to explore whether it can delay the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations."

The persistent pulmonary hypertension and systemic vascular paralysis during the perioperative period are the main causes of early postoperative death and serious complications such as organ failure.\nCatecholamine vasoactive drugs commonly used in cardiac surgery may aggravate the condition of pulmonary hypertension, while the use of drugs to reduce pulmonary hypertension, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may worsen the state of systemic vascular paralysis.\nVasopressin and oxytocin are two effective components in pituitrin, and vasopressin is the main component that exerts strong vasoconstrictive effect.\nVasopressin binds to receptors distributed in vascular smooth muscle, pituitary and kidney, and exerts its effects by regulating adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel function, nitric oxide production and enhancing vascular response to catecholamine.\nIn addition, oxytocin can also bind to the receptors distributed in the heart and vascular endothelium, and play a role by releasing atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide.\nTherefore, pituitrin can not only constrict systemic circulation vessels and increase systemic circulation pressure, reduce pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, but also protect the heart and kidney.\nTherefore, this study intends to explore whether pituitrin has an impact on the prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery, so as to provide reference for its clinical application."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChildren with medical complexity (CMC) are increasingly prescribed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) for chronic respiratory failure. In our clinical experience, patients and families would prefer NiPPV initiation in the home environment but this is not standard of care. This proposal will evaluate the feasibility and safety of an innovative model of care for NiPPV initiation in the home environment utilizing remote telemonitoring compared to usual care which is in-hospital polysomnography (PSG) laboratory-based initiation. The incidence of CMC requiring NiPPV is exponentially growing. NiPPV effectively corrects abnormal gas exchange, improves sleep quality, and reduces symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. The use of NiPPV has been associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To ensure effectiveness, NiPPV must be used for all periods of sleep and settings must be individually-titrated. Unfortunately, poor adherence results in many CMC being undertreated for chronic respiratory failure. Successful NiPPV initiation is critical because early negative experiences are commonly reported barriers to adherence and early usage predicts longer term use. Standard of care is the initiation and titration of NiPPV during a one-night in-hospital PSG. A PSG is challenging for CMC and families due to their medical fragility and lasting effects of travel and a disrupted routine, the significant amount of equipment and supplies that must be brought to the study as well as the financial implications and additional psychosocial stress for caregivers. In addition, negative experiences with NiPPV may be exacerbated by introduction of the therapy in an unfamiliar PSG laboratory with burdensome monitoring. Furthermore, a one-night PSG provides limited sleep data that may not be representative of dynamic and variable sleeping patterns that occur in the comfort of one's home. Recent technological advances in remote NiPPV monitoring coupled with a shift to virtual care models has enabled a patient and family centered opportunity to bypass the PSG laboratory and initiate NiPPV at home. Remote NiPPV monitoring extends data collection beyond discrete health care encounters and provides real-time data on adherence and efficacy that can be wirelessly transmitted to facilitate setting adjustment by clinicians. Home NiPPV initiation is increasingly being requested"

The disease is heterogeneous and can affect the skin, joints, entheses, and other organs. The prevalence of PsA is estimated to be 0.3% in the general population. The disease can have a significant impact on health-related quality of life and work productivity. The treatment of PsA is aimed at controlling inflammation and preventing joint damage. The treatment of PsA is similar to that of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The first-line treatment is with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). If the disease is not controlled with NSAIDs, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are used. If the disease is not controlled with DMARDs, biologic agents are used. The most commonly used biologic agents in PsA are anti-TNF agents and anti-IL-17 agents. However, not all patients respond to these treatments. In addition, some patients experience side effects from these treatments. Therefore, there is a need for new biomarkers that can help predict which patients are more likely to respond to a particular treatment.\nObjectives: The main objective of this study is to identify new biomarkers that can help predict the response to biologic treatments in PsA. The study will also investigate the similarities and differences between PsA and RA.\nMethods: The study will be conducted in two parts.

Neurological symptoms, particularly cognitive deficits and fatigue, are common in PCS, with a higher prevalence in female patients (Boesl et al., 2021; Ceban et al., 2022). The underlying causes of PCS remain unclear, but some evidence suggests autoimmune mechanisms may play a role. Currently, there are no proven treatments for PCS, leading to a need for effective therapies. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the impact of methylprednisolone, a generally well-tolerated and affordable drug, on cognitive deficits in PCS patients with suspected autoimmune involvement. The objective is to demonstrate improvement in memory satisfaction as measured by the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome treated with Methylprednisolone compared with placebo. Methylprednisolone is a well-known immunosuppressant used for multiple diseases of (suspected) autoimmune etiology. This is a two-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial spanning 52 weeks, and participants will be stratified based on age, sex, and cognitive screening using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA). They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Methylprednisolone (including a tapering phase) or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by an additional 6 weeks of open treatment phase with Methylprednisolone after a 6-weeks treatment pause. During the study, follow-up visits will be conducted as outpatient visits in weeks 8 and 20, with a final telephone follow-up after 52 weeks. The screening and baseline examinations will involve recording of medical history, checking inclusion and exclusion criteria, and conducting clinical examinations. The intervention group will receive approximately 1mg/kg body weight oral Methylprednisolone once daily for 6 weeks, with dosage reduction after week 4. The other group will receive a matching placebo once daily for 6 weeks,"

Moreover, when vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible or not indicated, the surgical method should be laparoscopic, because total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) provides a faster return to normal activity, shorter hospital stays, lower intraoperative bleeding and fewer wound infections, compared with abdominal hysterectomy. However, longer operating times and higher incidence of urinary system damage are seen in laparoscopic hysterectomies. Cesarean section (CS) is the most commonly performed surgery on women and has increased significantly in the last 15 years. Various reasons account for the increase in CSs, including an increase upon maternal request, changes in maternal demographics (e.g., increasing maternal age), changes in physician practice patterns, more conservative practice guidelines, and mounting legal pressures. Because of the gradually increasing rates of cesarean sections (CSs) over the last two decades, the number of hysterectomized patients with previous CSs has increased. In a recent review article, previously performed CSs were demonstrated to be an important risk factor for lower urinary tract injuries, and the recommendation that abdominal hysterectomy might be preferable for these patients was emphasized. TLH may be technically difficult in patients with previous CSs,"

The players have to perform various actions like running, jumping, throwing, hitting the ball and many more. All these actions require a high level of strength and power. Resistance training is one of the best ways to improve strength and power. There are two types of resistance training full-body resistance training and split-body resistance training. In full-body resistance training, the whole body is trained in a single session and in split-body resistance training, the body is divided into two parts and each part is trained on alternate days. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of split-body and full-body resistance training on strength and functional performance in cricket players. 28 cricket players will be taken in this study. The participants will be divided into two groups. One group will perform split-body resistance training and the other group will perform full-body resistance training. Both groups will perform resistance training for 6 weeks. After 6 weeks the strength and functional performance of both groups will be compared.

The recurrence rate of colorectal polyps is as high as 20% to 30%, and the recurrence rate of large polyps is as high as 40% to 50%. The recurrence of colorectal polyps is closely related to the genetic mutations of adenomatous polyposis (APC) and TP53 genes. The APC gene is the most common gene mutated in colorectal polyps and CRC. The TP53 gene is the most frequently mutated gene in human tumors. The mutation of TP53 gene is closely related to the progression of colorectal polyps to CRC. The mutation of APC and TP53 genes can be detected by DNA sequencing.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPerioperative stroke is a significant complication after surgery. Unfortunately, covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline. Further, perioperative overt stroke is associated with an 8-fold increase in perioperative mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay, and decreased quality of life. For shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position, due to systemic hypotension and reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral desaturation events and impaired cerebral autoregulation can occur in up to 80% of patients. Most perioperative stroke in non-cardiac surgery is ischemic and is related to brain hypoperfusion. Importantly, brain hypoperfusion is potentially modifiable with simple measures such as increasing systemic blood pressure (BP) if brain ischemia is identified early enough. However, deliberate hypertension is not devoid of risk and there is currently no effective monitor that can detect brain hypoperfusion during surgery. Cerebral oxygenation has been used clinically as a measure of adequate brain perfusion during surgery. An early clinical trial at Western found that monitoring cerebral oxygenation was associated with fewer cases of major organ dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients. Despite this promising initial finding, current commercial cerebral oximeters have a number of limitations that prevent reliable perioperative neuromonitoring, including non-specificity due to signal contamination from extracerebral tissue, especially during administration of vasoconstrictors or hypothermia. In addition, current commercial cerebral oximeters only have two channels to monitor the frontal lobe regions (i.e., anterior cerebral artery territory). This monitoring strategy assumes that cerebral oxygenation is homogenous across different brain regions so that measurements from the frontal regions can be used clinically to represent the adequacy of global brain oxygenation. Such a limited spatial coverage may result in undetected stroke, despite the patients having apparently normal cerebral oxygenation in the frontal regions throughout surgery. The current research project employs multi-channel tr-fNIRS to address these limitations, with the goal of timely detection and prevention of ischemic brain injury. Multi-channel tr-fN"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nFunctional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) develops due to functional and structural alterations related to heart failure (HF), mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation. An increase in cardiac filling pressure due to left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction leads to left atrial, right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) remodeling, which causes tricuspid annular dilatation and TR. The development of significant functional TR causes RV dysfunction and further dilation of RV, which deteriorates TR. Functional TR may occur with HF with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF), and the prevalence of moderate-to-severe functional TR is around 19% in patients with HF. Regardless of LVEF or pulmonary artery pressure, presence of moderate or severe functional TR is associated with more symptoms, reduced cardiac output, and worse renal function. A vicious cycle of significant TR, RV volume overload, adverse remodeling of RA, RV, and tricuspid annulus, and consequent aggravation of TR is suggested as a pathophysiologic mechanism of the poor clinical outcomes of patients with TR, and the presence of moderate or severe functional TR is a strong independent determinant of mortality in patients with HF. Because functional TR has a strong prognostic impact and plays an important pathophysiologic role in patients with HF, functional TR is suggested as a therapeutic target in HF. However, there have been no proven medical therapies for TR and only loop diuretics are cautiously recommended for relief of congestive symptoms in patients with severe TR and signs of RV failure. In patients with functional TR associated with systolic dysfunction, medical therapy for HF with a reduced EF may diminish functional TR by improving LV systolic function. Otherwise, the morbidity and mortality of patients with functional TR remain high and a novel therapeutic agent is needed to improve clinical outcomes of HF patients with functional TR and a preserved LV ejection fraction.

SLD; According to DSM-5, the academic difficulties experienced are explained in detail by dividing them into three subgroups. These are dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The incidence of SLD is approximately 33% in girls and 67% in boys between the ages of 6-12. The ethology of SLD is multifactorial. It is associated with multiple genes and environmental risk factors. Structural imaging studies in children with SLD have revealed that grey matter is reduced. As a result of low grey matter, early literacy education seems to be negatively affected, and fine motor skills such as writing play an important role in this influence. Writing is a complex activity that includes perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Writing activities require a high level of fine motor coordination, postural control, adjustable grip strength, visual perception, and language skills. Considering the studies, it is stated that children who go to primary school spend 31%-60% of their academic days with tasks involving fine motor skills, and most of them do activities such as writing and painting. In addition to their academic and writing performances, children with SLD perform differently in daily life compared to their healthy peers. In general, they have difficulties during self-care activities such as tying shoes, clipping their nails, buttoning/zipping, shaving, and performing activities that require sequencing. At the same time, children with SLD have difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control. Difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control seen in children with SLD affect proximal stability. When proximal stability is poor, distal movements cannot be performed in good quality. Therefore, adequate postural control and proximal stability are essential prerequisites for many activities of daily living. In the literature, it has been shown that grip strength and anthropometric characteristics of the upper extremity affect distal fine motor skills. In a study by Anakwe et al., it was shown that grip strength increased as the forearm circumference"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe current standard approach to the management of extremity soft tissue sarcoma is a combination of radiotherapy and limb preserving surgery. Currently guidelines recommend preoperative conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, which involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. Preoperative hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) is an approach that can shorten the duration of treatment. Clinical outcomes with preoperative HFRT in STS have been reported from retrospective case series, prospective institutional registries and phase I-II trials. However, preoperative HFRT has not been compared in a prospective randomized trial to CFRT and due to the rarity of extremity soft tissue sarcoma, attempts to develop such a trial would face feasibility challenges. Therefore, single arm trials of preoperative HFRT will be critical to defining the feasibility, toxicity, efficacy, and potential improvement in access to care associated with this approach.\nRadiation therapy combined with wide local excision in the preoperative or postoperative setting optimizes local control for extremity STS. Preoperative radiotherapy confers a higher rate of wound complications but a lower rate of irreversible sequela such as fibrosis and lymphedema compared with postoperative radiotherapy. Resultantly, preoperative radiotherapy is the preferred approach in most cases. Preoperative radiotherapy with CFRT given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. The burden of daily travel and time away from work or care giving can be a barrier to utilization of radiotherapy. A recent analysis of the National Cancer Database demonstrated that farther distance to treatment was a negative predictor for receipt of radiotherapy in extremity STS. Sociodemographic factors such as female sex, older age (>70 years), Black race, and noncommercial insurance coverage were also negatively associated with receipt of radiotherapy. The authors summarized that radiotherapy is underutilized in the treatment of STS and that sociodemographic disparities exist in access to radiotherapy.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPrimary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) is a common subtype of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) that affects approximately 15% of people with MS. People with PPMS experience a steady accumulation of disability from the onset of symptoms, with no relapses or remissions. There are currently no disease-modifying therapies for PPMS. The investigators believe Remote Ischemic conditioning (RIC) is ideally suited to be tested as a therapy for progression in MS. RIC is a simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive intervention that involves inducing short periods of cyclical tissue ischemia (reversible lack of blood flow) that confers subsequent protection against ischemia-reperfusion-injury. The investigators will investigate whether RIC treatment can prevent disability worsening in people with PPMS. This is a phase II open-label, single-center, single-arm futility trial. The study will follow the Simon-2-stage MiniMax design for futility studies. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-futility of RIC for reducing progression of disability, as measured with the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), in people with PPMS."

This condition causes physical, psycho-social, and economic problems.1 It is more prevalent in women than in men. It occurs in women during pregnancy, childbirth, or menopause. It can also be triggered by factors such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus, chronic urinary infections, hysterectomy, and obesity.2,3 While urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening condition, it significantly impacts the quality of life for women. It leads to social phobia, social isolation, reduced self-confidence and self-esteem, embarrassment, psychological issues, as well as individual and societal costs.2-4 Urinary incontinence represents a growing burden in numerous countries.5 (Milsom et al., 2014). Urinary incontinence constitutes a significant public health issue when considering the global female population, their participation in the workforce, and their role in social life.6 Urinary incontinence afflicts more than 40% of women worldwide.7 (Liu et al., 2014). The prevalence of UI is 48.3%, 46.4%, 31.9%, and 18.7% in women over 18 years of age living in Germany, Denmark, China, and Norway, respectively.8-10 The prevalence of UI is 23.6% in women aged 45-60 years living in Brazil.11 The prevalence of UI ranges from 16.4% and 49.7 in Turkish women.12 The projected number of women with UI in the United States is expected to reach 28.4 million by 2050.13 Investigators believe that the prevalence of UI may be underestimated because many women either seek healthcare assistance late or not at all due to perceiving it as a natural consequence of aging or childbirth or because they feel embarrassed about the issue. Furthermore, only a small fraction of women who are diagnosed with UI receive effective treatment.2,3,14 More than half of women with UI (66.4%) take approximately three years to seek medical assistance due to fears of stigmatization and a lack of information"

It is caused by a break in the retina that allows the fluid from the vitreous cavity to pass under the retina, detaching it. The standard treatment of RRD is pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) combined with sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponade. However, the anatomical success rate of PPV alone is lower in large retinal tears and in the presence of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Scleral buckling (SB) is a well-established technique that has been used for many years to treat RRD. It is a procedure that involves placing a band or buckle around the eye to apply pressure to the wall of the eye and push the retina back into place. The use of SB in combination with PPV has been shown to be more effective than PPV alone in large retinal tears and in the presence of PVR. However, SB is associated with cosmetic problems such as scleral scarring and strabismus.\nIn this study, the investigators will compare the anatomical success rate of PPV alone with that of PPV combined with SB in the treatment of RRD.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe administration of intravenous anesthetics in the elderly population requires adequate titration to avoid deleterious effects derived from overdosing or underdosing. Older patients show greater sensitivity to similar doses of propofol compared to younger patients. In addition, there is extensive interindividual variability among older patients, which would also explain the different responses to the same dose of drugs. This variability would be secondary to differences in comorbidities and physiological age, in contrast to chronological age, which would not explain the differences found in response to anesthetics in these patients. One way in which an attempt has been made to make the doses of anesthetics in different patients comparable is the use of models that predict what infusion rate is required to maintain a given concentration at the site of drug action. The relationship between a propofol effect site concentration (Ce) with a given effect can be represented by pharmacodynamic (PD) models. Recently, Eleveld et al. created a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for the administration of intravenous propofol in a population of wide ages, including neonates to older patients. However, the pharmacodynamic parameter used in this model was the BIS index, which has been questioned for its use in older adults. In addition, the creation of this PD model only included 3 patients older than 70 years, so the underrepresentation of this age group in the construction of the model could affect its performance, making it even more difficult to correctly predict the effect in this population.\nAnesthetic drugs exert their desired hypnotic effect on the brain. Brain electrical activity can be monitored non-invasively by recording electrical potential on the cranial surface using electrodes. The electroencephalographic (EEG) changes observed with the administration of anesthetics are usually systematic across different patients. These have been described and have been used to identify different phases of anesthetic depth or hypnosis. In addition, the representation of the EEG signal by means of a spectrogram has facilitated the incorporation of this information into commercial EEG monitors that previously only included highly processed indices such as the BIS.\nWithin the EEG patterns of the spectrogram described for anesthetic maintenance with prop"

This study posits the hypothesis that very low total doses of orthovoltage radiotherapy, delivered in a single fraction, may provide pain relief comparable to that achieved with higher doses of fractionated radiotherapy.

Exercise therapy is an evidence-based treatment for CLBP both general exercises and cognition-targeted exercise therapy have shown beneficial effects on pain in patients with CLBP. Unfortunately, current treatments for CLBP apply a 'one-size-fits-all' approach and do not address comorbidities like obesity. This knowledge gap is now acknowledged internationally: overweight and obesity are increasingly recognized as a plausible therapeutic target for people with CLBP. Despite the growing body of scientific literature pointing towards the close interaction between overweight/obesity and CLBP few treatment programs for people with CLBP nowadays take overweight into account. Here we propose studying the added value of a behavioral weight reduction program combined with Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) and Cognition-Targeted Exercise Therapy (CTET) for overweight or obese people with CLBP. Both interventions (experimental and control) are organized equally: all participants will receive 18 treatment sessions over a 14-week period. The control intervention will consist of only the chronic-pain-focused interventions: 3 sessions of PNE in the first 2 weeks & secondly, 15 sessions of CTET in the remaining 12 weeks. The experimental intervention will consist of a total of 18 treatment sessions distributed over 14 weeks. The first part will consist of chronic-pain-focused interventions: firstly, 3 sessions of PNE in the first 2 weeks & secondly, 15 sessions of CTET in the remaining 12 weeks. The second part will consist of a more weight-reduction-focused intervention. The weight reduction intervention is a lifestyle approach that will be integrated in the CTET intervention, implying that grading daily physical activity and exercise levels will aim at reducing weight (i.e. together with a change in diet we aim at a caloric deficit of 500 to 700 kcal/day) and improving pain cognitions at the same time.\nStudy design: Randomized controlled trial with follow-up assessments directly post-treatment (T1), 3 months post-treatment (T2), 6 months post-treatment (T3),"

The clinical symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, post-prandial fullness, bloating, belching, and upper abdominal discomfort. The gastroparesis cardinal symptoms index (GCSI) is a reliable, reproducible, and valid instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. It is based on three sub-scales (post-prandial fullness/early satiety-4 items; nausea/vomiting-3 items; bloating-2 items), and each item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (severe). GCSI is not a diagnostic tool, but it is helpful to measure the severity of the disease and the post-treatment improvement.

Patients with mild symptoms can be referred for dietary modifications coupled with medical therapy with prokinetics, especially metoclopramide. However, the response to prokinetics decreases over time.

Several studies indicate that current early intervention programs may not significantly alter long-term clinical outcome, suggesting that critical treatment target(s), beyond symptoms and functional status, are not being addressed. Evidence strongly indicates that, along with cognitive dysfunction, impaired motivation is also a critical target and unmet therapeutic need. The investigators have demonstrated both behavioral gains and improved neural system functioning after neuroscience-informed cognitive training in schizophrenia, in both chronic and early phases of the illness. In young recent-onset individuals (average age of 21 years), the investigators' multi-site double-blind randomized controlled trial showed that 40 hours/ 10 weeks of cognitive training delivered at home over a laptop resulted in significant gains in global cognition, verbal memory, and problem solving compared to a computer games control condition. Cognitive gains were significantly correlated with enhanced thalamic volume and thalamo-cortical connectivity, as well as increased white matter integrity. A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs in early schizophrenia has also indicated the benefit of cognitive remediation approaches. Impaired motivation is also a core feature and very strong predictor of functional outcome in early stages of psychosis. Some studies have shown positive effects in improving motivation immediately after the intervention, but treatments that induce enduring improvements in motivated behavior are scarce. Disturbances in motivated behavior reflect a range of factors, including diminished anticipatory pleasure, difficulty learning from rewarding outcomes, reduction in effort expended to obtain rewarding outcomes, and impairment and disconnection between components of social motivation. This makes it difficult to determine optimal therapeutic approaches. However, some headway is starting to appear in the literature. For instance, social cognition impairments appear to play a specific contributing role to dysfunctions in motivated behavior, and are amenable to intervention. We have found that ratings of motivated behavior improve after social cognition training, and are significantly greater in subjects who performed cognitive training combined with social cognition training, than in those who completed only cognitive training. The investigators have also demonstrated a significant relationship between 6-month social functioning and training-induced improvements in the neural correlates of a self-other reality monitoring task."

On the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe extremity artery is the peripheral blood vessel of the whole body, and it is often involved early in the diseases that are easy to damage the small vessels, such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases. Early lower limb atherosclerosis mainly occurs in the dorsal foot artery, which is commonly seen in people with diabetes and long-term smoking. Connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus also mainly involve small blood vessels, and vascular lesions may appear earlier than those of other specific organs such as heart and lung. Because of its shallow location, the extremity artery can be better used as a screening site for vascular diseases, and it is the window for early reaction of vascular diseases.\nHowever, the early stage of extremity artery disease is easy to be ignored, and patients often have pain and numbness of the affected limb. When the disease is severe, it can lead to ulcer not healing, and even limb gangrene and amputation, which greatly affects the quality of life and brings huge troubles and economic pressure to the patients. Therefore, early diagnosis of extremity arterial lesions is of great significance for early diagnosis of microvascular injury diseases such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases, reducing the incidence of complications, and reducing the rate of amputation and mortality.\nUltrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in clinic. In recent years, with the development of ultrasound technology, the frequency of ultrasonic probes has been increasing. Because of its higher resolution, high-frequency ultrasound can clearly display the superficial vascular structure and blood flow, detect vascular lesions early, and accurately quantify the degree of stenosis, providing a new and beneficial tool for clinical observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities.\nThe purpose of this multi-center clinical study was to establish the normal value of high frequency ultrasound for the structure and blood flow of the extremities of Chinese Han adults, and to explore its influencing factors, so as to provide a quantitative reference for the early diagnosis, degree evaluation and curative effect observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe purpose of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of STERIFY GEL in promoting healing of periodontal pockets following SRP, compared with treatment with SRP alone.\nWith specific visco-elastic and mucoadhesive properties, STERIFY GEL easily penetrates into the deepest and hard-to-reach areas of periodontal and peri-implant pockets, adhering to the gingival tissue and alveolar bone, providing complete coverage of the pockets. The effect of STERIFY GEL is promoted by a physical mechanism of action. After SRP, the gel is applied into the gingival pocket, where it acts primarily as a filler to restore volume, physically preventing bacteria from entering and reinfecting the pocket. STERIFY GEL can thus mechanically protect treated pockets and bone defects, promoting tissue healing. The occluding action at the level of periodontal and peri-implant gingival pockets, in synergy with the accessory action of hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, prevents bacterial recolonization and promotes subsequent tissue regeneration.\nAlthough SRP surgery is considered a gold standard treatment for periodontitis, it may in some cases be insufficient to decontaminate the pocket allowing bacteria to recolonize the tissues promoting new inflammation that can worsen the clinical picture.\nSTERIFY GEL may find useful application in cases of moderate to severe chronic periodontal disease as an adjunctive treatment following SRP to improve and accelerate healing parameters and prevent recurrent inflammation and infection.\nIn addition, antimicrobial control action prevents antibiotic use and the risk associated with antibiotic resistance.\nSuch control of periodontal disease also allows for the maintenance of patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment (e.g., patients on bisphosphonate therapy, defected etc.)."

Persistent hippocampal dysfunction contributes to the unremitting nature of PTSD years after the acute event. The upshot is not only amnesia, but also difficulty in memory contextualization and neutralization. Improved hippocampal function may contribute to better access to memories of a traumatic event and to memory contextualization and neutralization. Memory processing is essential for PTSD recovery.\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding one atmosphere absolute. HBOT has been applied worldwide, mostly for chronic non-healing wounds. Our team demonstrated that HBOT induced hippocampal neuroplasticity in veterans with long-standing treatment-resistant PTSD; this led to enhanced memory recovery and significant improvement in PTSD symptoms. The investigators also demonstrated effects of HBOT on memory recovery among women with fibromyalgia due to childhood sexual abuse. Both physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, and cognitive training were shown to support neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate whether hippocampal training, induced by physical and cognitive training, will augment the hippocampal neuroplasticity effect of HBOT and further enhance recovery of inaccessible memories in veterans with PTSD.\nThe protocol will include forty male veterans aged 25 to 60 years, with combat-associated PTSD and peritraumatic amnesia, who will receive either HBOT alone or HBOT and hippocampal training.

Elaborate preparations are required for patients including either a low-carbohydrate diet followed by long fasting or heparin loading before FDG-PET. In heparin loading, the rare adverse effect of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be considered. Therefore, it is of interest to find a PET/CT tracer that displays high sensitivity and specificity without requiring thorough patient preparation and minimizing any adverse effects. A potential tracer is the somatostatin-based tracer 64Cu-DOTATATE, which is routinely used for the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Inflammatory cells, including macrophages that are found in sarcoid granulomas, express somatostatin receptors on their surface, whereas normal cardiomyocytes do not. This allows for the potential use of macrophage imaging in cardiac sarcoidosis. In the CuDOSIS trial, groups A and B (suspected and confirmed cardiac sarcoidosis, respectively) will be scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT in addition to the routinely performed 18F-FDG PET/CT. Further, to examine whether the macrophage infiltration pattern is different in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and other inflammatory heart diseases, a group of patients with confirmed or clinically suspected myocarditis will be included (group C); this group will only be scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT. Finally, data from a group of patients with neuroendocrine tumours (negative controls) who have previously been scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE will be included."

The investigators propose the following scientific hypothesis: In patients with depression, levels of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin in different brain regions may fluctuate at different stages of the disease progression and treatment, along with changes in the activation levels of different brain regions. Neuroimaging studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of depression suggest a reduction in gray matter volume in emotion processing areas such as the limbic system, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Previous neuroimaging studies have found that successful cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) accompanied changes in gray matter volume in the brain, as observed through fMRI. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), which is a component of the third wave of CBT, is expected to exhibit more significant expression in cognitive task-based fNIRS during IPT treatment for depression. In this project, the investigators will implement medication therapy, psychotherapy, and a combination of medication therapy with psychotherapy, specifically utilizing IPT, in patients with depression. Simultaneously, the investigators will conduct comprehensive fNIRS assessments on all patients to evaluate changes in their brain function and determine the level of effectiveness of psychotherapy. The investigators will also employ standardized psychological assessments to evaluate patients, allowing for a comparison of the effectiveness of fNIRS assessments and providing clarity on the efficacy of psychotherapy in patients with depression, as the investigatorsll as the differential efficacy of different treatment approaches, and establishing the biological markers of psychotherapy.

The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2018, there will be 64,690 new cases of HNSCC in the United States and 13,710 deaths from the disease. The standard of care for patients with HNSCC is surgical resection, which often includes removal of lymph nodes from the neck (called a neck dissection). The goal of the neck dissection is to remove any cancer that may have spread to the lymph nodes.\nThe current standard of care for identifying lymph nodes involved by cancer is to perform a physical exam and/or an imaging study (such as a magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] scan) prior to surgery. During the surgery, a blue dye is injected near the tumor in the mouth and the surgeon looks for blue-stained lymph nodes to identify which lymph nodes should be removed. However, the blue dye does not always spread to the lymph nodes and the physical exam and imaging studies are not always accurate. As a result, some patients undergo a more extensive neck dissection than necessary, removing more lymph nodes than needed, and other patients may have cancer-containing lymph nodes left behind.\nThe purpose of this study is to determine if a new imaging agent called 111In-panitumumab can be used to identify lymph nodes involved by cancer prior to surgery. 111In-panitumumab is a radioactive form of a drug called panitumumab, which is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HNSCC. The investigators will give the drug as an injection into a vein 1-5 days before surgery. The investigators will then use a special camera to detect the drug in the lymph nodes.

It is currently believed that it may be related to abnormalities in the function of the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex.\nThe treatment of GAD mainly includes psychotherapy and drug therapy. However, the effect of psychotherapy is limited, and the recurrence rate is high after drug therapy is stopped.

Obstruction can occur at any level along the lacrimal drainage system: punctum, canaliculus, nasolacrimal duct, or nasal ostium. It is seen more often in females, especially in postmenopausal women. The etiopathogenesis of lacrimal passage obstruction appears to be multifactorial. Chronic inflammation has been suggested to be the most causal. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a standard surgical procedure used to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), with a reported success rate of more than 90%. Knowledge concerning the morphological characteristics of lacrimal passage obstruction using traditional diagnostic methods (e.g., lacrimal irrigation, probing, dacryocystography) is limited. Dacryoendoscopy was originally described in 1979 and has recently matured for use in lacrimal drainage system imaging. It has been proved to be a useful instrument not only for understanding differences in the etiology of obstructions but also for treating LD obstructions. On the other hand, semiconductor diode laser can achieve more effective tissue dissection than direct probing technique with minimal hemorrhage and improved intraoperative view. Hence, dacryoendoscopic-assisted laser dacryoplasty with silicone intubation (DLDI) offers direct therapy to the obstructed site, leading to minimal collateral damage external to the target zone. In addition, this procedure can be performed under local anesthesia as an outpatient procedure in the office, and it has advantages such as short surgery time and less risk of bleeding during surgery, resulting in its increasingly widespread use in China. Although the silicone intubation using dacryoendoscopy has increased the success rates, the success rates vary from a low of 51% to a high of 90%. The difference in success rates seems to depend on the site of obstruction, differences in the surgical technique, stringency of definitions of success, and duration of follow-up.

Most existing treatments focus on a subset of mental disorders and do not address subthreshold or multi-disorder mental health problems. Furthermore, available treatments are limited in efficacy and most youth in need do not receive treatment due to social stigma and structural barriers such as geographical distance to treatment providers. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of a digital emotion regulation treatment in adolescents with mental health problems. Participants will be randomized to a digital emotion regulation treatment or to an active comparator. Treatments in both conditions will include therapist support, and will be delivered in a blended treatment format combining asynchronous therapist-guided online modules with one synchronous session delivered over video-link. The primary endpoint is at post- treatment. Primary objectives: To test the effects of POET on mental health problems. To test the effects of POET on emotion regulation. Secondary objectives: To test if emotion regulation mediates reductions in mental health problems during treatment. To test if POET is cost-effective.

About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk clinico-pathologic features that can increase risk of local recurrence (LR). Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence. Despite the lack of high level evidence, ART is indicated in patients according to unfavorable prognostic factors. ART benefit is generally questioned in regard to the potential degradation of the patient's quality of life (QoL). Currently there is no prospective trial or recommendations that take into account geriatric patients' evaluation and profiles during the management of NMSC. In addition, there is no data that could help to define the subgroup of elderly patients who will benefit from ART in tumors with unfavorable prognostic factors. In terms of ART, multiple fractionation schedules are available, ranging from standard fractionation (45-60Gy in 5-6 weeks) to the extreme hypofractionation (HF) delivering 16-18Gy in one fraction. In routine practice, HF is mainly preferred in elderly patients for more convenience by reducing the number of transports and increase health related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is no data on the fragility profiles of these patients, nor validating any HF schedule in terms of efficacy, acute toxicity, cosmetic results, and impact on HRQoL.\nHypothesis/Objective\nMain Objective:\nTo evaluate the comparative efficacy of two modalities of Radiotherapy over surgery alone on local tumor control in older patients with Non Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC)\nIn current practice, adjuvant radiotherapy is discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence as determined by the existence (or not) of unfavorable prognostic factors.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nProstate cancer is the commonest male cancer and sadly more than 10,000 men die each year from the disease in the UK. This is actually a greater number than women who die from breast cancer each year in the UK. If diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of being cured of the disease are high through either surgery (prostatectomy) or through radiation treatment (radiotherapy). Both treatment options are associated with quality of life changing impacts on sexual, bowel and bladder function, with survivors having to manage these side effects for the rest of their lives. It is a key area of research to try and identify who may be at particular risk and to minimize these risks. The development of increasingly sophisticated radiotherapy machines (linear accelerators) which can deliver radiotherapy more precisely has allowed the radiotherapy for prostate cancer to be transformed over the last decade. The number of treatments required for cure has been reduced from 39 over nearly 8 weeks, to 20 over 4 weeks, and more recently to only 5 over 1-2 weeks, greatly improving patient convenience through less travel, days off work, or time in hospital away from loved ones. Importantly technology has reduced but not removed the risk of both initial and then longer term permanent side effects. In this study the investigators want to reduce the number of treatments down to only 3, given on consecutive days, further enhancing the patient experience and providing evidence that this number of treatments could become the new standard of care. In this study the investigators will be using the very latest state of the art radiotherapy machines and the unique RayPilot system, adopted for routine use by a small number of global radiotherapy centres when delivering prostate SBRT(Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy). The ability to track the position of the prostate cancer throughout the radiotherapy treatment using RayPilot allows the treatment to be given more precisely with less dose being given to the surrounding bladder and rectum. It also ensures that all the intended dose is given to the cancer as the treatment can be interrupted should the cancer move due to rectal gas, changes in bladder filling or simply the patient moving position on the treatment bed, maximizing the chances of cure and minimizing the risk of life changing side effects. This is a single arm 2 stage Phase II study that will test the safety of the 3 fraction radiotherapy schedule. It"

However, the shortage of donor livers is the main factor limiting the development of liver transplantation. The incidence of liver cancer in China is the highest in the world, and the number of liver transplantation patients is increasing year by year. The Milan criteria and its variants have strict requirements for tumor size and number, and many patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (cHCC) cannot meet the criteria, and cannot obtain the opportunity of liver transplantation. In 2015, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment 2-3 transplantation with delayed total hepatectomy (RAPID) . This approach allows transplantation of the left liver (segments 2+3) to an adult recipient, while the remaining enlarged right hemi-liver is transplanted to another adult recipient, effectively avoiding some unsuitable left lateral lobe livers for pediatric recipients to be wasted. Recipients who received right-hemi-liver transplantation had a similar prognosis compared with those who received whole-liver transplantation. Therefore, if the RAPID technique is confirmed to be feasible, it can greatly alleviate the shortage of liver donors. In addition to cadaver sources, living adult donors can also be considered as the source of liver donors. A smaller left lateral lobe donor liver also places less burden on the donor than a left or right hemiliver. To sum up, our center proposed and designed a clinical study of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation (SALT) in the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC based on clinical surgical experience. On the basis of RAPID surgery, the overall survival rate of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC was evaluated by SALT."

Regional techniques can be used for postoperative pain control following breast surgery. Ultrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSIPB) is a new interfacial plane block defined by Tulgar et al in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain. The SPS muscle is located at the C7-T2 level. It attaches to the lateral edges of the second and fifth ribs. It is innervated by the lower cervical and upper intercostal nerves. With the SPS block, these nerves are blocked and analgesia is provided.

However, ASM has greater consequences (e.g., higher incarceration and HIV/HCV infection rates) for residents in these communities. While the etiology underpinning this inequity is complex, the root cause of these issues has been traced to social determinants of health (SDH; e.g., stigma; poverty; barriers to education, housing, and employment). Funded by the National Institute for Minority Health Disparities (NIMHD 5R01MD010629), in partnership with the Critical Consciousness Collaborative Board (3CB), we developed Community Wise (CW), a multi-level manualized behavioral intervention to decrease ASM frequency in a population of self-identified men with histories of substance use disorder (SUD) and incarceration in Essex County, NJ, U.S. The 3CB was founded in 2010 and developed and pilot-tested the original CW. Over the past six years, our team used the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), and community based participatory research (CBPR) principles to develop and optimize CW for efficacy in reducing ASM and cost. MOST is an innovative methodological framework that employs experimental designs to engineer efficient and effective behavioral interventions. MOST guided the optimization of CW with delivery cost of less than $2,000 per intervention cycle serving up to ten individuals simultaneously (this was the Medicaid allowable reimbursement cost for SUD group treatment services in 2015). Clinical trial results showed larger ASM reduction (Cohen's d=-2\u221922, P=0\u2219067) in the optimized CW group. Unfortunately, attendance across the 15 intervention sessions was low (only 15% of participants attended 50% of the sessions).

However, patients may experience intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, which can lead to inactivity, increased risk of complications, and greater consumption of opioids, resulting in adverse effects and prolonged hospital stays. Pain management is challenging due to a large number of dermatomes covered. The interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block seems to cover the thoracic dermatomes. It has been the subject of many studies in the same surgical group. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery can be excruciating in the postoperative period, just like thoracotomy surgeries. What is aimed of this study is to compare it with erector spinae block in this study. Additional anesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of the multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to manage acute pain better. Inadequate treatment can lead to persistent pain conditions. Although numerous nerve blocks exist for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the thoracic dermatomes or their entire innervation.

The standard treatment for patients with colorectal cancer liver metastases is surgical resection, ablation, or stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for patients who cannot undergo surgery. After local treatment, patients with no evidence of disease (NED) are recommended to receive chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy can only control the disease for a limited period of time, and the disease will eventually progress.

ICA-augmented coaching has the potential to transform the coaching profession. Having ICA as a partner can facilitate human coaches to improve the quality of their work and has the potential to increase accessibility and availability of coaching through lower costs. The ICA of this digital health platform has been developed to take time-consuming administrative tasks from the human coach so that their time can be maximised for scalability. Administrative tasks that ICA have taken include, on-boarding participants, prompting participants to complete assessments and book coaching session, reporting assessment results, and gathering data for the coach (i.e. short, medium and long-term goals and targets, trackability of goals, along with their readiness to change and feelings of achievability and reality towards goals).

Dyspnea, fatigue and sleep disorders are among the most common complaints of patients with COPD. Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) and deep breathing exercises (DBE) are used in the treatment of many physical and psychological problems. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of PMR and DBE on dyspnea, fatigue and sleep quality in patients with COPD. The study was designed as a randomized controlled clinical trial. The sample of the study consisted of 60 patients with COPD who applied to the outpatient clinic of Bart\u0131n Training and Research Hospital. The patients were divided into three groups as PMR, DBE and control groups. The PMR exercise, which includes the systematic relaxation of the main muscle groups of the body aimed at physical and psychological relaxation, was applied twice a day, every weekday, for eight weeks. PMR exercises and training on the application of these exercises were given to the patients individually by face-to-face interview method. Deep Breath exercises training was given to the patients in this group individually by face-to-face interview. During the application, the importance of deep and comfortable breathing was explained and correct breathing technique was taught. Informing and application training took an average of 20-25 minutes for each patient. The patients were told to do the 10-minute application at home 3 times a day for 8 weeks. They were called once a week and asked whether they continued the practice and whether they had any difficulties during the exercises. Data were collected using the COPD and Asthma Fatigue Scale, Dyspnea-12 Scale and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Data were analyzed using the SPSS 22.0 program."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease in the world. It is the leading cause of death in both men and women. The most common symptom of CAD is angina, which is chest pain or discomfort caused by reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.\nIn patients with angina, coronary angiography is performed to evaluate the presence and severity of CAD. Coronary angiography is an x-ray test that uses dye to visualize the arteries of the heart. If the angiography shows that the arteries are narrowed, the doctor will decide whether to perform a procedure called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is a procedure in which a small mesh tube called a stent is placed in the narrowed artery to open it up and improve blood flow.\nBefore performing PCI, the doctor will want to know how much the artery is narrowed and how much the blood flow is reduced. This information can be obtained by performing fractional flow reserve (FFR) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). FFR is a pressure wire that is placed in the artery to measure the pressure difference across the narrowed area. IVUS is a catheter with an ultrasound tip that is placed in the artery to obtain images of the artery wall.\nUltrasonic flow ratio (UFR) is a new technique that can be used to measure blood flow. It uses an ultrasound catheter that is placed in the artery. The catheter emits ultrasound waves that can measure the speed of the blood. The UFR is calculated from the blood speed and the diameter of the artery.\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of UFR to FFR and IVUS in patients with angina who are candidates for PCI. The investigators will also compare the UFR to the FFR and IVUS in predicting the need for PCI in the future."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAlzheimer's Disease is an insidious onset and slowly progressive disease, characterized by the presence of cognitive, behavioral and general dysfunction. Among the neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms seen in Alzheimer's patients, apathy is the most common symptom. It is also followed by depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) affect up to 90% of people with dementia during the illness. Therefore, it brings great difficulties to both patients and their caregivers and causes low quality of life. In addition, the inability to treat the disease completely worsens this situation. Considering the pharmacological treatment of psychological symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression in AD individuals, the existence of adverse side effects, increased mortality, limited drug efficacy, relatively high cost, and the inability to effectively treat some of the most distressing behaviors, it is recommended to give priority to non-pharmacological interventions. The concept of cognitive stimulation in AD is one of the most popular approaches. It is stated that Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the best evidence-based practice with robust clinical trials, applied according to a specific guideline for individuals with mild and moderate dementia. In addition, CST is the only intervention recommended by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to promote cognition, independence and well-being for people with mild to moderate dementia. It has been determined that CST applied to individuals with Alzheimer's disease contributes to the strengthening of cognitive, psychological and social aspects, but there are different results in studies on the effectiveness of cognitive intervention strategies aimed at reducing cognitive functions, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. To enable the conversion of CST into routine clinical practice, practice research to support the standardization and generalization of cognitive stimulation therapy planned for patients with AD and its impact on improving neuropsychiatric symptoms and daily living skills requires further research. It has been confirmed by many studies that CST applied by nurses to individuals with AD contributes to the strengthening of cognitive, psychological and social aspects, but there are few studies applied by nurses. It is noteworthy that the studies on the CST program applied by nurses in our country are limited. Therefore, the need for more clinical studies is"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChronic pain has long been known as one of the major health concerns, impacting psychological health, functioning, and quality of life. However, its treatment is complex and is challenged by a complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors. Common pain treatments present significant medical and technological limitations, reflected in unspecific drug usage and an extremely high number of medical examinations that patients face regularly, with a huge cost burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, the overall efficacy of pain management is often limited (73% dissatisfaction with treatment), leaving the patient in poor life conditions. Designing individualized targeted therapies requires understanding each subject's multidimensional pain experience, taking into consideration both the physical and emotional aspects involved. However, today, the golden standard measurement for pain is self-reports, which inherently suffer from subjective differences in perception and reporting. Healthcare systems advocate for the discovery of biomarkers and reliable clinical trial endpoints for pain to foster diagnosis, monitor pain progression, assess new treatments, and personalized therapeutic response. Nevertheless, most of the evidence today comes from inpatient settings or controlled laboratory environments. The pAIn-sense study aims at providing a radically novel approach in the monitoring and treatment of pain patients: a novel telemonitoring system allowing to understand the real nature of the pain (emotional vs physical), leveraging the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques and wearable sensing technology collecting biometric data, therefore enabling efficient personalized treatments. To achieve this goal, the investigators will combine real patient data both from a physical and emotional perspective, to characterize the pain nature of patients and provide a tailored continuum-of-care. The system will include: Robotic wearable sensors (Hardware): wearable technology for physiological monitoring (e.g., skin conductance, blood volume pressure and heart rate, activity) Digital platform (Software): a customized application that collects psychological assessments, psychological status, medication, subjective pain level and sleep quality. AI-based engine: advanced AI models take all the previous physical and psychological information and model it to provide an outline of what is the nature of the pain level of the subject. The system will be used to monitor the patient during normal activities (day and night) while collecting physiological, psychosocial, and pain information."

An unfortunate consequence of dysphagia is aspiration pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD). Swallowing therapy has proven to be effective for the management of dysphagic symptoms in PD. Treatment is most often delivered in clinics once/week over short time periods with the expectation that exercises be completed at-home. However, these paradigms lack biofeedback to assess the accuracy and strength of the prescribed exercise and accountability to ensure completion of the exercise program. Without biofeedback or options for long-term therapeutic intervention at-home, patients often regress to baseline levels. The proposed research project seeks to test the effectiveness of a novel at-home surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback therapy tool called Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) on swallowing safety and efficiency in patients with PD. The significance of this project lies in the fact that dysphagia is expensive in terms of patient quality of life, health outcomes, and healthcare costs. Thus, a targeted swallowing therapy system with biofeedback that can be utilized at-home may reduce hospitalizations secondary to dysphagia, help maintain therapeutic gains, and reduce the burden that dysphagia places on our healthcare system."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe use of cognitive functions such as memory is essential for the execution of daily activities and represents a crucial element for autonomy maintenance during aging. It is known that the physiological cognitive decline associated with aging also involves memory and can significantly impact the older person's independence. For these reasons, great interest has been generated by two tools that have proved to be decisive in supporting memory functions: non-invasive neurostimulation and memory training. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation that modulates brain activity by employing a direct current delivered through electrodes applied to the scalp. Recently, the use of tDCS has been combined with training interventions focused on working memory in healthy older adults, providing evidence of a significant improvement in memory function when memory training is associated with the use of tDCS compared to when it is performed without it. In particular, adaptive memory trainings coupled with stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex provide benefits that last also at follow-up visits after 1 or 3 months, especially in participants who exhibit a lower baseline performance. While it was observed that adaptive working memory training alone is unable to modulate brain plasticity mechanisms, it was hypothesized that tDCS can modulate brain plasticity by acting through long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms and that it can modulate brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that plays a relevant role in LTP. Several adaptive memory trainings focused on working memory, which is essential for decision-making processes and daily activities. Even if promising results have been shown so far, it appears that no study addressed the implementation of strategic memory training coupled with the use of tDCS. Adaptive memory trainings permit improving the performance in each task by gradually increasing its difficulty, without however resorting to teaching a strategy. Strategic memory trainings permit not only to improve participants' performance in the practiced task but also to generalize the use of memory strategies to new tasks. Intending to prevent cognitive impairment, using these intervention methods in healthy aging and the prodromal phases can be useful. To this end, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) indeed represents an intermediate state between normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (nMCD) and may predict the development of objective cognitive decline.

In theory, sufficiently sensitive and specific point-of-care format tests could be implemented at PoE and used to screen low-prevalence populations effectively. In particular, rapid COVID-19 antigen tests in a lateral flow format COVID antigen RDTs or AgRDTs can play a key role in accelerating access to testing and improving turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. COVID antigen RDTs detect specific proteins known as antigens on the surface of the virus and can identify people who are at the peak of infection when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. A number of AgRDTs are now available, some of which have received emergency use authorizations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and/or the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These tests have the potential to detect an active infection with performance that is close to that of PCR in specific settings. However, the performance of COVID antigen RDTs outside of highly controlled settings is not well defined,particularly in low-prevalence groups of asymptomatic people (Bryan et al., 2020; Lassauni\u00e8re et al., 2020 Linares et al., 2020; Porte et al., 2020).

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPhantom limb pain (PLP) is a common and chronic condition experienced by people after amputation. It is estimated that 80% of people with an amputation experience PLP, and it can persist for years. PLP can be severe and debilitating, and can have a significant impact on quality of life. The underlying mechanisms of PLP are not well understood, and there are currently no effective treatments.\nThe goal of this study is to develop a new treatment for PLP. The treatment will be based on the idea that PLP is caused by changes in the brain after amputation. Specifically, the investigators believe that the brain's response to sensory input from the amputated limb is weakened after amputation. The investigators will use a technique called operant conditioning to strengthen the brain's response to sensory input from the amputated limb.\nOperant conditioning is a type of learning in which a person's behavior is influenced by the consequences of that behavior. In this study, the investigators will use operant conditioning to strengthen the brain's response to sensory input from the amputated limb. The investigators will do this by providing visual feedback about the brain's response to sensory input. The investigators believe that this will lead to long-term changes in the brain, and will reduce PLP.\nThe investigators will test this treatment in a group of people with PLP. The investigators will compare the treatment group to a control group that receives the same amount of sensory stimulation, but does not receive the visual feedback. The investigators will measure the effectiveness of the treatment by measuring changes in PLP and the brain's response to sensory input.\nThe investigators hope that this study will lead to a new and effective treatment for PLP."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCentral venous catheterization is a common procedure in the intensive care unit. It is used to monitor central venous pressure (CVP), administer drugs, and provide total parenteral nutrition. The internal jugular vein and subclavian vein are the two most common sites for central venous catheterization. However, in some cases, the internal jugular vein and subclavian vein cannot be catheterized due to anatomical factors or previous operations. In these cases, the axillary vein can be used as an alternative site for central venous catheterization.\nThe axillary vein is located in the axilla, which is the space between the upper limb and the chest wall. It is connected to the subclavian vein and then to the superior vena cava. The axillary vein is usually used for central venous catheterization in the emergency department or in the field. However, with the development of ultrasound technology, ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization has been widely used in the intensive care unit.\nUltrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization has many advantages. First, ultrasound can provide real-time imaging of the axillary vein and surrounding structures, which can help the operator to avoid injury to the axillary artery and other structures. Second, ultrasound can help the operator to locate the axillary vein and reduce the number of punctures. Third, ultrasound can help the operator to confirm the position of the catheter tip after catheterization.\nIn this study, the investigators retrospectively analyzed the data of trauma patients who underwent ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in the intensive care unit. The investigators analyzed the accuracy of the catheter tip position, the incidence of complications, and the clinical outcomes of these patients. The investigators also compared the results with those of internal jugular vein catheterization and subclavian vein catheterization. The investigators hope to provide reference for the clinical application of ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in trauma patients."

Nasal congestion (i.e. reversible mucosal congestion/nasal mucosal obstruction) is one of the most general and bothersome symptoms in rhinitis and is associated with other medical conditions such as rhinosinusitis and otitis media. This study is relevant as in addition to the high global occurrence of AR, this disorder has substantial effects on the quality of life (QOL) (e.g. during sleep and work). AR is related to high direct medical costs (mainly prescription of medications and outpatient visits) and indirect economic costs (including productivity decrease).\nCurrent medications are undesirable due to their side-effects (such as sedation in the case of intranasal antihistamines (INAH)). Acupuncture for AR in general can be considered as safe and can be seen as a potential remedial blueprint for nasal congestion. Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on specifically nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial aims to evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin\u00ae). A standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points has been established - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - and this selection of acupuncture points can be seen as a solid and profound approach from which every AR patient may benefit. This standard set opens the nose and affects the underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time to maintain its nose opening effect (i.e. to prevent recurrence of the complaint). The positive effects of this treatment protocol (such as improvement QOL) may result in more confidence in the direct, post-treatment and long-term effects of acupuncture and lead to more acceptance of acupuncture as a solid treatment option for nasal congestion in AR instead of using an INAH spray."

When they are malignant, they can be operated on, but often they are not operable anymore and can only be treated with medication.\nThe first-line treatment for these patients is a somatostatin analogue (SSA). SSAs are hormone therapies that mimic the action of the hormone somatostatin. Somatostatin is a naturally occurring hormone that regulates the release of other hormones.\nSSAs are very effective in controlling the symptoms of NET.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a peer-mediated intervention for preschool children with language impairment (LI) who are socially isolated in the classroom. The investigators propose that improved socialization experiences in the preschool classroom for focal children can disrupt the social exclusion, leading to accelerated growth in linguistic, social, and behavioral outcomes. This study involves 25 inclusive preschool classrooms. The study uses an randomized controlled trial to estimate treatment impacts of a peer-mediated intervention, with 12 classrooms assigned to the treatment condition and 13 to the control condition. First, investigators identify all children's positions within the classroom social network using a teacher matrix conducted in fall of the academic year; from this network a child-level social network index is calculated (i.e., individual degree centrality; lower scores are characteristic of social exclusion). Second, teachers simultaneously complete the Developmental Pragmatic Profile (DPP) for each child in the classroom. Finally, among the participating focal children, investigators select the target child based on the lowest centrality scored weighted by DPP score, so that focal children represent the most socially isolated children with the poorest social-pragmatic communication skills. Children and teachers participate for a 9-month period, and the primary approach to treatment for focal children is described here. Specifically, focal children in classrooms randomized to the treatment condition receive peer-mediated pivotal response training (PRT) per procedures detailed by Brock et al. PRT procedures are facilitated by a classroom facilitator-a classroom teacher or teaching assistant-who receives ongoing training and support from research staff. First, investigators provide a one-on-one 1-h training session for each facilitator that focuses on how to identify, initially train, and then support peers on a day-to-day basis during center time. Second, investigators partner with the facilitator to identify two peers who (a) demonstrate good social skills; (b) respond well to adult directions; (c) have consistent attendance; and (d) do not have a history of negative interactions with the target student.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease process that disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses, resulting in a range of neurological signs and symptoms. Walking-related impairment is one of the most common symptoms, reported to affect more than 90% of people with MS. The leading non-pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is rehabilitation, such as physical therapy. The leading pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is dalfampridine. Dalfampridine improves motor function by increasing nerve conduction through demyelinated axons, however, dalfampridine alone is not likely to generate neuroplastic changes needed for lasting benefits, because neural plasticity requires salient and task-specific practice with high repetition at adequate intensity, as well as complex environments that stimulate opportunities for movement to facilitate synthesis of neurotrophic factors. Indeed, the treatment effects of dalfampridine are reversed as soon as the treatment was discontinued. However, it is possible that improved nerve conduction velocity provided by dalfampridine may accelerate neuroplasticity generated from rehabilitation. Yet, combining dalfampridine with concurrent rehabilitation has never been studied. The objective of the proposed study is to test our central hypothesis that providing a motor-relearning physical therapy intervention in combination with dalfampridine will produce superior gains to either intervention alone in mobility through augmented neuroplasticity. Aim 1 will determine if dalfampridine can augment the effects of physical therapy in restoring function in people with MS by comparing the combined intervention to physical therapy without dalfampridine. Aim 2 will explore the comparative effectiveness between the combined intervention with dalfampridine alone, and between physical therapy alone and dalfampridine alone. In Aim 3, the investigators will investigate mechanisms of treatment effects by evaluating functional connectivity before and after each intervention arm. Exploratory Aim 4 will examine whether there are specific clinical and personal factors associated with treatment responsiveness to each type of treatment.

The pain is usually felt in the lower abdomen but sometimes it may radiate in thighs and to the back. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common type of gynecological disorder among females worldwide. Some females may feel some associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting diarrhea, headache, dizziness and in severe conditions syncope. All of these symptoms occur usually in females with normal pelvic anatomy and symptoms occur just before menses. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs 6-12 months after the onset of ovulation cycle. Primary dysmenorrhea can be distinguished from secondary dysmenorrhea on the basis of symptoms and other pelvic or reproductive organ disorders. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, in secondary dysmenorrhea pain starts few days before the onset of menstrual cycles and may last longer than the cycle. The chances of secondary dysmenorrhea are more prevalent in females above the age of 20. A complete pelvic examination should be performed in females who are sexually active and have dysmenorrhea and those who are suspected to have endometriosis. In general population the prevalence of Primary dysmenorrhea is about 47-80%. Seventy five to eighty five percent of female have said to report that the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea are mild.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe risk associated with arterial hypotension during general anesthesia for surgery or interventional procedure has been demonstrated, but the threshold at which consequences for perfusion of one or more organs appear varies according to the mechanism of hypotension, associated abnormalities (Heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen transport), and the patient's terrain. Currently, a mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mm Hg and a reduction of less than 30-50% from the value measured before general anesthesia are commonly used treatment thresholds to ensure good perfusion of all organs. These values are based on large cohort studies that associate these blood pressure thresholds with the occurrence of postoperative complications or during the resuscitation stay. They cannot be generalized to certain subpopulations, such as women and elderly patients. Normally, cerebral blood flow is self-regulated, which allows cerebral blood flow to adapt to oxygen requirements and to different levels of high and low blood pressure. However, this protective mechanism may fail for a degree of hypotension that depends on several factors such as the age or vascular health of the patient. For example, in patients with preexisting hypertension, the autoregulatory capacity of the brain is likely impaired making organs more susceptible to ischemia at low blood pressure. Thus, current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines in the setting of noncardiac surgery recommend individualizing care for patients with associated cardiovascular comorbidities. Arterial stiffness is currently one of the best independent, early biomarkers predictive of cardiovascular complications and cardiovascular comorbidity. Assessment of arterial stiffness is currently performed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement. Therefore, higher blood pressure goals tailored to the physiology of each patient may be preferable for these high-risk patients.\nWhat is the tolerable target BP level for a patient under general anesthesia?\nIs there a simple and non-invasive way to measure the level of cerebral blood flow autoregulation and, more importantly, adequacy to the brain's oxygen requirements?\nThe aim of the study is to measure non-invasively, easily and reliably the variations of"

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIn the US, tens of thousands of children, adolescents, and young adults (AYA) are estimated to live with severe neurologic impairment (SNI). Over 60% of these children endure uncontrolled and often persistent pain, which frequently goes unrecognized and untreated. The impact extends to their parents who commonly experience unremitting physical and psychological distress. There has been a lack of rigorous studies that focus on interventions to alleviate recurrent pain in children with SNI. This gap might be attributed to the stigmatization of these children, who are often from historically marginalized backgrounds, resulting in a low prioritization in research endeavors. To address this inequity and using the ORBIT Model for intervention development, the investigators have adapted and are refining an intervention previously applied in children with cancer. The PediQUEST Response to Pain Of children with Neurologic Disability (PQ-ResPOND) will respond to child distress by using reciprocal activation strategies to overcome normalization-the acceptance among parents and clinicians that symptom distress is an unavoidable outcome of serious illness-and integration of a specialty pediatric palliative care team (PPC). The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of running a full-scale RCT that compares the effect of the PediQUEST ResPOND intervention vs. usual care in children and AYA with SNI. Specific Aims are to 1. assess study's feasibility and acceptability by evaluating recruitment (rates and suitability of screening/tracking), adherence to the intervention (by study participants and interventionists), and retention (dropout rates, reasons, and demographics); and, 2. explore potential for intervention's efficacy by estimating effect sizes and variability of the outcomes proposed for the full-scale RCT (child recurrent pain and symptom burden, and parent outcomes) and assessing intervention's acceptability through semi-structured interviews.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nParkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, usually results in physical deterioration, as well as a spectrum of psychosocial sequels that could bring various challenges on one's daily lives. Patients experience common motor symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, in parallel with psychosocial stressors (i.e., non- motor symptoms NMS), such as sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal symptoms, dopaminergic drug-induced behaviors (e.g., hallucination, impulse control issues) and mood disturbance (e.g., depression, anxiety). While 21% of individuals struggling with the disease reported at least one of these psychosocial symptoms within the initial stage of the disease, they are generally at risk for increased emotional distress, cognitive declines, and elevated stress hormone (cortisol) levels. Both motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease could affect the quality of life of individuals and that of their caregivers. A cross-sectional study conducted by our research team has explored the symptom burden and support care needs in people with PD across East and Southern Asia (n=186), revealing significant unmet needs among Hong Kong PD patients regarding their psychosocial-spiritual concerns. In particular, they experience significant, moderate palliative care needs at the early to middle course of the illness. The extent of unmet support care needs among patients with mild to moderate PD is as great as that among patients with other chronic health conditions, such as advanced cancer, late-stage lung cancer, stage 4/5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and late stage chronic kidney disease. The visible and unpredictable symptoms of a distorted body (e.g., tremor and gait dysfunction) and the suppressed expressions due to having a masked face, reduced voice and slurred speech often results in difficulty seeking help and stigmatization of the disease. Despite the tremendous influences and common occurrence of NMS, they are surprisingly under- recognized in clinical practice because of the lack of spontaneous verbal complaints by the patients, as well as the lack of systematic questioning by healthcare professionals. A qualitative exploration of the illness experience of local PD patients highlighted the importance and urgent need for"

Despite aggressive treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, the median survival is 14-16 months. The standard of care for GBM is maximal safe resection followed by adjuvant radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy. However, even with maximal safe resection, recurrence occurs in the remaining brain tissue. This is due to the infiltrative nature of GBM, where tumor cells invade the surrounding normal brain tissue.\nCurrently, there is no reliable method to identify these infiltrating tumor cells. This is important because these infiltrating tumor cells are the source of tumor recurrence.\nThe investigators have developed a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique that can identify these infiltrating tumor cells.

The incidence of headaches and migraines is to peak at the age of 20-50, and is more common in women than in men. Recurrent tension-type headaches and migraine attacks negatively affect the quality of life of individuals, reducing working capacity and participation in social and family activities. Therefore, tension-type headaches and migraines cause significant social exclusion, loss of workforce and economic burden. TTH and migraine tend to occur during the most productive and high-capacity phase of life, between ages 25-55, affecting muscle groups used in daily life activities, potentially leading to limitations in participation, coping, and self-management skills among women. In this regard, it is important to study how tension-type headaches and migraines, which have significant social and individual effects, alter the self-sufficiency and perception of activity in women.

In this regard, it is important to study how tension-type headaches and migraines, which have significant social and individual effects, alter the self-sufficiency and perception of activity in women.\n\nConstant thinking of pain and avoiding physical activity can reveal dysfunction in individuals. Because of the individual-specific and complex structure of human roles, each individual suffering from a headache faces different limitations in fulfilling daily roles and social participation, depending on lifestyle and preferences. Thus, non-pharmacological treatments (physiotherapy practices, lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, body awareness therapy) are recommended for women with TTH and migraine complaints to relax various muscle groups. One of these treatments is progressive relaxation training. PRT is defined as a method of voluntary, regular relaxation of large muscle groups in the human body with relaxation throughout the body.

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) with buprenorphine is the standard of care for pregnant women with opioid use disorder (OUD). However, buprenorphine induction, the process of transitioning from illicit opioids to buprenorphine, is associated with severe opioid withdrawal. Induction is often prolonged and complicated by treatment discontinuation and relapse to illicit opioid use. These complications can be particularly problematic during pregnancy, when adherence to buprenorphine is critical for maternal and fetal health.\nThe transdermal buprenorphine patch is an alternative method of buprenorphine administration that may facilitate induction. The patch provides a steady release of buprenorphine, which may reduce withdrawal symptoms and improve induction success. The patch may also improve adherence to buprenorphine, which is critical for preventing relapse.\nThe investigators propose a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the use of the transdermal buprenorphine patch for induction during pregnancy. The investigators will compare the transdermal patch to standard induction with tablets. The investigators hypothesize that the patch will reduce the severity of withdrawal symptoms and improve induction success. The investigators will also evaluate the impact of the patch on treatment adherence and neonatal outcomes.\nThe investigators will enroll pregnant women with OUD who are initiating buprenorphine treatment.

The disease is characterized by respiratory symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, and in severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome. The virus is spread through respiratory droplets and can also be spread through direct contact with infected individuals. The incubation period of the virus is approximately 5-6 days. The clinical presentation of COVID-19 can vary from mild symptoms to severe illness. The most common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms include sore throat, headache, muscle pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. In severe cases, the disease can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, and death. The risk of death from COVID-19 is higher in older individuals and those with underlying medical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and lung disease. The diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on clinical symptoms and a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs. The treatment of COVID-19 is mainly supportive and includes symptomatic treatment, oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation in severe cases. There is currently no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. Research is ongoing to develop effective treatments and vaccines for the disease. The prevention of COVID-19 includes personal protective measures, such as wearing a mask, social distancing, and frequent hand washing. The use of vaccines is also an effective way to prevent the spread of the virus. As of April 2021, several vaccines have been approved for use and are being administered worldwide.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nInactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, leading to chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) and contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the world's population is inactive and older adults are at highest risk. Inactivity in older adults is linked to age-related diseases and cognitive decline. Inactivity also imposes social costs through increased medical expenses, which are already high among the growing older adult population in the US. Incentive-based interventions have gained popularity among behavioral scientists and policymakers as a tool for improving health-related behaviors. But there are drawbacks - first, monetary incentives are often not cost-effective, and therefore scalability is limited. Second, behaviors often return to baseline when monetary incentives are removed, i.e., healthy habits are hard to maintain when incentives are limited in duration. Third, there is a concern that monetary incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation to engage in health-promoting behaviors. In light of the limited success of incentive-based behavior change programs, the investigators propose to design and evaluate alternative incentives that address these challenges of scalability, habit formation and crowd-out. The investigators will aim to encourage physical activity through alternative incentives - by making a meal donations on behalf of participants (prosocial incentives) and give participants monetary incentives (personal incentives). Both types of incentives have underpinnings in behavioral economics. Meal donations harness prosocial preferences, which may be more powerful and less likely to reduce intrinsic motivation than equivalent monetary incentives. The overall aim is to evaluate the impact of alternative incentives on step count of older adults in the short-term and long-term. Exploratory analysis will also evaluate the impact on physical and mental health. The investigators will recruit 200 older adults and randomize half of them to receive additional prosocial and personal incentives for their walking behavior. The other half will not receive these incentives. The investigators will track step count of these two groups for 8 weeks using a Fitbit device.

The work of CTI is specifically designed to avoid becoming the primary source of care for the individual."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCoronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. The identification of patients at high risk of disease progression is crucial to provide an adequate medical therapy and to prevent adverse cardiovascular events. In recent years, coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) has become a crucial diagnostic tool for suspected CAD, because of the well-known high negative predictive value of cCTA in ruling out obstructive CAD. However, most patients have non-obstructive CAD. While the management of patients with obstructive CAD is established, as it revolves around further diagnostic test for ischemia evaluation or upfront coronary artery revascularization, this is not the case for patients with non-obstructive CAD. However, these cohort of patients still has a significant risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) that could be prevented by implementing adequate medical therapy. To date, many approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue. However, these proposed solutions lack the ability to provide quantitative and reproducible results with a sufficiently strong predictive value, are often proposed as a stand-alone solution without the integration with multiple prognosticator imaging and clinical parameters, and are not delivered through platforms capable of providing external validation and easy integration in the clinical workflow.\nAmong the proposed prognostic approaches, some are based on the qualitative evaluation of coronary artery plaque features, such as positive remodeling, low attenuation of the plaque, presence of spotty calcification, and napkin ring sign, which is subject to significant inter-reader variability. Other approaches rely on quantitative methods for evaluating atherosclerotic burden based on the extent of coronary artery plaques and their characteristics, such as calcium density, number of lesions, regional distribution, plaque volume, non-calcified plaque volume etc. However, these approaches may be hampered by low reproducibility, especially among different scanner vendors.\nWe propose an AI-based analysis that can integrate all this data in order to select the most important determinant of CAD progression and to discard futile features, thus creating an agile and clinically valuable risk stratification model.\nFurthermore, we plan to create a novel imaging marker of CAD"

Domestic researchers conducted a follow-up study on 1,733 patients discharged from Wuhan Yintan Hospital between January 7 and May 29, 2020, and found that 76% of patients with novel coronavirus pneumonia still had at least one persistent symptom 6 months after the onset of the disease, with fatigue or muscle weakness being the most common (63%) [4]. Foreign researchers conducted a follow-up study on 16,091 adult patients with novel coronavirus in the United States from February 5, 2021 to July 6, 2022, and 15% of the patients reported persisting symptoms 2 months after infection [5].

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe fast growth of Decision Neuroscience is contributing to unveil the cognitive processes underlying choices and their neural bases. The results obtained so far show that decision-making involves neural mechanisms underpinning a complex balance between automatic appetitive or aversive drives generated by subcortical structures, and processes of executive control centered in fronto-parietal brain networks. While the role of meso-limbic structures in reinforcement learning have been widely investigated, it is much less clear to what extent are choices shaped by a) individual differences in executive skills; b) contextual factors potentially interfering with such skills, such as knowing that the outcome of those choices will impact only on one's own vs. another's welfare. This a critical gap, since executive abilities are known to decline even in physiological ageing, thus potentially interfering with the quality of choices. On this ground, this single center non-interventional fMRI study aims to provide novel insights into the relationship between executive and decision-making skills, and their possible changes with ageing, in 150 healthy individuals. This goal will be pursued by combining a behavioral assessment of decision-making and executive skills with a multimodal fMRI session including data concerning a) brain activity associated with decision-making and executive functioning in social vs. non-social contexts, b) brain structural morphometry (grey-matter volume/density), and c) brain structural connectivity (diffusion weighted imaging). The behavioral assessment will involve the main metric of decision-making (e.g., risk aversion, loss aversion, delay discounting) and executive functioning (e.g., selective attention and inhibitory control). MRI data will unveil the neural bases of individual differences in decision-making and executive performance in terms of performance-related patterns of brain activity, structure and connectivity. Results will provide an useful baseline for investigating alterations of decision-making and executive functioning, and of their neural bases, in pathological conditions."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nTemporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) is a collective term for a group of conditions which include disorders of the temporomandibular joint and the masticatory muscles that result in pain, dysfunction, and degeneration. TMD is a common condition that affects 5-12% of the population. The condition is more common in females than males. The etiology of TMD is not well understood, but it is believed to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The most common symptom of TMD is pain in the jaw, face, neck, and shoulders. Other symptoms include clicking or popping sounds when opening the mouth, limited mouth opening, and locking of the jaw. Forward head posture (FHP) is a common postural abnormality in which the head is positioned in front of the shoulders. FHP is associated with a number of musculoskeletal disorders, including TMD. The relationship between the two conditions of FHP and TMD have been previously stated with comparing the craniocervical angle (CVA) of TMD patients to the healthy individuals, still a clear relationship couldn't be drawn due to different study limitations such as the lack of subdivision in the TMD patients based on their diagnostic subcategories in addition to, patients' posture might have been altered while the photo was captured. Ever since, multiple researchers deliberately investigated the two conditions association and inferred the following: 1. FHP can be a risk factor resulting in TMD where any alteration in the head position produces more tension on the masticatory muscles by changing the mandible position 2. TMD origins from muscular component is more significant than articular component yet the correlation between head posture and TMD is still not clear enough, however, if FHP and myogenic TMD were linked preventive measures can be taken. recently, multiple studies established a relation between the occurrence of FHP in TMD patients which supported the suspected relation between them but without a clear association. Till present, no study has investigated the additional effect of FHP DCTO correction impact on myogenic TMD, and this is where the purpose of this study arises from."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPasta plays an indisputable role in the Mediterranean diet pyramid. Indeed, it is an excellent source of carbohydrates that can be part of a varied, balanced, and healthy diet. Despite this, more and more people are avoiding it because they consider it too caloric and associate it with weight gain, especially if eaten in the evening. While we know with certainty that the consumption of pasta, in the right quantities, is associated with positive health effects, there is limited information on the optimal time to consume it. The most common hypothesis is that it is better to consume it at lunch, as metabolism undergoes a physiological and progressive reduction as the evening approaches. Furthermore, recent findings in the field of chrono-nutrition have highlighted that glucose tolerance is high during the day and minimal during the night, suggesting that consuming a high amount of carbohydrates in the evening may predispose to weight gain and a worsened cardio-metabolic profile. On the other hand, some studies on animal models have suggested that the timing of carbohydrate consumption could also impact the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota. For example, it has been observed that the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) fluctuates throughout the day under the control of the host's circadian rhythms. Considering that SCFA are produced from carbohydrates and are fundamental regulators for many metabolic processes, it could be extremely interesting to explore the relationship between when carbohydrates are consumed and microbial functionality. In conclusion, to date, studies that have evaluated the timing of carbohydrate consumption are limited and rely on physiological and chrono-biological assumptions rather than experimental evidence. Consequently, it is not known whether consuming pasta at lunch or dinner, in the right quantities, may have effects on human weight and health.\nThe aim of this study is to assess, for the first time, whether there is a difference between consuming pasta at lunch or dinner in terms of sleep quality, anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, composition and functionality of the gut microbiota in a sample of normal-weight subjects.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCritically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to sleep disorders. In the context of critical illness and ICU admission, there is an intersection of factors contributing to this situation: pre-existing health conditions, severe acute illness, sleep-altering treatments (sedatives, analgesics, mechanical ventilation), psychiatric disorders, and the physical environment. In addition to the impact during hospitalization, the literature points to a long-term reduction in quality of life due to sleep disturbance. Recent studies following up on patients after ICU discharge reveal high rates of sleep disorders up to 6 months after hospital discharge - related or unrelated to new psychiatric disorders and even cognitive changes. Furthermore, sleep disorders are associated with an increased incidence of delirium in ICUs, which refers to altered consciousness and cognition in patients admitted to the intensive care environment, which are associated with worsened patient outcomes such as increased hospital stay and consequently the risk of fatal complications. The prevalence of delirium is around 70%, with an incidence of 89%. Delirium assessment in ICUs is usually performed daily. In order to improve the sleep quality of this population, there are modifiable factors, whether environmental (lighting, noise, general care), physiological (medications, ventilatory parameter adjustments), or psychological (anxiety, pain, absence of family members). Routines to control environmental factors in ICUs seem to have an impact on reducing the incidence of acute brain dysfunction - delirium - and could help prevent sleep disturbances in critically ill patients. These measures include dimming or reducing corridor lights at night, grouping (when possible) care activities at appropriate times, raising curtains, and encouraging mobilization during daytime shifts. For non-delirious patients, the use of earplugs and eye masks is also recommended. Therefore, the investigators have developed this research project with the aim of evaluating the implementation of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary protocol to promote an improvement in sleep quality in critically ill patients.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMelissa officinalis L. is a plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family known for its beneficial properties. This plant has been used since ancient times to treat various disorders, especially those related to anxiety and sleep quality. M. officinalis contains several phytochemicals, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and many others, which form the basis of its pharmacological activities. The plant exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective effects. Widely used since ancient times, M. officinalis has also been studied clinically, demonstrating interesting beneficial properties in the treatment of various conditions, including anxiety, sleep disorders, palpitations, hypertension, and depression. Nutraceuticals could be an alternative option to prescription drugs for alleviating symptoms associated with mild anxiety and insomnia. M. officinalis extract has been shown to be a stress-reducing and anxiolytic agent; in a study [Cases et al., 2011] conducted on subjects with mild to moderate anxiety and sleep disorders, M. officinalis extract reduced anxiety manifestations by 18%, improved anxiety-related symptoms by 15%, and reduced insomnia by 42%. Among the subjects who benefited from M. officinalis extract, 70% experienced a significant reduction in anxiety and 85% in insomnia. However, a limitation of the study was the absence of a control group, thus requiring a randomized controlled study with a placebo group. In light of the above, the aim of the current study is to further investigate the beneficial effects of a formulated M. officinalis extract in phytosome form (Phytosome\u00ae). The phytosome technology utilizes phospholipids derived from sunflowers as an element capable of modulating the absorption kinetics of plant-derived molecules, with the intention of optimizing the product's efficacy with the lowest effective dosage. The phytosome technology represents a potentially useful approach in optimizing the administration of M. officinalis extract, applicable to the described literature-based applications. Phytosome\u00ae is composed of a dry extract of Berberis aristata root (550mg"

The main goal of HRT is to replace the missing estrogens. The standard dose of HRT is 1.0 mg of conjugated estrogens or 0.5 mg of micronized 17\u03b2-estradiol per day. However, in some patients, this dose of estrogen is insufficient to relieve menopausal symptoms. In this case, the dose of estrogen is increased to 1.5 mg of micronized 17\u03b2-estradiol per day. However, there is no data on the effectiveness and safety of higher doses of estrogen in women with POI.\nThe aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of higher doses of estrogen therapy in women with POI.

Obesity is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer. The investigators have previously shown that obesity is also associated with reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability, which is a risk factor for cognitive impairment and dementia. NO is a gas molecule that is important for maintaining healthy blood vessels. Urolithin A (UA) is a metabolite of dietary polyphenols that is found in various fruits and vegetables. UA has been shown to improve NO bioavailability in animal studies. The investigators hypothesize that UA supplementation will improve endothelial function and cerebral blood flow regulation in middle-aged adults with obesity. The investigators will test this hypothesis by conducting a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study for 4 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group will consume 1,000 mg of UA daily in the form of softgel capsules, whereas those in the control group will consume a placebo. Data collection will occur at baseline (day 0) and endpoint (day 28). The investigators will compare outcomes between control and intervention group.

Most SCIs involve the cervical (neck) region of the spine and cause partial or complete loss of movement of both arms, both legs, and the torso (quadriplegia). Individuals with a higher-level and more complete SCI typically have greater loss of functional movement and sensation below the level of the injury. They require greater levels of assistance for self-care and mobility. Currently, there are limited options for quadriplegics to access water to perform basic activities of daily living such as drinking. Additionally, hydration packs and straws create unsanitary conditions and can be difficult to use. The aim of the project is to develop an innovative fountain faucet to enable individuals living with SCI to access water more independently for basic activities of daily living. The faucet incorporates electromechanical controls and software programs that adjust spray outlets, spray angles, and water temperatures. A proximity sensor and voice recognition function allow users to control the faucet through a smart speaker. These features enable precise dispensing of water at the desired temperature and volume, while a camera and other sensors enable hands-free operation. Subjects, including individuals living with SCI and controls, were recruited from an outpatient rehabilitation clinic to test the functionality of the faucet including eye gaze, voice, and motion sensors to control the water stream for drinking, rinsing, and grooming. The examiner screened the subjects to determine their levels of functional independence (independent, modified independent, assistance required, and dependent). The participants were also interviewed regarding their current methods of drinking, rinsing, and grooming. The percentage and standard deviation of individuals in each level of independence for each function were calculated. A t-test was conducted to determine any significant differences in the dependence levels between the tested subjects and the control group."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAtrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases. It is typically characterized by a left-to-right shunt which results in volume overload of the right ventricle and overcirculation of the pulmonary vascularization (le Gloan et al., 2018). This may further result in arrhythmia, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary hypertension is caused by endothelial dysfunction, remodelling of the pulmonary vascularization, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventually causes shunt reversal into right-to-left (Eisenmenger's syndrome). At this point, closure of the defect is contraindicated.\nSmall LV, although less extensively studied than dilated LV, also implies impaired LV function. Small LV means less tolerance to volume overload, which in turn impairs cardiac output and presents higher risk of heart failure and mortality (Saito et al., 2021).\nASD closure in cases with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents a clinical challenge. Complete closure may cause pulmonary hypertensive crisis and low cardiac output syndrome; however, if left untreated, the disease progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases, which may also lead to Eisenmenger's syndrome and shunt reversal. Today, this condition is treated with fenestrated closure, either with patch or fenestrated septal occluder. The fenestration is hypothesized to provide protective effect against pulmonary hypertensive crisis because it allows blood to flow from right to left heart. The added volume into the left heart is then, hypothesized, to provide volume training for the left heart, mainly in the case of small LV. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of fenestrated closure compared to non- fenestrated closure to the left ventricular size at systole and diastole."

Although PTC is usually curable by surgery, recurrences and even distant metastases occur in up to 30% of patients.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of therapeutic resistance and tumor progression in PTC are still poorly understood.\nRecently, the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter mutations have been identified as a common event in human cancers. TERT is a catalytic subunit of telomerase, an enzyme that maintains telomere length and is essential for cellular immortality. TERT promoter mutations have been reported in 70% of PTCs and have been associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis.\nTERT is a multifunctional protein that can be localized in the nucleus and in the mitochondria.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nLow back pain (LBP) is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders and today it is known that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence and intensity of LBP. This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time, next to reduced level of physical activity. Most people sit for a long hours in a slumped sitting posture. Prolonged sitting causes changes in the passive structures of the spine and induces a low back compressive load significantly higher than that observed in standing. Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Periodic rest breaks have been identified as a way to reduce self-report discomfort at the low back and a standing breaks may be beneficial for the passive tissues of the spine. A combination of sitting and standing is beneficial for reducing musculoskeletal discomfort.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP.\nThe study will be a randomized controlled study with pre and post-intervention assessment. The participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group consisting of an active break (n = 25) or the control group (n = 25). The group with an active break with postural change from sitting to standing will be recommended to take an active break for every 30 minutes of sitting. The primary outcome will be average pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), disability measured using the Oswestry Disability Index and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting (Borg scale) and The Global Perceived Effect (7-point Likert scale). Secondary outcome will Post-Intervention Questionnaire (5-item self-completed questionnaire)."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe vaginal microbiota has a significant bearing on a woman's mental and physical health at every stage of life. A balanced microflora of the vaginal environment (eubiosis) consists of a predominant presence of lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacilli ensure the maintenance of an acidic pH that effectively makes the environment inhospitable to pathogens by preventing infection and protecting the genital tract. At the end of the reproductive period, the reduction of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, results in a decrease in the lactobacillus component with consequent depletion of the vaginal microbiota and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential human nutrient found mainly in oily fruits. It is a fat-soluble molecule with high antioxidant power. Topically administered, it not only plays a key role in protecting epithelial cell membranes from oxidative damage but is also able to modulate bacterial growth by contributing to pH acidification. The latter feature, in the vaginal canal, creates a favorable environment for the lactobacilli flora, positively affecting the microbial population and thus contributing to the prevention of all those problems related to increased vaginal sensitivity to pathogens during menopause. In addition, recent data show that vitamin E can counteract the production of biofilm produced by certain pathogens, which has detrimental effects on the homeostasis of the vaginal environment."

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPolycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by increased production of all cell lines in the bone marrow, with a predominance of red blood cells (RBCs). The diagnosis of PV is based on the presence of typical clinical manifestations, such as pruritus, splenomegaly, and symptoms of vascular occlusion, in addition to the presence of bone marrow fibrosis and the JAK2 V617F mutation. The hematological picture is characterized by an increase in the hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels, with a normal or low red blood cell (RBC) count and a high red blood cell (RBC) volume (mean corpuscular volume, MCV). The HCT/Hb ratio is a new parameter that has been proposed to diagnose PV. The normal range of the HCT/Hb ratio is 0.85-1.00 L/L. A ratio of <0.85 is considered low, and a ratio of >1.00 is considered high. The diagnostic value of the HCT/Hb ratio in PV has been reported to be 96.7%, with a sensitivity of 95.2% and a specificity of 98.1%. The red blood cell distribution width (RDW) is a measure of the variation in RBC volume. It is calculated as the coefficient of variation of RBC volume. The normal range of RDW is 11.5-14.5%. An increase in RDW is associated with a decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, which can lead to symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea. An increase in RDW is also associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. The diagnostic value of RDW in PV has been reported to be 96.7%, with a sensitivity of 95.2% and a specificity of 98.1%. The aim of this study is to measure the HCT/Hb ratio and RDW in patients with PV and compare them with patients with secondary erythrocytosis.
