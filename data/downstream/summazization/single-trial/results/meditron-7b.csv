Input Text: Multidisciplinary Approach for High Risk Patients Leading to Early Diagnosis of Canadians in Heart Failure

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Heart failure describes a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients. This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

Input Text: Evaluating Strategies to Improve Guideline Directed Medical Therapy: The GDMT Research, Education & Assist Trial for Heart Failure Care (GREAT-HF Care)

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
This is a cluster randomized study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving GDMT in patients with HFrEF. Clinicians stratified based on practice specialty, location, and pharmacist referral habits will be permuted block randomized to achieve 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution across the following arms respectively: (1) usual care, (2) multi-prong CDS inclusive of a patient portal message about GDMT, an interruptive advisory upon chart entry as a notification to clinicians on GDMT consideration and a Best Practice Advisory (BPA) that includes a GDMT order set, and (3) multi-prong CDS as in #2 but replacement of GDMT order set with referral to integrated clinical pharmacist co-management. Secondarily, each of the 5 clinical practice sites of roughly equal HFrEF patient loads were assigned to receive either an early or delayed education rollout. Exploratory analyses will look to determine the independent and incremental benefits of education with other interventional approaches.

Input Text: Perceived Quality of Family Planning Counseling

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
In 2017, Holt, Dehlendorf, and Langer created a framework for contraceptive counseling quality grounded in quality of care and human rights principles and research in healthcare communication. Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research. This study will seek to understand quality of family planning counseling utilizing the validated and client-centered based QCC Scale as experienced by reproductive aged women in El-Dakhla District, New Valley. Furthermore, it will investigate their associated factors either client, provider, or visit factors. Data collection tool Data will be collected through a semi-structured interview administered questionnaire which includes: Socio-demographic characteristics of women such as age, education, occupation, religion, residence, husband's education, husband's occupation. Family planning practice: This will include number of living children, current use of FP method and its type, and suggested causes of discontinuation of FP, previous contraceptive use, and reason for the visit 3-Facility factors such as gender of providers, qualification of providers, type of the health facility (mobile clinics???) 4-Quality of contraceptive counseling (QCC) scale: it is a 22-item scale which measures the quality of care"

Input Text: African Americans (AA) Communities Speak

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
African Americans (AA) are less likely to receive quality end-of-life (EoL) care. For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. EoL care delivery is also affected by the interpersonal and systemic racism that AAs experience in healthcare settings. EoL care delivery for AAs is also affected by the interpersonal and systemic racism that AAs experience in healthcare settings.

Input Text: Depth of Botulinum Neurotoxin Injection for Treatment of Glabellar Lines

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
STUDY AIM, BACKGROUND, AND DESIGN ABSTRACT Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a safe and effective treatment for numerous conditions in neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and urology. In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the corrugator supercilii muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 +/-1.4 mm medially and 6.6 +/-1.4mm laterally and recommended BoTN injections at the depth of 4mm. However, no in vivo studies have been performed to validate this as the optimal depth of injection. In a split face study evaluating the depth of"

Input Text: Brief Digital Intervention to Increase COVID-19 Vaccination Among Individuals With Anxiety or Depression

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

The project will recruit undervaccinated participants with and without symptoms of anxiety or depression from the CHASING COVID Cohort, a large and geographically diverse community-based US cohort, to tailor and test the effectiveness of two brief digital interventions to increase vaccine uptake among adults with anxiety or depressive symptoms. The investigators will assign undervaccinated cohort participants, with and without symptoms of anxiety or depression, to: 1) an attitudinal inoculation intervention; 2), a CBT-informed intervention; or 3) a conventional public health messaging intervention without attitudinal inoculation or CBT-informed content. The investigators will examine the outcome of COVID-19 vaccination at 4 weeks post-intervention, conducting intent-to-treat comparisons between arms.

Input Text: Diosmin for Treatment of Delayed-onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Main objective: • Analyze the potential effects of supplementation with the flavonoid diosmin on DOMS in humans (athletes from the women's five-a-side soccer team from the city of Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil), using the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Specific objectives: Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin reduces muscle pain induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol; Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin reduces systemic (serum) levels of total creatine phosphokinase (CFQ) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity) induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol; Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin is capable of improving the reduction in muscular performance and impairment of balance induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol. The present project will be carried out through a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of approximately 40 female athletes pertaining to the Londrina Esporte Clube (name in Portuguese of the team) women's five-a-side soccer will be recruited for the study. The choice of exclusively women individuals is due to sexual dimorphism in pain perception, thus contributing to the results being more homogeneous and reliable. The criteria for inclusion of volunteer participants in the project will be to be between 16 and 35 years old, and to be able to perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Exclusion criteria will include locomotor system dysfunctions or use of analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication at the time of recruitment, as well as being on a calorie-restricted diet or ergogenic supplementation. The study will consist of two experimental"
