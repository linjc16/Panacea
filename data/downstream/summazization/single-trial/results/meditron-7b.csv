Input Text: Multidisciplinary Approach for High Risk Patients Leading to Early Diagnosis of Canadians in Heart Failure

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Heart failure describes a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients. This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

Input Text: Evaluating Strategies to Improve Guideline Directed Medical Therapy: The GDMT Research, Education & Assist Trial for Heart Failure Care (GREAT-HF Care)

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
This is a cluster randomized study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving GDMT in patients with HFrEF. Clinicians stratified based on practice specialty, location, and pharmacist referral habits will be permuted block randomized to achieve 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution across the following arms respectively: (1) usual care, (2) multi-prong CDS inclusive of a patient portal message about GDMT, an interruptive advisory upon chart entry as a notification to clinicians on GDMT consideration and a Best Practice Advisory (BPA) that includes a GDMT order set, and (3) multi-prong CDS as in #2 but replacement of GDMT order set with referral to integrated clinical pharmacist co-management. Secondarily, each of the 5 clinical practice sites of roughly equal HFrEF patient loads were assigned to receive either an early or delayed education rollout. Exploratory analyses will look to determine the independent and incremental benefits of education with other interventional approaches.

Input Text: Perceived Quality of Family Planning Counseling

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
In 2017, Holt, Dehlendorf, and Langer created a framework for contraceptive counseling quality grounded in quality of care and human rights principles and research in healthcare communication. Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research. This study will seek to understand quality of family planning counseling utilizing the validated and client-centered based QCC Scale as experienced by reproductive aged women in El-Dakhla District, New Valley. Furthermore, it will investigate their associated factors either client, provider, or visit factors. Data collection tool Data will be collected through a semi-structured interview administered questionnaire which includes: Socio-demographic characteristics of women such as age, education, occupation, religion, residence, husband's education, husband's occupation. Family planning practice: This will include number of living children, current use of FP method and its type, and suggested causes of discontinuation of FP, previous contraceptive use, and reason for the visit 3-Facility factors such as gender of providers, qualification of providers, type of the health facility (mobile clinics???) 4-Quality of contraceptive counseling (QCC) scale: it is a 22-item scale which measures the quality of care"

Input Text: African Americans (AA) Communities Speak

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
African Americans (AA) are less likely to receive quality end-of-life (EoL) care. For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. EoL care delivery is also affected by the interpersonal and systemic racism that AAs experience in healthcare settings. EoL care delivery for AAs is also affected by the interpersonal and systemic racism that AAs experience in healthcare settings.

Input Text: Depth of Botulinum Neurotoxin Injection for Treatment of Glabellar Lines

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
STUDY AIM, BACKGROUND, AND DESIGN ABSTRACT Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a safe and effective treatment for numerous conditions in neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and urology. In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the corrugator supercilii muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 +/-1.4 mm medially and 6.6 +/-1.4mm laterally and recommended BoTN injections at the depth of 4mm. However, no in vivo studies have been performed to validate this as the optimal depth of injection. In a split face study evaluating the depth of"

Input Text: Brief Digital Intervention to Increase COVID-19 Vaccination Among Individuals With Anxiety or Depression

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

The project will recruit undervaccinated participants with and without symptoms of anxiety or depression from the CHASING COVID Cohort, a large and geographically diverse community-based US cohort, to tailor and test the effectiveness of two brief digital interventions to increase vaccine uptake among adults with anxiety or depressive symptoms. The investigators will assign undervaccinated cohort participants, with and without symptoms of anxiety or depression, to: 1) an attitudinal inoculation intervention; 2), a CBT-informed intervention; or 3) a conventional public health messaging intervention without attitudinal inoculation or CBT-informed content. The investigators will examine the outcome of COVID-19 vaccination at 4 weeks post-intervention, conducting intent-to-treat comparisons between arms.

Input Text: Diosmin for Treatment of Delayed-onset Muscle Soreness (DOMS)

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Main objective: • Analyze the potential effects of supplementation with the flavonoid diosmin on DOMS in humans (athletes from the women's five-a-side soccer team from the city of Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil), using the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Specific objectives: Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin reduces muscle pain induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol; Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin reduces systemic (serum) levels of total creatine phosphokinase (CFQ) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation and antioxidant capacity) induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol; Evaluate whether treatment with the flavonoid diosmin is capable of improving the reduction in muscular performance and impairment of balance induced by the intense dynamic exercise protocol. The present project will be carried out through a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of approximately 40 female athletes pertaining to the Londrina Esporte Clube (name in Portuguese of the team) women's five-a-side soccer will be recruited for the study. The choice of exclusively women individuals is due to sexual dimorphism in pain perception, thus contributing to the results being more homogeneous and reliable. The criteria for inclusion of volunteer participants in the project will be to be between 16 and 35 years old, and to be able to perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Exclusion criteria will include locomotor system dysfunctions or use of analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication at the time of recruitment, as well as being on a calorie-restricted diet or ergogenic supplementation. The study will consist of two experimental"

Input Text: Application of Chromosomal Instability in Early Diagnosis of Biliary Tract Carcinoma

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Biliary tract carcinoma account for about 3% of all digestive system tumors, with potential high metastasis and invasion ability. Their early clinical symptoms lack specificity, and they are often found in late stage with poor prognosis. CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially way to detect CIN in the cast-off cells from the bile samples for diagnosing and monitoring biliary tract carcinoma patients. BileCAD is a new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from bile, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of biliary tract carcinoma patients.The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing bile samples from gallbladder cancers and cholangiocarcinoma patients and control groups that without any tumor in the Bile duct and gallbladder or other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of BileCAD test for diagnosing biliary tract carcinoma to other modal"

Input Text: COVID-19 Transmission and Morbidity in Malawi

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
The investigators hypothesize that malaria and intestinal parasitic diseases may result in enhanced or tolerogenic innate immune responses that decrease the risk of symptomatic COVID-19. On the other hand, these conditions and deficiency of micronutrients may decrease the acquisition and longevity of Ab responses and memory B cells. To test these hypotheses, up to 200 symptomatic subjects (index cases) will be enrolled when they seek diagnosis for their symptoms of COVID-19 and have their SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed. All their household contacts (anticipated 700) aged 5-75 years who provide consent (participants) will be examined for infection through two consecutive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR. Venous blood will be collected at that time. For AZ vaccinees, at their 2nd vaccine dose, about 90 days after the 1st dose, they will be given a stool sample container. JJ vaccinees will receive the stool sample container when they receive the first vaccine dose. Two weeks after completion of the primary regimen (2nd dose of the AZ [M3.5] and 1st dose of the JJ vaccines [M0.5]), venous blood draws will be repeated and stool containers will be collected. Subsequent visits/procedures will happen at one month thereafter (M4.5 for AZ and M1.5 for JJ), and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the primary regimen. Venous blood will be collected at the visit 1.5, 3, 6, and 12 months after the primary regimen and capillary blood will be collected at the other"

Input Text: Tailoring Bleeding Reduction Approaches in Patients Undergoing PCI

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the standard of care for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition."

Input Text: A Novel Biomarker for Response and Prognosis of HBV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated With Radiotherapy: Personalized Cell-free Virus-host Chimera DNA

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Residual tumors and early recurrence/metastasis after radiotherapy (RT) compromise the patient survival with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of"

Input Text: Testing Design Thinking Methodology to Engage Hispanic and Latino Families of Autistic Children in Research.

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Racial and ethnic minorities with autistic children experience delays in access to therapy services that can result in poorer outcomes, decreased quality of life, and increased parental and financial stress. Many autism interventions were developed and tested with only White participants, assuming they could be transferable to minority populations. However, research has found that this is not the case and that interventions that are not adapted to an individual's culture and ethnicity do not work as well and are not used as frequently. In this project, we compare two methods of stakeholder engagement, Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG), to determine which is better at getting input on the facilitators and barriers to access therapy for autistic children. We focus on Hispanics and Latinos as this is the largest minority group in the US, with one of the fastest-growing groups of autistic children. Our long-term objective is to improve the functional skills and health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and their families by improving access to an occupational therapy intervention designed to improve daily living skills, socialization, and quality of life. Occupational therapy using Ayres Sensory Integration (OT/ASI) is the only evidence-based intervention that addresses the sensory symptoms in autism. We will use input from these engagement sessions to adapt two versions of the OT/ASI manual: one using DT data and the other using FG data. Outcomes are evaluated following each step. Following the completion of this project, the planned outputs of the study are data on the most effective minority stakeholder engagement method and a culturally adapted OT/ASI manual for Hispanic and Latino autistic children for clinicians and researchers. This information can support future researchers who are engaging Hispanic/Latino"

Input Text: A Study Comparing 3 Study Medicines (Encorafenib, Binimetinib, Pembrolizumab) to 2 Study Medicines (Ipilimumab and Nivolumab) in Patients With Advanced Melanoma

Study Overview
-----------------
Detailed Description
-----------------
The purpose of the study is to compare the efficacy of a triplet therapy (encorafenib, binimetinib, pembrolizumab) versus a doublet/control therapy (nivolumab and ipilimumab). Participants will have metastatic or unresectable locally advanced BRAF V600E/K-mutant melanoma, which progressed during or after prior treatment in the adjuvant or first-line metastatic setting, with an approved anti-PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab or nivolumab). Participants will have anti-PD-1 resistant disease (primary or secondary) with confirmed disease progression per RECIST v1.1 either during or after receipt of an approved anti-PD-1 monotherapy (ie, nivolumab or pembrolizumab) for melanoma, defined according to the SITC Immunotherapy Resistance Taskforce (Kluger et al, 2020). Participants must have at least one measurable lesion per RECIST v1.1. Participants must have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1. Participants must have adequate organ function, defined as: absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3, platelets ≥100,000/mm3, hemoglobin ≥9 g/dL, total bilirubin ≤1.5 x ULN, AST and ALT ≤2.5 x ULN, and creatinine ≤1.5 x ULN.

Input Text: Non-invasive Brain Stimulation and Injury Risk Biomechanics

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
The overall goal of the project is to determine how repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (theta burst stimulation) influences movement among individuals with and without a concussion history. The purpose of this study is prevention via improving injury risk biomechanics to reduce the risk of future musculoskeletal injury. Participants will complete 2 testing sessions separated by a minimum of 7 days. During the first testing session, participants will complete single-task serial subtraction, single- and dual-task jump landing, and a theta burst stimulation intervention. The jump landing will be completed before and after theta burst stimulation and under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions. During the second testing session, participants will complete the jump landing before and after theta burst stimulation under single- and dual-task (serial 7s) conditions. On both testing sessions, the symptom checklist and Tampa Scale of Kinesiophobia 11 (TSK-11) will be administered upon arrival to the lab (after informed consent on day 1), and immediately after repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. The Godin Leisure Activity Questionaire will be administered on both days before the jump landing. The NASA Task Load index will be administered on both days immediately after every cognitive condition during the jump landing on both the experimental and control theta burst stimulation days. The TSK-11 will be analyzed as a continuous variable ranging from 11-44. Higher scores on the TSK-11 indicate a greater fear of movement.

Input Text: Pain, Discomfort, and Acceptance During Using Electrical Stimulation to Accelerate Orthodontic Teeth Movement

Study Overview
-----------------

Detailed Description
-----------------
Participants will be chosen from the patients attending the Department of Orthodontics in the Faculty of Dentistry at Damascus University. patients will be invited to participate in this trial. After giving them the information sheet, informed consent will be obtained from all patients who agreed to join the study. Leveling and alignment will be performed using pre-adjusted fixed orthodontic appliances of 0.022 x 0.028-inch slot metal bracket with MBT prescription; the conventional wiring sequence will be followed until leveling and alignment will begin for all patients. self-drilling orthodontic mini-implants (diameter: 1.6 mm; length: 8 mm) will be placed between the roots of the maxillary second premolar and the first molar on each side. The en-masse retraction of the upper anterior teeth will be done using backward traction, and the remodeling will be enhanced by very light electrical stimulation by a specific device.

Input Text: High-dose Cephalexin for Cellulitis (HI-DOCC)

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background Non-purulent cellulitis is a bacterial skin and soft tissue infection of the subcutaneous tissue. Group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), beta-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria causing non-purulent cellulitis. Patients typically present to the emergency department (ED) with pain, redness, swelling and induration (skin hardening due to inflammation) of the affected skin. A minority of patients may have fever or tachycardia. The diagnosis of cellulitis is clinical. Once the diagnosis is made, the emergency physician must decide whether the patient can be treated as an outpatient or requires hospitalization. The emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

The emergency physician must also decide whether the patient requires oral or intravenous (IV) antibiotics.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: The term contextual effect has been used to reinforce the view that the placebo effect should be understood as an effect related to the use of inert treatments. Thus, the placebo effect. There is evidence of the effect of positive expectations on the placebo effect. There is no study that investigated the effect of positive expectations on the placebo effect in patients with chronic low back pain.

Objectives: The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of positive expectations on the placebo effect in patients with chronic low back pain.

Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial with three parallel arms. The participants will be randomly allocated to one of the three groups: positive expectation group, neutral expectation group, and negative expectation group. The participants of the positive expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a positive message regarding SMT. The participants of the neutral expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a neutral message regarding SMT. The participants of the negative expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a negative message regarding SMT. The participants of the positive expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a positive message regarding SMT. The participants of the neutral expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a neutral message regarding SMT. The participants of the negative expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a negative message regarding SMT. The participants of the positive expectation group will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering a positive message regarding SMT.

Input Text: Comparative Study Between Autogenous Bone Block and Tent Pole Technique for Augmentation of Atrophic Anterior Maxilla

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
• Research question: Does screw tent pole technique provides better bone gain than autogenous bone block in atrophied anterior maxilla? • Rationale for conducting the research: Several methods have been developed for the augmentation of the deficient bone volume. These include Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR) with barrier membranes, onlay bone grafting, ridge splitting and distraction osteogenesis. The screw tent-pole method is an effective technique to achieve initial reconstruction of alveolar bone deficiencies. Previous studies have proven that screw tent pole technique is recommended in reconstruction of atrophied alveolar bone and its good outcome in contrary to other bone graft techniques. This study to compare the outcome of screw tent pole technique to conventional gold standard technique of block bone grafts in atrophied anterior maxilla. • Primary and secondary objectives: primary objective to assess amount of bone gain secondary objective assess bone quality . Trial design: Randomized clinical trial, Unicentered, Parallel groups, 2 arms, Allocation ratio 1:1, Equivalent trial • PICO: Population: patients with atrophied Anterior Maxillary area (with initial ridge width of ≤ 5 mm and moderate bone height) Intervention: Screw Tent pole technique Control group: Autogenous Bone Block technique Outcome: bone gain , histomorphometric evaluations, dehiscence. Interventions Surgical Protocol A. Screw Tent pole technique A prophylactic antibiotics administration was conducted. All surgical procedures were performed under local anesthesia. A trapezoid incision will be formed to expose the edentulous alveolar ridge in recipient site. A full-thickness f"

Input Text: PRecisiOn Medicine In StrokE Study on the Evolution of Plasma Brain-Derived Tau in 100 Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide,1 despite major advancements in reperfusion therapies.2,3 While neuroimaging modalities have expanded patient eligibility for reperfusion therapies by estimating ischemic core and salvageable tissue,4-7 their assessments are mostly single-timed. Currently available clinical algorithms lack the capacity to continuously track the dynamic evolution of how the primary core progresses to a final infarct, which, however, is a major determinant of stroke progression,8-10 and is associated with functional outcome.9,11,12 Previously studied blood-based biomarkers such as Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL),13 neuron-specific enolase (NSE),14 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),15,16 and S 100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B)17 either failed to capture the extent of brain injury within the acute phase of stroke or lack specificity. Plasma levels of brain-derived tau (BD-tau) were recently found to show high value for monitoring brain injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke: In 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome.18 While informing on the relation of BD-tau with imaging-based metrics of brain injury after onset and to evaluate whether BD-tau plateaus at different time points"

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1. Subjects A total of 50 healthy male students will be randomly assigned to one of two groups of 25 subjects each using a computerized randomization method. The trained group will undergo 3 weeks of EEG-NFB training, whereas the control group will not undergo training. Inclusion criteria for study participation will be lack of any neurological disorders and motor or cognitive deficits, lack of neurological incident in the past, age between 20 to 25 years, male sex, and right-handedness (this inclusion criteria will be to avoid an influence of lateralization and gender on psychological tests outcomes). The study was approved by the ethic committee of the University School of Physical Education in Wroclaw and will be carried out in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. 2.2. Experimental procedure TR and CO groups will be each tested twice in the same time periods, i.e., before 3 weeks period of EEG-NFB training (PRE) and after the training period (POST). During the PRE and POST experimental sessions, all subjects will be subjected to the same psychological tests. Before starting each test, subjects will be instructed to concentrate and to make use their maximal attention skills during testing session. For the 12 testing sessions, all participants will be subjected the same psychological tests. The tests will be performed in a quiet room with only one and always the same investigator present. The tests will be performed in the following order: TMT-A, TMT-B, ST-I, and ST-II. The TMT-A and TMT-B will be performed first, followed by the ST-I and ST-II. The TMT-A and TMT-B will be performed first, followed by the ST-I and ST"

Input Text: Comparative Effects of Myofascial Decompression and Positional Release Therapies in Chronic Non-specific Neck Pain

Study Overview
-----------------

Detailed Description
-----------------
Neck pain is one of the most common and painful musculoskeletal conditions. Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition. Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as cervical pain without a known pathological basis (e.g., infection, tumor, osteoporosis, fracture, structural deformity). Characteristic of chronic nonspecific neck is heavy pain, worsening with exertion and relieve with rest. The most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain patients.

Input Text: The Efficacy and Safty of Proton Pump Inhibitor (Lansoprazole)

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Purpose : This study compares gastrointestinal and cardiovascular events with coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who underwent percutaneous coronary angioplasty in patients with moderate gastrointestinal bleeding risk with use of dual antiplatelet drugs (DAPT), especially controversial use of prophylactic acid secretion inhibitors, and attempts to confirm the effectiveness and safety of gastric acid secretion inhibitors Background : DPAT is a standard treatment in patients with CAD with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, it is important to consider the GI bleeding risk when using DAPT and to determine whether Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) should be prescribed to prevent such accidents. DAPT, or aspirin and P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, complementarily reduce platelet activation and aggregation and consequently reduce the progression of coronary thrombosis. We have reported whether PPI use is associated with ischemic events or mortality in patients with DAPT up to date, but we have shown conflicting results depending on the type of study conducted. Observational studies generally show that PPI increases all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, angina and stroke, while RCT studies show that it does not. This difference can be explained by the selection bias. This is because observational studies attempt to reduce selective bias through correction of basic patient characteristics, but unmeasured differences in underlying variables continue to affect the results. method : Among patients who performed PCI in patients with CAD, enrollment is performed in patients with moderate risk in gastrointestinal risk assessment indicators. After obtaining the consent form, patients are randomly assigned to the gastric acid secretion inhibitor group and the non"

Input Text: Clinical Research of Drug Holiday Based on MRD Detection in GIST Patients at High Risk of Recurrence

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and surgery is the preferred treatment method for primary resectable GIST. The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors. Existing studies have explored the drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection assisting patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to use TKI. Therefore, this one-arm prospective observational clinical study will assist some high-risk GIST patients who have been treated with imatinib for 3 years after surgery and have achieved disease control to adopt the treatment mode of drug holiday based MRD detection, aiming to evaluate the value of MRD detection in"

Input Text: AMP SCZ® Observational Study: PREDICT-DPACC

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
The Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP®) is a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the European Medicines Agency, and multiple public and private organizations. The goal of the AMP Schizophrenia (AMP SCZ) program, a multi-continent consortium, is to develop a deep biomarker-informed functional characterization and longitudinal clinical profiling of study participants at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. The data will support the development of algorithms of clinical and biological measures to predict the trajectories and outcomes of CHR individuals to identify enriched CHR patient populations to enable proof of principle intervention studies for early intervention in schizophrenia. These tools will allow the assessment of biomarkers and outcome measures as early indicators of pharmacologic treatment efficacy. See the AMP SCZ website link for a detailed description of study goals (https://www.ampscz.org/about/goals/). The Accelerating Medicines Partnership® Schizophrenia Observational Study: Psychosis Risk Evaluation, Data Integration, and Computational Technologies Data Processing, Analysis and Coordination Center (AMP SCZ® Observational Study: PREDICT-DPACC) based out of Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) and Mass General Brigham (MGB) is one of three research projects supported by the AMP SCZ program. The AMP SCZ Observational Study: PREDICT-DPACC works with two Clinical High Risk (CHR) research networks (described below) to meet the following goals: Capture data from the research networks in a uniform manner. Build flexible infrastructure to accommodate multiple data types. Develop and refine pipelines that provide rapid data"

Input Text: Fine Motor Function in Children With Specific Learning Disorders

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the individual has difficulties in reading, written expression, and/or mathematics, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5 (DSM-V). SLD; According to DSM-5, the academic difficulties experienced are explained in detail by dividing them into three subgroups. These are dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The incidence of SLD is approximately 33% in girls and 67% in boys between the ages of 6-12. The ethology of SLD is multifactorial. It is associated with multiple genes and environmental risk factors. Structural imaging studies in children with SLD have revealed that grey matter is reduced. As a result of low grey matter, early literacy education seems to be negatively affected, and fine motor skills such as writing play an important role in this influence. Writing is a complex activity that includes perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Writing activities require a high level of fine motor coordination, postural control, adjustable grip strength, visual perception, and language skills. Considering the studies, it is stated that children who go to primary school spend 31%-60% of their academic days with tasks involving fine motor skills, and most of them do activities such as writing and painting. In addition to their academic and writing performances, children with SLD perform differently in daily life compared to their healthy peers. In general, they have difficulties during self-care activities such as tying shoes, clipping their nails, buttoning/zipping, shaving, and performing activities that require sequencing. At the same time, children with SLD have difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control. Difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control seen in children with SLD affect proximal"

Input Text: Reciting Tang Poems to Promote Happiness

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Tang poems are not only for language learning but also induce people's positive emotions. Traditionally, some Chinese parents teach the very young kids to recite Tang poems even before the kids know how to read and write. Reciting Tang poems resembles singing a song without understanding the verses, and some kids can do so better than adults. Tang poems sound musical and should be easier to remember and recite than other texts. Learning and reciting poems at home could be happy and fun family activities in Chinese families. Whether using fun activities on small groups of kids in a community setting to promote Tang poem reciting and happiness could have the same effects of Tang poem reciting in Chinese kids is unknown for non-Chinese. This is a pilot pre-post interventional trial with no controls, with 10-20 South Asian children in primary schools (Grades 1-2, age 6-9) being recruited. In most primary schools, grades 1-2 students have not started learning Tang poems. Students and their parents will be actively approached by Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS). An information sheet will be provided to the parents of eligible children, and their contact information will be asked. Parents give written consent if they agree for their children to participate. Parents will be invited to join the intervention sessions to show support for students' participation but they will only sit at the back of the room without active interaction or learning requirements. The intervention comprises three 1.5-hour sessions of Tang poem reciting and one session for participant performances. Experienced instructors from Bestreben Drama Association Limited will lead each session, and adherence to the protocol will be assessed by independent reviewers. Participants will recite two poems per session, with adjustments based on performance. Body language, sound, images, and videos will be used, along with engaging games, to enhance"

Input Text: A Digitally Assisted Risk Reduction Platform for Youth at High Risk for Suicide

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth. Digital tools, especially personal smartphones, are promising avenues to address these issues and can be used to provide a unique understanding of risk factors, including psychological distress, anhedonia and behavioral withdrawal, and sleep disturbance among high-risk individuals. This project aims to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of preventative health care to youth at risk for suicide by developing a comprehensive digital platform that allows practitioners to integrate mobile sensing data and HIPAA-compliant client communication tools into their management of these young people. Specifically, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) based at the intensive outpatient services (Intensive Adolescent and Family DBT Program (Columbia Doctors)) to test the impact of using the Vira platform for patients versus treatment as usual control (TAU; i.e., not using Vira). This project will include adolescent patients (n = 200) aged 13-18-years-old randomized to: (a) Vira group (n = 100) and (b) treatment as usual control group (n = 100). Participants will include current patients receiving treatment in the intensive outpatient program, and all treatment decisions will be overseen by practitioners within the program. The overarching goal is to test whether using the Vira platform in the context of an intensive outpatient setting improves clinical outcomes.

Input Text: Tunnel Widening in Augmented ACL Integration Via PrP Enriched Collected Autologous Bone vs Standard ACL Technique

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
To be successful, an ACL reconstruction requires a strong incorporation of the tendon to the bone within or at the margin of the tunnel, but the tunnel itself is at risk of widening, therefore compromising the tendon attachment. A composite of harvested healthy autologous bone fragments from the tunnel and autologous thrombin and fibrin, generated from the patient's PrP could be used at the interface between tunnel and ACL graft at the tibia and femur to reduce frequency of tunnel widening and therefore improve graft-bone-integration. The study seeks primarily to determine less tibial tunnel widening when a bone/PrP-composite is applied directly in the tibial tunnel compared to the same surgery without using the composite, measured with CT and MRI. Secondary study objectives are to evaluate femoral tunnel widening, tibial and femoral graft incorporation, graft maturation and knee function (clinical, functional, patient reported) over the course of 24 months follow-up and to evaluate occurrence of procedure- and product-related adverse events and complications. This is a prospective, single-center, patient-blinded, randomized, parallel-group, superiority study to compare the efficacy of augmented ACL integration via platelet-rich-plasma enriched collected autologous bone versus standard ACL technique.

Input Text: Immediate Effects of PNF With Lower Leg Kinesiotaping in Chronic Stroke

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Detailed Description: Stroke has been described clinically through the abrupt onset of signs of focal neurological disorder that remain more than 24 hours( or lead to earlier brain damage).The general prevalence charge of stroke is round 2-25 according to thousand population. The chance of recurrance over five years is 15-40%. Ischemic stroke is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in the neck or brain becomes blocked. Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis).Hemorrhagic stroke is because of bleeding into the brain through the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemiparetic gait is characterised by using particular spatiotemporal features (1) restoring muscle characteristic by assisting weakened muscles,(2) reducing congestion through improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing ache by way of stimulating neurological system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm. Depending on the direction of application and tape tension increasing proprioception and increasing or inhibiting muscle recruitment can be obtained. The effect and positive result of Kinesio Taping greatly centers on increase in neuromuscular recruitment.RCT was conducted by S.Choi et.al in 2020 on immediate effects of lower leg kinesiotaping on ankle dorsiflexion and gait parameters in patients with chronic stroke with foot drop.The aim of the study was to estimate the immediate effects kinesiotaping of lower leg on ankle dorsiflexion as compared to no taping.

Input Text: Net Transition Initiative: Efficacy of Two Next-generation Nets for Control of Malaria in Cote d'Ivoire

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: The massive scale-up of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) has led to a major reduction in malaria burden in many sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. This progress is threatened by the wide scale selection of insecticide resistant malaria vectors. Study site: The study will be conducted in the department of Tiebissou (Gbeke Region in Lac district) Southern Bouake city, central Côte d'Ivoire. The Lac district is characterized by intense indoor malaria transmission with a prevalence of malaria reaching 51.3% in 2021 in children of under 5 years of age and extremely high pyrethroid resistance intensity in the main malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii. Study design: Three-arm superiority, single blinded, cluster-randomised trial with village as the unit of randomisation. The arms consist of; 1/ Veeralin LLIN, a net combining the synergist PBO and the pyrethroid alpha-cypermethrin, 2/ Interceptor G2, a mixture LLIN incorporating two adulticides with different modes of action; chlorfenapyr and a pyrethroid (alpha-cypermethrin), and 3/ the control arm: MAGNet LLIN, an alpha-cypermethrin-only LLIN. Activities/Sample size: A total of 33 villages (1 village = 1 cluster) with an average of 200 households will be identified and mapped. Nets will be distributed at a central point following national guidelines with 1 net for every 2 people. To compare incidence of malaria cases between each intervention study arm and the control arm, a cohort of 50 children ("

Input Text: Improving Attendance in Community Wise

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Rates of alcohol and substance misuse (ASM) in low-income, predominantly African American communities (from here on marginalized communities) are similar to the general population. However, ASM has greater consequences (e.g., higher incarceration and HIV/HCV infection rates) for residents in these communities. While the etiology underpinning this inequity is complex, the root cause of these issues has been traced to social determinants of health (SDH; e.g., stigma; poverty; barriers to education, housing, and employment). Funded by the National Institute for Minority Health Disparities (NIMHD 5R01MD010629), in partnership with the Critical Consciousness Collaborative Board (3CB), we developed Community Wise (CW), a multi-level manualized behavioral intervention to decrease ASM frequency in a population of self-identified men with histories of substance use disorder (SUD) and incarceration in Essex County, NJ, U.S. The 3CB was founded in 2010 and developed and pilot-tested the original CW. Over the past six years, our team used the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), and community based participatory research (CBPR) principles to develop and optimize CW for efficacy in reducing ASM. MOST is an innovative methodological framework that employs experimental designs to engineer efficient and effective behavioral interventions. MOST guided the optimization of CW with delivery cost of less than $2,000 per intervention cycle serving up to ten individuals simultaneously (this was the Medicaid allowable reimbursement cost for SUD group treatment services in 2015). Clinical trial results showed larger ASM reduction (Cohen's d=-2∙22, P=0∙067"

Input Text: Comparison of Interpectoral+Serratus Anterior Block With Erector Spinae Block in Minimally Invasive Cardiac Surgery

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Minimally invasive cardiac surgery is necessary surgery that can take steps to improve the quality of life and functional status of patients without sternotomy. However, patients may experience intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, which can lead to inactivity, increased risk of complications, and greater consumption of opioids, resulting in adverse effects and prolonged hospital stays. Pain management is challenging due to a large number of dermatomes covered. The interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block seems to cover the thoracic dermatomes. It has been the subject of many studies in the same surgical group. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery can be excruciating in the postoperative period, just like thoracotomy surgeries. What is aimed of this study is to compare it with erector spinae block in this study. Additional anesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of the multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to manage acute pain better. Inadequate treatment can lead to persistent pain conditions. Although numerous nerve blocks exist for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the thoracic dermatomes or their entire innervation. The central hypothesis of this study hypothesis, interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block, defined in 2012, has been used in many previous studies as part of multimodal analgesia in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Erector spinae block was also described in 2018 with positive results that have been used in both sternotomies (open heart surgery) and minimally invasive procedures. In this randomized clinical trial, the study aims to compare the efficacy of previously known field"

Input Text: De-escalation of Antiplatelet Therapy to Evaluate Platelet Reactivity and Clinical Outcomes After Coronary Stenting in Patients at High Bleeding Risk and Recent Acute Coronary Syndrome: DESC-HBR Trial

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
The aim of the DESC-HBR trial is to compare the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid, with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitor on the proportion of patients in the OPR range measured through the VerifyNow system. The secondary outcome is to explore the effect of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor therapy on clinical events and patients' quality of life. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients in the OPR range measured through the VerifyNow system at peak level after drug MD at 14±2 days from study inclusion. OPR will be defined as a PRU between 85 and 208 reactivity units according to international expert consensus. Secondary outcomes include: incidence of bleeding events according to multiple bleeding definitions, platelet reactive units (PRU) at VerifyNow system, platelet-derived thrombogenicity at Total Thrombus Formation (T-TAS), adverse clinical event, cost-effectiveness.

Input Text: Paramedical Tele-education on Moderate Depressive Episodes

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
In addition to the usual standard care, recruited patients will benefit from either an individual tele-education programme or standard care following the randomisation. The psycho-education programme is based on 3 dimensions: educational (nature of the information and how it should be delivered), psychological (revelation of the diagnosis and transmission of information in a personalised way), behavioural and cognitive (restoring the skills and mobilising the resources of the subject in their daily functioning and in their relationship with the disease (management of treatment and communication skills in particular). A low number of sessions has been chosen, as it is more appropriate for this population, whose disorders are not severe and who do not require specialist care. The emphasis was placed on personalising the information, with one-to-one sessions. The tele-education program consists of 5 sessions and is designed to adapt to changes in depressive symptoms over time. Each session will last an average of 60 minutes. They will be scheduled every week for 5 weeks. The first session is devoted to educational diagnosis, with identification of the patient's needs and any barriers to treatment, in order to personalise the information to be provided about the programme. The second session will focus on personalised hygienic and dietary measures. This will involve identifying sleep habits and leisure activities through behavioural analysis, and then identifying coping strategies with the patient in order to identify habits that can help combat depression. A third session will focus on identifying the symptoms of depression, with a particular focus on suicidal ideation and the causes of depression. The role of family and friends will also be discussed. A fourth session will be devoted to providing clear information on antidepressants, with particular attention to the duration of treatment. The aim of the final session is to identify what has been learned and to clarify any questions before drawing up a joint summary of"
