-----------------
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition that affects 15% of the population. It is characterized by urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia. The first line treatment is anticholinergic medication. However, 30-50% of patients do not respond to this treatment. The second line treatment is onabotulinum toxin A (Botox) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM). Botox is a toxin that is injected into the bladder wall. It is effective in 50-80% of patients. SNM is a surgical procedure that involves implanting a small device in the lower back. It is effective in 60-80% of patients. However, there is no consensus on which treatment is the best for patients with OAB. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is a method that can be used to measure patient preferences for different treatments. It involves asking patients to choose between two fictive treatments, each option comes with it's own botox and SNM characteristics. The DCE will be used to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy. The results of the DCE will be used to inform clinical decision making.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy.

9,"1. Background and rationale: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management to prevent complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a technology that can help people with T1D manage their blood glucose levels more effectively. CGM devices measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid continuously and provide real-time data to the user. This information can help people with T1D make more informed decisions about their diabetes management, such as adjusting insulin doses, dietary choices, or physical activity levels. However, the use of CGM devices is not widespread in South Africa due to a lack of evidence on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. In addition, there is limited evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use on blood glucose levels in people living with T1D in South Africa. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 3. Study design: This is a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled study. The study will be conducted in three study clinics in South Africa. The study will enroll 150 participants who will be randomly assigned to one of the three study arms: Arm 1: continuous CGM use; Arm 2: intermittent CGM use; Arm 3: standard of care (control). The study will be conducted over a period of 15 months. 4. Study population: The study population will include people living with T1D who are attending for diabetes care at the study clinics. The study will also include caregivers of children/adolescents living with T1D and healthcare providers involved in clinical care at the study sites. 5. Study interventions: The study interventions will include continuous and intermittent CGM use, standard of care, and qualitative methods. 6. Study outcomes: The primary study outcome will be the change in HbA1c levels before and after treatment in standard of care, continuous, and intermittent CGM arms. The secondary study outcomes will include the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 7. Study methods: The study will use a mixed methods approach, including quantitative and qualitative methods. The study will use a range of data collection methods, including surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions. 8. Study analysis: The study will use a range of statistical and analytical methods to analyze the study data. The study will use descriptive statistics to summarize the study data, and inferential statistics to test the study hypotheses. The study will also use qualitative methods to analyze the study data. 9. Study dissemination: The study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and other appropriate channels. The study results will also be shared with the study participants and other stakeholders. 10. Study limitations: The study has several limitations, including the potential for selection bias, the potential for measurement bias, and the potential for confounding. The study will use a range of methods to minimize these limitations. 11. Study implications: The study results will have important implications for the management of T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries. The study results will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use in people living with T1D in South Africa. The study results will also provide evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. The study results will inform policy and decision-making related to the use of CGM devices in people living with T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries."

11,"Background
-----------------
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. It is the most common chronic disease in childhood, with a prevalence of 10% in children aged 12-17 years. The disease is characterized by a high variability in the clinical course, with a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The main objective of asthma treatment is to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations. The treatment plan is based on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA), which are the mainstay of asthma treatment. However, adherence to treatment is often poor, especially in children, and this can lead to poor control of the disease and an increased risk of exacerbations. In recent years, the use of digital technologies in the management of chronic diseases has been increasingly studied. In particular, the use of serious games (SG) has been proposed as a tool to improve adherence to treatment and to promote a healthy lifestyle in children with asthma. SG are interactive games that are designed to promote learning and behavior change. They can be used to educate patients about their disease and to promote healthy behaviors, such as physical activity and healthy eating. In this study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma. The SG will be designed to be fun and engaging, and will be based on the principles of gamification. The SG will be used in conjunction with a standard treatment plan, and patients will be followed for six months. The primary outcome of the study will be adherence to treatment, as measured by the number of days of treatment taken and the number of exacerbations. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life, as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and the Skills and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Ita). The study will be conducted in collaboration with the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and will involve 60 children with asthma. The study will be conducted in two groups: one group will receive the SG in addition to the standard treatment plan, while the other group will receive the standard treatment plan only. The study will be conducted in a randomized, controlled trial design. The results of the study will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma.

SG will include an adaptive tool to enable the experience based on the child's specific motor skills. The dynamics of SG will be adapted by considering real motor and physiological data acquired during each SG session via a wristband. These data are necessary to keep the child in the aerobic zone (60-80% of maximum heart rate). The movements are: Side bending: Moving an obstacle to open a passage.

13,"1. Background:

The investigators hypothesize that the current practice of weaning infants off of CPAP too early is associated with an increased risk of lung injury and poor lung growth.

2. Objectives:

The investigators aim to determine whether a standardized maintenance/weaning protocol for CPAP will reduce the number of infants who fail to wean off of CPAP.

3. Study Design:

This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks CGA exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations. The control group will be weaned according to the unit's or medical team's practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations"

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of HF diagnosis in outpatient settings, urgent heart failure visit, heart failure hospitalization, and prescription for guideline recommended HF therapies in patients diagnosed with HFrEF within 6 months.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be patients with at least two additional risk factors for HF. Male or female > 40 years of age Informed consent At least two additional risk factors for Heart Failure (HF): Coronary artery disease (either a previous documented type 1 myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention or documented stenosis or an epicardial coronary artery (50% left main stem or >70% left anterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery)). Diabetes type 1 or 2. Persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation. Previous ischemic or embolic stroke. Peripheral artery disease (previous surgical or percutaneous revascularization or documented stenosis >50% of major peripheral arterial vessel. Chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 milliliters per minute (mL/min)/1.73m2 or eGFR 60-90 mL/min/1.73m2 and urine albumin-creatinine ration (UACR) >300mg/g). Regular loop diuretic use for >30 days within 12 months prior to consent. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) evidenced by one of the following: Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) showing airway obstruction, diagnosis of respiratory physician, CT scan reporting presence of emphysema, or treatment with national guidance advocated COPD therapy. Exclusion Criteria: Inability to give informed consent (e.g. due to significant cognitive impairment). Previous diagnosis of heart failure. This is any diagnosis of heart failure with any ejection fraction of any cause. Renal replacement therapy. Anyone who, in the investigator's opinion, is not suitable to participate in the trial for other reasons e.g., a diagnosis which may compromise survival over the study period.

Propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic agent. It is a short-acting anesthetic agent that is used in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It is a lipophilic drug that is rapidly distributed in the body and has a short half-life. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Propofol is a safe and effective anesthetic agent, but it can cause adverse effects such as respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction varies depending on the patient's weight. The recommended dose of propofol for anesthesia induction is 2-2.5 mg/kg for adults. However, the dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may vary depending on the patient's weight. Patients with a higher body weight may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients with a lower body weight may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's age, gender, and medical history. Patients with a history of liver or kidney disease may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients with a history of heart disease may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's physical condition. Patients who are obese or have a history of obesity may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients who are underweight or have a history of underweight may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's psychological condition. Patients who are anxious or have a history of anxiety may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients who are calm or have a history of calmness may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. CMV infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in SOT recipients. CMV prophylaxis is recommended for all SOT recipients who are CMV seropositive and have a CMV seropositive donor. The current standard of care for CMV prophylaxis is valganciclovir. However, valganciclovir is associated with significant toxicity, including bone marrow suppression, renal toxicity, and gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance. Letermovir is a novel oral antiviral agent that is approved for the prevention of CMV infection in adult CMV seropositive kidney transplant recipients. Letermovir is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of CMV DNA polymerase. Letermovir is dosed at 480mg daily for patients with CrCl >10. Dose adjustment, as per package insert, is recommended in setting of co-administration of cyclosporine, with dose reduction of letermovir to 240mg daily. Missed doses of letermovir will not be made up.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in thoracic organ transplant recipients. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in thoracic organ transplant recipients.

Study Design
-----------------
This study is a prospective cohort design. Subjects exposed to letermovir for CMV prophylaxis following heart or lung transplantation will be compared with those who received standard valganciclovir prophylaxis in the two years before the study began (referred to as the pre-intervention period). The goal is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of letermovir.

Study Population

-----------------
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main subtypes of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). The incidence of IBD is increasing worldwide, and the disease is associated with a reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased risk of colorectal cancer. The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Diet is one of the most important environmental factors that can influence the development and progression of IBD. A diet high in fiber has been shown to be beneficial for IBD patients, as it can help to reduce inflammation and improve gut health. However, many IBD patients do not consume enough fiber, as they often experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to explore the effect of a 4-week WholeFiberTM intervention on inflammation, fecal gut microbiota and metabolites, IBD-complaints and QoL in patients with CD and UC. The secondary objective is to assess the feasibility of the intervention.

Dyspnea is a common symptom in patients under invasive mechanical ventilation. It is a subjective sensation of breathing discomfort that can be difficult to assess in patients who are intubated and sedated. The assessment of dyspnea is therefore often based on the observation of the patient's behavior and the evaluation of the respiratory rate and the respiratory effort. The assessment of dyspnea is also based on the evaluation of the patient's respiratory variability. The respiratory variability is defined as the variation in the amplitude of the respiratory movements. It is measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the chest expansion. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation of the chest expansion to the mean chest expansion. The CV is a measure of the variability of the respiratory movements.

29,"1. Introduction: The term MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) refers to the transitional state between normal cognitive changes associated with aging and very early dementia. It is a disorder characterized by impairments in both short-term and long-term memory, but without functional deficits. MCI is considered a precursor to dementia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that in 2014 there were 5.0 million adults with cognitive impairment (CI) in the population aged 65 years and older, and it is projected that by 2060, this number will increase to nearly 14 million. A study by Gómez on sentinel health networks in Spain describes a prevalence of MCI among individuals aged 65 years and older ranging from 14.5% to 17.6% , which increases with age. Another study reports a prevalence of 11.6% in individuals aged 65 to 69 years, which rises to an average of 22.9% among those aged 85 years and older. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 9 Spanish studies on different types of dementia showed a prevalence ranging from 3.2% to 12.3% in individuals aged 70 years and older, with higher prevalence in women and increasing with age. Activities of daily living (ADL) rely on a combination of motor, cognitive, and socioemotional skills . Therefore, CI can directly impact independence in ADL, leading to immobility and social isolation . Gait and balance impairments are common in individuals with dementia, including slower gait speeds, decreased stride length, altered swing time, among others. However, these motor alterations are often overlooked when addressing CI . Balance impairment combined with gait deficits significantly increases the risk of falls, with approximately 60% of individuals with CI experiencing falls annually, twice as frequently as cognitively intact counterparts . Individuals with CI are also more prone to falls resulting in injuries, with up to a three-fold increase in the incidence of hip fractures compared to those without CI. Recognizing and addressing this connection between cognitive and motor deficits is crucial . Action Observation Therapy (AOT) involves observing a motor gesture performed by another individual and then imitating the same movement. This technique has been developed as a physical rehabilitation approach that promotes brain plasticity by activating the mirror neuron system . Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of action observation learning. A study conducted with children with cerebral palsy, presented by Naura et al. , showed that motor learning through observation is more effective and provides more evident benefits when subjects learn from other patients with the same condition but less severity, compared to learning by observing a therapist or another person without motor impairment. However, these results have not been corroborated in older patients or those with CI. The current literature includes various studies consistently demonstrating that AOT is an effective way to learn or improve specific motor skills. Buccino's work summarizes several studies that have employed AOT, including one in which the intervention was carried out with healthy individuals to imitate a motor action in a new environment for them. Another study showed that AOT facilitates motor learning and the construction of a motor memory trace in adults and in patients who have had a stroke. In another study, it was demonstrated that, in healthy adults, AOT is superior to motor imagery as a strategy for learning a complex motor task, at least in the early phase of motor learning. Buccino concludes that these results can have significant implications in educational activities, sports training, and neurorehabilitation. Specifically in the field of pathology, evidence exists regarding the application of AOT for upper limb rehabilitation in patients who have had a stroke. A pilot study by Yu-Wei Hsieh concluded that AOT resulted in improvements in most outcomes, suggesting it as a promising alternative to contemporary bilateral arm training interventions (i.e., active control intervention) for subacute stroke patients . In a randomized controlled pilot study by Mancuso et al., it was proposed that AOT is a promising treatment for functional recovery and upper limb function in individuals with moderate to severe upper limb impairment following a stroke. AOT could become a useful strategy in stroke rehabilitation programs, as it improves functionality of the paretic upper limb and allows for regaining maximum independence in ADL . Evidence also exists for AOT in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, specifying that AOT increases spontaneous use of the affected upper limb through observation and imitation"

31,"Episiotomy is a planned surgical incision to the perineum and posterior wall of the vagina during the second stage of labor. The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and non-ablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Er:YAG laser on the tissue healing of the episiotomy scars and the reduction of vulvar pain."

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in children. The prevalence of CP is estimated to be 2.1 per 1000 live births. CP is a heterogeneous disorder, with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The most common type of CP is spastic hemiplegic CP, which is characterized by a unilateral distribution of motor impairments. In addition to motor impairments, children and adolescents with unilateral CP often present with somatosensory impairments, which are defined as a deficit in the processing of sensory information. Somatosensory impairments are present in 50-80% of children and adolescents with unilateral CP and are associated with poorer functional hand use.

Currently, the majority of upper limb therapy programs for children and adolescents with unilateral CP focus on motor training. However, the effects of motor training on somatosensory function are still unclear. In addition, the effects of motor training on functional hand use are often limited. Therefore, there is a need for novel therapy programs that focus on somatosensory function and that are able to improve functional hand use.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an intensive upper limb therapy program focused on somatosensation in children and adolescents with unilateral CP. The secondary objective is to determine the predictive value of clinical and neuroimaging variables on the therapy response.

Study design
-----------------
A randomized controlled trial will be carried out in 50 children and adolescents with spastic unilateral CP aged between 7 and 15 years old. Participants will be randomized to the intervention group or the active control group. Participants in both groups will receive three session of 45 minutes upper limb therapy per week for a period of 8 weeks, resulting in a total therapy intensity of 18 hours. The intervention group will receive Sense for Kids therapy, which consists of component-based training and occupation-based training. During the component-based training participants will perform graded and structured practice of tactile object recognition, texture discrimination and proprioception. During the occupation-based practice, participants will repetitively and structured practice of self-chosen activities of daily living while attention is denoted to somatosensory aspects necessary for successful task completion (e.g., position of the upper limb, texture of materials, localization of materials based on touch). Participants in the control group will receive an equal amount of motor training, consisting of unimanual motor tasks and bimanual goal directed training. All therapy sessions will be performed under supervision of a trained physical and/or occupational therapist. Therapy adherence and progression will be closely monitored by the therapist. Outcomes will be assessed at three different points in time, being within two weeks prior to therapy commencement (baseline), within one week following therapy completion (post-intervention) and 6 months after the therapy has ended (follow-up).

33,"Background: Gallstone disease affects 10-15% of people in the United Kingdom (UK) and over 65,000 patients undergoing cholecystectomy each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) over 110 million. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without (including reduced diversity, decreased prevalence of beneficial and increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria) but there are only a handful of small scale studies exploring the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Hypothesis and Objectives: This pilot study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including: Patients who develop complications of gallstone disease(including but not limited to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis and gallstone ileus) following diagnosis and Patients who develop post-operative complications including short (hospital stay, wound healing etc) and intermediate (development of post-cholecystectomy diarrhoea) outcomes. Design and Methods: A prospective cohort design will be used to collect data from 75 adult patients presenting to East Kent University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Hospitals with newly diagnosed gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging investigations. Data will be collected from electronic patient records including clinical history and diagnostic investigations, anthropometry, blood and imaging results (if taken as part of routine clinical care) for the initial presentation and subsequent readmissions/planned follow-up timepoints. Stool samples will be collected from patients either during admission or at home at each timepoint. Samples will be returned by post to the research team where they will be stored and analysed. Patients will also be asked to provide a 3 day food diary card Patients will have a sample collected at time of diagnosis and then at 6 monthly intervals whilst awaiting cholecystectomy. A pre-operative sample will be required within 6 weeks of any surgical intervention. Following cholecystectomy an immediate post-operative sample (within the first week) will be collected as well as a sample at 6 months. Clinical and Scientific Impact: At least 20% of those patients awaiting cholecystectomy experience complications, costing the NHS over £25 million per year. Therefore, there is a huge need to understand mechanisms behind the development of complications and to reduce the symptom burden for patients as well as the financial burden for the NHS. This study is the crucial first step in identifying differences in the gut microbiome between patients who experience complications (both pre and post-op) and those who do not. Once differences are discovered the next step will be to use the information discovered to determine interventions to reduce the development of these complications."

-----------------
Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) is a common complication of sepsis, which is associated with increased mortality. The pathogenesis of SALD is complex and multifactorial, including direct injury to hepatocytes, hypoxia, and inflammatory response. The diagnosis of SALD is based on the presence of elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin levels. However, the diagnosis of SALD is often delayed due to the lack of specific diagnostic tests. The prognosis of SALD is poor, with a mortality rate of up to 50%. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of SALD are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to investigate the association between initial aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI) and the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

Methods
-----------------
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the MIMIC IV database. We included adult sepsis patients (≥18 years) as study participants, but only those who had data available for their first hospitalization and first ICU admission were enrolled in our study, if they had multiple admission records in the database. Exclusion criteria include: all types of chronic liver disease; viral hepatitis; primary acute cholangiopathies; cholecystitis; hepatic infarction; liver necrosis; liver trauma; length of ICU stay < 24 hours. Patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission were also excluded. The following indicators were extracted directly or derived from the database(MIMIC IV): age; weight; gender; comorbidity, including hypertension, old myocardial infarct, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease and diabetes; infection site, including blood, lung, skin and soft tissue, abdominal cavity and urinary tract; disease severity scores within the first day of ICU admission, including Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Oxford Acute Severity of illness Score (OASIS) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II); mean vital signs in first 24h, including heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2); treatment received within the first day of ICU admission, including invasive ventilation, vasopressor therapy, renal replacement therapy and parenteral nutrition (PN) support; initial laboratory parameters, including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell (RBC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, bicarbonate, anionic gap, sodium, potassium, chloride, total calcium, glucose, prothrombin time (PT), partial prothrombine time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR) and APRI; clinical outcome measures, including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. The disease severity scores, including APS III, SOFA, LODS, OASIS, SAPS II, are calculated using the SQL code provided by Johnson et al. APRI is calculated by (AST(IU/L)/ upper limits of normal)/PLT(k/uL)×100. Sepsis is diagnosed according to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3"

38,"The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as taught muscle bands, trigger points (TPs), and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker)."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, which leads to paralysis and death. The disease is rare, with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 person-years. The median survival time is 3-5 years after diagnosis. The disease is progressive and there is no cure. The only treatment that has been shown to prolong survival is long term mechanical ventilation support (LTMV). LTMV is a treatment that involves the use of a ventilator to help a person breathe. The ventilator is connected to a tube that is inserted into the person’s airway. The ventilator delivers oxygen and other gases to the lungs. LTMV is a life-saving treatment for people with ALS who have lost the ability to breathe on their own. LTMV can help people with ALS to live longer and more comfortably. However, LTMV is not without risks. The most common risks associated with LTMV are pneumonia, respiratory infections, and skin breakdown. In addition, LTMV can be burdensome for caregivers. Caregivers may experience stress, anxiety, and depression as a result of caring for a loved one with ALS. They may also experience financial strain as a result of the costs associated with LTMV. Despite the risks and burdens associated with LTMV, many people with ALS choose to receive this treatment. This is because LTMV can help people with ALS to live longer and more comfortably. In addition, LTMV can help people with ALS to maintain their quality of life.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall quality of life of ALS patients who choose life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families with ALS patients who decline life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the health-related quality of life, disease-specific quality of life, and caregiver burden of ALS patients who choose life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families with ALS patients who decline life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects young adults. It is characterized by the presence of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of the disease. The pathophysiology of MS is complex and involves both immune and neurodegenerative mechanisms. The mainstay of treatment for MS is immunomodulatory therapy, which aims to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and slow the progression of disability. Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a surface protein expressed on B cells. It is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion every 6 months. The recommended dose is 600 mg, administered as two 300 mg infusions given 2 weeks apart. The efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. In the OPERA I and II trials, ocrelizumab was shown to be superior to interferon beta-1a in reducing the number of relapses and the accumulation of disability in patients with RRMS. In the ORATORIO trial, ocrelizumab was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the progression of disability in patients with PPMS. Ocrelizumab is generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions and infections. However, there are concerns about the long-term safety of ocrelizumab, particularly with regard to the risk of malignancy and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is a rare but serious complication of ocrelizumab therapy, in which the immune system reacts aggressively to the re-emergence of latent infections or the reactivation of autoimmune diseases. IRIS can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment. The risk of IRIS is highest in patients who have been treated with ocrelizumab for a long time and who have a history of latent infections or autoimmune diseases. To minimize the risk of IRIS, patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection or autoimmune disease. If IRIS is suspected, the patient should be referred to a specialist for evaluation and treatment. In conclusion, ocrelizumab is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for MS. However, there are concerns about the long-term safety of the drug, particularly with regard to the risk of malignancy and IRIS. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection or autoimmune disease, and prompt treatment should be initiated if IRIS is suspected.

47,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% hypertonic saline (HS) is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with neuromuscular disease (NMD) or neurodisability.

Background
-----------------
Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) are a group of disorders that affect the nerves and muscles. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, autoimmune diseases, and infections. NMD can cause a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing. People with NMD often have a reduced quality of life and a shorter life expectancy.

Neurodisability is a term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the brain and nervous system. These conditions can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, infections, and trauma. Neurodisability can cause a range of symptoms, including cognitive impairment, difficulty with movement, and difficulty with communication. People with neurodisability often have a reduced quality of life and a shorter life expectancy.

Both NMD and neurodisability can cause respiratory problems, including difficulty breathing and difficulty clearing secretions from the lungs. These respiratory problems can lead to respiratory infections, which can be life-threatening in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Hypertonic saline (HS) is a solution that contains a higher concentration of salt than normal saline. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including respiratory infections and cystic fibrosis. HS is thought to work by drawing water out of the lungs, which helps to clear secretions and improve breathing.

There is some evidence that HS may be effective in treating respiratory infections in people with NMD or neurodisability. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support this. The purpose of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% HS is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% HS is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a phase 2 open label pilot study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include people with NMD or neurodisability who are aged 5 years and above.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be nebulised 6% HS. Participants will receive 3ml of 6% HS via nebuliser twice daily for 52 weeks.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the number of respiratory exacerbations. A respiratory exacerbation will be defined as a worsening of respiratory symptoms that requires antibiotic treatment.

Secondary outcome measures will include:

- Lung clearance index (LCI)
- Forced oscillation technique (FOT)
- Lung ultrasound
- Electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
- Airway inflammation
- Bacterial diversity
- Ease of airway clearance
- Health-related quality of life
- Patient and main carer treatment satisfaction
- Family impact
- Health economics

49,"18FDG PET is the current standard of care for metabolic imaging of brain tumors. However, it is expensive, requires a cyclotron, and is not widely available. Activity MRI (aMRI) is a new metabolic imaging approach that uses the same MRI scanner as conventional MRI, but does not require a cyclotron. aMRI is based on the fact that the magnetic resonance signal is sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic ions, such as iron. Iron is a byproduct of metabolism, and its concentration in the brain is related to the metabolic activity of the brain. aMRI can be used to measure the concentration of iron in the brain, and this concentration is related to the metabolic activity of the brain. aMRI has been shown to be a sensitive and specific metabolic imaging approach in animal models of brain tumors. The purpose of this study is to determine whether aMRI is a valid metabolic imaging approach in human subjects with brain tumors."

58,"Background
-----------------
Family planning (FP) is a key component of reproductive health and is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . The World Health Organization (WHO) defines FP as the ability of individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births . The WHO recommends that FP services should be available to all individuals and couples who want to avoid or delay pregnancy, regardless of their marital status, age, or parity . In Egypt, the total fertility rate (TFR) has declined from 6.7 in 1992 to 3.5 in 2014 . However, the unmet need for family planning (UNFP) remains high, with an estimated 22% of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who want to avoid or delay pregnancy but are not using any method of contraception . The high UNFP rate is a major public health concern, as it increases the risk of unintended pregnancies, maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and other adverse health outcomes .
The quality of FP services is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of FP programs . Poor-quality FP services can lead to negative health outcomes, such as unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality . The quality of FP services is determined by various factors, including the availability of trained providers, the availability of appropriate contraceptive methods, and the quality of counseling provided to clients .
In Egypt, the quality of FP services has been a concern for many years . A study conducted in 2014 found that only 40% of women who received FP services reported receiving high-quality counseling . The study also found that the quality of counseling varied significantly across different types of health facilities, with private clinics providing the highest quality of counseling and public hospitals providing the lowest quality of counseling .
The quality of FP services in Egypt is further compounded by the lack of standardized guidelines for FP counseling . The current guidelines for FP counseling in Egypt are based on the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (MEC) . However, these guidelines do not provide specific guidance on how to provide high-quality counseling to clients .
In order to improve the quality of FP services in Egypt, it is essential to develop and implement standardized guidelines for FP counseling. These guidelines should be based on the latest evidence and should be tailored to the specific needs of clients in different settings. The guidelines should also be regularly updated to reflect changes in the evidence base and to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.
In addition to developing and implementing standardized guidelines for FP counseling, it is also essential to train healthcare providers in the provision of high-quality counseling. This training should be comprehensive and should cover all aspects of FP counseling, including the provision of information about contraceptive methods, the assessment of client needs and preferences, and the provision of support and guidance to clients.
The provision of high-quality FP counseling is essential for achieving the SDGs and for improving the health and well-being of women and their families in Egypt. By developing and implementing standardized guidelines for FP counseling and by training healthcare providers in the provision of high-quality counseling, we can ensure that all women who want to avoid or delay pregnancy have access to high-quality FP services.

-----------------
Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is a leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. DFO is a complication of a large amount of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and is a major trigger of lower limb amputations. DFO is defined as an infection of the bone and/or joint space in a patient with DM and a DFU. The diagnosis of DFO is based on clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria. The microbiological diagnosis of DFO is based on the isolation of microorganisms from bone biopsy (BB) samples. The gold standard for the diagnosis of DFO is the bone biopsy (BB) procedure. However, BB is underused in clinical practice for various reasons including lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find BB cumbersome or too invasive. To overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by a physician at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete DFU healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside versus conventional BB in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non inferior to conventional BB in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. The main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological) on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives of this study are to: compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy compare microbiological culture results between groups compare the safety of both procedures compare DFO remission according to results of BB (negative or positive) The health economic of this study are to: to estimate total costs for the intervention and total medical costs in each groups to estimate total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based upon EQ5D5L scores to calculate the point estimate of the incremental cost utility ratio and estimate the probability of decremental cost effectiveness for the beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional biopsy.

75,"Aging is a complex process that involves changes in multiple organ systems. The aging process is associated with a decline in physical and cognitive function, which can lead to frailty and disability. Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, such as falls, hospitalization, and death. It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of older adults are frail, and this number is expected to increase as the population ages. Frailty is associated with a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, including falls, hospitalization, and death.

The AGE SELF CARE group visit program is a virtual program that aims to promote healthy aging and prevent frailty in older adults. The program is designed to be delivered in a group setting, with each session lasting approximately 90 minutes. The program is led by an aging expert, such as a geriatrician, and includes education and behavioral change elements in the broad areas of self/health, home environment, and community.

76,"1. Background and rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hard, and older and vulnerable persons are more likely to get very ill when infected, and have the highest morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required. Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments. The goal of geriatric rehabilitation has been defined as to assist [older people] to manage personal activities of daily living without the assistance of another person. If this is not possible, the goal is to minimize the need for external assistance through the use of adaptive techniques and equipment. Thereby focussing on the amelioration of dependency in activities of daily living. However, we are still in the dark about the amount of functional recovery of geriatric post-COVID-19 patients. We do know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious. Before being able to assure the best outcomes for older post-COVID geriatric rehabilitation patients, we first have to be informed about what the clinical characteristics are, what treatment is provided, and what outcomes geriatric post-COVID-19 patients have in geriatric rehabilitation. Therefore, members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the European Geriatric Medical Society (EuGMS) decided to conduct this multi-center observational cohort study into usual care data on the course of functional and clinical outcomes in post-COVID-19 geriatric rehabilitation patients in several European countries. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study to get insight into the course of functional and medical recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. The secondary objective is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organisation of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. 3. Study design: In principle, patients admitted for geriatric rehabilitation due to COVID-19 morbidity will be informed by letter and asked if they have objections that their regular care data will be anonymously used for research purposes to improve practice in geriatric rehabilitation. If they do, the data will not be used (opt-out procedure). In some countries this will be conducted under the guidelines for service evaluation and audit, as it uses routine data, held entirely by the clinical care team. Where this is not possible because of local legislation or guidelines, informed consent will be obtained (opt-in procedure). During one-year (October 2020 - November 2021), patients were enrolled in the study. Participants will receive standard rehabilitation treatment according to the discretion of clinical teams, which will likely be adapted to the specific needs of post-COVID-19 patients. This treatment includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medical treatment by an advanced nursing practitioner, geriatrician or medical specialist. This study will not influence any therapy provided or decisions about the medical treatment or treatment programs already used in the participating geriatric rehabilitation setting. This study is observational and it is not anticipated that the observations will influence therapy or treatment, particularly since such indices, questionnaires and measurements are a regular part of the rehabilitation program. 4. Study management: For each participating geriatric rehabilitation facility in Europe one instructed local care professional will complete an online CASTOR database in which anonymous data from the clinical records of the included patients will be collected at admission, discharge and 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up. For countries with multiple participating sites, a country coordinator was appointed. Most country coordinators were the members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the EuGMS. 5. Data collection: Variables collected Demographic factors: In all participants, selected demographic factors such as year of birth/age, gender, and residency premorbid will be documented. Information from hospital / general practitioner: hospital length of stay (days), ICU length of stay (days), complications during hospital stay or at home (Thromboembolism, Delirium, Pressure Ulcer), and COVID-19 diagnosis"
77,"1. Background and rationale: The immunogenicity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens is diminished in kidney transplant recipients. This patient group therefore remains extremely vulnerable for viral infections despite vaccination. This impaired immune response is related to the use of immunosuppressive agents, especially Mycophenolate Mofetil/Mycophenolic Acid (MMF/MPA). Patients that use everolimus instead of MMF/MPA elicit a higher immune response after vaccination. 2. Objective: To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. 3. Study design: This is a multicentre, open-label, controlled, randomized study to evaluate replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in KTR on immunogenicity and safety after vaccination. The seven participating study sites are Amsterdam UMC, Erasmus MC, Leiden UMC, Maastricht UMC+, Radboudumc, UMC Groningen and UMC Utrecht. At the first study visit, eligibility for study participation will be checked, blood will be drawn, and participants will subsequently be 1:1 randomised to: Continue immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA Replace immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA by everolimus After randomisation, the study will continue in 2 parts: Part 1 - Run-in and COVID-19 vaccination (≥6 weeks + 28 days) The aim of this phase is to first ensure complete washout of MMF/MPA and attaining optimal trough levels of everolimus in patients randomized to everolimus. To monitor tolerability, safety and trough levels, participants will be invited at week 1 and week 3 after randomisation for a blood withdrawal and spot urine collection. At least 6 weeks after randomisation, patients will receive the COVID-19 vaccination (=baseline visit). After 28 days patients will be invited for a study visit for blood withdrawal. Part 2 (optional) - Herpes zoster vaccination (+56 days) Patients that opted to participate in this part of the study will continue their randomised treatment for the next 56 days. During this period patients will receive 2 herpes zoster vaccinations with an interval of 28 days between each vaccination. At 28 days after the second vaccination patients will be invited for the last study visit for blood withdrawal. After completion of the study (either 28 days after COVID-19 vaccination or 28 days after the last herpes zoster vaccination) patients will be offered the option to continue everolimus instead of MMF/MPA as part of shared clinical decision making. 4. Study population: Kidney transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy with either triple or dual therapy including MMF/MPA with a minimum daily dose of 1000 mg (MMF) or 720 mg (MPA) and a CNI. 5. Sample size: 100 participants will be included in the study. 6. Statistical analysis: The primary outcome measure is the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. The primary analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population. The primary analysis will be performed using a linear mixed model with the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain as the dependent variable and the treatment group as the independent variable. The model will be adjusted for the baseline neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. The primary analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The disease is associated with infertility and recurrent miscarriages. The pathophysiology of endometriosis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors. One of the main theories is that endometriosis is caused by retrograde menstruation, in which endometrial tissue is transported through the fallopian tubes and implanted in the pelvic cavity. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the fallopian tubes and increase the risk of retrograde menstruation. Another theory is that endometriosis is caused by an immune system dysfunction, which allows endometrial tissue to survive and grow outside the uterus. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Endometriosis is associated with infertility, which is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. The exact mechanism by which endometriosis causes infertility is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of factors. One of the main theories is that endometriosis causes inflammation in the pelvic cavity, which can damage the fallopian tubes and prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the fallopian tubes and increase the risk of infertility. Another theory is that endometriosis causes changes in the hormonal environment of the uterus, which can affect the quality of the egg and the ability of the embryo to implant in the uterine lining. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is associated with hormonal imbalances.

The diagnosis of endometriosis is based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, such as pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, as well as the presence of endometriosis lesions on pelvic imaging. The most common imaging modality used to diagnose endometriosis is transvaginal ultrasound, which can detect endometriomas (cysts filled with endometrial tissue) and other endometriosis lesions. However, the diagnosis of endometriosis can be challenging, as the symptoms can be non-specific and the lesions can be difficult to detect on imaging.

The treatment of endometriosis depends on the severity of the disease and the symptoms experienced by the patient. The most common treatment options include hormonal therapy, surgical excision of endometriosis lesions, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Hormonal therapy is the most common treatment option for endometriosis, as it can reduce the symptoms of the disease and prevent the growth of endometriosis lesions. The most commonly used hormonal therapies for endometriosis include oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Surgical excision of endometriosis lesions is another treatment option for endometriosis, as it can improve the symptoms of the disease and increase the chances of pregnancy. ART is a treatment option for women with endometriosis who are unable to conceive despite hormonal therapy and surgical excision of endometriosis lesions. ART involves the use of assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), to help women conceive.

The prognosis of endometriosis depends on the severity of the disease and the treatment options available. The majority of women with endometriosis can be successfully treated with hormonal therapy or surgical excision of endometriosis lesions. However, some women may require more aggressive treatment options, such as ART, to conceive. The long-term prognosis of endometriosis is also affected by the risk of recurrence, which is higher in women who undergo surgical excision of endometriosis lesions."

-----------------
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cells. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that produces hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. In people with SCD, the red blood cells become sickle-shaped, which can cause them to become stuck in small blood vessels, leading to pain, organ damage, and other complications. SCD is a chronic disease that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life. It can cause pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that can make it difficult to participate in daily activities and enjoy life. In addition, SCD can also lead to complications such as stroke, lung disease, and kidney damage, which can further impact a person's quality of life. Despite the significant impact of SCD on a person's quality of life, there is limited research on the effectiveness of interventions to improve quality of life in people with SCD. One potential intervention that has been shown to improve quality of life in people with chronic diseases is exercise training. Exercise training has been shown to improve physical function, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve mental health in people with chronic diseases. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of exercise training in people with SCD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week exercise training program on quality of life in people with SCD. The study will compare the effects of the exercise training program to a control group that does not receive the intervention. The study will also evaluate the effects of the exercise training program on pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD.

Objective
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week exercise training program on quality of life in people with SCD. The study will compare the effects of the exercise training program to a control group that does not receive the intervention. The study will also evaluate the effects of the exercise training program on pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD.

Design
-----------------
The study will be a randomized controlled trial with two groups: an exercise training group and a control group. The exercise training group will receive a 6-week exercise training program, while the control group will not receive the intervention. The study will be conducted at a hospital or clinic that specializes in the treatment of SCD.

Participants
-----------------
The study will include people with SCD who are between the ages of 18 and 65. Participants will be recruited through advertisements in the community and through referrals from healthcare providers.

Intervention
-----------------
The exercise training program will consist of a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises. The program will be designed to be safe and effective for people with SCD. The program will be supervised by a trained exercise professional and will be tailored to the individual needs and abilities of each participant. The program will be conducted three times per week for 60 minutes per session.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be quality of life, as measured by the Sickle Cell Quality of Life (SCQOL) questionnaire. The SCQOL is a validated questionnaire that assesses quality of life in people with SCD. The questionnaire consists of 30 items that assess physical, emotional, and social functioning. The questionnaire will be administered at baseline and at the end of the 6-week intervention period.

Secondary outcome measures will include pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD. Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses pain intensity and pain interference. Fatigue will be assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses the severity of fatigue. Other symptoms associated with SCD, such as depression and anxiety, will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses the severity of anxiety and depression.

Statistical Analysis
-----------------
The data will be analyzed using statistical software, such as SPSS or SAS. The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, such as means and standard deviations, to describe the characteristics of the study population. The data will also be analyzed using inferential statistics, such as t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), to compare the effects of the exercise training program to the control group.

-----------------
Bronchiectasis is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible dilatation of the bronchi. It is associated with chronic cough and sputum production, and is predisposed to recurrent airway infections. Many systemic diseases can cause bronchiectasis: cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiencies (PID) and idiopathic bronchiectasis (IB) represent a significant proportion of patients with bronchiectasis starting in early age. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. It can be speculated that for some of the bronchiectasis patients, hyper-reactive airways or asthma can contribute to the reversible pattern. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to ATS/ERS statement, the proper way to determine BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered a positive BDR. While in most scenarios it is reasonable to assume that the change in FEV1 measured after the waiting time can be attributed solely to the affect of bronchodilators, this is not necessarily the case in bronchiectasis. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectatic disease might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives are to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma and use of inhaled steroids.

Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.

Intervention
-----------------
Each group of patients and controls will be randomly assigned to two study arms as follows: patients in both arms will perform regular spirometry. After the first series of spirometry testing, patients in the first arm will receive bronchodilators as per bronchodilator response protocol (Salbutamol, 100 mcg, 4 puffs via spacer) and patients in the second arm will receive four puffs of placebo. After a waiting time of 15 minutes, spirometry will be repeated. Following the second spirometry testing those who received salbutamol will now receive placebo and those receiving placebo will receive Salbutamol. After a second period of 15 minutes, a third series of spirometry will be recorded.

Main study parameters
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the change in FEV1 from pre to post bronchodilator inhalation, compared to the same change after placebo.

96,"The evolution of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is marked by dyspnea, anxiety and pain, major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort (scale A1 of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire) of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated with NIV. This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study. ALS patients will be recruited during their respiratory evaluation carried out as part of their usual care provided in an ambulatory setting (day care hospital) in the Pneumology Department of Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital. Eligibility criteria will be verified during this visit. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, the investigator will present the study to him using the information letter. After a period of reflection that the patient deems necessary to make his decision and after having obtained an answer to all his questions, his written consent will be collected by the investigator. The patient will then be offered a digital therapy session based on immersive virtual reality (IVR) and a music therapy session, 60 minutes apart. The IVR session will be based on medical hypnosis (GAMIDA®) and the music therapy session will be based on the choice of music that the patient wishes. Each session will last 15 minutes. Patients will start either with the medical hypnosis session by IVR or with the music session depending on the randomization carried out before the start of the study.

The study will be conducted in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire regions, in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The intervention will be a selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility testing, with a list of antibiotics restricted according to four E. coli susceptibility profiles, with an emphasis on narrower-spectrum antibiotics. The control arm will be a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing report. The primary endpoint will be the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing, defined as the number of urine cultures associated with a prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin) prescribed by GPs in the same practice over a period from 3 days before to 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing, relative to the total number of urine cultures. This period of interest corresponds to the period of empirical antibiotic therapy (=within 3 days before report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), and the period of directed antibiotic therapy (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing). A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out by varying the time window for broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing around the date of the antibiotic susceptibility testing result, up to a maximum of 7 days before and 14 days after. The secondary endpoints will be the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), the rate of antibiotic de-escalation, the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, as a continuous variable (dose-effect) and ordinal variable (threshold-effect), the characteristics of GPs and patients, and the E. coli antimicrobial susceptibility profiles."

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells.

SBP is considered the most common infection in cirrhotic patients with ascites. SBP is diagnosed by the presence of ≥250 polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)/mm3 in the ascetic fluid in absence of surgical and treatable causes of intra-abdominal infections. SBP has many pictures of clinical presentation.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Radiotherapy is an essential component of breast cancer treatment, and it is highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial randomizing R&R vs. standard-of-care management in patients with radiotherapy in DIBH for left breast cancer. The investigators primary endpoint will assess heart dose (Dmax), and secondary endpoints include longitudinal anxiety and quality of life assessment and clinic workflow efficiency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a validated patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced-technology-based cardiac dose reduction, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of communication and relaxation techniques (R&R) in addition to standard DIBH training reduces the maximum dose to the heart (Dmax) in DIBH under adjuvant radiotherapy of left sided breast cancer. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the use of R&R in addition to standard DIBH training improves quality of life, reduces anxiety, and improves clinic workflow efficiency.

This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to either the R&R arm or the standard arm.

-----------------
Cesarean section is the most common major surgical procedure in obstetrics. It is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It is defined as blood loss of more than 500 ml within 24 hours after delivery. The incidence of PPH is 3-5% in the general population and 10-15% in women undergoing cesarean section. The risk of PPH is increased in women with a history of PPH, multiple pregnancies, placenta previa, and uterine atony. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony, which occurs in about 50% of cases. Other causes include retained placenta, uterine rupture, and coagulopathy. The management of PPH includes uterine massage, oxytocin administration, and uterine artery ligation. In severe cases, hysterectomy may be necessary. The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce blood loss in women undergoing cesarean section. TXA is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits the breakdown of fibrin clots. It has been shown to be effective in reducing blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding and in women undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids. The use of TXA in women undergoing cesarean section has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing blood loss. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that the use of TXA in women undergoing cesarean section reduced the risk of PPH by 30%.

117,"Background
-----------------
Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is characterized as the overproduction of very low density cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (i.e. bad cholesterol) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) (i.e. good cholesterol). Amongst individuals with mild to moderate hyperlipidaemia, lifestyle changes is the first treatment option, such as a healthy diet. Therefore, seeking to develop food-based approaches for hyperlipidaemia therapy is a timely endeavour. Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive option, as it is a spice throughout the world which possesses medicinal properties in regulating human nutrient metabolism. In a recent review of the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperlipidaemia in humans with diabetes and prediabetes, this analysis suggested that fenugreek has total cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The effects of fenugreek on triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol showed a trend towards reduction and an incremental trend for HDL-cholesterol but needed further confirmation. The effect of fenugreek in human subjects with hyperlipidaemia without diabetes has not been investigated. This research aims to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed consumed as a tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. Changes in plasma microRNAs will be analysed to establish non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the effect of fenugreek seed tea on plasma microRNAs as non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia.

Study Design
-----------------
This will be a randomised controlled trial. 114 participants will be randomized into two groups (57/group) to receive either fenugreek seed tea or a control black tea, respectively.

Study Population
-----------------
Patients with hyperlipidaemia (plasma triglyceride level between 1.7 - 4.5mmol/l) not on any lipid-lowering treatment or on a stable lipid-lowering treatment (last six months) but still have confirmation of high triglycerides within the range required for study.

Intervention
-----------------
Fenugreek seeds will be delivered at a dose of 5g/day, drunk as a tea (2.5g/per tea bag), p.o. twice a day at a 12-hour interval) for 8 weeks (56 days). The tea bags will be brewed in a cup (200ml) of boiled hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. This will be self-administered by the subjects, twice a day at a 12-hour interval. The rationale for choosing the dose and intervention time course were based on the previous studies where metabolic effects have been detected. Literature reports from 12 human studies on diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects gave doses of fenugreek seed ranging from 1 to 100g/day, with the median treatment dose being 6.3g/day, to the participants; the intervention time course ranged from 1 week to 3 years, with the median treatment time being 60 days. The dose and duration in this study was therefore designed as being similar to these studies where metabolic effects have been detected and where participant burden will not be too onerous."

The disease is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste and smell, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin rash. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, some patients may experience more severe symptoms, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure. The disease can also lead to long-term complications, such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and cognitive impairment. The long-term effects of COVID-19 are not yet fully understood, but it is clear that the disease can have a significant impact on a person's health and quality of life. 2. Objectives {7} The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an individually tailored exercise and its impact on time in upright position and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical activity, physical and psychological function and work-ability in persons with POTS, post COVID-19 condition. 3. Trial design {8} The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups. 4.

124,"1. Background of the study
The incidence of stroke is increasing year by year, and the mortality rate is high. The main pathological changes of stroke are cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage. Cerebral infarction is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 80% of all strokes. The main pathological changes of cerebral infarction are atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall, which is characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arterial wall. Atherosclerotic plaques are composed of lipids, fibrous tissue, and inflammatory cells. When atherosclerotic plaques rupture, thrombosis occurs, and cerebral infarction occurs. The pathogenesis of cerebral infarction is complex, and the main risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and family history of stroke. The treatment of cerebral infarction mainly includes antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation therapy, and thrombolysis therapy. However, the efficacy of these treatments is limited, and the recurrence rate of cerebral infarction is still high.
Therefore, it is necessary to find new and effective treatments for cerebral infarction. Tirofiban is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist that can inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce the risk of thrombosis. It has been used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and peripheral arterial disease. However, its efficacy and safety in the treatment of cerebral infarction have not been fully studied.
2. Objective of the study
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in the treatment of cerebral infarction. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score: 0-1) at 90 days after treatment. The secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome at 7 days after treatment, the proportion of patients with early neurological deterioration, the NIHSS score, the Barthel index score, the proportion of patients with new-onset ischemic stroke, the proportion of patients with new-onset stroke, the proportion of patients with new-onset transient ischemic attack, the composite endpoint, the proportion of major bleeding, the proportion of serious adverse events, the proportion of adverse events, the proportion of all-cause death, the changes in hemoglobin, the changes in the count of red blood cell, the changes in the count of white blood cell, the changes in the count of platelets, the changes in alanine transaminase, the changes in aspartate aminotransferase, the changes in direct bilirubin, the changes in indirect bilirubin, the changes in the concentration of Na, the changes in the concentration of K, the changes in the concentration of creatinine, the changes in the concentration of albumin, the changes in the urinary occult blood, and the changes in the fecal occult blood.
3. Study design
This is a multi-center, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint, parallel controlled trial. The study will be conducted in 10 hospitals in China.

One of the main factors that contribute to skin ageing is the loss of collagen and hyaluronic acid, which are essential components of the skin that provide structure and hydration. In addition, the skin is constantly exposed to oxidative stress, which can cause damage to the skin cells and accelerate the ageing process. The intestinal microbiota is also involved in skin ageing, as it can produce metabolites that can affect the skin.

139,"The objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults.

Background: 
Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: 
eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.

140,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel intervention, the African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment-Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression (ASSET-PPD), in reducing maternal depressive symptoms and improving parent-infant interactions. The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal period and 2 postpartum review sessions. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers': 1) prenatal and postpartum family involvement; 2) mental health psychoeducation; 3) interparental communication and relationship skills; and 4) balanced division of family tasks. ASSET-PPD will be evaluated in a pilot RCT with 50 cohabitating or non-cohabitating fathers and AA mothers who will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD intervention or the comparator group. Fathers only will participate in the intervention, and mothers and fathers will complete measures of mental health and parental experiences. Maternal depressive symptoms will be assessed as a primary outcome, and breastfeeding and parent-infant interactions will be assessed as secondary outcomes."

142,"The purpose of this study is to test new algorithms for detecting pump/infusion set malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery. The study consists of three phases: Phase 1: Preliminary Data Collection (Free-living Data) In this phase, data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions are collected. This data is obtained from a download form the patient's artificial pancreas. The one-month session is designed to gather a substantial amount of patient-specific data to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals impact the patient's glycemia as recorded by the CGM sensor. During this phase, the patient continues to use their artificial pancreas in their daily life. Phase 2: Induction of Hyperglycemia The second phase involves the patient visiting the clinic, where, according to a specific protocol and a defined schedule, insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump malfunction. The resulting episode of hyperglycemia is closely monitored under medical supervision. At the end of the experiment, the study team assists the patient in restoring euglycemia before returning home. Phase 3: Retrospective Data Analysis In this phase, the collected data is retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detecting insulin suspension, simulating a pump malfunction. The sensitivity of the tested methods is assessed as the fraction of insulin suspensions (simulating a malfunction) correctly detected. The uniqueness of this dataset lies in the controlled induction of malfunction, achieved by disconnecting the insulin pump and monitoring the resulting hyperglycemic episode. The presence of malfunctions in this data is certain and precisely characterized in terms of the start time and duration. The dataset resulting from this experimentation will be a valuable tool for the scientific community, enabling the retrospective testing of fault detection algorithms."

144,"1. Background and rationale: Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare cancer with an incidence of 4.5 per 100,000 person-years. The treatment of STS is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The treatment decision is based on the patient's age, tumor size, tumor depth and histology. The treatment decision is often difficult for patients and professionals, because of the complexity of the decision and the lack of evidence-based guidelines. 2. Objective: The objective of this study is to assess whether the use of the personalized risk assessment tool (PERSARC) is (cost)effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing informed choices in high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients compared to usual care (co-primary outcomes). In addition, we aim to assess in a process evaluation (a) the involvement of patients in decision-making (b) the extent and way PERSARC is used by patients and professionals, and (c) how satisfied patients and professionals were with the use of PERSARC. 3. Study design: To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue sarcoma expertise centers. Hospitals will be randomized between standard care (control condition) or care with the use of PERSARC (intervention). Outcomes will be assessed within one week after treatment decision has been made (T1), and after 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment decision has been made (T2, T3, T4) in at least 120 patients. See main study parameters/endpoints for a description of the outcomes that will be measured at these time points. Actual use of PERSARC, satisfaction with/added value of PERSARC and barriers and facilitators for the integration of PERSARC in treatment decision-making processes during patient-clinician encounters will be measured in a process evaluation using questionnaires, interviews, and audio-recording/observation of consultations. 4. Study population: Patients (>= 18 years) with primarily diagnosed (histologically confirmed) grade 2-3 extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma, who do not have a treatment plan yet and will be treated with curative intent. Patients with sarcoma subtypes or treatment options other than those mentioned in PERSARC are unable to participate. Furthermore, patients need to be Dutch fluency and literacy and mentally competent. 5. Intervention (if applicable): High-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients will either receive standard care (control group) or care with the use of PERSARC; i.e. PERSARC will be used in multidisciplinary tumour boards to guide treatment advice and in consultation in which the oncological/orthopaedic surgeon informs the patient about his/her diagnoses and discusses the benefits and harms of all relevant treatment options (intervention group). 6. Main study parameters/endpoints: The co-primary outcomes are decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale(DCS) (T1) and informed choice (T1). Informed choice is a combined outcome incorporating knowledge, attitudes concerning trade-offs between quality and length of life (QQ_Questionnaire) (T1), and treatment decision (T1). Secondary outcomes, include regret (Decision_Regret_Scale) (T3, T4), worry (Cancer_Worry_scale) (T1, T2, T3, T4), involvement in decision-making according to patients (SDM-Q-9) (T1), patient reported outcome using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMIS Global health) (T1, 2, 3, 4), and (PROMIS physical function) (T1, 2, 3, 4), utilities for the cost-effectiveness analysis (EQ-5D-5L) (T1, T2, T3, T4), health care cost (iMCQ) (T2, T3, T4) and absenteeism/presenteeism from paid work (T2, T3, T4). 7. Study design: To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue"
