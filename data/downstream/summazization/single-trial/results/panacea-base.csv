-----------------
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition that affects 15% of the population. It is characterized by urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia. The first line treatment is anticholinergic medication. However, 30-50% of patients do not respond to this treatment. The second line treatment is onabotulinum toxin A (Botox) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM). Botox is a toxin that is injected into the bladder wall. It is effective in 50-80% of patients. SNM is a surgical procedure that involves implanting a small device in the lower back. It is effective in 60-80% of patients. However, there is no consensus on which treatment is the best for patients with OAB. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is a method that can be used to measure patient preferences for different treatments. It involves asking patients to choose between two fictive treatments, each option comes with it's own botox and SNM characteristics. The DCE will be used to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy. The results of the DCE will be used to inform clinical decision making.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy.

9,"1. Background and rationale: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management to prevent complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a technology that can help people with T1D manage their blood glucose levels more effectively. CGM devices measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid continuously and provide real-time data to the user. This information can help people with T1D make more informed decisions about their diabetes management, such as adjusting insulin doses, dietary choices, or physical activity levels. However, the use of CGM devices is not widespread in South Africa due to a lack of evidence on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. In addition, there is limited evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use on blood glucose levels in people living with T1D in South Africa. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 3. Study design: This is a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled study. The study will be conducted in three study clinics in South Africa. The study will enroll 150 participants who will be randomly assigned to one of the three study arms: Arm 1: continuous CGM use; Arm 2: intermittent CGM use; Arm 3: standard of care (control). The study will be conducted over a period of 15 months. 4. Study population: The study population will include people living with T1D who are attending for diabetes care at the study clinics. The study will also include caregivers of children/adolescents living with T1D and healthcare providers involved in clinical care at the study sites. 5. Study interventions: The study interventions will include continuous and intermittent CGM use, standard of care, and qualitative methods. 6. Study outcomes: The primary study outcome will be the change in HbA1c levels before and after treatment in standard of care, continuous, and intermittent CGM arms. The secondary study outcomes will include the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 7. Study methods: The study will use a mixed methods approach, including quantitative and qualitative methods. The study will use a range of data collection methods, including surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions. 8. Study analysis: The study will use a range of statistical and analytical methods to analyze the study data. The study will use descriptive statistics to summarize the study data, and inferential statistics to test the study hypotheses. The study will also use qualitative methods to analyze the study data. 9. Study dissemination: The study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and other appropriate channels. The study results will also be shared with the study participants and other stakeholders. 10. Study limitations: The study has several limitations, including the potential for selection bias, the potential for measurement bias, and the potential for confounding. The study will use a range of methods to minimize these limitations. 11. Study implications: The study results will have important implications for the management of T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries. The study results will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use in people living with T1D in South Africa. The study results will also provide evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. The study results will inform policy and decision-making related to the use of CGM devices in people living with T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries."

11,"Background
-----------------
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. It is the most common chronic disease in childhood, with a prevalence of 10% in children aged 12-17 years. The disease is characterized by a high variability in the clinical course, with a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The main objective of asthma treatment is to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations. The treatment plan is based on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA), which are the mainstay of asthma treatment. However, adherence to treatment is often poor, especially in children, and this can lead to poor control of the disease and an increased risk of exacerbations. In recent years, the use of digital technologies in the management of chronic diseases has been increasingly studied. In particular, the use of serious games (SG) has been proposed as a tool to improve adherence to treatment and to promote a healthy lifestyle in children with asthma. SG are interactive games that are designed to promote learning and behavior change. They can be used to educate patients about their disease and to promote healthy behaviors, such as physical activity and healthy eating. In this study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma. The SG will be designed to be fun and engaging, and will be based on the principles of gamification. The SG will be used in conjunction with a standard treatment plan, and patients will be followed for six months. The primary outcome of the study will be adherence to treatment, as measured by the number of days of treatment taken and the number of exacerbations. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life, as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and the Skills and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Ita). The study will be conducted in collaboration with the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and will involve 60 children with asthma. The study will be conducted in two groups: one group will receive the SG in addition to the standard treatment plan, while the other group will receive the standard treatment plan only. The study will be conducted in a randomized, controlled trial design. The results of the study will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma.

SG will include an adaptive tool to enable the experience based on the child's specific motor skills. The dynamics of SG will be adapted by considering real motor and physiological data acquired during each SG session via a wristband. These data are necessary to keep the child in the aerobic zone (60-80% of maximum heart rate). The movements are: Side bending: Moving an obstacle to open a passage.

13,"1. Background:

The investigators hypothesize that the current practice of weaning infants off of CPAP too early is associated with an increased risk of lung injury and poor lung growth.

2. Objectives:

The investigators aim to determine whether a standardized maintenance/weaning protocol for CPAP will reduce the number of infants who fail to wean off of CPAP.

3. Study Design:

This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks CGA exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations. The control group will be weaned according to the unit's or medical team's practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations"

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of HF diagnosis in outpatient settings, urgent heart failure visit, heart failure hospitalization, and prescription for guideline recommended HF therapies in patients diagnosed with HFrEF within 6 months.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be patients with at least two additional risk factors for HF. Male or female > 40 years of age Informed consent At least two additional risk factors for Heart Failure (HF): Coronary artery disease (either a previous documented type 1 myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention or documented stenosis or an epicardial coronary artery (50% left main stem or >70% left anterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery)). Diabetes type 1 or 2. Persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation. Previous ischemic or embolic stroke. Peripheral artery disease (previous surgical or percutaneous revascularization or documented stenosis >50% of major peripheral arterial vessel. Chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 milliliters per minute (mL/min)/1.73m2 or eGFR 60-90 mL/min/1.73m2 and urine albumin-creatinine ration (UACR) >300mg/g). Regular loop diuretic use for >30 days within 12 months prior to consent. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) evidenced by one of the following: Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) showing airway obstruction, diagnosis of respiratory physician, CT scan reporting presence of emphysema, or treatment with national guidance advocated COPD therapy. Exclusion Criteria: Inability to give informed consent (e.g. due to significant cognitive impairment). Previous diagnosis of heart failure. This is any diagnosis of heart failure with any ejection fraction of any cause. Renal replacement therapy. Anyone who, in the investigator's opinion, is not suitable to participate in the trial for other reasons e.g., a diagnosis which may compromise survival over the study period.

Propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic agent. It is a short-acting anesthetic agent that is used in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It is a lipophilic drug that is rapidly distributed in the body and has a short half-life. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Propofol is a safe and effective anesthetic agent, but it can cause adverse effects such as respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction varies depending on the patient's weight. The recommended dose of propofol for anesthesia induction is 2-2.5 mg/kg for adults. However, the dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may vary depending on the patient's weight. Patients with a higher body weight may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients with a lower body weight may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's age, gender, and medical history. Patients with a history of liver or kidney disease may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients with a history of heart disease may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's physical condition. Patients who are obese or have a history of obesity may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients who are underweight or have a history of underweight may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's psychological condition. Patients who are anxious or have a history of anxiety may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients who are calm or have a history of calmness may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. CMV infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in SOT recipients. CMV prophylaxis is recommended for all SOT recipients who are CMV seropositive and have a CMV seropositive donor. The current standard of care for CMV prophylaxis is valganciclovir. However, valganciclovir is associated with significant toxicity, including bone marrow suppression, renal toxicity, and gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance. Letermovir is a novel oral antiviral agent that is approved for the prevention of CMV infection in adult CMV seropositive kidney transplant recipients. Letermovir is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of CMV DNA polymerase. Letermovir is dosed at 480mg daily for patients with CrCl >10. Dose adjustment, as per package insert, is recommended in setting of co-administration of cyclosporine, with dose reduction of letermovir to 240mg daily. Missed doses of letermovir will not be made up.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in thoracic organ transplant recipients. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in thoracic organ transplant recipients.

Study Design
-----------------
This study is a prospective cohort design. Subjects exposed to letermovir for CMV prophylaxis following heart or lung transplantation will be compared with those who received standard valganciclovir prophylaxis in the two years before the study began (referred to as the pre-intervention period). The goal is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of letermovir.

Study Population

-----------------
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main subtypes of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). The incidence of IBD is increasing worldwide, and the disease is associated with a reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased risk of colorectal cancer. The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Diet is one of the most important environmental factors that can influence the development and progression of IBD. A diet high in fiber has been shown to be beneficial for IBD patients, as it can help to reduce inflammation and improve gut health. However, many IBD patients do not consume enough fiber, as they often experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to explore the effect of a 4-week WholeFiberTM intervention on inflammation, fecal gut microbiota and metabolites, IBD-complaints and QoL in patients with CD and UC. The secondary objective is to assess the feasibility of the intervention.

Dyspnea is a common symptom in patients under invasive mechanical ventilation. It is a subjective sensation of breathing discomfort that can be difficult to assess in patients who are intubated and sedated. The assessment of dyspnea is therefore often based on the observation of the patient's behavior and the evaluation of the respiratory rate and the respiratory effort. The assessment of dyspnea is also based on the evaluation of the patient's respiratory variability. The respiratory variability is defined as the variation in the amplitude of the respiratory movements. It is measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the chest expansion. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation of the chest expansion to the mean chest expansion. The CV is a measure of the variability of the respiratory movements.

29,"1. Introduction: The term MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) refers to the transitional state between normal cognitive changes associated with aging and very early dementia. It is a disorder characterized by impairments in both short-term and long-term memory, but without functional deficits. MCI is considered a precursor to dementia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that in 2014 there were 5.0 million adults with cognitive impairment (CI) in the population aged 65 years and older, and it is projected that by 2060, this number will increase to nearly 14 million. A study by Gómez on sentinel health networks in Spain describes a prevalence of MCI among individuals aged 65 years and older ranging from 14.5% to 17.6% , which increases with age. Another study reports a prevalence of 11.6% in individuals aged 65 to 69 years, which rises to an average of 22.9% among those aged 85 years and older. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 9 Spanish studies on different types of dementia showed a prevalence ranging from 3.2% to 12.3% in individuals aged 70 years and older, with higher prevalence in women and increasing with age. Activities of daily living (ADL) rely on a combination of motor, cognitive, and socioemotional skills . Therefore, CI can directly impact independence in ADL, leading to immobility and social isolation . Gait and balance impairments are common in individuals with dementia, including slower gait speeds, decreased stride length, altered swing time, among others. However, these motor alterations are often overlooked when addressing CI . Balance impairment combined with gait deficits significantly increases the risk of falls, with approximately 60% of individuals with CI experiencing falls annually, twice as frequently as cognitively intact counterparts . Individuals with CI are also more prone to falls resulting in injuries, with up to a three-fold increase in the incidence of hip fractures compared to those without CI. Recognizing and addressing this connection between cognitive and motor deficits is crucial . Action Observation Therapy (AOT) involves observing a motor gesture performed by another individual and then imitating the same movement. This technique has been developed as a physical rehabilitation approach that promotes brain plasticity by activating the mirror neuron system . Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of action observation learning. A study conducted with children with cerebral palsy, presented by Naura et al. , showed that motor learning through observation is more effective and provides more evident benefits when subjects learn from other patients with the same condition but less severity, compared to learning by observing a therapist or another person without motor impairment. However, these results have not been corroborated in older patients or those with CI. The current literature includes various studies consistently demonstrating that AOT is an effective way to learn or improve specific motor skills. Buccino's work summarizes several studies that have employed AOT, including one in which the intervention was carried out with healthy individuals to imitate a motor action in a new environment for them. Another study showed that AOT facilitates motor learning and the construction of a motor memory trace in adults and in patients who have had a stroke. In another study, it was demonstrated that, in healthy adults, AOT is superior to motor imagery as a strategy for learning a complex motor task, at least in the early phase of motor learning. Buccino concludes that these results can have significant implications in educational activities, sports training, and neurorehabilitation. Specifically in the field of pathology, evidence exists regarding the application of AOT for upper limb rehabilitation in patients who have had a stroke. A pilot study by Yu-Wei Hsieh concluded that AOT resulted in improvements in most outcomes, suggesting it as a promising alternative to contemporary bilateral arm training interventions (i.e., active control intervention) for subacute stroke patients . In a randomized controlled pilot study by Mancuso et al., it was proposed that AOT is a promising treatment for functional recovery and upper limb function in individuals with moderate to severe upper limb impairment following a stroke. AOT could become a useful strategy in stroke rehabilitation programs, as it improves functionality of the paretic upper limb and allows for regaining maximum independence in ADL . Evidence also exists for AOT in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, specifying that AOT increases spontaneous use of the affected upper limb through observation and imitation"

31,"Episiotomy is a planned surgical incision to the perineum and posterior wall of the vagina during the second stage of labor. The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and non-ablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Er:YAG laser on the tissue healing of the episiotomy scars and the reduction of vulvar pain."

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in children. The prevalence of CP is estimated to be 2.1 per 1000 live births. CP is a heterogeneous disorder, with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The most common type of CP is spastic hemiplegic CP, which is characterized by a unilateral distribution of motor impairments. In addition to motor impairments, children and adolescents with unilateral CP often present with somatosensory impairments, which are defined as a deficit in the processing of sensory information. Somatosensory impairments are present in 50-80% of children and adolescents with unilateral CP and are associated with poorer functional hand use.

Currently, the majority of upper limb therapy programs for children and adolescents with unilateral CP focus on motor training. However, the effects of motor training on somatosensory function are still unclear. In addition, the effects of motor training on functional hand use are often limited. Therefore, there is a need for novel therapy programs that focus on somatosensory function and that are able to improve functional hand use.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an intensive upper limb therapy program focused on somatosensation in children and adolescents with unilateral CP. The secondary objective is to determine the predictive value of clinical and neuroimaging variables on the therapy response.

Study design
-----------------
A randomized controlled trial will be carried out in 50 children and adolescents with spastic unilateral CP aged between 7 and 15 years old. Participants will be randomized to the intervention group or the active control group. Participants in both groups will receive three session of 45 minutes upper limb therapy per week for a period of 8 weeks, resulting in a total therapy intensity of 18 hours. The intervention group will receive Sense for Kids therapy, which consists of component-based training and occupation-based training. During the component-based training participants will perform graded and structured practice of tactile object recognition, texture discrimination and proprioception. During the occupation-based practice, participants will repetitively and structured practice of self-chosen activities of daily living while attention is denoted to somatosensory aspects necessary for successful task completion (e.g., position of the upper limb, texture of materials, localization of materials based on touch). Participants in the control group will receive an equal amount of motor training, consisting of unimanual motor tasks and bimanual goal directed training. All therapy sessions will be performed under supervision of a trained physical and/or occupational therapist. Therapy adherence and progression will be closely monitored by the therapist. Outcomes will be assessed at three different points in time, being within two weeks prior to therapy commencement (baseline), within one week following therapy completion (post-intervention) and 6 months after the therapy has ended (follow-up).

33,"Background: Gallstone disease affects 10-15% of people in the United Kingdom (UK) and over 65,000 patients undergoing cholecystectomy each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) over 110 million. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without (including reduced diversity, decreased prevalence of beneficial and increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria) but there are only a handful of small scale studies exploring the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Hypothesis and Objectives: This pilot study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including: Patients who develop complications of gallstone disease(including but not limited to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis and gallstone ileus) following diagnosis and Patients who develop post-operative complications including short (hospital stay, wound healing etc) and intermediate (development of post-cholecystectomy diarrhoea) outcomes. Design and Methods: A prospective cohort design will be used to collect data from 75 adult patients presenting to East Kent University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Hospitals with newly diagnosed gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging investigations. Data will be collected from electronic patient records including clinical history and diagnostic investigations, anthropometry, blood and imaging results (if taken as part of routine clinical care) for the initial presentation and subsequent readmissions/planned follow-up timepoints. Stool samples will be collected from patients either during admission or at home at each timepoint. Samples will be returned by post to the research team where they will be stored and analysed. Patients will also be asked to provide a 3 day food diary card Patients will have a sample collected at time of diagnosis and then at 6 monthly intervals whilst awaiting cholecystectomy. A pre-operative sample will be required within 6 weeks of any surgical intervention. Following cholecystectomy an immediate post-operative sample (within the first week) will be collected as well as a sample at 6 months. Clinical and Scientific Impact: At least 20% of those patients awaiting cholecystectomy experience complications, costing the NHS over £25 million per year. Therefore, there is a huge need to understand mechanisms behind the development of complications and to reduce the symptom burden for patients as well as the financial burden for the NHS. This study is the crucial first step in identifying differences in the gut microbiome between patients who experience complications (both pre and post-op) and those who do not. Once differences are discovered the next step will be to use the information discovered to determine interventions to reduce the development of these complications."

-----------------
Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) is a common complication of sepsis, which is associated with increased mortality. The pathogenesis of SALD is complex and multifactorial, including direct injury to hepatocytes, hypoxia, and inflammatory response. The diagnosis of SALD is based on the presence of elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin levels. However, the diagnosis of SALD is often delayed due to the lack of specific diagnostic tests. The prognosis of SALD is poor, with a mortality rate of up to 50%. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of SALD are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to investigate the association between initial aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI) and the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

Methods
-----------------
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the MIMIC IV database. We included adult sepsis patients (≥18 years) as study participants, but only those who had data available for their first hospitalization and first ICU admission were enrolled in our study, if they had multiple admission records in the database. Exclusion criteria include: all types of chronic liver disease; viral hepatitis; primary acute cholangiopathies; cholecystitis; hepatic infarction; liver necrosis; liver trauma; length of ICU stay < 24 hours. Patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission were also excluded. The following indicators were extracted directly or derived from the database(MIMIC IV): age; weight; gender; comorbidity, including hypertension, old myocardial infarct, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease and diabetes; infection site, including blood, lung, skin and soft tissue, abdominal cavity and urinary tract; disease severity scores within the first day of ICU admission, including Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Oxford Acute Severity of illness Score (OASIS) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II); mean vital signs in first 24h, including heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2); treatment received within the first day of ICU admission, including invasive ventilation, vasopressor therapy, renal replacement therapy and parenteral nutrition (PN) support; initial laboratory parameters, including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell (RBC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, bicarbonate, anionic gap, sodium, potassium, chloride, total calcium, glucose, prothrombin time (PT), partial prothrombine time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR) and APRI; clinical outcome measures, including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. The disease severity scores, including APS III, SOFA, LODS, OASIS, SAPS II, are calculated using the SQL code provided by Johnson et al. APRI is calculated by (AST(IU/L)/ upper limits of normal)/PLT(k/uL)×100. Sepsis is diagnosed according to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3"

38,"The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as taught muscle bands, trigger points (TPs), and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker)."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, which leads to paralysis and death. The disease is rare, with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 person-years. The median survival time is 3-5 years after diagnosis. The disease is progressive and there is no cure. The only treatment that has been shown to prolong survival is long term mechanical ventilation support (LTMV). LTMV is a treatment that involves the use of a ventilator to help a person breathe. The ventilator is connected to a tube that is inserted into the person’s airway. The ventilator delivers oxygen and other gases to the lungs. LTMV is a life-saving treatment for people with ALS who have lost the ability to breathe on their own. LTMV can help people with ALS to live longer and more comfortably. However, LTMV is not without risks. The most common risks associated with LTMV are pneumonia, respiratory infections, and skin breakdown. In addition, LTMV can be burdensome for caregivers. Caregivers may experience stress, anxiety, and depression as a result of caring for a loved one with ALS. They may also experience financial strain as a result of the costs associated with LTMV. Despite the risks and burdens associated with LTMV, many people with ALS choose to receive this treatment. This is because LTMV can help people with ALS to live longer and more comfortably. In addition, LTMV can help people with ALS to maintain their quality of life.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall quality of life of ALS patients who choose life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families with ALS patients who decline life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the health-related quality of life, disease-specific quality of life, and caregiver burden of ALS patients who choose life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families with ALS patients who decline life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects young adults. It is characterized by the presence of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of the disease. The pathophysiology of MS is complex and involves both immune and neurodegenerative mechanisms. The mainstay of treatment for MS is immunomodulatory therapy, which aims to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and slow the progression of disability. Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a surface protein expressed on B cells. It is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion every 6 months. The recommended dose is 600 mg, administered as two 300 mg infusions given 2 weeks apart. The efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. In the OPERA I and II trials, ocrelizumab was shown to be superior to interferon beta-1a in reducing the number of relapses and the accumulation of disability in patients with RRMS. In the ORATORIO trial, ocrelizumab was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the progression of disability in patients with PPMS. Ocrelizumab is generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions and infections. However, there are concerns about the long-term safety of ocrelizumab, particularly with regard to the risk of malignancy and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is a rare but serious complication of ocrelizumab therapy, in which the immune system reacts aggressively to the re-emergence of latent infections or the reactivation of autoimmune diseases. IRIS can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment. The risk of IRIS is highest in patients who have been treated with ocrelizumab for a long time and who have a history of latent infections or autoimmune diseases. To minimize the risk of IRIS, patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection or autoimmune disease. If IRIS is suspected, the patient should be referred to a specialist for evaluation and treatment. In conclusion, ocrelizumab is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for MS. However, there are concerns about the long-term safety of the drug, particularly with regard to the risk of malignancy and IRIS. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection or autoimmune disease, and prompt treatment should be initiated if IRIS is suspected.

47,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% hypertonic saline (HS) is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with neuromuscular disease (NMD) or neurodisability.

Background
-----------------
Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) are a group of disorders that affect the nerves and muscles. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, autoimmune diseases, and infections. NMD can cause a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing. People with NMD often have a reduced quality of life and a shorter life expectancy.

Neurodisability is a term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the brain and nervous system. These conditions can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, infections, and trauma. Neurodisability can cause a range of symptoms, including cognitive impairment, difficulty with movement, and difficulty with communication. People with neurodisability often have a reduced quality of life and a shorter life expectancy.

Both NMD and neurodisability can cause respiratory problems, including difficulty breathing and difficulty clearing secretions from the lungs. These respiratory problems can lead to respiratory infections, which can be life-threatening in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Hypertonic saline (HS) is a solution that contains a higher concentration of salt than normal saline. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including respiratory infections and cystic fibrosis. HS is thought to work by drawing water out of the lungs, which helps to clear secretions and improve breathing.

There is some evidence that HS may be effective in treating respiratory infections in people with NMD or neurodisability. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support this. The purpose of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% HS is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% HS is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a phase 2 open label pilot study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include people with NMD or neurodisability who are aged 5 years and above.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be nebulised 6% HS. Participants will receive 3ml of 6% HS via nebuliser twice daily for 52 weeks.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the number of respiratory exacerbations. A respiratory exacerbation will be defined as a worsening of respiratory symptoms that requires antibiotic treatment.

Secondary outcome measures will include:

- Lung clearance index (LCI)
- Forced oscillation technique (FOT)
- Lung ultrasound
- Electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
- Airway inflammation
- Bacterial diversity
- Ease of airway clearance
- Health-related quality of life
- Patient and main carer treatment satisfaction
- Family impact
- Health economics

49,"18FDG PET is the current standard of care for metabolic imaging of brain tumors. However, it is expensive, requires a cyclotron, and is not widely available. Activity MRI (aMRI) is a new metabolic imaging approach that uses the same MRI scanner as conventional MRI, but does not require a cyclotron. aMRI is based on the fact that the magnetic resonance signal is sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic ions, such as iron. Iron is a byproduct of metabolism, and its concentration in the brain is related to the metabolic activity of the brain. aMRI can be used to measure the concentration of iron in the brain, and this concentration is related to the metabolic activity of the brain. aMRI has been shown to be a sensitive and specific metabolic imaging approach in animal models of brain tumors. The purpose of this study is to determine whether aMRI is a valid metabolic imaging approach in human subjects with brain tumors."

58,"Background
-----------------
Family planning (FP) is a key component of reproductive health and is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . The World Health Organization (WHO) defines FP as the ability of individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births . The WHO recommends that FP services should be available to all individuals and couples who want to avoid or delay pregnancy, regardless of their marital status, age, or parity . In Egypt, the total fertility rate (TFR) has declined from 6.7 in 1992 to 3.5 in 2014 . However, the unmet need for family planning (UNFP) remains high, with an estimated 22% of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who want to avoid or delay pregnancy but are not using any method of contraception . The high UNFP rate is a major public health concern, as it increases the risk of unintended pregnancies, maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and other adverse health outcomes .
The quality of FP services is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of FP programs . Poor-quality FP services can lead to negative health outcomes, such as unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality . The quality of FP services is determined by various factors, including the availability of trained providers, the availability of appropriate contraceptive methods, and the quality of counseling provided to clients .
In Egypt, the quality of FP services has been a concern for many years . A study conducted in 2014 found that only 40% of women who received FP services reported receiving high-quality counseling . The study also found that the quality of counseling varied significantly across different types of health facilities, with private clinics providing the highest quality of counseling and public hospitals providing the lowest quality of counseling .
The quality of FP services in Egypt is further compounded by the lack of standardized guidelines for FP counseling . The current guidelines for FP counseling in Egypt are based on the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (MEC) . However, these guidelines do not provide specific guidance on how to provide high-quality counseling to clients .
In order to improve the quality of FP services in Egypt, it is essential to develop and implement standardized guidelines for FP counseling. These guidelines should be based on the latest evidence and should be tailored to the specific needs of clients in different settings. The guidelines should also be regularly updated to reflect changes in the evidence base and to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.
In addition to developing and implementing standardized guidelines for FP counseling, it is also essential to train healthcare providers in the provision of high-quality counseling. This training should be comprehensive and should cover all aspects of FP counseling, including the provision of information about contraceptive methods, the assessment of client needs and preferences, and the provision of support and guidance to clients.
The provision of high-quality FP counseling is essential for achieving the SDGs and for improving the health and well-being of women and their families in Egypt. By developing and implementing standardized guidelines for FP counseling and by training healthcare providers in the provision of high-quality counseling, we can ensure that all women who want to avoid or delay pregnancy have access to high-quality FP services.

-----------------
Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is a leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. DFO is a complication of a large amount of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and is a major trigger of lower limb amputations. DFO is defined as an infection of the bone and/or joint space in a patient with DM and a DFU. The diagnosis of DFO is based on clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria. The microbiological diagnosis of DFO is based on the isolation of microorganisms from bone biopsy (BB) samples. The gold standard for the diagnosis of DFO is the bone biopsy (BB) procedure. However, BB is underused in clinical practice for various reasons including lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find BB cumbersome or too invasive. To overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by a physician at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete DFU healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside versus conventional BB in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non inferior to conventional BB in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. The main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological) on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives of this study are to: compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy compare microbiological culture results between groups compare the safety of both procedures compare DFO remission according to results of BB (negative or positive) The health economic of this study are to: to estimate total costs for the intervention and total medical costs in each groups to estimate total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based upon EQ5D5L scores to calculate the point estimate of the incremental cost utility ratio and estimate the probability of decremental cost effectiveness for the beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional biopsy.

75,"Aging is a complex process that involves changes in multiple organ systems. The aging process is associated with a decline in physical and cognitive function, which can lead to frailty and disability. Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, such as falls, hospitalization, and death. It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of older adults are frail, and this number is expected to increase as the population ages. Frailty is associated with a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, including falls, hospitalization, and death.

The AGE SELF CARE group visit program is a virtual program that aims to promote healthy aging and prevent frailty in older adults. The program is designed to be delivered in a group setting, with each session lasting approximately 90 minutes. The program is led by an aging expert, such as a geriatrician, and includes education and behavioral change elements in the broad areas of self/health, home environment, and community.

76,"1. Background and rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hard, and older and vulnerable persons are more likely to get very ill when infected, and have the highest morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required. Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments. The goal of geriatric rehabilitation has been defined as to assist [older people] to manage personal activities of daily living without the assistance of another person. If this is not possible, the goal is to minimize the need for external assistance through the use of adaptive techniques and equipment. Thereby focussing on the amelioration of dependency in activities of daily living. However, we are still in the dark about the amount of functional recovery of geriatric post-COVID-19 patients. We do know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious. Before being able to assure the best outcomes for older post-COVID geriatric rehabilitation patients, we first have to be informed about what the clinical characteristics are, what treatment is provided, and what outcomes geriatric post-COVID-19 patients have in geriatric rehabilitation. Therefore, members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the European Geriatric Medical Society (EuGMS) decided to conduct this multi-center observational cohort study into usual care data on the course of functional and clinical outcomes in post-COVID-19 geriatric rehabilitation patients in several European countries. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study to get insight into the course of functional and medical recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. The secondary objective is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organisation of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. 3. Study design: In principle, patients admitted for geriatric rehabilitation due to COVID-19 morbidity will be informed by letter and asked if they have objections that their regular care data will be anonymously used for research purposes to improve practice in geriatric rehabilitation. If they do, the data will not be used (opt-out procedure). In some countries this will be conducted under the guidelines for service evaluation and audit, as it uses routine data, held entirely by the clinical care team. Where this is not possible because of local legislation or guidelines, informed consent will be obtained (opt-in procedure). During one-year (October 2020 - November 2021), patients were enrolled in the study. Participants will receive standard rehabilitation treatment according to the discretion of clinical teams, which will likely be adapted to the specific needs of post-COVID-19 patients. This treatment includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medical treatment by an advanced nursing practitioner, geriatrician or medical specialist. This study will not influence any therapy provided or decisions about the medical treatment or treatment programs already used in the participating geriatric rehabilitation setting. This study is observational and it is not anticipated that the observations will influence therapy or treatment, particularly since such indices, questionnaires and measurements are a regular part of the rehabilitation program. 4. Study management: For each participating geriatric rehabilitation facility in Europe one instructed local care professional will complete an online CASTOR database in which anonymous data from the clinical records of the included patients will be collected at admission, discharge and 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up. For countries with multiple participating sites, a country coordinator was appointed. Most country coordinators were the members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the EuGMS. 5. Data collection: Variables collected Demographic factors: In all participants, selected demographic factors such as year of birth/age, gender, and residency premorbid will be documented. Information from hospital / general practitioner: hospital length of stay (days), ICU length of stay (days), complications during hospital stay or at home (Thromboembolism, Delirium, Pressure Ulcer), and COVID-19 diagnosis"
77,"1. Background and rationale: The immunogenicity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens is diminished in kidney transplant recipients. This patient group therefore remains extremely vulnerable for viral infections despite vaccination. This impaired immune response is related to the use of immunosuppressive agents, especially Mycophenolate Mofetil/Mycophenolic Acid (MMF/MPA). Patients that use everolimus instead of MMF/MPA elicit a higher immune response after vaccination. 2. Objective: To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. 3. Study design: This is a multicentre, open-label, controlled, randomized study to evaluate replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in KTR on immunogenicity and safety after vaccination. The seven participating study sites are Amsterdam UMC, Erasmus MC, Leiden UMC, Maastricht UMC+, Radboudumc, UMC Groningen and UMC Utrecht. At the first study visit, eligibility for study participation will be checked, blood will be drawn, and participants will subsequently be 1:1 randomised to: Continue immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA Replace immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA by everolimus After randomisation, the study will continue in 2 parts: Part 1 - Run-in and COVID-19 vaccination (≥6 weeks + 28 days) The aim of this phase is to first ensure complete washout of MMF/MPA and attaining optimal trough levels of everolimus in patients randomized to everolimus. To monitor tolerability, safety and trough levels, participants will be invited at week 1 and week 3 after randomisation for a blood withdrawal and spot urine collection. At least 6 weeks after randomisation, patients will receive the COVID-19 vaccination (=baseline visit). After 28 days patients will be invited for a study visit for blood withdrawal. Part 2 (optional) - Herpes zoster vaccination (+56 days) Patients that opted to participate in this part of the study will continue their randomised treatment for the next 56 days. During this period patients will receive 2 herpes zoster vaccinations with an interval of 28 days between each vaccination. At 28 days after the second vaccination patients will be invited for the last study visit for blood withdrawal. After completion of the study (either 28 days after COVID-19 vaccination or 28 days after the last herpes zoster vaccination) patients will be offered the option to continue everolimus instead of MMF/MPA as part of shared clinical decision making. 4. Study population: Kidney transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy with either triple or dual therapy including MMF/MPA with a minimum daily dose of 1000 mg (MMF) or 720 mg (MPA) and a CNI. 5. Sample size: 100 participants will be included in the study. 6. Statistical analysis: The primary outcome measure is the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. The primary analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population. The primary analysis will be performed using a linear mixed model with the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain as the dependent variable and the treatment group as the independent variable. The model will be adjusted for the baseline neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. The primary analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The disease is associated with infertility and recurrent miscarriages. The pathophysiology of endometriosis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors. One of the main theories is that endometriosis is caused by retrograde menstruation, in which endometrial tissue is transported through the fallopian tubes and implanted in the pelvic cavity. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the fallopian tubes and increase the risk of retrograde menstruation. Another theory is that endometriosis is caused by an immune system dysfunction, which allows endometrial tissue to survive and grow outside the uterus. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Endometriosis is associated with infertility, which is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. The exact mechanism by which endometriosis causes infertility is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of factors. One of the main theories is that endometriosis causes inflammation in the pelvic cavity, which can damage the fallopian tubes and prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the fallopian tubes and increase the risk of infertility. Another theory is that endometriosis causes changes in the hormonal environment of the uterus, which can affect the quality of the egg and the ability of the embryo to implant in the uterine lining. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is associated with hormonal imbalances.

The diagnosis of endometriosis is based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, such as pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, as well as the presence of endometriosis lesions on pelvic imaging. The most common imaging modality used to diagnose endometriosis is transvaginal ultrasound, which can detect endometriomas (cysts filled with endometrial tissue) and other endometriosis lesions. However, the diagnosis of endometriosis can be challenging, as the symptoms can be non-specific and the lesions can be difficult to detect on imaging.

The treatment of endometriosis depends on the severity of the disease and the symptoms experienced by the patient. The most common treatment options include hormonal therapy, surgical excision of endometriosis lesions, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Hormonal therapy is the most common treatment option for endometriosis, as it can reduce the symptoms of the disease and prevent the growth of endometriosis lesions. The most commonly used hormonal therapies for endometriosis include oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Surgical excision of endometriosis lesions is another treatment option for endometriosis, as it can improve the symptoms of the disease and increase the chances of pregnancy. ART is a treatment option for women with endometriosis who are unable to conceive despite hormonal therapy and surgical excision of endometriosis lesions. ART involves the use of assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), to help women conceive.

The prognosis of endometriosis depends on the severity of the disease and the treatment options available. The majority of women with endometriosis can be successfully treated with hormonal therapy or surgical excision of endometriosis lesions. However, some women may require more aggressive treatment options, such as ART, to conceive. The long-term prognosis of endometriosis is also affected by the risk of recurrence, which is higher in women who undergo surgical excision of endometriosis lesions."

-----------------
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cells. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that produces hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. In people with SCD, the red blood cells become sickle-shaped, which can cause them to become stuck in small blood vessels, leading to pain, organ damage, and other complications. SCD is a chronic disease that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life. It can cause pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that can make it difficult to participate in daily activities and enjoy life. In addition, SCD can also lead to complications such as stroke, lung disease, and kidney damage, which can further impact a person's quality of life. Despite the significant impact of SCD on a person's quality of life, there is limited research on the effectiveness of interventions to improve quality of life in people with SCD. One potential intervention that has been shown to improve quality of life in people with chronic diseases is exercise training. Exercise training has been shown to improve physical function, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve mental health in people with chronic diseases. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of exercise training in people with SCD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week exercise training program on quality of life in people with SCD. The study will compare the effects of the exercise training program to a control group that does not receive the intervention. The study will also evaluate the effects of the exercise training program on pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD.

Objective
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week exercise training program on quality of life in people with SCD. The study will compare the effects of the exercise training program to a control group that does not receive the intervention. The study will also evaluate the effects of the exercise training program on pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD.

Design
-----------------
The study will be a randomized controlled trial with two groups: an exercise training group and a control group. The exercise training group will receive a 6-week exercise training program, while the control group will not receive the intervention. The study will be conducted at a hospital or clinic that specializes in the treatment of SCD.

Participants
-----------------
The study will include people with SCD who are between the ages of 18 and 65. Participants will be recruited through advertisements in the community and through referrals from healthcare providers.

Intervention
-----------------
The exercise training program will consist of a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises. The program will be designed to be safe and effective for people with SCD. The program will be supervised by a trained exercise professional and will be tailored to the individual needs and abilities of each participant. The program will be conducted three times per week for 60 minutes per session.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be quality of life, as measured by the Sickle Cell Quality of Life (SCQOL) questionnaire. The SCQOL is a validated questionnaire that assesses quality of life in people with SCD. The questionnaire consists of 30 items that assess physical, emotional, and social functioning. The questionnaire will be administered at baseline and at the end of the 6-week intervention period.

Secondary outcome measures will include pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD. Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses pain intensity and pain interference. Fatigue will be assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses the severity of fatigue. Other symptoms associated with SCD, such as depression and anxiety, will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses the severity of anxiety and depression.

Statistical Analysis
-----------------
The data will be analyzed using statistical software, such as SPSS or SAS. The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, such as means and standard deviations, to describe the characteristics of the study population. The data will also be analyzed using inferential statistics, such as t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), to compare the effects of the exercise training program to the control group.

-----------------
Bronchiectasis is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible dilatation of the bronchi. It is associated with chronic cough and sputum production, and is predisposed to recurrent airway infections. Many systemic diseases can cause bronchiectasis: cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiencies (PID) and idiopathic bronchiectasis (IB) represent a significant proportion of patients with bronchiectasis starting in early age. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. It can be speculated that for some of the bronchiectasis patients, hyper-reactive airways or asthma can contribute to the reversible pattern. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to ATS/ERS statement, the proper way to determine BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered a positive BDR. While in most scenarios it is reasonable to assume that the change in FEV1 measured after the waiting time can be attributed solely to the affect of bronchodilators, this is not necessarily the case in bronchiectasis. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectatic disease might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives are to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma and use of inhaled steroids.

Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.

Intervention
-----------------
Each group of patients and controls will be randomly assigned to two study arms as follows: patients in both arms will perform regular spirometry. After the first series of spirometry testing, patients in the first arm will receive bronchodilators as per bronchodilator response protocol (Salbutamol, 100 mcg, 4 puffs via spacer) and patients in the second arm will receive four puffs of placebo. After a waiting time of 15 minutes, spirometry will be repeated. Following the second spirometry testing those who received salbutamol will now receive placebo and those receiving placebo will receive Salbutamol. After a second period of 15 minutes, a third series of spirometry will be recorded.

Main study parameters
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the change in FEV1 from pre to post bronchodilator inhalation, compared to the same change after placebo.

96,"The evolution of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is marked by dyspnea, anxiety and pain, major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort (scale A1 of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire) of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated with NIV. This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study. ALS patients will be recruited during their respiratory evaluation carried out as part of their usual care provided in an ambulatory setting (day care hospital) in the Pneumology Department of Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital. Eligibility criteria will be verified during this visit. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, the investigator will present the study to him using the information letter. After a period of reflection that the patient deems necessary to make his decision and after having obtained an answer to all his questions, his written consent will be collected by the investigator. The patient will then be offered a digital therapy session based on immersive virtual reality (IVR) and a music therapy session, 60 minutes apart. The IVR session will be based on medical hypnosis (GAMIDA®) and the music therapy session will be based on the choice of music that the patient wishes. Each session will last 15 minutes. Patients will start either with the medical hypnosis session by IVR or with the music session depending on the randomization carried out before the start of the study.

The study will be conducted in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire regions, in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The intervention will be a selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility testing, with a list of antibiotics restricted according to four E. coli susceptibility profiles, with an emphasis on narrower-spectrum antibiotics. The control arm will be a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing report. The primary endpoint will be the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing, defined as the number of urine cultures associated with a prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin) prescribed by GPs in the same practice over a period from 3 days before to 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing, relative to the total number of urine cultures. This period of interest corresponds to the period of empirical antibiotic therapy (=within 3 days before report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), and the period of directed antibiotic therapy (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing). A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out by varying the time window for broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing around the date of the antibiotic susceptibility testing result, up to a maximum of 7 days before and 14 days after. The secondary endpoints will be the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), the rate of antibiotic de-escalation, the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, as a continuous variable (dose-effect) and ordinal variable (threshold-effect), the characteristics of GPs and patients, and the E. coli antimicrobial susceptibility profiles."

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells.

SBP is considered the most common infection in cirrhotic patients with ascites. SBP is diagnosed by the presence of ≥250 polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)/mm3 in the ascetic fluid in absence of surgical and treatable causes of intra-abdominal infections. SBP has many pictures of clinical presentation.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Radiotherapy is an essential component of breast cancer treatment, and it is highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial randomizing R&R vs. standard-of-care management in patients with radiotherapy in DIBH for left breast cancer. The investigators primary endpoint will assess heart dose (Dmax), and secondary endpoints include longitudinal anxiety and quality of life assessment and clinic workflow efficiency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a validated patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced-technology-based cardiac dose reduction, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of communication and relaxation techniques (R&R) in addition to standard DIBH training reduces the maximum dose to the heart (Dmax) in DIBH under adjuvant radiotherapy of left sided breast cancer. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the use of R&R in addition to standard DIBH training improves quality of life, reduces anxiety, and improves clinic workflow efficiency.

This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to either the R&R arm or the standard arm.

-----------------
Cesarean section is the most common major surgical procedure in obstetrics. It is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It is defined as blood loss of more than 500 ml within 24 hours after delivery. The incidence of PPH is 3-5% in the general population and 10-15% in women undergoing cesarean section. The risk of PPH is increased in women with a history of PPH, multiple pregnancies, placenta previa, and uterine atony. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony, which occurs in about 50% of cases. Other causes include retained placenta, uterine rupture, and coagulopathy. The management of PPH includes uterine massage, oxytocin administration, and uterine artery ligation. In severe cases, hysterectomy may be necessary. The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce blood loss in women undergoing cesarean section. TXA is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits the breakdown of fibrin clots. It has been shown to be effective in reducing blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding and in women undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids. The use of TXA in women undergoing cesarean section has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing blood loss. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that the use of TXA in women undergoing cesarean section reduced the risk of PPH by 30%.

117,"Background
-----------------
Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is characterized as the overproduction of very low density cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (i.e. bad cholesterol) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) (i.e. good cholesterol). Amongst individuals with mild to moderate hyperlipidaemia, lifestyle changes is the first treatment option, such as a healthy diet. Therefore, seeking to develop food-based approaches for hyperlipidaemia therapy is a timely endeavour. Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive option, as it is a spice throughout the world which possesses medicinal properties in regulating human nutrient metabolism. In a recent review of the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperlipidaemia in humans with diabetes and prediabetes, this analysis suggested that fenugreek has total cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The effects of fenugreek on triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol showed a trend towards reduction and an incremental trend for HDL-cholesterol but needed further confirmation. The effect of fenugreek in human subjects with hyperlipidaemia without diabetes has not been investigated. This research aims to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed consumed as a tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. Changes in plasma microRNAs will be analysed to establish non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the effect of fenugreek seed tea on plasma microRNAs as non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia.

Study Design
-----------------
This will be a randomised controlled trial. 114 participants will be randomized into two groups (57/group) to receive either fenugreek seed tea or a control black tea, respectively.

Study Population
-----------------
Patients with hyperlipidaemia (plasma triglyceride level between 1.7 - 4.5mmol/l) not on any lipid-lowering treatment or on a stable lipid-lowering treatment (last six months) but still have confirmation of high triglycerides within the range required for study.

Intervention
-----------------
Fenugreek seeds will be delivered at a dose of 5g/day, drunk as a tea (2.5g/per tea bag), p.o. twice a day at a 12-hour interval) for 8 weeks (56 days). The tea bags will be brewed in a cup (200ml) of boiled hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. This will be self-administered by the subjects, twice a day at a 12-hour interval. The rationale for choosing the dose and intervention time course were based on the previous studies where metabolic effects have been detected. Literature reports from 12 human studies on diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects gave doses of fenugreek seed ranging from 1 to 100g/day, with the median treatment dose being 6.3g/day, to the participants; the intervention time course ranged from 1 week to 3 years, with the median treatment time being 60 days. The dose and duration in this study was therefore designed as being similar to these studies where metabolic effects have been detected and where participant burden will not be too onerous."

The disease is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste and smell, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin rash. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, some patients may experience more severe symptoms, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure. The disease can also lead to long-term complications, such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and cognitive impairment. The long-term effects of COVID-19 are not yet fully understood, but it is clear that the disease can have a significant impact on a person's health and quality of life. 2. Objectives {7} The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an individually tailored exercise and its impact on time in upright position and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical activity, physical and psychological function and work-ability in persons with POTS, post COVID-19 condition. 3. Trial design {8} The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups. 4.

124,"1. Background of the study
The incidence of stroke is increasing year by year, and the mortality rate is high. The main pathological changes of stroke are cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage. Cerebral infarction is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 80% of all strokes. The main pathological changes of cerebral infarction are atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall, which is characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arterial wall. Atherosclerotic plaques are composed of lipids, fibrous tissue, and inflammatory cells. When atherosclerotic plaques rupture, thrombosis occurs, and cerebral infarction occurs. The pathogenesis of cerebral infarction is complex, and the main risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and family history of stroke. The treatment of cerebral infarction mainly includes antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation therapy, and thrombolysis therapy. However, the efficacy of these treatments is limited, and the recurrence rate of cerebral infarction is still high.
Therefore, it is necessary to find new and effective treatments for cerebral infarction. Tirofiban is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist that can inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce the risk of thrombosis. It has been used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and peripheral arterial disease. However, its efficacy and safety in the treatment of cerebral infarction have not been fully studied.
2. Objective of the study
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in the treatment of cerebral infarction. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score: 0-1) at 90 days after treatment. The secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome at 7 days after treatment, the proportion of patients with early neurological deterioration, the NIHSS score, the Barthel index score, the proportion of patients with new-onset ischemic stroke, the proportion of patients with new-onset stroke, the proportion of patients with new-onset transient ischemic attack, the composite endpoint, the proportion of major bleeding, the proportion of serious adverse events, the proportion of adverse events, the proportion of all-cause death, the changes in hemoglobin, the changes in the count of red blood cell, the changes in the count of white blood cell, the changes in the count of platelets, the changes in alanine transaminase, the changes in aspartate aminotransferase, the changes in direct bilirubin, the changes in indirect bilirubin, the changes in the concentration of Na, the changes in the concentration of K, the changes in the concentration of creatinine, the changes in the concentration of albumin, the changes in the urinary occult blood, and the changes in the fecal occult blood.
3. Study design
This is a multi-center, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint, parallel controlled trial. The study will be conducted in 10 hospitals in China.

One of the main factors that contribute to skin ageing is the loss of collagen and hyaluronic acid, which are essential components of the skin that provide structure and hydration. In addition, the skin is constantly exposed to oxidative stress, which can cause damage to the skin cells and accelerate the ageing process. The intestinal microbiota is also involved in skin ageing, as it can produce metabolites that can affect the skin.

139,"The objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults.

Background: 
Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: 
eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.

142,"The purpose of this study is to test new algorithms for detecting pump/infusion set malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery. The study consists of three phases: Phase 1: Preliminary Data Collection (Free-living Data) In this phase, data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions are collected. This data is obtained from a download form the patient's artificial pancreas. The one-month session is designed to gather a substantial amount of patient-specific data to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals impact the patient's glycemia as recorded by the CGM sensor. During this phase, the patient continues to use their artificial pancreas in their daily life. Phase 2: Induction of Hyperglycemia The second phase involves the patient visiting the clinic, where, according to a specific protocol and a defined schedule, insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump malfunction. The resulting episode of hyperglycemia is closely monitored under medical supervision. At the end of the experiment, the study team assists the patient in restoring euglycemia before returning home. Phase 3: Retrospective Data Analysis In this phase, the collected data is retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detecting insulin suspension, simulating a pump malfunction. The sensitivity of the tested methods is assessed as the fraction of insulin suspensions (simulating a malfunction) correctly detected. The uniqueness of this dataset lies in the controlled induction of malfunction, achieved by disconnecting the insulin pump and monitoring the resulting hyperglycemic episode. The presence of malfunctions in this data is certain and precisely characterized in terms of the start time and duration. The dataset resulting from this experimentation will be a valuable tool for the scientific community, enabling the retrospective testing of fault detection algorithms."

144,"1. Background and rationale: Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare cancer with an incidence of 4.5 per 100,000 person-years. The treatment of STS is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The treatment decision is based on the patient's age, tumor size, tumor depth and histology. The treatment decision is often difficult for patients and professionals, because of the complexity of the decision and the lack of evidence-based guidelines. 2. Objective: The objective of this study is to assess whether the use of the personalized risk assessment tool (PERSARC) is (cost)effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing informed choices in high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients compared to usual care (co-primary outcomes). In addition, we aim to assess in a process evaluation (a) the involvement of patients in decision-making (b) the extent and way PERSARC is used by patients and professionals, and (c) how satisfied patients and professionals were with the use of PERSARC. 3. Study design: To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue sarcoma expertise centers. Hospitals will be randomized between standard care (control condition) or care with the use of PERSARC (intervention). Outcomes will be assessed within one week after treatment decision has been made (T1), and after 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment decision has been made (T2, T3, T4) in at least 120 patients. See main study parameters/endpoints for a description of the outcomes that will be measured at these time points. Actual use of PERSARC, satisfaction with/added value of PERSARC and barriers and facilitators for the integration of PERSARC in treatment decision-making processes during patient-clinician encounters will be measured in a process evaluation using questionnaires, interviews, and audio-recording/observation of consultations. 4. Study population: Patients (>= 18 years) with primarily diagnosed (histologically confirmed) grade 2-3 extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma, who do not have a treatment plan yet and will be treated with curative intent. Patients with sarcoma subtypes or treatment options other than those mentioned in PERSARC are unable to participate. Furthermore, patients need to be Dutch fluency and literacy and mentally competent. 5. Intervention (if applicable): High-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients will either receive standard care (control group) or care with the use of PERSARC; i.e. PERSARC will be used in multidisciplinary tumour boards to guide treatment advice and in consultation in which the oncological/orthopaedic surgeon informs the patient about his/her diagnoses and discusses the benefits and harms of all relevant treatment options (intervention group). 6. Main study parameters/endpoints: The co-primary outcomes are decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale(DCS) (T1) and informed choice (T1). Informed choice is a combined outcome incorporating knowledge, attitudes concerning trade-offs between quality and length of life (QQ_Questionnaire) (T1), and treatment decision (T1). Secondary outcomes, include regret (Decision_Regret_Scale) (T3, T4), worry (Cancer_Worry_scale) (T1, T2, T3, T4), involvement in decision-making according to patients (SDM-Q-9) (T1), patient reported outcome using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMIS Global health) (T1, 2, 3, 4), and (PROMIS physical function) (T1, 2, 3, 4), utilities for the cost-effectiveness analysis (EQ-5D-5L) (T1, T2, T3, T4), health care cost (iMCQ) (T2, T3, T4) and absenteeism/presenteeism from paid work (T2, T3, T4). 7. Study design: To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue"

3. Study design
This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group study.

4. Study setting
This study will be conducted at the intensive care unit of a university hospital.

5. Study population
The study population will be adult patients (19 years of age or older) who are intubated after admission to the intensive care unit.

6. Sample size
The sample size is calculated based on the primary outcome, which is the time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation. The time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation in the control group is assumed to be 30 minutes, and the time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation in the intervention group is assumed to be 15 minutes. The standard deviation of the time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation is assumed to be 10 minutes. The significance level is set to 0.05, and the power is set to 0.8. Based on these assumptions, the sample size is calculated to be 100 patients per group.

7. Recruitment
Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited for the study.

8. Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria are as follows:
1. Adult patients (19 years of age or older) who are intubated after admission to the intensive care unit.
2. Patients who are neurologically evaluable or have concomitant neurologic dysfunction.

162,"The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (CBT+VR) enriched with the contribution of virtual reality (VR), which the investigators prepared to intervene in psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. If the CBT+VR protocol is effective, it can be used to increase the quality of physical rehabilitation and therefore to ensure that the perceptions of athletes regarding their psychological outcomes about their return to sport are positive. CBT+VR protocol will be tested, and if it is found effective, it will make a significant contribution to both the literature and practice. The main peculiarity of this study is that a holistic protocol including virtual intervention will be developed for the solution of psychological problems encountered in the rehabilitation process of sports injuries for the first time. The research will be conducted with 60 athletes who meet the inclusion criteria. In the study, which is planned as a 4X5 (groupXmeasurement) mixed factorial design model with four groups (intervention1-intervention2-intervention3, control), the athletes will be filled with psychological assessment scales in order to collect the first data within the first week of starting physical therapy after ACL operation. The CBT+VR protocol will be applied to the first intervention group. Only the behavioral intervention part of the protocol in the VR environment will be applied to the second intervention group. The CBT protocol will be applied without the VR environment for the third intervention group. It is planned that for all intervention groups and the control group, there will be 10 sessions in total once a week, and each session lasts 50 minutes. There will be conversation in the control group sessions; in addition, images that give calmness from nature will be watched for 5 minutes with VR glasses. The remaining 45 minutes will continue with a conversation with encouragement and emotional support, which will not create a therapeutic effect. The scales will also be filled in three more times. The data obtained will be analyzed with multi-level statistics. Whether the anxiety levels of the athletes increase in the VR environment will be monitored with the biofeedback system, which will provide concrete data as well as subjective scales."
163,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical decision support tool (PT-PENCIL) in improving the proportion of patients discharged home from the hospital.

172,"1. Background: CAR T-cell therapy is a promising treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. However, the treatment is associated with significant toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated-neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The incidence of CRS and ICANS is high, and the severity of these toxicities can be life-threatening. 2. Hypothesis: Interferon-beta-1a (FP-1201) can prevent CRS and ICANS in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. 3. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FP-1201 in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. The secondary aims are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FP-1201 in preventing CRS and ICANS in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. 4. Study design: This is a phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients will receive FP-1201 prior to CAR T-cell infusion. The study will be conducted in two parts: a dose-escalation part and a dose-expansion part. 5. Study population: The study population will include patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies who are candidates for CAR T-cell therapy. 6. Study interventions: Patients will receive FP-1201 prior to CAR T-cell infusion. The dose of FP-1201 will be escalated in the dose-escalation part of the study. 7. Study outcomes: The primary outcome of the study is the incidence of CRS and ICANS in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. The secondary outcomes include overall response rate, complete response rate, and safety of FP-1201. 8. Potential impact: If successful, this study could lead to the development of a new treatment for patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy, which could improve the safety and efficacy of this treatment."

-----------------
Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency. The most common cause of SBO is adhesions, which are formed after abdominal surgery. The most common treatment for SBO is surgical intervention. However, surgery is not always necessary, and in some cases, conservative management with nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression and water-soluble contrast (WSC) administration may be effective. The use of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO is controversial, and there is limited evidence to support their use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO, and to evaluate the patient-reported outcomes of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will consist of patients with a diagnosis of SBO who are candidates for conservative management with NGTs and WSCs.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomized to receive either NGTs and WSCs, or NGTs and saline.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the rate of successful conservative management of SBO. The secondary outcome measures will include the rate of complications, the rate of recurrent SBO, and the patient-reported outcomes of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO."

-----------------
Infertility is a common problem affecting 15% of couples worldwide. Male factor infertility is the cause of infertility in 50% of couples. The most common cause of male factor infertility is oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT), which is characterized by low sperm count, low sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. In addition to OAT, another common cause of male factor infertility is azoospermia, which is defined as the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. Azoospermia can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic abnormalities, testicular injury, and certain medical conditions. In cases of azoospermia, the most common treatment option is testicular sperm extraction (TESA), which involves surgically removing sperm from the testicles. However, TESA can be a challenging procedure, and the success rate of TESA-ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) is often low. In recent years, a new technique called microfluidic sperm separation (MSS) has been developed as an alternative to TESA. MSS involves using a microfluidic device to separate sperm from the semen sample. This technique has been shown to be more effective than TESA in terms of sperm retrieval and fertilization rates. However, there is limited data on the effectiveness of MSS in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation. In this study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of TESA-ICSI and MSS-ICSI in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation. We hypothesize that MSS-ICSI will result in higher fertilization rates and clinical pregnancy rates than TESA-ICSI.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical pregnancy rate in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation undergoing TESA-ICSI vs Zymot-ICSI. The secondary objective is to compare the number of utilizable blastocysts obtained in couples using TESA-ICSI vs Zymot-ICSI.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation will be randomized to undergo TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will consist of couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation undergoing ICSI.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention in this study is the use of TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the clinical pregnancy rate, which will be assessed by ultrasound at approximately 8 weeks after embryo transfer. The secondary outcome measure is the number of utilizable blastocysts obtained, which will be assessed by embryo culture and grading.

Data Collection and Management
-----------------
Data will be collected from medical records and patient questionnaires. Data will be entered into a secure electronic database and analyzed using statistical software.

Statistical Analysis
-----------------
The primary analysis will be a comparison of the clinical pregnancy rate between the TESA-ICSI and Zymot-ICSI groups using a chi-square test. The secondary analysis will be a comparison of the number of utilizable blastocysts obtained between the two groups using a t-test.

Ethics and Dissemination
-----------------
The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the participating institution. All participants will provide written informed consent before enrollment in the study. The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific conferences.

198,"1. Background of the study: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and stability of left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) for ventricular pacing in symptomatic bradycardia patients with a conventional bipolar, active fixation pacing lead. 2. Rationale of the study: The conventional bipolar pacing lead is the most commonly used pacing lead in the world. However, the conventional bipolar pacing lead is not designed for LBBAP. The Solia S lead is a family of 5.6 French, steroid-eluting, transvenous, endocardial, bipolar active fixation leads with an extendable/retractable and electrically active screw. The Solia S lead is manufactured, like its predecessor, the Siello S lead, in three different models (45, 53, and 60 cm in length). It has an isodiametric structure and silicone insulation. The inner and outer conductors consist of quadruple wire coils. The Solia S has a diameter of 5.6 F and is covered by a polyurethane overlay for improved gliding. It has an IS-1 connector and a 10 mm pole distance. The area between tip and ring is flexible in order to minimize the perforation risk. The fixation screw of the Solia S is electrically active and has a fractal iridium coating. The screw can be extended by 1.8 mm and has an active surface area of 4.5 mm2. The ring electrode of Solia S has a surface area of approximately 17.4 mm2 and is fractally coated with iridium. The Solia S has a dexamethasone eluting steroid collar containing 0.85 mg dexamethasone acetate. The accessories that are delivered with the lead are identical to the accessories of the Siello S. 3. Objective of the study: The purpose of the primary endpoint is to evaluate the overall success rate of the implanted system, including Solia ventricular lead to sense and deliver pacing at 12- month post-implant. Successful sensing performance at 12 months is the demonstrated ability to appropriately sense without intervention for undersensing (i.e., Solia lead-related adverse event for lead undersensing or loss of sensing) in the period from implant to 12 months, except for normal pulse generator reprogramming. Successful pacing is the demonstrated ability at 12 months to deliver a stimulation pulse with capture, without intervention (i.e., Solia lead-related adverse event for intermittent capture or no lead capture) other than normal pulse generator reprogramming. Success is determined at the subject level. 4. Study design: This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study to investigate the feasibility and stability of LBBAP for ventricular pacing in symptomatic bradycardia patients with a conventional bipolar, active fixation pacing lead. Eligible patients will be enrolled through the process of informed consent in the seven clinical investigational sites across Taiwan with competitive enrollment. All subjects enrolled in the study will undergo LBBAP implantation using one or two Solia S leads in combination with any legally marketed BIOTRONIK pacemaker system delivered through a preshaped sheath (Selectra 3D) via left cephalic, left subclavian, or left axillary venous access. The available lengths of Solia S are 45, 53, and 60 cm. As for which one will be used, it will depend on the lead configuration and the anatomy of the subject. During the screening period, the subject's medical history and demographic information will be collected. The baseline data will be obtained prior to the pacing implantation. Depending on the needs of the subject, the screening and implantation procedures may be performed on the same day. Implant data will include lead measurements, implant technique, and lead positioning. After completion of pacemaker implantation, subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or until lead failure (dislodgment, high capture threshold, or inadequate sensing requiring revision of the lead) or death. During follow-up, a determination will be made whether the system is able to provide appropriate pacing and sensing.

203,"The study is structured into two parts. In the first part the investigators will be recruiting 10 patients with MDD-AD and 10 HC, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each participant will be evaluated by a team of experienced psychologists and clinicians, administering structured clinical interviews to assess the presence/absence of axis I and II psychiatric disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II) (first visit). Furthermore, in all subjects the degree of depressive/manic dysintomatology will be measured through the use of clinical scales and psychopathological tests such as:the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery- Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating scale (BPRS)(second visit; within one week of the first screening visit). Moreover, additional clinical data will beextrapolated from medical records and interviews with psychiatrists (if available). The investigators will also evaluate the suitability of each participant to undergo the multimodal acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data with a 7T GE scanner. The neuroimaging session, performed during the third visit (within one month of the second visit) will include: T1-weighted image acquisition: to study the volumetric differences of white and gray matter between subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. fMRI: to assess functional connections between prefrontal cortex and limbic system. 1H-MRS: to study glutamatergic neurotransmission within the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The sequences will be optimized thanks to the 32-channel brain coil (NovaMedical), to reduce artifacts and inhomogeneities in images. The second part of the study will involve murine models. More specifically, to assess whether Pcdh9 deficits affect the number and morphology of excitatory synapses, electron microscopic analyses will be performed in Pcdh9-knockout mice. Glutamatergic signaling will also be studied at the biochemical level: the expression levels of all major glutamate receptor subunits (ionotropic and metabotropic) will be investigated by analyzing cortical protein lysates (total lysates) in adult mice (3-4 months). In addition, to identify finer changes in glutamate receptor expression, their intracellular and surface expression will be analyzed using the BS3 crosslinking assay. The investigators will also proceed in the characterization of the interaction between integrin β3 and Protocadherin9 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis from mouse brain: in case of positive results (at least 3 replicates), further analysis will be conducted to study whether the two proteins bind directly. Electrophysiological characterization of Itgb3 and Pcdh9 murine patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex at both synaptic and local network levels will also be performed and, lastly, an evaluation of functional recovery of behavioral and electrophysiological deficits mediated by CRISPRa will be conducted. In this case, experiments on murine models will be perform to determine whether overexpression of integrin β3 or protocadherin9 could compensate for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs."

218,"Background: Prognostic awareness among patients with life-limiting diseases has been shown to be associated with less depression, better quality of care and earlier referral to palliative care. Moreover, accurate understanding of their illness may support patients to make informed decisions about their future in alignment with their preferences, values or needs. Supportive care in cancer is the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. This includes management of physical and psychological symptoms and side effects. Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) is a relatively new initiative implementing early supportive care in patients with advanced cancer. Although studies have shown that a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer remain unaware that their disease is not curable, research regarding prognostic awareness in patients referred to Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) services is still scarce. A deeper knowledge of the factors and patient characteristics associated with prognostic awareness is an important first step to develop interventions to improve prognostic communication and thereby to facilitate delivery of high-quality ESC. General aim: The ESC team at University College London Hospital is embedded within the oncology outpatient service, providing specialist symptom control and Advanced Care Planning to patients with advanced cancer. The primary aim of this study is to better understand the prognostic awareness of patients referred to the ESC service. A secondary aim is to evaluate the relationship between patients' prognostic awareness and levels of psychological distress, quality of life, trust in medical professionals and perceived quality of care. Patient population: Consecutive adult patients with advanced cancer referred to the ESC service will be eligible to participate. Patients unable to complete questionnaires due to cognitive impairment such as dementia will be excluded. Patients who have already been referred to community palliative care services will also be excluded. Methods: This will be a cross-sectional prospective study. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by members of the ESC team and will be informed about the study. Interested patients will then discuss the study with the research team and will be invited to participate. After informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete a questionnaire which will cover their level of prognostic awareness, psychological symptoms, and quality of life). The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire can be completed online via RedCap. Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is the level of patients' prognostic awareness, which will be assessed by the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire. This questionnaire has previously been successfully used in research to assess patients' information preferences, perceptions about their prognosis and the goals of therapy and communication preferences about end-of-life care. Secondary endpoints will be (a) patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information assessed through the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire (b) symptoms of depression evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), (c) symptoms of anxiety evaluated through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), (d) quality of life and (d) patients' trust in their medical team and (e) other aspects of perceived quality of care, rated on a visual analogue scale (NRS) from 0-10. Sample size and statistics: The investigators will conduct univariable and multivariable regression analyses to evaluate associations between sociodemographic or clinical variables and outcomes. The investigators aim to include 100 patients. This will give us at least 10 degrees of freedom to assess association of potential risk factors with outcome and to evaluate confounders in a multivariable analysis. Discussion: This will be the first prospective study to assess prognostic awareness among cancer patients referred to ESC services in a British setting. Identifying covariates for prognostic unawareness and psychological burden among patients with advanced cancer will inform the future development of strategies to improve care and communication with this patient group."
219,"Background: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The diagnosis of BSI is based on the presence of positive blood cultures. However, the time to positive blood cultures is often delayed, and the results of blood cultures are often not available to guide antibiotic therapy. Direct-from-blood testing (DFB) is a novel technology that allows for the rapid detection of bacteria in blood. The purpose of this study is to determine whether DFB testing can reduce the time to appropriate antibiotic therapy in patients with suspected BSI. Methods: This is a pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial with parallel group assignment. Patients will be randomized to receive either DFB testing or usual care. The primary outcome is the time to last dose of intravenous vancomycin. Secondary outcomes include the time to last dose of systemic anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic, the proportion of patients who receive appropriate antibiotic therapy within 24 hours of randomization, and the proportion of patients who are discharged from the hospital within 30 days of randomization."
220,"Background
-----------------
Arterial hypertension is one of the most important risk factors in developing a cardiovascular disease. While medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications should always be included. Besides physical activity and a balanced diet, there are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine. One very important part in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended. Even though hydrotherapy has been a part of complementary medicine for more than a century now some therapeutic approaches lack of scientific evidence - especially when it comes to their effect on arterial hypertension. This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual). All 50 participants will be monitored with three 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure measurements (24h ABPM) at the beginning of the trial after randomization, at 8 weeks and at 6 months. The intervention group will be advised to perform the armbaths on 5 of 7 days per week for 8 weeks total. Each participant will get a detailed instruction how to perform the armbath and will be handed a diary to document their performance. After 6 months, each participant of the control group will be offered to be instructed on performing the armbaths as well. Within the active period of 8 weeks, participants of both groups will be called regularly to ask about their health and whether they have questions regarding the trial.

225,"1. Background and rationale {6a} The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pay for performance (PFP) program for high-utilizers of mental health services in Santa Clara County, California. The PFP program was implemented in 2012 and is designed to improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care for high-utilizers of mental health services. The program provides financial incentives to contracted providers for meeting performance targets related to the quality of care and the cost of care. The program also provides technical assistance and support to contracted providers to help them improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care. The program is being evaluated using a randomized controlled trial design. The study will compare the outcomes of participants in the PFP program to the outcomes of participants in a control group that receives usual care. The study will also compare the outcomes of participants in the PFP program to the outcomes of participants in a historical control group that received care before the PFP program was implemented. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the PFP program in improving the quality of care and reducing the cost of care for high-utilizers of mental health services. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the utilization of mental health services, the incidence of hospitalizations, and the incidence of arrests. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the quality of life of participants. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the satisfaction of participants with their care. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the satisfaction of providers with the care they provide.

226,"Background
-----------------
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. It is associated with significant disability and premature mortality. The majority of people with schizophrenia have their first episode of psychosis (FEP) in their late teens or early twenties. FEP is a critical period in the course of schizophrenia, as it is associated with a high risk of relapse and poor long-term outcomes. Early intervention services (EIS) are designed to provide intensive and coordinated care to people with FEP. EIS have been shown to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse in people with FEP. However, there is limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that supports the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of EIS in LMICs.

Aims
-----------------
The primary aim of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Culturally adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CaCBT) and Culturally adapted Family Intervention (CulFI) compared to TAU in reducing overall symptoms of psychosis in individuals with FEP in Pakistan. The secondary aim is to determine the cost-effectiveness of CaCBT and CulFI compared to TAU in Pakistan.

Study design
-----------------
This is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with three parallel arms. The study will include 390 participants with FEP from psychiatric units of hospitals in ten centres (i.e. Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, Qambar Shahdakot, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta and Multan). Consented participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomised in a 1:1:1 allocation to CaCBT + TAU, CulFI + TAU or TAU alone. Participants in CaCBT intervention group will receive 12-weekly one-to-one sessions. Participants in CulFI group will receive 10-weekly one-to-one sessions. Each CaCBT and CulFI session will last for approximately 1 hour. Sessions will be delivered by trained psychologists who will receive regular weekly supervision to maintain fidelity. Assessments will be carried out at baseline, months 3, 6, and 12 by trained, blinded assessors. . Process evaluation will help to build the implementation knowledge base for proposed interventions across study settings. We will conduct economic evaluations (i.e., the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses) of the CaCBT and CulFI interventions, as add-on to TAU.

-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the barriers and facilitators of integrating Horyzons, an evidence-based digital intervention, in outpatient mental health clinics in North Carolina that provide care to individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders. The primary aim is to evaluate and identify the unique barriers and facilitators in implementing Horyzons at each first episode psychosis (FEP) clinic as part of standard care and distinct implementation strategies. The secondary and tertiary aims are to evaluate client engagement with Horyzons and attrition as part of clinical care and assess the change in clients' psychological measures across in addition to their use of state-funded services (e.g., emergency department and social services) across the 12-month intervention.

Methods
-----------------
Service provider participants will be recruited over a 4-6 week period at their respective clinics. They will be asked to complete an adapted measure, the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network (CPCRN) Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Survey, assessing clinical readiness, leadership, acceptance, adoption, and perspective on evidence-based practices. Service providers will then participate in implementing and integrating Horyzons within clinical practice including preferred implementation strategy that is distinct for each clinic (e.g., Horyzons training, access to the platform by clinicians, ongoing technical support, attendance and update at monthly team meetings, etc.). Service providers will meet with research staff at approximately the 6-month timepoint (+/- 4 weeks) to complete the CPCRN FQHC Survey then upon completion of the effectiveness trial with clients, service providers will complete this measure once again in addition to participating in a qualitative interview based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) around their experience with integrating the platform and identification of barriers and facilitators to Horyzons' implementation. Service providers will be compensated for the completion feedback, including the questionnaire and qualitative interviews. Client participants will be recruited over a 16- to 20-week period at their respective clinic. Participants will participate in a baseline visit to provide informed consent and complete a brief battery of measures (Demographics and Characteristics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, MOS Social Supports Survey). Participants will then meet with a research assistant, peer support specialist, or clinician to be given guidance and instruction for using the site (i.e., Horyzons onboarding). Clients will then engage in the platform, where site usage information as well as experience will be collected from participants through the Horyzons platform. Site usage (e.g., number of posts/comments made on the online platform, number and type of 'Journeys' or 'Tracks', self-guided therapeutic content, completed during time on the platform) will automatically be collected via the platform. Participants will have access and engage in this platform for approximately 12 months, depending on when recruited into trial. During this 12 month engagement period with the platform, client participants will meet with research staff at their midway point to complete the brief battery of measures assessing loneliness and social support and feedback on Horyzons. Upon completion of their engagement with the platform, client participants will additionally participate two additional research visits to complete the battery of measures at 12-months and at a 3-month follow-up. Horyzons will be monitored daily (two hours per weekday and one hour per weekend day) by trained peer support specialists, master's level clinicians, and/or graduate students with relevant clinical/research experience with individuals with psychosis. Drs. David Penn and Kelsey Ludwig, who are clinical psychologists, lead weekly supervision calls to ensure appropriate care and support of clients involved in the trial, to discuss case conceptualization and suggestions for engaging clients in the platform.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common cause of hospitalization in the United States and Europe. The mainstay of treatment for ADHF is diuretic therapy. However, diuretic therapy is associated with a high incidence of adverse events, including acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with ADHF.

-----------------
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The 5-year survival rate is only 9%. The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and are not eligible for curative treatment. The standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer is chemotherapy. However, the median overall survival (OS) is only 6-11 months. The prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is poor and new treatment options are needed.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a new class of drugs that have shown promising results in the treatment of several types of cancer. ICIs work by blocking the interaction between the immune checkpoint proteins PD-1 and PD-L1 on T cells and tumor cells, respectively. This allows the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor cells. Durvalumab is a human anti-PD-L1 antibody that has shown promising results in the treatment of several types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer.
In addition to ICIs, other immunotherapies are being investigated for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. One such therapy is the use of TLR-3 agonists. TLR-3 agonists are synthetic double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules that activate the immune system by stimulating the production of type I interferons (IFNs). Type I IFNs have been shown to have anti-tumor effects by activating the immune system and promoting the production of tumor-specific antibodies. Rintatolimod is a TLR-3 agonist that has shown promising results in the treatment of several types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer.
In this study, we will investigate the combination of durvalumab and rintatolimod in the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of these two immunotherapies will be more effective than either drug alone.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the combination of durvalumab and rintatolimod in the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the clinical benefit rate, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of the combination therapy. We will also explore the immunogenic effect of the combination therapy on the circulating and infiltrating immune profile.

Design
-----------------
This is a single-center, open-label, phase I-II study. The study will be conducted in two phases. In the phase Ib, we will determine the safety of the combination therapy by enrolling 12 patients and administering the combination therapy for 6 weeks. In the phase II, we will enroll 25 patients and administer the combination therapy for 12 weeks.

Intervention
-----------------
In the phase Ib, we will administer durvalumab at a dose of 1500 mg and rintatolimod at a dose of 200 mg twice per week for 6 weeks. In the phase II, we will administer durvalumab at a dose of 1500 mg and rintatolimod at a dose of 400 mg twice per week for 12 weeks.

Outcome measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure of this study is the safety of the combination therapy, as determined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs). The secondary outcome measures of this study are the clinical benefit rate, PFS, and OS of the combination therapy. We will also explore the immunogenic effect of the combination therapy on the circulating and infiltrating immune profile."
244,"The present project will be carried out through a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of approximately 40 female athletes pertaining to the Londrina Esporte Clube (name in Portuguese of the team) women's five-a-side soccer will be recruited for the study. The choice of exclusively women individuals is due to sexual dimorphism in pain perception, thus contributing to the results being more homogeneous and reliable. The criteria for inclusion of volunteer participants in the project will be to be between 16 and 35 years old, and to be able to perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Exclusion criteria will include locomotor system dysfunctions or use of analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication at the time of recruitment, as well as being on a calorie-restricted diet or ergogenic supplementation. The study will consist of two experimental groups, made up of healthy individuals, who will perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol, as follows: 1) control group that will receive placebo supplementation (corn starch tablets at a concentration of 750 mg); and 2) intervention group that will receive supplementation with diosmin (tablets at a concentration of 750 mg). Treatment of study participants will occur orally, and everyone will ingest identical opaque capsules containing placebo or diosmin with water. The treatment protocol will be applied before the start (pre-treatment) of the intense dynamic exercise sessions, once a day, during the two days before, and on the day (immediately before) the execution of the exercise protocol. Each experimental group will consist of approximately 20 participants. The project is approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) for Human Beings/Brazil Platform(protocol number 64025122.2.0000.0108). The selected participants will be informed about the objectives and methodology of the study and when there is agreement with the proposed design, the agreement to voluntarily participate in the study will be registered by means of an Informed Consent Form. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed (concentric and eccentric contractions) for the study will follow the following approach: participants will perform a standardized muscle injury protocol that will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until fatigue of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45° angle. Each The participant will have their load previously defined through the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) test, and 70% of the defined weight will be used during the intense dynamic exercise protocol. During each action, the load will be resisted with the legs placed on the leg-press supporter from full knee extension to the 90° knee flexion angle, lasting approximately 3-5 seconds. Between each series, participants will be able to take a 1-minute rest period. The intense dynamic exercise protocol that will be carried out by all participants will be supervised by the project manager and/or collaborators duly trained for such assessments. Participants' clinical signs will be monitored frequently during the activities and in case of discomfort, the activity will be stopped immediately. Analyzes of clinical and blood parameters will be carried out before the start (baseline) and after the end of the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol (24 and 48 hours) aiming to investigate the possible effects of diosmin on DOMS and related pathological events."

246,"Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common condition among pregnant women with metabolic implications for both the mother and offspring. Studies have suggested a potential role of vitamin D status in GDM risk, but evidence from randomized controlled trials is inadequate and inconclusive. A research has been planned to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM development among high risk pregnant women through a well-designed RCT.

Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM development among high risk pregnant women. The secondary objective is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Study Design: This study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel group design.

Study Population: Pregnant women at a risk to develop GDM with low vitamin D levels (<30 ng/mL) at 07-11 weeks of gestation will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D3 supplementation (2 00,000 IU/Week) for 04 -06 weeks or placebo.

Intervention: The intervention group will receive vitamin D3 supplementation (2 00,000 IU/Week) for 04 -06 weeks. The control group will receive placebo.

Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the incidence of GDM based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups Criteria after 75 g OGTT. The secondary outcomes will include maternal and neonatal outcomes such as maternal weight gain, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

Sample Size: The sample size will be calculated based on the incidence of GDM in the intervention and control groups. A total of 100 participants will be recruited in each group, with a total sample size of 200.

Data Collection: Data will be collected at baseline, during the intervention period, and at delivery. The data will include demographic information, medical history, vitamin D levels, and outcomes related to GDM and maternal and neonatal health.

Data Analysis: The data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM development will be assessed using the incidence of GDM in the intervention and control groups. The secondary outcomes will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.

Ethical Considerations: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants before enrollment in the study.

Conclusion: This study will contribute to the understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and GDM risk through a well-designed RCT with integrated approaches. The findings may inform clinical practice and public health recommendations for vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy."

254,"Background
-----------------
Psychotic disorders are among the top ten causes of long-term disability and have a high chronicity potential and a high risk of invalidity. One-fifth of all patients with schizophrenia suffer from chronic symptoms and impairments, and the disease is associated with low long-term work performance, a high degree of all mental health care resources and high socioeconomic costs. These findings demonstrate the importance of sufficient treatment for psychotic disorders and, most importantly, point to a need for research so that more effective treatments can be developed in the future. In the recent decade, various psychotherapeutic programs with cognitive-behavioral background have been developed for patients with psychosis, and their efficacy has been investigated. Meta-analyses have shown superiority of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis over standard treatment, both in combination with antipsychotic medication and without. Many of the psychological approaches have focused primarily on treating the deficits associated with psychosis, as for example cognitive remediation or social skills training. However, these methods are not feasible in the acute setting and there are only a few psychotherapeutic instruments that can be used within a short period of time for inpatient treatment. The guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia recommend a combination of antipsychotic medication and psychosis-specific cognitive behavioral therapy. This includes all stages of the illness, also in the acute phase. The Swiss Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (SGPP) has stated in its treatment guidelines for schizophrenia that our group recommends a structured psychotherapeutic approach even in the acute phase of the disease. The best evidence currently exists for cognitive-behavioral approaches, […]. In any case, the psychotherapeutic procedure must be adapted to the circumstances of the acute phase and there is an urgent need for research on how this can be arranged in the setting of an acute ward. (p.10). Despite this explicit recommendation, to our knowledge there have been no studies that have systematically investigated this in the acute setting and results of which could therefore inform future treatment recommendations. As proposed by the SGPP, we would like to systematically test and evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions in the setting of an acute care unit in an initial pilot trial. Therapeutic alliance during the acute phase of psychotic illness is one of the most pressing obstacles for successful long term recovery. In order for patients to accept much-needed medication and psychosocial therapy and not drop out prematurely, intrinsic motivation to adhere to therapy is crucial. Motivational Interviewing is a method, that has been developed and evaluated over the last three decades and that shows promising results, not only for patients with addiction but also for other patients who struggle with compliance and ambivalence towards treatment and change of behavior. It is well known from clinical experience that patients are offered psychotherapy only late during the course of hospitalizations and not when it is highly needed - during the acute phase of their illness. Accordingly, there is a clear gap in the literature as to which interventions are particularly useful in this challenging yet crucial phase of the illness. (p.10).

-----------------
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world’s population. In India, the prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be 0.9% and the disease burden is expected to increase as the population ages and the prevalence of chronic medical conditions increases. The burden of disability due to schizophrenia is often underestimated as many epidemiological studies do not adequately account for the added burden of chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes that disproportionately impact individuals living with schizophrenia. Globally, the dramatically reduced life expectancy observed among individuals living with schizophrenia is largely due to preventable and treatable medical conditions. Recent epidemiological studies in India have further observed a mortality rate among individuals living with schizophrenia that is twice the rate observed in the general population, with calls for greater efforts to address this significant health disparity. In addition to recognizing the need to address the alarming care gap, where in India it is estimated that upwards of 75% of individuals living with schizophrenia do not have access to essential mental health care, urgent attention is also needed towards responding to the medical and physical health needs of this vulnerable patient population. Psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness and integration of task shared delivery of the evidence-based COPSI (Community care for People with Schizophrenia in India) program in primary care settings in India. We will build on important preliminary work led by project collaborators to support our aims to evaluate whether a novel digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness (Aim 1) and the integration (Aim 2) of an evidence-based psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India.

Objectives

258,"1. Background of the study
The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of occlusal splint therapy on the level of inflammatory cytokines in the blood and gingival crevicular fluid of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).
TMD is a multifactorial disease with complex etiopathogenesis. The main symptoms are persistent pain in the masticatory muscles and preauricular region, limitations in jaw function, and sounds in the temporomandibular joints. The most commonly used therapy is the occlusal splint (OS). The therapeutic effect of OS is attributed to various factors, however the exact mechanism is still unknown. One of the potential diagnostic methods is the use of molecular biomarkers. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between inflammatory cytokines and pain in TMD patients compared to healthy controls. Molecular biomarker levels can be determined from tissue samples and body fluids. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is a serum exudate that enters the gingival sulcus from the gingival plexus of blood vessels and contains proteins, various cell types, electrolytes, cytokines, etc. Considering its composition, wide availability, non-invasive method, and speed of collection, GCF could be a new source of TMD biomarkers with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes.

266,"1. The investigators hypothesize that malaria and intestinal parasitic diseases may result in enhanced or tolerogenic innate immune responses that decrease the risk of symptomatic COVID-19. On the other hand, these conditions and deficiency of micronutrients may decrease the acquisition and longevity of antibodies induced by natural infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, increasing the risk of re-infection and breakthrough infections to vaccination. To test these hypotheses, up to 200 symptomatic individuals (index cases)will be enrolled, their household contacts (anticipated  700), and up to 600 vaccinees. The specific innate immune phenotypes that differentiate uninfected Malawians from Western controls (based on samples from blood banks) and whether those responses are protecting Malawians from infection and/or progression of disease will be assessed. Infected participants and vaccinees will be followed for up to 1.5 years to assess acquisition and longevity of Ab responses and memory B cells. 2.

| Change from baseline in the health-related quality of life assessed by the Euroqol-5 | The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scal fom 0 to 100 points. | 12 months | 
| Relationship between hypoxic burden and hemoglobin and hematocrit | HB was defined as the total area under the oxygen saturation curve from a pre-event baseline oxygen desaturation. For each apnea and hypopnea the termination of the event is called time-zero. The oxygen saturation signals around time-zero are synchronized with respect to time-zero.The time-aligned oxygen saturation signals are ensemble-averaged such that the mean value at each time point is calculated, resulting in a subject-specific average oxygen saturation curve specific to apneas and hypopneas.A subject-specific search window to quantify the area under the desaturation curve for each respiratory event is defined as the interval between the pre-event and post-event maximum oxygen saturation values. This time-locked search window will be used to determine the start and end of oxygen desaturation and calculate the area under desaturation curve for each respiratory event.Total HB (%min/h) is defined as the sum of individual areas (%min) divided by total sleep time (h). | 12 months |

273,"Background
-----------------
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the standard of care for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition. To this extent, two strategies have both proven to be effective in reducing bleeding complications while preserving efficacy compared with maintaining long-term DAPT with aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor: a) DAPT de-escalation (i.e., switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel while maintaining aspirin) and b) potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (i.e., maintaining prasugrel or ticagrelor and dropping aspirin). These strategies have been tested in a number of trials and have led to changes in practice guidelines to consider either one of these strategies as bleeding reduction approaches among ACS patients undergoing PCI. However, comparative assessments between DAPT de-escalation and potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy are lacking.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the thrombus formation (measured by T-TAS) between potent P2Y12 monotherapy strategy and de-escalation strategy (trough effect).

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective randomized study.

Study Population
-----------------
Patients who presented with chronic coronary syndrome, underwent PCI and have been on maintenance treatment with DAPT, composed of low-dose aspirin (81mg od) and prasugrel (10 mg od) or ticagrelor (90 mg bid) for at least 30 days. Or patients that presented with an Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event and underwent PCI and have been on maintenance treatment with DAPT, composed of low-dose aspirin (81mg od) and prasugrel (10mg od) or ticagrelor (90mg bid) for 3 months or greater.

Intervention
-----------------
After at least 30 days of DAPT [with aspirin 81-mg od and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel 10 mg od or ticagrelor 90-mg BID)] in chronic coronary syndrome or after at least 90 days of DAPT in acute coronary syndromes; patients will continue aspirin and switch to clopidogrel 75-mg."

Participants will be prompted to use a pattern recognition-based myoelectric controller to operate a virtual prosthesis and complete a simulation of the GaMA Cup Transfer Task. The control group will be provided motor imagery exercises that involve brief attempts to move the missing limb in a similar manner to how they would control their pattern recognition system to strengthen their muscles. These exercises do not involve any real-time control feedback or functional assessment. The primary outcome measure is the time to successfully complete the entire task trial (all 4 cup movements) from start to finish; averaged over all successful trials. Secondary outcome measures include the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric Controls (ACMC), the GaMA Cup Transfer Task Completion Rate, and the GaMA Cup Transfer Task Wrist Activation."

285,"The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies. The investigators will first use our previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status. The investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns. The true value of this novel HBV chimera vh-DNA will be revealed. The results will also support the consolidative use of personalized vh-DNA for earlier evaluating treatment response after RT, for post-RT disease monitoring, and for differentiating clonality at recurrence to design future clinical trial on combinational treatment."

288,"Background
-----------------
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin secretion. It is a major public health concern, affecting approximately 463 million adults worldwide. T2DM is associated with a range of complications, including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Nephropathy is a common complication of T2DM, affecting approximately 30-40% of patients. It is characterized by albuminuria, a condition in which albumin is excreted in the urine at levels higher than normal. Albuminuria is a strong predictor of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM.

Currently, the standard of care for the treatment of albuminuria in patients with T2DM is the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). However, these medications are not always effective in reducing albuminuria, and they can cause side effects such as cough and dizziness. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as a treatment for albuminuria in patients with T2DM. SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the kidneys, leading to increased urinary excretion of these substances. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in albuminuria.

Finerenone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for albuminuria in patients with T2DM. Finerenone works by blocking the action of aldosterone, a hormone that is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. By blocking the action of aldosterone, finerenone can reduce albuminuria and improve kidney function in patients with T2DM.

In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the individual response to empagliflozin and finerenone in patients with T2DM and albuminuria. The investigators will also assess the feasibility of conducting a remote clinical trial using digital technologies.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the individual response to empagliflozin and finerenone in patients with T2DM and albuminuria. The investigators will assess the change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to the end of treatment with empagliflozin and finerenone.

The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the individual response to empagliflozin and finerenone in terms of changes in systolic blood pressure, body weight, eGFR, and fasting plasma glucose from baseline to the end of treatment. The investigators will also assess the feasibility of conducting a remote clinical trial using digital technologies.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, crossover study. The study will be conducted in two phases: a screening phase and a treatment phase.

In the screening phase, eligible patients will undergo a series of baseline assessments, including a medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and urine collection. Patients will also be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their perspectives on the feasibility of participating in a remote clinical trial using digital technologies.

In the treatment phase, eligible patients will be randomized to one of three treatment groups: empagliflozin monotherapy, finerenone monotherapy, or empagliflozin followed by finerenone. Patients in the empagliflozin monotherapy group will receive empagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 28 days. Patients in the finerenone monotherapy group will receive finerenone 10 mg once daily for 28 days. Patients in the empagliflozin followed by finerenone group will receive empagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 28 days, followed by finerenone 10 mg once daily for 28 days.

During the treatment phase, patients will be asked to collect their urine samples using a validated urine collection device (PeeSpot) and send them to the laboratory for analysis. Patients will also be asked to measure their blood pressure and body weight using validated devices (Withings BPM Connect and Withings Body) and send the"

290,"1. Background and significance: Dental erosion is a multifactorial disease that is caused by the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution. It is a common condition that affects people of all ages and can lead to tooth sensitivity, pain, and even tooth loss. The prevalence of dental erosion has been reported to be as high as 90% in some populations, and it is estimated that approximately 10% of the global population is affected by this condition. Dental erosion is a significant public health problem that can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life. It can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty eating, speaking, and smiling. In addition, dental erosion can lead to the need for costly dental treatments, such as fillings, crowns, and root canal therapy. 2. Aims and objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash on the oral microbiome, salivary pellicle, and vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. The specific objectives of this study are as follows: To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on the oral microbiome in individuals with dental erosion. To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on the salivary pellicle in individuals with dental erosion. To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on oxidative stress markers and redox-related molecules in individuals with dental erosion. 3. Methods: The study will involve a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial design. A total of 24 participants will be recruited, with 12 participants in each group. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either CHX mouthwash or a placebo mouthwash for a period of 7 days. After a washout period of 12 weeks, participants will switch to the other mouthwash for another 7 days. During the study, participants will be asked to provide saliva and blood samples at baseline and at various time points during the study. The samples will be analysed using a variety of techniques, including DNA sequencing, proteomics analysis, and ELISA. 4. Expected outcomes: The expected outcomes of this study are as follows: To identify changes in the oral microbiome in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. To identify changes in the salivary pellicle in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. To identify changes in vascular function in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. To identify changes in oxidative stress markers and redox-related molecules in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. 5. Potential impact: The results of this study will provide valuable information on the effect of CHX mouthwash on the oral microbiome, salivary pellicle, and vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. This information will be useful for developing new treatments for dental erosion and for improving the overall oral health of individuals with this condition. In addition, the results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the role of the oral microbiome and salivary pellicle in the development and progression of dental erosion. 6. Ethical considerations: The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and all relevant ethical guidelines. Participants will be informed of the potential risks and benefits of participating in the study, and they will be asked to provide written informed consent before participating in the study. The study will be conducted in a safe and ethical manner, and all participants will be treated with respect and dignity. 7. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study will provide valuable information on the effect of CHX mouthwash on the oral microbiome, salivary pellicle, and vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. The results of this study will be useful for developing new treatments for dental erosion and for improving the overall oral health of individuals with this condition."
291,"Background
-----------------
Opioid use is a major public health concern in many countries. In the USA, the opioid epidemic has led to a significant increase in opioid-related deaths and a decline in life expectancy. In Norway, the use of opioids has also increased in recent years, and the number of opioid-related deaths has increased. However, the impact of the opioid epidemic in Norway has been less severe than in the USA. One possible explanation for this is the different approaches to opioid prescribing and management in the two countries. In the USA, opioid prescribing is often more liberal, and there is a greater emphasis on treating pain with opioids. In Norway, opioid prescribing is more conservative, and there is a greater emphasis on non-pharmacological approaches to pain management.
-----------------
The aim of this study is to explore if a Pain and Coordination Plan (PAC-plan) for patients after accidental injury can reduce opioid use and improve quality of life.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a PAC-plan on opioid use in patients after accidental injury. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of the PAC-plan on pain, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).

Study design
-----------------
The study is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be assigned randomly to study conditions (1:1) through permuted block randomization with various sizes of the blocks (4, 6, 8, 10) in random order. The randomization will be performed manually by the principle investigator (PI). Sealed, opaque, numbered envelopes will be used, and will be opened after consent from the patient. For the intervention group, the patients receive a Pain- and Coordination plan (PAC-plan) at discharge from the hospital. The PAC-plan includes: Upon discharge, patients have a patient-centered conversation and receive written information covering patient education on opioids, a tapering plan, and a plan for contact and follow-up with the general practitioner. The information is based on the Norwegian National Guide for Addictive Medications. Before discharge, patients are scheduled an appointment with the GP, preferably within the first 2 weeks (2-4 weeks), for a follow-up regarding the injury and pain management. The GP is invited to maintain contact with the study nurse at the hospital for one year. The general practitioner can call for consultation with the study nurse, and if necessary, be connected with relevant medical specialists for advice and eventually further follow-up.

Sessions will occur weekly over the course of 4 consecutive weeks and will not exceed 60 minutes in length. Each session will include a 15- to 20-minute writing stint whereby participants are asked to write about their deepest thoughts and feelings regarding their loved one's cancer and their role as caregiver. All participants will be given a Rocketbook for this purpose, a spiral notebook that has the look and feel of a standard paper notebook but uses a pen with erasable ink. The writing stint will be followed by a group discussion; participants will be invited to share what they wrote about (if so desired) and their reactions to the writing process. Each session will end with a debriefing and erasure of the writing content just created.

Gender affirming mastectomy (GAM) is a surgical procedure that is performed to remove breast tissue in transgender and non-binary individuals. The procedure is typically performed in two stages, with the first stage involving the removal of breast tissue and the second stage involving the reconstruction of the chest. GAM is a relatively new procedure, and there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. One of the most common complications of GAM is postoperative bleeding, which can lead to hematoma formation, seroma formation, and increased drain output. Hematoma formation is a collection of blood outside of blood vessels that requires intervention such as aspiration or surgical drainage. Seroma formation is a collection of fluid that accumulates in the surgical site after mastectomy that requires intervention such as aspiration or surgical drainage. Drain output is the amount of fluid (in milliliters) collected in surgical drains after mastectomy. The volume of fluid collected will be recorded by patients daily until the drains are removed. All patients will have surgical drains placed after mastectomy. Patients will be instructed to report any unusual drainage or bleeding to their healthcare provider. Data on drain output will be collected as a continuous variable, as well as the duration of drain placement. Time to drain removal will be defined as the number of days from mastectomy surgery to the day the surgical drains are removed. The timing of drain removal will be determined by the primary surgeon, based on the amount and character of fluid collected in the drain, and the presence of factors such as infection, hematoma, or seroma. However, drains will typically be removed when they have produced < 30cc/day for at least 3 days. The timing of drain removal will be recorded by nursing staff at the time of removal. Data on time to drain removal will be collected as a continuous variable, as well as the reason for early or delayed drain removal.

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled single-surgeon trial performed at the University of California San Francisco that investigates the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing GAM. All patients who meet WPATH guidelines for GAM, undergo GAM, ASA I-III, and are >18 years old will have the opportunity to be enrolled. Patients will be randomized by a random computer generator and will be notified after randomization as to which group they are assigned. The investigators will enroll patients into this prospective trial investigating the effect of IV TXA on postoperative bleeding, hematoma, seroma, drain output, and time to drain removal. Patients will be randomized into two groups, an experimental group receiving IV TXA and a control group that will not receive IV TXA. Patients will be excluded if they are <18 years old, have a history of prior chest surgeries, coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, and have a history of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Patients will also be excluded if they are chronically anticoagulated, are on antiplatelet medications or have ever had an adverse reaction to IV TXA. All patients who are being scheduled to undergo bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction will be recruited to participate in the study. Patients will be consented to participate in the preoperative visit. Experimental Group: Patients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Postoperative care will be standard and based on established UCSF guidelines. Control Group: Patients in the control group will not receive any TXA intraoperatively and will undergo a traditional GAM. Tranexamic Acid is available as a sterile, single-dose. This 1g vial is readily available in the anesthesia cart in the operating room. Immediately following induction, the anesthesia team will administer 1g of TXA intravenously. After obtaining hemostasis and irrigating as per standard practice, anesthesia shall not use any other hemostatic agents. Post-procedure, each patient will be provided with standard postoperative instructions which will include a chart to record daily drain outputs for the right and left sides. At subsequent postoperative visits, drain output will be assessed at each clinic visit to determine timing for removal. The total drain output will be measured by the patient and later logged into our chart for later analysis. Dr"

324,"The investigators discovered that frontal lobe damage and Aiming SN both predict optimal recovery of functional independence after prism adaptation treatment (PAT). These findings argue for the development of an [objective, biomarker-based process to identify patients who should be administered PAT. The algorithm will be developed by identifying specific neurobiological features predictive of PAT treatment response. Thus, the investigators expect this research will deliver a critical missing element to rehabilitation, eliminating clinician uncertainty about SN diagnosis and appropriateness of PAT, and allowing a more personalized health care approach to SN rehabilitation. The team of researchers at three high-performing VA medical centers, distinguished in cognitive neurology analysis of brain imaging predictors, and stroke rehabilitation, from both advanced and clinical data, will develop the first biological parameter that can be used to assign SN rehabilitation. In 180 Veterans (120 with SN, 60 without), the investigators will define and validate brain imaging biomarkers that predict the presence of Aiming SN (Aim 1), a strong predictor of functional recovery after receiving PAT. The expectation that disconnection of frontal regions with subcortical and parietal regions will predict Aiming SN. The investigators will also examine the correlation between the brain imaging biomarkers predicting Aiming SN and improvements in daily life function after PAT (Aim 2).] Then, the investigators will determine if adding behavioral predictors to biomarker predictors (Aim 3) accounts for additional variance in the trajectory of functional recovery. The overall impact of the investigators' work will be to establish the utility of a validated biomarker that routinely identifies Veterans with SN after stroke who are the best candidates for PAT. Armed with a biomarker-based algorithm, the investigators can then carry out a large-scale PAT clinical trial, and personalized SN care. This care pathway could reduce reliance on specialized SN assessment, [coordinate VA and community systems providing Veteran stroke care,] and improve stroke care efficiency, to enhance outcomes and quality of life after stroke for thousands of Veterans."
325,"The investigators want to start a pilot study of this technique in those patients with brain lesions in the resonance images compatible with a glioma-like tumor. In particular, the main aim of the study is to analyze the blood samples obtained from these patients in order to detect and quantify the circulating DNA (ctDNA) of tumor cells on it. These DNA fragments are expelled into the bloodstream by mechanisms still unknown as a result of numerous processes of apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells. By analyzing them through a ddPCR, the investigators will try to detect the specific mutations present in this tumoral ctDNA, allowing the team to confirm the presence of a glioma-type tumor, and providing real-time information of its classification as astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma."

-----------------
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cells. The most common form of SCD is sickle cell anemia (SCA), which is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene. This mutation causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped, which can lead to a number of complications, including pain crises. Pain crises are one of the most common and debilitating complications of SCD. They are caused by a blockage of blood flow to the tissues, which can lead to severe pain. Pain crises can last for days or even weeks, and they can be very difficult to treat.

Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that uses computer-generated images to create a simulated environment. VR has been used to treat a variety of conditions, including pain. There is some evidence that VR can be effective in reducing pain in patients with SCD. However, there is a lack of high-quality studies on the use of VR for pain management in patients with SCD.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of VR in reducing pain in patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis. The study will also examine the safety of VR in this population.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of VR in reducing pain in patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the safety of VR in this population and to examine the feasibility of using VR in this setting.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be VR therapy. Patients will be given a VR headset and will be asked to use it for 30 minutes.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The secondary outcome measures will be safety, as measured by the number of adverse events, and feasibility, as measured by the number of patients who complete the study.

Data Collection and Management
-----------------
Data will be collected at baseline and at the end of the study. Data will be collected using a standardized data collection form.

Statistical Analysis
-----------------
The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. The primary outcome measure will be analyzed using a paired t-test. The secondary outcome measures will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.

Discussion
-----------------
This study will provide important information on the effectiveness of VR in reducing pain in patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis. The study will also provide information on the safety and feasibility of using VR in this setting.

341,"The main purpose of this project is to investigate the accuracy of pocket-sized ultrasound (PsUS) in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures. The primary research objective is to determine the test performance characteristics of PSUS performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians compared to radiography for the detection of pediatric elbow fractures. The project will consist of two parts, first involving a feasibility study and followed by an active study. This project will consist of two parts, involving first a brief feasibility phase followed by a pilot study conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department (Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago, IL). For the feasibility phase, the purpose is to demonstrate that novice PsUS users are able to obtain accurate and adequate imaging for interpretation. This phase will initially involve the study providers receiving the elbow PsUS exam training. Once trained, each study provider will obtain 3 elbow exams of participants between the ages of 1-16 years old. Providers will use the standardized views reviewed in the ultrasound training to perform the exam, with verbal consent obtained from each participant's parent for inclusion in the feasibility study. These images will be reviewed by study staff to ensure US examiners are obtaining the correct standardized views. Once the feasibility exams are completed, the study providers are able to begin active study recruitment which will involve recruiting children between the ages of 1-16 years old with isolated acute elbow pain. Parents will initially be approached in the emergency department (ED), with written consent obtained if interested and eligible. Once consented, patients will undergo bilaterally standardized elbow exams using the pocket-sized ultrasound. All images will be stored on a password protected, cloud-based imaging database with all identifying information removed. After the exam, a basic assessment of the images will be made by the bedside ultrasound provider, as positive, negative or equivocal for signs of elbow fracture, but before reviewing any radiographic imaging. A positive PsUS will be defined as the presence of signs of elbow fracture, either as direct signs including cortical discontinuities or indirect signs including posterior fat pad with or without lipohemarthrosis on ultrasound exam. Following the ultrasound exam, patients will undergo standard clinical care for acute elbow injury per primary ED team which may consist of Xray or possible bedside nursemaid reduction. When applicable, study investigators will review the final blinded radiology readings of the initial or subsequent x-ray images after the patient encounter. Additionally, research staff will also attempt to follow up with participants after their ED visit for their elbow injury to determine if any additional radiographic imaging or care was obtained and if subsequent occult fractures were discovered on later imaging that may have been missed on the initial evaluation. The primary aim of the feasibility portion of the study is to determine acceptability of the PsUS study training to obtain adequate elbow images. The primary aim of the active study is to compare the initial test performance characteristics of PSUS performed by bedside physicians compared to standard radiography in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures."

-----------------
Hallux valgus is a common foot deformity that causes pain and discomfort in the foot. It is characterized by the deviation of the big toe towards the second toe, resulting in a bunion on the inside of the foot. The condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, foot structure, and wearing ill-fitting shoes. Hallux valgus can lead to a range of symptoms, including pain, swelling, and difficulty walking. In severe cases, it can also lead to the development of arthritis in the joint of the big toe.

Treatment options for hallux valgus include conservative and surgical approaches. Conservative treatments include the use of orthotics, such as toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses. These devices are designed to realign the big toe and reduce the pressure on the bunion. They can be worn during the day or at night, depending on the severity of the condition.

Toe separator orthoses are designed to separate the toes and realign the big toe. They are made of silicone and do not use tape or straps to separate the first and second toes and pull them medially to realign the first metatarsal. The orthoses reduce the pain in the bunion area by reducing the high friction between the shoe and the bunion.

Dynamic orthoses, on the other hand, contain a free joint that does not hinder the movement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The working principle of the orthosis is to provide healing of the deformity with low torque and long-term stretching. The dynamic orthosis corrects the hallux valgus angle by realigning the hallux, thus allowing plantarflexion and dorsiflexion.

Both toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses have been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of hallux valgus. However, there is limited research comparing the effectiveness of these two types of orthoses. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses in reducing the symptoms of hallux valgus.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses in reducing the symptoms of hallux valgus. The secondary objectives are to compare the effectiveness of these two types of orthoses in reducing the hallux valgus angle and improving foot function and quality of life.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the toe separator orthosis group and the dynamic orthosis group.

Participants
-----------------
Participants will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology at Istanbul Medipol University. The inclusion criteria are as follows:

- Age between 18 and 65 years
- Diagnosis of mild to moderate hallux valgus
- Willingness to participate in the study and sign the informed consent form

The exclusion criteria are as follows:

- History of surgery on the foot
- Presence of rheumatoid arthritis disease
- Hallux valgus deformity is rigid

Interventions
-----------------
Participants in both groups will be asked to use their orthoses for an average of 8 hours per day for 1 month. The orthoses to be used during the study will be randomly distributed to the individuals participating in the study.

Primary Outcome Measure
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the hallux valgus angle. The angle will be measured using a goniometer. The measurement will be performed by a single researcher.

Secondary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The secondary outcome measures are foot function and quality of life. Foot function will be assessed using the Foot Function Index (FFI). Quality of life will be assessed using the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ).

Data Collection

344,"1. Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common mental disorder that seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients. The pathogenesis of AUD is complex and involves multiple factors. The gut microbiota is an important factor in the pathogenesis of AUD. The gut microbiota is closely related to the immune system, and the imbalance of the gut microbiota can lead to the release of inflammatory factors, which can further aggravate the symptoms of AUD. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can improve the balance of the gut microbiota. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a psychological intervention that can help patients accept and cope with their emotions and thoughts. It has been shown to be effective in treating AUD. 2. Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of probiotics and ACT on the gut microbiota and inflammatory factors in patients with AUD. 3. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial. A total of 120 patients with AUD will be recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: probiotics group, ACT group, and placebo group. The probiotics group will receive probiotics supplementation, the ACT group will receive ACT intervention, and the placebo group will receive placebo supplementation. The gut microbiota and inflammatory factors of patients will be analyzed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. 4. Expected Results: We expect that probiotics and ACT can improve the gut microbiota and inflammatory factors in patients with AUD, and that these improvements can lead to better treatment outcomes. 5. Significance: This study will provide new insights into the treatment of AUD and may lead to the development of new treatments for this disorder."

346,"The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. Objectives Primary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. Secondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers. Study design The primary hypothesis will be tested using cognitive tasks performed by participants in an fMRI scanner. In order to assess striatal reactivity to reward, the investigators will use fMRI combined with a reward task. The investigators will use fMRI combined with a facial emotion recognition task to measure the reactivity of the amygdala to emotional stimuli. These tasks will allow the investigators to establish the brain phenotypes characterizing impulsive and emotional gamblers, and test the hypothesis that these phenotypes are diametrically opposed in these two sub-populations. The secondary hypothesis will be tested by combining fMRI measures with behavioral measures from everyday life (EMA). In concrete terms, gamblers will be followed longitudinally for up to 4 weeks, and will receive short questionnaires 3 to 4 times a day on their smartphones to assess their gambling behavior (number of hours spent gambling, amount of money spent...) as well as their emotions (positive and negative). These measurements will enable the investigators to test the hypothesis that the brain phenotypes described above are capable of predicting the relationship between emotions and gambling behavior in everyday life. Study population This study will focus on individuals with gambling problems. This category includes individuals suffering from gambling addiction as defined by the DSM-5, and individuals suffering from problem gambling, just below the DSM-5 diagnostic threshold. Extending recruitment to individuals with problem gambling should facilitate recruitment, while considering the existence of a continuum of gambling problems. The study will also include a control group of healthy subjects with no gambling problems and no psychiatric comorbidities. The plan is to recruit 60 gamblers and 60 healthy controls."

-----------------
Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life and death. The prevalence of sarcopenia is increasing with the aging of the population. The pathophysiology of sarcopenia is multifactorial and includes age-related changes in muscle, hormonal changes, and inflammation. The inflammatory process is characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These cytokines can lead to muscle atrophy and weakness. In addition, sarcopenia is associated with a decrease in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, which is an important regulator of muscle growth and repair. IGF-1 levels are known to decrease with age, and this may contribute to the development of sarcopenia.

Ophiochepalus striatus is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for centuries to treat various conditions, including sarcopenia. Recent studies have shown that Ophiochepalus striatus extract can increase IGF-1 levels and reduce inflammation in animal models. However, there is limited evidence on the effects of Ophiochepalus striatus extract on IGF-1 levels and inflammation in humans.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Ophiochepalus striatus extract on IGF-1 levels and inflammation in elderly patients with sarcopenia. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Ophiochepalus striatus extract or placebo for 14 days. IGF-1 levels and inflammatory markers will be measured at baseline and after the intervention period. The primary outcome of the study will be the change in IGF-1 levels from baseline to the end of the intervention period. Secondary outcomes will include changes in muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance.

Breast reduction surgery is a common procedure performed in adolescent girls. It is associated with significant post-operative pain. The use of local anesthetics has been shown to decrease post-operative pain in other surgical procedures. The use of local anesthetics in breast reduction surgery has been shown to decrease post-operative pain in adult patients. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of local anesthetics in adolescent patients. The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of local anesthetics in the form of subpectoral bupivacaine in adolescent patients undergoing breast reduction surgery will decrease post-operative pain.

Objectives
-----------------
Primary: To determine if the use of subpectoral bupivacaine in adolescent patients undergoing breast reduction surgery will decrease post-operative pain. Secondary: To determine if the use of subpectoral bupivacaine in adolescent patients undergoing breast reduction surgery will decrease narcotic use, length of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit, and time to return to full activity.

Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomized into either the study group (receiving intraoperative subpectoral bupivacaine) or the control group (will not receive subpectoral bupivacaine.) Block randomization will be performed using randomizer.org. For every forty patients, twenty will be randomized into the control group, and twenty into the bupivacaine group. Patients will be blinded to the which group they are placed in. The PI and study staff are not blinded. Per standard protocol, patients will undergo urine pregnancy testing in the pre-operative area. If results are positive, patients will be informed of the results in a private area. Surgery will be postponed and patients will be then excluded from the study. Patients will undergo their procedure with their assigned intervention. Intra-operative anesthetic and pain control regimens will otherwise be standardized with the anesthesia team to remove other confounding factors/variables. Administration of the saline/bupivacaine will be just below the fascia of the pectroalis major. This will occur following resection of the specimen and achievement of hemostasis, prior to closure of the wounds. Injections will be in a fan-like pattern, beginning at the inferolateral border of the pectoral is muscle, extending superomedially with injection, spanning the anterior surface of the pectroalis major. This will be performed under direct visualization; no imaging assistance is necessary. Each patient will receive 5 injections, 3mL per injection bilaterally. A total of 30mL of saline or bupivacaine will be injected. PACU nurses will record pain scores upon arrival into the PACU, as well as upon discharge home from the hospital. All patients will receive the same amount of prescribed narcotic. They will be sent home with a log. Patients will record a daily pain score, and the number of doses of ibuprofen, acetaminophen and oxycodone. As an internal quality control measure, research staff will call patients within 72 hours from surgery to ensure they are completing the pain score and medication log daily. The clinician (MD, PA, or nurse) will go through the survey questions with patients at their 1 and 4 week post-operative visits. These questions are typical questions asked at follow-up and will not add significant time to the clinic visit. All clinical staff asking these surveys is familiar with the information. (see appendices) Data will be collected at the 1 and 4 week post-operative visit in the plastic surgery clinic Further data (PACU length of stay, PACU pain scores) will be determined by performing chart review. To minimize error and maximize quality, only a few clinicians (3-4 max) will be those obtaining the survey results in clinic. All questions will be asked by reading verbatim from the survey to avoid bias when questioning. Scores will be entered into an excel file each day at the end of clinic. The spreadsheet will be password protected to ensure patient privacy. Only the surgeon, PA and RN will have access to this. Interim analyses will be performed after 60 patients have undergone treatment in order to assess if the study is meeting the intended objectives.

In the United States, LBP is the second most common reason for visits to primary care physicians, and the most common reason for missed work. The annual cost of LBP in the United States is estimated to be $100 billion. The prevalence of LBP is estimated to be 23% in the general population, and 60-85% of the population will experience LBP at some point in their lives. LBP is a complex condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle strain, disc herniation, and spinal stenosis. While there are many treatments for LBP, including medication, physical therapy, and surgery, these treatments are often ineffective or have significant side effects. There is a need for safe and effective treatments for LBP that do not require medication or surgery. 2. Hypothesis: T'ai Chi and Qigong is a safe and effective treatment for LBP that does not require medication or surgery. 3. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to examine whether a safe and moderate online t'ai chi and qigong exercise program, offered without cost to individuals with chronic back pain, improves pain levels, sleep, and quality of life. The secondary objective is to explore whether improvements in pain levels are different among smokers and those with unhealthy BMI than among others. 4. Study design: The study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with two groups: a t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and a waitlist control group. The treatment group started the t'ai chi and qigong classes in September 2022; the waitlist control group was offered instruction beginning in January 2023. The waitlist control group will simply be a comparison group. Thus, we will be comparing the outcomes of key measures between the treatment group receiving t'ai chi and qigong instruction starting in September and the waitlist control group. 5. Methods: The study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with two groups: a t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and a waitlist control group. The treatment group started the t'ai chi and qigong classes in September 2022; the waitlist control group was offered instruction beginning in January 2023. The waitlist control group will simply be a comparison group. Thus, we will be comparing the outcomes of key measures between the treatment group receiving t'ai chi and qigong instruction starting in September and the waitlist control group. After the baseline survey was closed to further responses, the data was exported as an SPSS file, then converted to Stata, by the PI onto his NYMC-issued, password-protected computer, which is in a secure space. Participants then were randomized either to start class in September 2022 (the treatment group) or January 2023 (the waitlisted control group). The treatment and waitlist control groups were randomized using Stata statistical software through a standard randomization algorithm. The algorithm would ensure that participants had an equal chance of being assigned to either arm. A simple, post-randomization analysis of participants assigned to the two arms was conducted to confirm that participants in the treatment and control groups are similar in terms of baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. (A comparison of means t-test will be used.) Previously validated, self-administered survey instruments will be included in the Survey to be used to assess the primary outcome of interest, low back pain, as well as associated outcomes of sleep and quality of life, including: The Oswestry Disability Index (primary pain measurement) The Visual Analog Scale for Back and Leg Pain (additional pain measurement) The SF-36, Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (health and quality of life) 19-Item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index A maximum of 300 people with chronic low back pain were selected to participate in the program on a first-come basis. The treatment and control groups were divided into roughly equal numbers, with a maximum of 150 participants selected for participation in the live Zoom t'ai chi classes starting in September 2022 and a maximum of 150 participants selected for the waitlist control. The project will include a minimum of 200 total recruited participants, which, accounting for possible attrition, will result in a minimum of 50 participants in each study group, enough to statistically analyze the primary outcome of pain alleviation (see Sample Size and Power below"

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for men with hormone-sensitive PC. ADT is associated with a number of adverse effects, including cognitive decline. Cognitive decline is a common side effect of ADT, with up to 50% of men experiencing cognitive decline after starting ADT. Cognitive decline is associated with a decline in quality of life (QoL) and is a significant source of distress for men and their families. The mechanisms underlying cognitive decline after ADT are not well understood. One potential mechanism is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain. Aβ is a protein that is normally cleared from the brain by the glymphatic system. However, in some individuals, Aβ accumulates in the brain and forms plaques. These plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. Aβ plaques are also found in the brains of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. MCI is a condition in which individuals have mild cognitive impairment but do not meet the criteria for dementia. ADT is associated with a number of adverse effects, including cognitive decline.

Cellulitis is a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, and many patients are hospitalized. Current evidence is lacking regarding the optimal management of cellulitis. If high-dose cephalexin is found to be superior to standard-dose cephalexin, this will change practice, with the potential to reduce unnecessary IV antibiotic use, hospitalization, and costs. The results will help inform future skin and soft tissue infection treatment guidelines.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether high-dose cephalexin is superior to standard-dose cephalexin in the treatment of ED adult patients with cellulitis.

Study Design
-----------------
The investigators will conduct a multicentre, parallel-arm double-blind, individually randomized trial comparing high-dose (1000 mg) cephalexin to standard-dose (500 mg) cephalexin to treat ED adult patients with cellulitis. This is a superiority trial. The trial will be conducted at 8 Canadian EDs. A total sample size of 446 patients (223 per group) will be required.

Study Population
-----------------
Inclusion Criteria: Adults (age ≥18 years) diagnosed with non-purulent cellulitis and determined by the treating emergency physician to be eligible for outpatient oral antibiotics.

Exclusion Criteria: Age <18 years; Patient already taking oral antibiotics; Treating physician decides IV antibiotics are required; Abscess requiring an incision and drainage procedure; Known prior cellulitis secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); Cellulitis secondary to a human or animal bite wound; Penetrating wound or water exposure resulting in cellulitis; Surgical site infection; Patient found at a follow up visit to have an alternative, non-infectious etiology (e.g., deep vein thrombosis); bilateral symptoms (e.g., both legs involved); Malignancy and currently being treated with chemotherapy; Solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipient; Renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min documented on the health record at any time within the past three months; Allergy to cephalosporins or history of anaphylaxis to penicillin; Inability to provide informed consent

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention is high-dose cephalexin (1000mg PO QID) for seven days. The comparator is standard-dose cephalexin (500mg PO QID) plus oral placebo for seven days.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome is outpatient oral antibiotic treatment failure, defined as a change in antibiotic (change in class of oral antibiotic or step up to IV therapy) within 7 days due to worsening infection. Any of the following meet criteria for worsening infection (at day 3 or 8 follow-up): (1) New fever (temperature ≥38.0C) or persistent fever at follow-up; (2) Increasing area of erythema (in cm2) ≥20% from baseline; or (3) Increasing pain ≥2 points from baseline (using the numeric rating scale).

Secondary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The secondary outcome measures are: clinical cure, clinical response, unplanned visits to a healthcare provider for cellulitis, unplanned hospitalization for cellulitis, adverse events, antibiotic intolerance, antibiotic allergy, medication adherence, and health-related quality of life."

376,"This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) that involves the repeated serial sampling of participants. This study design was chosen to provide comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence changes over time and the subsequent clinical impact on pwCF. The study will be conducted at participating CF centers over a 3-year period. Study participants will include pediatric and adult pwCF. For the UK section of the study, UK investigators in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society-Clinical Trials Network (ECFS-CTN) will be invited to participate. Participating investigators can enroll all eligible pwCF over a 12-month period. Participants are then followed up for 24 months. Participants will donate blood samples at their routine clinic visits. Blood samples will be collected at Day 0 (baseline), at Months 6, 12, 18, and 24 (to coincide with routine clinical reviews). Additional blood samples will be taken opportunistically every time the participant visits the clinic for blood draws. These blood samples could be related to, routine care, annual review visits, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), CF complications, or when initiating new treatments (e.g. CFTR modulators). Serum from blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory (Queen's University Belfast) for standardized measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Alongside the blood samples, the investigators will also collect clinical data from the patient's health records and will input this data into the case report form (CRF). Clinical data will be collected in conjunction with routine care visits, according to local clinical practice. Investigators will collect data elements from information routinely recorded in the patient's medical records. Data will be collected at baseline, months 6, 12, 18, and 24 as per the study schedule, and at additional blood sampling time points as previously explained above. Data collection will include routine data available from CF clinic follow-ups including background demographic information, CF medical history, medications, exacerbation information, sputum microbiology, and clinical and lung function parameters. Information on SARS-CoV-2 infection history and vaccine receipt will also be collected. The maximum follow-up duration of participation in the study for each patient will be 24 months. This study duration (24-month follow-up) is justified as it provides sufficient time to observe changes in antibody prevalence over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as sufficient time to determine long-term clinical outcomes for pwCF who are SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Furthermore, we anticipate the 2-year study follow-up period will provide sufficient time to observe the impact of vaccination on antibody levels given that a number of vaccines are now commercially available. The investigators will compare the level of antibody responses between natural COVID-19 infection and vaccination in pwCF and how this varies over time. This will be achieved by analyzing seroprevalence and antibody levels according to natural infection and vaccination status and according to time of sample post-infection or post-vaccination, if known. Optional Study sample collection: For participants who consent, a second blood sample will also be drawn into EDTA tubes (plasma). Consent to this optional study sample would allow this sample and any remaining serum (following antibody testing) to be stored for future analysis and allow further research to be carried out on related studies to COVID-19 and CF."

380,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of different NMES protocols applied to the triceps surae muscle for evoked torque, muscle fatigue, sensory discomfort, and peripheral oxygen extraction. The effects of the types of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) protocols on the aforementioned outcomes will be evaluated in the same participant by randomizing the sequences of the protocols applied. The study is considered double-blind, as individuals will not know the sequence of the protocols applied. The evaluator will also not know which protocol will be used at the time of the intervention. It will consist of a total of 5 sessions with seven days between them. In the first session, anthropometry, the maximum intensity level for each electrical stimulation protocol as well as the protocol sequence for each individual will be evaluated. From the second to the fifth session, the following will be considered: voluntary and evoked maximum joint torque of the triceps surae muscle, muscle fatigue through the evaluation of the H-reflex, M-wave, fatigue index, torque-time-integral and recruitment curve, peripheral oxygen extraction, electromyographic signals through RMS (root mean square) and median frequency, and level of sensory discomfort with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). From the second to the fifth session will be composed by the following evaluation sequence: warm-up with six submaximal contractions with 6 seconds of duration and 10 seconds of rest between them; then the assessment of muscle fatigue; then two maximal isometric contractions, then two maximal evoked contractions; fatigue protocol at 20% of the maximum isometric contraction (this fatigue protocol will use the NMES sequence randomized in the first session; after the fatigue protocol, two maximum evoked contractions will be performed again; then two maximal isometric contractions and at the end, the muscle fatigue evaluation will be performed again.

-----------------
Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) in monochorionic twins is a common complication of twin pregnancies. The incidence of sFGR is estimated to be 10-15% of all twin pregnancies. The current diagnostic classification system based on three different umbilical artery flow patterns has no increasing scale of severity and the observed flow patterns may be volatile in nature. This hinders optimal diagnostic management and complicates outcome prediction as the survival outcome differs per umbilical artery flow type. Consequently, parents encounter a great deal of uncertainty during the pregnancy. Since there is no treatment available for sFGR, predicting fetal deterioration is key in preventing single or double demise. By testing several predictors, the investigators are aiming to improve outcome prediction at the time of sFGR diagnosis. The investigators furthermore hypothesize that additional ultrasound parameters could be of benefit in making the current classification system more accurate and less variable. Extensive histological placental examinations will shine a light on microscopic abnormalities which can increase our knowledge of the pathophysiology. Examining neurodevelopment of sFGR twins at two years of age will additionally be of great value for our understanding of the impact of sFGR and contribute to adequate patient counselling. Our study will evaluate the impact of a sFGR pregnancy on parental mental health and parent-to-infant(s) attachment, which has not been carried out this extensively before.

-----------------
The term contextual effect has been used to reinforce the view that the placebo effect should be understood as an effect related to the therapeutic context, and not restricted to the use of inert treatments. Thus, the placebo effect is inherent to any therapeutic context and also can be used to enhance the effects of treatment with active components. There is evidence of the effectiveness of manipulative therapy in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP), however, for most physical therapy interventions, its effect is small. Thus, strategies to enhance the effects of this therapy, such as through the use of context factors, may contribute to better therapeutic outcomes. The literature describes that positively induced expectations can trigger a placebo effect. There are previous studies that investigated the effect of different speech on SMT in patients with chronic neck pain, but there is no study in CLBP. In addition, no previous study investigated further the perceptions of patients regarding the content and perceptions of the videos. The objective of this study will be to identify the short-term impact of positive, neutral, or negative speech on pain intensity (primary outcome). The secondary outcomes assessed will be the global perceived effect of improvement, patient's expectations regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) intervention, and perception of empathy in the therapeutic encounter in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) Methods
-----------------
It will be a randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor. It will be investigated the effect of the use of a hidden conditioning procedure and the induction of positive expectations on pain intensity after the administration of a manipulative therapy approach. This is an exploratory randomized clinical trial. The three groups will receive one session of SMT after watching the video proposed for their group. First participants will be assessed for pain intensity, low back pain disability, psychosocial aspects, and expectations related to treatment. Secondly, a researcher not involved in the recruitment of patients will randomly allocate the participants into three different groups (G1- group submitted to positive expectation speech, G2- group submitted to neutral expectation speech, and G3- group submitted to negative expectation speech). After the allocation, the participants will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering positive, negative, or neutral messages regarding SMT. And finally, a physiotherapist will administer one session of SMT and participants will be re-assessed to investigate the immediate effect of the videos on the pain intensity, global perceived effect of improvement, and expectations. Ultimately, patients will be submitted to a semi-structured interview in which their perceptions about the videos will be investigated. It will help to understand if the content of the videos actually causes an impact on the expectations of the patients. The main hypothesis of this study is that the group submitted to the positive expectation speech will have a higher hypoalgesic effect, greater perception of improvement, and higher expectations regarding SMT than the other groups immediately post-treatment. Outcomes will be assessed just immediately after one SMT session.

393,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on resting state functional connectivity in healthy individuals. The investigators will use a neuroimaging technique called resting state functional connectivity, which is a statistical dependence between time series of electro-physiological activity and (de)oxygenated blood levels in distinct regions of the brain. Functional connectivity strength calculation determines whether the activity between a pair of brain regions covaries or correlates over time. We will investigate the strength of the functional connectivity between the stimulation target (Nucleus Accumbens) and connected areas, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and sensory areas of the brain at baseline, and then will determine whether tFUS increases or decreases the resting-state connectivity between these regions after the NAC has been stimulated."

402,"Background
-----------------
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The incidence of IBD is increasing worldwide, and the prevalence of IBD in China is increasing year by year. The main clinical manifestations of IBD are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool. The diagnosis of IBD is based on recognized standards, including clinical symptoms, endoscopy, radiology, pathology and surgical history. The main treatment methods for IBD are drug therapy, surgery and other treatments. The main drugs used in the treatment of IBD are 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biological agents, etc. The purpose of drug therapy is to control the activity of the disease, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the quality of life of patients. However, the long-term use of drugs may lead to drug resistance, drug toxicity, and other adverse reactions. Therefore, it is necessary to find new and effective treatment methods for IBD.

Bowel preparation is an important part of colonoscopy. It is used to clean the intestines and improve the quality of colonoscopy. The most commonly used bowel preparation drugs are polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lactulose. PEG is a non-absorbable osmotic laxative that can draw water into the intestines and increase the volume of intestinal contents, which can effectively clean the intestines. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that can be fermented by intestinal bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, which can stimulate intestinal peristalsis and promote the excretion of intestinal contents. However, the use of PEG and lactulose for bowel preparation in patients with IBD has not been well studied.

Objective
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lactulose for bowel preparation in patients with IBD.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Patients with IBD who require colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to receive either lactulose or PEG for bowel preparation. The primary outcome is the effective preparation rate, which is defined as a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score of 6 or higher with a partial score of 2 or higher in each colon segment. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of adverse events, taste score evaluated by patients, effects of bowel preparation drugs on liver function, and effects of bowel preparation drugs on serum electrolyte.

Study Population
-----------------
Patients with IBD who require colonoscopy will be recruited for this study. The inclusion criteria are as follows: age 18-75 years, confirmed diagnosis of IBD, and scheduled for colonoscopy. The exclusion criteria are as follows: pregnant or lactating women, known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon, recent or active gastrointestinal bleeding, severe renal failure, severe dehydration or electrolyte disturbances, known or suspected allergy to PEG or lactulose, diabetes, lactose or galactose intolerance, and refusal to participate in this study.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either lactulose or PEG for bowel preparation. The dose of lactulose is 30 mL/kg body weight, and the dose of PEG is 2 L. Patients will be instructed to take the bowel preparation drug the night before the colonoscopy and to drink plenty of water. The taste score evaluated by patients will be recorded. The effects of bowel preparation drugs on liver function and serum electrolyte will be evaluated.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome is the effective preparation rate, which is defined as a BBPS score of 6 or higher with a partial score of 2 or higher in each colon segment.

-----------------
The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of two methods of soft tissue augmentation around dental implants: using a free connective tissue graft from the tuberosity area of the upper jaw and using a xenogeneic collagen matrix Fibro-Gide.

Methods
-----------------
The study was conducted in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the E.N. Meshalkin National Medical Research Center of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The study included 20 patients with a sufficient volume of bone tissue in the distal part of the lower jaw and a soft tissue thickness of less than 3 mm on the vestibular side. The patients were divided into two groups: the first group underwent implant placement in combination with an increase in the thickness of soft tissues using a free connective tissue graft from the maxilla tuberosity area, the second group underwent implant placement in combination with an increase in the thickness of soft tissues using a xenogeneic collagen matrix Fibro-Gide. The patients were examined on the 90th and 180th days after the operation. The amount of soft tissue thickness gain was evaluated using the GOM Inspect program. The severity of pain syndrome was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The severity of edema was assessed by its volume. The quality of life was assessed using the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) questionnaire. The width of the keratinised attached mucosa was measured using the UNC-15 periodontal probe.

-----------------
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness with a high mortality rate. The pathogenesis of AN is complex and not fully understood. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is closely related to the core symptoms of AN, and proposed the hypothesis of AN-ACC pathological network, suggesting that ACC overactivation and abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions (anterior frontal lobe, parietal lobe, precuneus, and striatum) is the neuropathological mechanism for the onset of AN. Currently, rare studies have been conducted on dTMS targeting ACC as an intervention in patients with AN. In this research, dTMS, a neuroregulatory technology, was used for the first time to intervene with ACC in the treatment of adult AN. A randomized controlled study design was adopted, in which patients with AN were divided into the dTMS treatment group and the pseudo-stimulation group by 1:1 randomization, followed by 6-week intervention and half-year follow up, to clarify the near-term and long-term efficacy and safety of the dTMS treatment. Psychometric and fMRI examinations are performed at baseline in both groups. The rest of the time follow-up of symptoms and psychometrics and side-effects questionnaires are performed at week 2, 4, and 6 (during treatment) as well as at week 4, 12, and 24 ( after completion of treatment). Meanwhile, baseline fMRI data were extracted and combined with clinical features to establish an efficacy prediction model. We will explore factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group, divided into two groups according to whether dTMS was effective or not at the end of treatment (week 6) (effective is defined as BMI increasing by ≥1.2 kg/m2 at the end of treatment), using pre-treatment (baseline) demographic information, psychological assessment questionnaires, and neuroimaging data in the two groups. This will provide theoretical and practical basis for the pioneering ACC-targeted dTMS treatment in China, helping to establish a new type of intervention program for AN, with expected results of innovation.

Objective
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of dTMS targeting ACC in the treatment of adult AN, and to explore the factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group.

418,"Background
-----------------
Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly health problem. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with an estimated 540 million people affected. In the United States, LBP is the most common cause of job-related disability and accounts for more than $50 billion in annual healthcare costs. Despite the prevalence and impact of LBP, there is no universally accepted treatment for the condition. Current treatments for LBP include medication, physical therapy, and surgery. However, these treatments are often ineffective or have significant side effects. As a result, there is a need for new and effective treatments for LBP.

Tai Chi and Qigong are two traditional Chinese exercises that have been shown to be effective in treating a variety of health conditions, including LBP. Tai Chi is a slow, gentle form of exercise that involves a series of movements that are performed in a slow, controlled manner. Qigong is a form of exercise that involves a series of postures and movements that are designed to promote relaxation and improve energy flow. Both Tai Chi and Qigong have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with LBP.

Aims
-----------------
The primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Tai Chi and Qigong in reducing pain and improving function in people with LBP. The secondary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Tai Chi and Qigong in reducing the use of pain medication and improving sleep quality in people with LBP.

Methods
-----------------
This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Tai Chi and Qigong group or the control group. The Tai Chi and Qigong group will receive 12 weeks of Tai Chi and Qigong instruction, while the control group will receive no intervention. Both groups will be assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity, as measured by a visual analogue scale. The secondary outcome measures will be function, as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index, and sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

Discussion
-----------------
This study will provide important information about the effectiveness of Tai Chi and Qigong in treating LBP. If these exercises are found to be effective, they could be used as a first-line treatment for LBP. This would be a significant advance in the treatment of LBP, as current treatments are often ineffective or have significant side effects.

420,"This is a UK-based observational study that aims to discover novel predictive biomarkers with the potential to guide treatment decision making and prolong PFS and OS in patients with advanced TNBC. Patients will undergo a mandatory, study-specific core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour or metastasis before commencing their next line of therapy. The research sample will be run on Pear Bio's test whilst the patient receives therapy as per their physician's choice. This study will not use Pear Bio's tool to inform the choice of treatment, with the treating oncologist being blinded to the test results. Treatment response data will be collected at multiple timepoints to conduct analyses on the study's secondary and tertiary objectives. Fresh tissue resections that arrive at Pear Bio's lab will undergo processing, cell culture and various drug dosing and omics assays (depending on extracted cell numbers). Tumour samples will be processed using a cell isolation kit to retrieve a viable single-cell suspension. A minimum of 100,000 cells (10,000 viable cells per chip) will be used for staining with live and dead cell-tracking dyes. In parallel, blood vials will be processed for PBMCs and further effector cell extraction (flow cytometry, Dynabeads, etc). The remaining cells will be used for sequencing (DNA/RNA), fixed for immunofluorescence characterisation of biomarkers/receptor status or used for further omics assays (if cell numbers allow). This may include tumour mutational burden and microsatellite instability testing. The stained cells will be cultured in a biomimetic hydrogel within Pear Bio's organ-on-a-chip to provide a physiological 3D environment for drug dosing experiments. Using a microfluidic device, samples in each chip will be exposed to approved therapies (either as monotherapy or combination therapies, as outlined below) over multiple days. In parallel, PBMCs will be extracted from whole blood, characterised and sorted via flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic beads selection. Cells of interest (e.g. CD8+ T cells) will be used for culture in Pear Bio's chips jointly with cells isolated from the matched tumour sample. To test immunotherapies, tumour cells will be co-cultured with immune cells in a modified organ-on-a-chip architecture. Chips receiving immunotherapies may be tested for tumour mutational burden and/or microsatellite instability. Confocal microscopy will be conducted daily to collect 3D image data of the cells and track their position and behaviour over time. At the end of the assay, the 3D cell cultures will be fixed for further 3D immunofluorescence analyses or used for embedding, sectioning and assessment of spatial transcriptomics. For targeted therapies, RNAseq, IF and other omics data will be integrated to confirm drug MoA and identify other potential therapeutic targets. Concurrently, 3D image data is processed through a computer vision pipeline to measure functional metrics of the ex vivo 3D cell cultures, including cell viability, cell culture width and cell migration, both at a bulk tumour level and at a single-cell resolution. For immunotherapies, additional metrics such as immune cell infiltration and immune cell killing will be recorded. A patient report is then generated to outline an individual patient sample's response to each therapy tested."
421,"Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract. The most common types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD is a disease that can be treated with medication, but sometimes surgery is needed. In Sweden, there is a waiting list for surgery, and the waiting time can be long. The purpose of this study is to investigate how health economy including quality of life is affected when surgery is delayed.

426,"1. Background and aims. Population-based newborn screening (NBS) is an important public health program that has vastly improved the course of several diseases through early detection. The selection of screened disorders generally follows the 10 principles outlined by Wilson and Jungner. In Germany, NBS has been a voluntary National Health Service program since 1969 which currently covers 17 disorders. Current NBS methods, which employ tandem mass-spectrometric analysis of newborn dried blood spots, cannot detect many potentially treatable genetic conditions. At the same time, molecular-based NBS is increasingly feasible because DNA can be extracted from a dried blood spot, next generation sequencing has become economical, and molecular diagnostics have greater reliability and increased validity as genetic databases become more refined and comprehensive. Nephropathic cystinosis and hyperoxaluria (PH) are eligible for molecular-based NBS because effective therapies are available. In a first pilot project, the scientific basis for NBS for cystinosis could already be established. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the transferability of genetic NBS for Cystinosis to other laboratories and to lay the scientific basis for screening for PH. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis. Cystinosis Nephropathic cystinosis, due to impaired transport of cystine out of lysosomes, occurs with an incidence of 1 in 100-200,000 live births. It is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome in the first year of life and glomerular dysfunction progression to end-stage kidney disease by approximately 10 years of age. Treatment with oral cysteamine therapy helps preserve glomerular function, but affected individuals eventually require kidney replacement therapy Cysteamine treatment generally begins at the time of diagnosis in the second year of life, but some glomerular and tubular damage has already occurred by then. This situation could be ameliorated by diagnosing patients shortly after birth, employing molecular genetics-based newborn screening. Standard mass spectrometry-based methods for newborn screening cannot detect the increased cystine content of cystinosis leukocytes. For cystinosis screening, the first tier involved multiplex PCR to detect two of the three most common CTNS mutations in Germany. Heterozygous samples will be submitted to amplicon-based next-generation sequencing for 175 pathogenic CTNS mutations (Labor Limbach, Mainz). A detection rate of 96.5% is predicted using this approach. Primary Hyperoxaluria Three different defaults in the glyoxylate metabolism lead to PH. The severe type PH1 is the most common variant (1-3 out of 106 patients). Population-based studies estimate a prevalence of 1:58,000. The estimated number of unreported cases is high. The deposit of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys triggers a chronic inflammation which results in terminal renal failure. Decreased oxalate excretion in the plasma and subsequently deposits of calcium oxalate in the organs and tissue (systemic oxalosis). The clinical course is highly variable. Examples of infantile oxalosis with early renal function loss up to a-/oligosymptomatic patients in adulthood are described. Clinically, PH2 is calmer, but about 50% of patients develop end-stage renal failure. PH3 used to be considered a mild variant, but it is known today that PH3 patients can also develop kidney stones in childhood and develop terminal renal failure with a systemic oxalosis. The PH registry of OxalEurope (European hyperoxaluria consortium) currently lists 1137 genetically diagnosed patients, comprising 81.9% with PH1, 7.9% with PH2 and 8.4% with PH3. So far, primary hyperoxaluria has been diagnosed according to clinical findings through urine analysis (or plasma test in case of terminal renal failure). Therefore, the diagnosis is usually made once patients have already developed terminal renal failure. But existing medications (Vitamin B6) or the new RNAi medications (Lumasiran, Nedosiran) can prevent renal failure and are making the disease treatable. The purpose of this pilot project is to identify the most common mutations in"

428,"The 3 FDA-approved CDK4, 6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, all provided progression-free survival benefits when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. But, not all of them provided overall survival benefit in the same setting. One of the proposed mechanisms that influence the overall survival difference is from the different influence of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors on tumor microenvironment and / or immune system. However, there was no head-to-head comparison of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors in the same study. Neoadjuvant therapy provides a window to obtain tissue samples before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment. We aim to compare the immune modulation effects of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib with letrozole in neoadjuvant treatment for ER+/HER2- early breast cancer. We will collect tumor tissue, blood, and stool samples prospectively before treatment, at 2 weeks after treatment, and after 12 weeks of treatment at the time of surgery. Immune modulation effects will be compared between 3 treatment groups from breast tumor RNAseq analysis."

432,"Background
-----------------
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. The majority of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive (ER+) and HER2-negative. In these patients, the standard of care is endocrine therapy. In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the standard of care is a combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy.

In the last decade, the introduction of targeted therapies has led to a significant improvement in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the majority of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer still relapse after initial treatment.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is currently being investigated in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. T-DXd is composed of a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (deruxtecan). T-DXd has shown promising results in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.

In this study, the investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. The investigators will also investigate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in patients with a molecular subtype of HER2-enriched.

Study design
-----------------
This is a randomized, open-label, phase III study. Patients will be randomized to receive either T-DXd or standard neoadjuvant therapy (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab). Patients will be stratified by molecular subtype (HER2-enriched versus non-HER2-enriched).

434,"1. Background and rationale: Physical activity (PA) is a key factor for health and well-being. However, the majority of the population does not meet the recommended PA levels. In addition, the nursing profession is characterized by a high prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and a high risk of work disability. The promotion of physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) is a promising approach to increase PA levels and to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal complaints and work disability. However, the implementation of PAHCO in nursing education is still in its infancy. 2. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches to the implementation of PAHCO in nursing education. 3. Study design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) with 16 schools. 4. Study population: Nursing students in Bavaria. 5. Interventions: The study will compare three different approaches to the implementation of PAHCO: (1) cooperative planning, (2) expert-based intervention delivered by external physical activity specialists, and (3) expert-based intervention delivered by teachers. 6. Main study parameters: Physical activity-related health competence, psychological movement quality, quality physical activity, general health status, work ability, and musculoskeletal complaints. 7. Study duration: 2 years. 8. Expected results: The study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of different approaches to the implementation of PAHCO in nursing education. The results will inform the development of evidence-based interventions to promote PAHCO in nursing education. 9. Potential impact: The study will contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions to promote PAHCO in nursing education. This will have a positive impact on the health and well-being of nursing students and on the quality of nursing care.

436,"1. Background and Rationale: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the European Union (EU) (267,000 deaths/year) and the fourth most common cancer (321,000 new cases/year). To date, radical surgery remains the best curative option in patients with early-stage lung cancer. Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to frequent diagnoses of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, many requiring surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention. Nevertheless, the increase in the utilization of minimally invasive procedures (e.g., video-assisted thoracic surgery -VATS- and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery -RATS- ) remains mandatory in order to reduce the significant morbidity of classic surgery, the surgical trauma, to preserve organs function and to improve patient's quality of life. Nevertheless, minimally invasive surgery does not consent to manual lung palpation, making localizing the not superficial lung nodule problematic. Several approaches have been developed to enhance the localization of indeterminate lung nodules and decrease the time to diagnosis and rate of conversion to open surgery. Nevertheless, none of these is 100% sensitive or without complications, also of severe grade. Numerous pre-operative methods are being employed, including percutaneous CT-guided placement techniques, encompassing the use of microcoils, hook-wires, and spiral-wires. These devices can support nodule localization during minimally invasive lung procedures; nevertheless, they could be easily displaced during patient transport and positioning, intraoperative atelectasis, single lung ventilation, and surgeon manipulation. Moreover, some locations of the lung as the apex, near the diaphragm, and the proximity of mediastinum and great vessels. Furthermore, all these pre-operative localization techniques require two different procedures, one for the CT-guided referral placement and one for surgical treatment. Finally, the rate of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and subcutaneous emphysema are not insignificant, and these complications are mandatory to avoid in several sub-groups of patients. Of note, methylene blue has limited application in patients with anthracotic pigmentation. Moreover, also these procedures remain complicated by the risk of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, dye air embolism, and cerebrovascular accident, and cases of lethal anaphylaxis to the dye of choice. On the other hand, clinical pre-operative staging and surgical planning are based on pre-operative images taken before surgery, either by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These pre-operative imaging assessments frequently underestimate lymph node involvement and secondary localizations. This results in an upstaging after surgical resection ranging from 9 to 24 % in clinical Stage I lung cancer. [10, 11] Nevertheless, the current system of intraoperative imaging, based on direct injection of a tracker in the principal tumoral mass, demonstrated a substantial limitation in lung cancer. This is principally due to the deeper location of the lymph node, usually profoundly engaged in normal fat tissue, and to the irregular lymph node drain system in the respiratory region. In this context, intraoperative fluorescence imaging can enhance the real-time identification of cancer cells during minimally invasive surgical procedures. This could overcome the difficulty of finding cancer nodules located deep in the lung parenchyma, not visible on the surface of normal, uninvolved tissue. The Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700-1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, which provides high contrast between the target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a more comprehensive dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence because of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. However, the conventional near-infrared (NIR) indocyanine green (ICG) method demonstrated a significant limitation in deep cancer recognition, principally due to its intrinsic low-depth tissue penetration. Similarly, the lymph-node sentinel approach conducted by the ICG method proved to be inefficient, mainly due to the non-specificity of the tracker and the irregular pathway of pulmonary lymph node drainage.

437,"Background
-----------------
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), also known as the Whipple procedure. The perioperative mortality rate after PD is 1-2%. The most common postoperative complications after PD are surgical site infections (SSIs), which occur in 10-20% of patients. The most common SSIs after PD are organ/space infections (OSIs), which occur in 5-10% of patients. OSIs are associated with a prolonged hospital stay, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased healthcare costs. The additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment after PD is undetermined as previous research reported conflicting results regarding infectious complications.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment on clinically relevant organ/space surgical site infections (OSIs) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile.

Study design
-----------------
This multicenter, randomized controlled, superiority trial compares perioperative versus pre-emptive antibiotic treatment during five postoperative days after PD in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile.

Study population
-----------------
Adult patients undergoing PD with a high risk for contaminated bile (patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy).

Intervention
-----------------
Participants will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation before surgery into the intervention or control group: Patients in the intervention group will receive perioperative prophylaxis (similar to the control group) followed by five days of 1500mg IV cefuroxime and 500mg IV metronidazole thrice daily. Patients in the control group will only receive perioperative prophylaxis (a single dose of 5-7mg/kg gentamicin followed by 2gr IV cefazolin and 500mg IV metronidazole every 4 hours of surgery), which will be discontinued after surgery.

Main study endpoints
-----------------
The primary endpoint are organ/space infections (OSIs) within 90 days after surgery requiring a therapeutic intervention.

Secondary endpoints
-----------------
The secondary endpoints are OSIs, isolated OSIs, wound infections, postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile or enteric anastomotic leakage, post pancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥III), reintervention, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, readmission, and in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Besides, switch of postoperative antibiotics, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and concordance between perioperative bile and postoperative surgical site cultures are analyzed.

444,"1.Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with a high recurrence rate after liver transplantation. The current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation is limited to surveillance and treatment of recurrence. However, the recurrence rate after liver transplantation is still high, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective adjuvant therapies to reduce the recurrence rate and improve the prognosis of patients with HCC after liver transplantation. 2.Rationale: Multi-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a class of targeted drugs that inhibit the activity of multiple kinases involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a key mediator of tumor angiogenesis. The combination of TKIs and bevacizumab has shown promising results in the treatment of advanced HCC. However, there is limited evidence on the use of this combination as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation. 3.Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation in patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy, as well as to assess the impact of this therapy on quality of life and graft survival. 4.Study Design: This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial. Patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation will be randomly assigned to receive either multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab or no adjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint is one-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate). The secondary endpoints include recurrence-free survival (RFS) duration, overall survival (OS), two-year and three-year RFS rates, graft survival, quality of life evaluation, and incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. 5.Study Population: The study population will include patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation. The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will be determined based on the current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation. 6.Intervention: Patients in the intervention group will receive multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation. The specific multi-kinase inhibitor and bevacizumab regimen will be determined based on the current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation. 7.Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is one-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate). The secondary outcome measures include recurrence-free survival (RFS) duration, overall survival (OS), two-year and three-year RFS rates, graft survival, quality of life evaluation, and incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. 8.Statistical Analysis: The sample size will be determined based on the primary endpoint of one-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate). The statistical analysis plan will be developed based on the current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation. 9.Ethics and Dissemination: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences. 10.Conclusion: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation in patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence. The results of this study will provide valuable information for the development of effective adjuvant therapies for patients with HCC after liver transplantation."
445,"1. Background: Limb loss is a life-altering event that can have a significant impact on one's mental health. Inpatient rehabilitation is a critical time for patients to receive support and treatment for their mental health needs. However, there is a lack of evidence-based interventions to address mental health concerns in this population. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic trial using a supportive-expressive (SEGT) group therapy intervention for addressing anxiety and depression for inpatients with limb loss. The secondary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the SEGT intervention in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. 3. Study Design: This is a two-arm pragmatic trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of the SEGT intervention compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The study will be conducted at St. John's Rehab, a specialized inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Toronto, Canada. 4. Study Population: The study population will include inpatients with limb loss who are admitted to St. John's Rehab. 5. Intervention: The SEGT intervention will be delivered by a team of allied healthcare professionals, including a psychiatrist, social worker, and occupational therapist. The intervention will consist of six 1-hour sessions that will be delivered over a 3-week period. The sessions will focus on guided discussions on coping with limb loss, managing sequelae associated with limb loss (e.g., pain), goal setting and strategies for community living. 6. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) questionnaires, which will be administered at baseline, discharge, and 3 months post-discharge. Secondary outcome measures will include the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist- 5 (PCL-5). 7. Data Analysis: The primary analysis will be a comparison of the mean change in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores between the SEGT and TAU groups using a mixed-effects model. Secondary analyses will include comparisons of the mean change in GSE and PCL-5 scores between the two groups. 8. Conclusion: This study will provide important evidence on the effectiveness of the SEGT intervention for addressing mental health concerns in inpatients with limb loss. If successful, the intervention could be implemented in other inpatient rehabilitation settings to improve mental health outcomes for this population."

453,"The investigators will perform basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH) designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. These experiments will follow standard procedures for collecting behavioral data, and involve simple perceptual tasks (e.g., signal detection, object recognition) and behavioral tasks (e.g., walking towards a goal location). The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when using an external computer to directly specify pulse trains (e.g., for Argus II, a 1s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12). These direct pulse trains are then sent to the VPU. This VPU contains software that makes sure that these pulse trains are within FDA-approved safety limits. For example, these pulses must be charge-balanced (equal anodic/cathodic charge) and must have a charge density below 35 microCoulombs/cm2. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. Sometimes the investigators will directly send pulses to the VPU by directly specifying pulse trains (e.g., send a 1 s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microAmps to Electrode 12 of an Argus II implant). Important parameters for safety include a) pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), b) charge density should be limited. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust to extremely high rates of stimulation and high current levels. However, high frequency pulse trains or high amplitude pulse trains can produce discomfort in patients (analogous to going from a dark movie theatre to sunlight) due to inducing large-scale neuronal firing. The investigators will normally be focusing on pulse-train frequencies/amplitudes that are in the normal range used by the patient when using their device. If the investigators use parameters that might be expected to produce a more intense neural response (and therefore have the potential to cause discomfort), they will always introduce them in a step-wise function (e.g. gradually increasing amplitude) while checking that the sensation is not 'uncomfortably bright', and the investigators will immediately decrease the intensity of stimulation if patients report that the sensation approaches discomfort. The PI has experience in this approach and will train all personnel on these protocols. In response to the stimulation/image on the monitor, subjects will be asked to either make a perceptual judgment or perform a simple behavioral task. Examples include detecting a stimulus ('did you see a light on that trial'), reporting size by drawing on a touch screen, or walking to a target location. Both patient response and reaction time will be recorded. None of these stimuli will elicit emotional responses or be aversive in any way. In some cases, the investigators will also collect data measuring subjects' eye position. This is a noninvasive procedure that will be carried out using standard eye-tracking equipment via an infra-red camera that tracks the position of the subjects' pupil. Only measurements like eye position or eye blinks will be recorded, so these data do not contain identifiable information. Subject"

Schechter Investigator: Mrs. Sandra Rusconi Serpa, MSc, FSP Study Title Feasibility of a brief manualized psychotherapy for traumatized mothers and their young children: Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) Short Title / Study ID CAVEAT Feasibility Study Protocol Version and Date Version 1.0, DATE Study registration Registered on international register (clinicaltrial.gov) provisionally Study category and Rationale This feasibility study conforms to a clinical trial of category A Background and Rationale The present study aims to determine if the manualized brief psychotherapy Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure-Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) can be administered to violence-exposed mothers and their young children (ages 1-5 years) in the ambulatory care center of a Swiss public hospital (SUPEA, CHUV) during a psychotherapy of 16 sessions. CAVEAT is based on an amalgam of four existing evidence-based psychotherapy models (Child-Parent psychotherapy, Parental Mentalization, Interaction Guidance, Prolonged Exposure) for parents, infants and young children and traumatized adults that led to the novel, core therapeutic technique developed by Prof. Schechter and colleagues Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Session(s) or CAVES which has been shown to be successful in positively altering mothers' perception of their young children in two open trials. From the existing literature, the investigataors know that parent-child relationship-based psychotherapies improve significantly maternal sensitivity to their child's communication, which is in part based on maternal capacity to perceive more accurately the young child's emotional communication and to take the child's perspective. Moreover, dyadic psychotherapy models using video-feedback and support of parental mentalization have been shown across models more generally to improve the quality of mother-child interaction. Risk / Benefit Assessment The risks of participating in this study are estimated as minimal (category A). The proposed intervention involves standard, validated psychotherapeutic procedures with the addition of clinician-assisted videofeedback exposure to naturalistic challenges that are typically stressful for young children and that are in situation by the clinician in collaboration with the child's mother during the filmed parent-child interaction sessions. This latter technique has been used without complication in both mental health referred and non-referred pediatrics samples with positive clinical effects in both studies. The investigators estimate that the risks of such an intervention are therefore limited. Though, if a matter arises that is severe, urgent or cannot be dealt with in the psychotherapy as conceived in the model, based on the therapist assessment, proper interventions and/or referrals will be made. Regarding the potential benefits An increase in maternal ability to take her very young child's perspective To respond more sensitively to the child's developmental needs and emotional communication, To be aware of what triggers post-traumatic stress during parent-child interactions, Reduction in re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions, and hyperarousal in day-to-day life with one's child Acquisition of increased tools for self and mutual regulation and stress-reduction during are benefits of participating in the study. If this form of manualized psychotherapy proves feasible to administer in a public hospital outpatient mental health clinic for children, it could potentially be implemented for this group of patients in a study that tests its efficacy in terms of improvement in parental stress, maternal sensitivity, and reduction of parent-child relational disturbance, potentially benefitting the larger group of these difficult-to-treat child-parent dyads. Objective(s) The aim of the submitted study is to determine whether the manualized, brief child-parent psychotherapy CAVEAT can be feasibly performed in a child and adolescent psychiatric ambulatory care center at the CHUV, a public university-hospital, this with child and mothers who have experienced IPV and who present to the clinic with concerns about their child's risk for emotional and/or behavior difficulties and/or who note relational disturbances with their very young children ages 1-5 years and/or problems with their parenting.

459,"1. Background and rationale: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem worldwide. The prevalence of T2D in Singapore is 11.3% (2018) and is projected to increase to 15.9% by 2030. T2D is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The risk of T2D is increased in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM is defined as diabetes diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy and has traditionally been considered a benign condition because typically glucose levels return to normal after delivery. However, women with pregnancies complicated by GDM often progress to develop T2D later in life. The risk of T2D is increased in women with a history of GDM by 3- to 10-fold.

-----------------
Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, thus being the focus of extensive research. The primary treatment goals of this disease consist in controlling local disease, reducing the risk of distant metastases, and avoiding enucleation whenever possible. Plaque brachytherapy is currently the standard treatment for small and medium-sized uveal melanomas. In clinical practice, ruthenium (Ru-106) or iodine (I-125) are the most commonly employed radioisotopes. Ruthenium is the most utilized radioisotope in Europe and South America due to its availability and good clinical outcomes. It is currently the only available option in Brazil's public health system (SUS). However, its use for large tumors (greater than 10 mm in thickness and/or 22 mm in diameter) is limited by the inability of delivering an adequate therapeutic dose of radiation without causing further damage to the surrounding retinal tissue. For this reason, researchers in medical physics have been investigating new treatment options in the last decades, including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radiosurgery (gamma knife or linear accelerator), and proton beam therapy. Although gamma knife radiosurgery and proton beam therapy are effective treatments with reliable tumor control rates, they are associated with poor visual outcomes, inadequate globe retention, and their use is reportedly limited in public health systems of low- or middle-income countries. EBRT carries potential side effects related to a broader radiation field, with an increased risk for complications in ocular and periocular structures, such as eyelids, sclera, lens, and retina. Finally, enucleation is an effective management for very large tumors, but it is usually a last resource. Considering the above-mentioned treatment limitations for large choroidal melanomas, our group explored an alternative approach using intra-arterial melphalan for tumor chemoreduction, aiming to reduce thickness and allow subsequent brachytherapy using a Ru-106 plaque. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan has been used to treat multiple cancers, including liver metastases from uveal and skin melanomas, but it has never been described as a primary tumor treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated a reasonable safety profile of the therapy when used for the treatment of other tumors. This is a phase I clinical trial that assesses the safety profile of chemoreduction with intra-arterial melphalan, followed by ruthenium brachytherapy, performed in patients that would otherwise need enucleation due to tumor size.

-----------------
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is a heterogeneous disease that represents an incurable condition wherein pharmacological interventions are directed towards deferring disease progression and alleviating symptoms, thereby extending survival rates and preserving the quality of life (QoL) and psychological well-being. Clinical advancements in anticancer treatments have notably augmented survival rates among MBC patients. However, accruing evidence reported that adherence to medications is a critical issue in the disease trajectory of breast cancer patients, particularly in the context of oral anticancer treatments (OATs). Emerging evidence indicates that patients with advanced cancer, such as those with MBC, often exhibit significant levels of nonadherence. MBC patients encounter various barriers to the daily management of OATs, including emotional and physical distress associated with side effects, dosage variations, treatment interruptions, and a lack of disease-related knowledge. Prediction models for adherence have been previously developed and tested across diverse scenarios and diseases. Evidence suggested that leveraging of the machine learning models in clinical practice enables the provision of personalized predictions on medication adherence for individual patients, thereby supporting adherence and facilitating targeted interventions. Even so, existing studies have yet to systematically address medication adherence among MBC patients by designing and implementing a decision support system (DSS) that integrates risk predictive models alongside educational and training tools. The current protocol aims to assess the efficacy of the DSS, a web-based solution named TREAT (TREatment Adherence SupporT), and a machine learning web application in promoting adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a sample of MBC patients. This protocol is part of a project titled Enhancing Therapy Adherence Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients (Tracking Number 65080791). The overarching goal of this project is to develop a predictive model of nonadherence, an associated DSS, and guidelines to enhance patient engagement and therapy adherence among MBC patients. The web-based DSS was developed in the first year of the Pfizer Project (65080791) using a patient-centric approach and comprises four sections: i) Metastatic Breast Cancer; ii) Adherence to Cancer Therapies; iii) Promoting Adherence; iv) My Adherence Diary. Moreover, a machine learning web-based application was designed to focus on predicting patients' risk factors for adherence to anticancer treatment, specifically considering physical status, comorbid conditions, and short- and long-term side effects. This machine learning web-based application was developed through a retrospective study employing physiological, clinical, and quality of life data available in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy) (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Specifically, multi-modal retrospective data has been retrieved from the Patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) using natural language processing (NLP) in a sample of 2.750 MBC patients (from 2010 to 2020). Methods/Design Main objectives Evaluating the effectiveness of the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application (TREAT - TREatment Adherence SupporT) in fostering adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a cohort of 100 Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients over a three-month period. Adherence is assessed by calculating the number of pills taken divided by the prescribed amount. Secondary Objectives Identify clinical factors (comorbidities, pain presence, tumor type, treatment type), psychological parameters (personality traits, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, sense of coherence, and risk perception), and QoL variables that serve as predictors for patients' adherence to OATs. These predictors are utilized to assess nonadherence to OATs among MBC patients and enhance the initial version of a machine learning model developed in the retrospective study (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Data for the secondary endpoints are collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 23-item Breast Cancer-specific Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-BR23), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

474,"Background
-----------------
Cardiac surgery is a complex procedure that requires the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to maintain the patient's circulation and oxygenation during the surgical procedure. During CPB, the patient's blood is circulated through a machine that provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide. The CPB machine also allows the surgeon to perform the necessary surgical procedures on the heart. However, CPB can also cause damage to the patient's organs, including the heart, brain, and kidneys. This damage can lead to complications such as stroke, kidney failure, and heart attack.

The use of CPB is associated with a number of risks, including the risk of stroke, kidney failure, and heart attack. These risks are increased in patients who have pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. In addition, the use of CPB can also lead to the development of blood clots, which can cause serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.

Despite the risks associated with CPB, it is still a necessary procedure in many cases. The benefits of CPB outweigh the risks in most cases, and it is the only way to perform certain types of heart surgery. However, there is still a need for further research to improve the safety and effectiveness of CPB.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of three different strategies for managing mean arterial pressure (MAP) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The three strategies are:

1. Standard MAP: MAP values between 50-60 mmHg
2. High MAP: MAP values between 70-80 mmHg
3. Patient-tailored MAP: MAP values comparable to the patient's pre-operative MAP

The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following outcomes between the three groups:

1. Serum lactate peak (Lmax) (mmol/l) detected during CPB
2. The area under the curve (AUC) of the serum lactate values measured during CPB
3. Number of cases with serum lactate peak > 3 mmol/l during CPB
4. Evaluation of intraoperative cerebral perfusion (through monitoring of NIRS)
5. Intraoperative pulmonary perfusion (through Pa/Fi ratio, paO2, paCO2 at ABG and VO2R and DO2 of CDI)
6. Evaluation of intraoperative and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (through the calculation of VISmax)
7. Postoperative and 30-day LVEF (%)
8. Evaluation of pulmonary injury (through the LIS)
9. Postoperative and 30-day Acute Kidney Injury (according to AKIN score)

485,"1.1.1.1 Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects the growth of bones. It is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible for the production of a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). This protein is involved in the regulation of bone growth. In people with achondroplasia, the FGFR3 gene is mutated, which leads to the production of an abnormal form of the protein. This abnormal protein interferes with the normal growth of bones, resulting in short stature and other skeletal abnormalities. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, affecting approximately 1 in 25,000 people. It is a lifelong condition that can cause a range of health problems, including spinal cord compression, sleep apnea, and obesity. There is currently no cure for achondroplasia, but treatment options are available to help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. These include physical therapy, surgery, and medications to help with pain and other symptoms. Research is ongoing to develop new treatments for achondroplasia, including gene therapy and stem cell therapy. 1.1.1.2 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TransCon CNP in children and adolescents with achondroplasia. TransCon CNP is a novel, long-acting formulation of CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide) that is designed to mimic the natural release of CNP from the heart. CNP is a hormone that is involved in the regulation of bone growth and has been shown to be effective in promoting bone growth in animal models of achondroplasia. In this study, participants will receive weekly subcutaneous injections of TransCon CNP for up to 10 years. The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of TransCon CNP, as well as its efficacy in promoting bone growth and improving height in participants with achondroplasia. The study will also evaluate the long-term effects of TransCon CNP on other aspects of health, such as quality of life and physical function. The study will enroll approximately 100 participants aged 3-15 years with achondroplasia. Participants will be followed for up to 10 years, with regular assessments of safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The study will also include a genetic analysis of the FGFR3 gene to better understand the underlying causes of achondroplasia and to identify potential biomarkers of response to TransCon CNP. The results of this study will provide important information on the long-term safety and efficacy of TransCon CNP in children and adolescents with achondroplasia, and may lead to the development of new treatments for this condition."

Adult-type GCTs are typically slow growing and are often diagnosed at an early stage. However, adult-type GCTs can be aggressive and can recur after initial treatment. The standard of care for adult-type GCTs is surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy is not always effective and can have significant side effects. Therefore, there is a need for new and effective treatments for adult-type GCTs. 2. Hypothesis: Androgen receptor (AR) inhibition by darolutamide in combination with leuprolide acetate and exemestane is a promising treatment option for adult-type GCTs. 3. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to determine the objective response rate of darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane in recurrent adult-type GCTs of the ovary (AGCT). The secondary aims of this study are to determine duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane when used in recurrent adult-type GCTs of ovary (AGCT). The exploratory aim of this study is to determine biomarkers predictive of response to darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane. 4. Study design: This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II study. 5. Study population: Patients with recurrent adult-type GCTs of the ovary (AGCT) will be eligible for this study. 6. Interventions: Patients will receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) and darolutamide PO BID starting on days -14 to -7 prior to cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1) and then on days 1-28 of each cycle. Patients will receive leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles will repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 7. Study outcomes: The primary outcome of this study is objective response rate. The secondary outcomes of this study are duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The exploratory outcome of this study is biomarkers predictive of response to darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane. 8. Sample size: A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. 9. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Logistic regression will be used to estimate the objective response rate. 10. Potential impact: This study has the potential to improve the treatment of adult-type GCTs of the ovary (AGCT). If darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane are found to be effective in treating AGCT, this treatment regimen could become the standard of care for AGCT."

493,"This is an observational cohort study using MRI to measure gastrointestinal (GI) function, lung structure and function and liver endpoints in children with CF aged 6 to 11 years. The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study (NCT04618185) to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint. In total, participants will be asked to remain in the MRI scanner for approximately 30 minutes at a time. For comfort, participants will be able to watch multimedia programmes through the use of a specially adapted television while in the scanner. Participants will also be asked to complete validated gastrointestinal questionnaires throughout the study day and recall their GI symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and complete a 3 day food diary. The study will be split into two phases. The first will be a pilot phase where 3 children with CF aged 6 to 11 years and 3 healthy age and gender matched controls undergo MRI scanning. These scans will be assessed to determine whether the scan protocol can be completed by the participants and assess the quality of the images obtained. If successful, the trial will progress onto the main phase. In the main phase, the 12 additional children with CF will be recruited and undergo the above scanning protocol, prior to starting ETI. We will then ask participants to return for a repeat scans approximately 6 months after starting ETI."
494,"Hypospadias repair surgery is an invasive surgery that results in significant postoperative pain. pain alters the quality of life and satisfaction of the patients and results in manipulation of wounds, infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence leading to unfavorable surgical outcome . As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedtomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting. A vast majority of literature supports the efficacy of particulate steroids like methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions. Aim of the work and hypothesis: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of caudal methylprednisolone in pediatric patients. This randomized, double-blind, controlled bi-center study was designed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in caudal block for children undergoing hypospadias surgical repair using the duration of analgesia as the primary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that methylprednisolone will provide superior postoperative analgesia than dexamethasone when added to bupivacaine for caudal block."

| Experimental: Treatment Group<br>EVLP + HDF | Device: hemodiafiltration (HDF)<br>* Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a variation of conventional HD. By the addition of a substitution solution, convection forces are significantly increased. This substitution solution is added to the blood and is completely removed again in the dialyzer. This increases the negative pressure on the dialysate side and the removal of toxins through convection. The substitution solution can be added in a pre-dilution (before the dialyzer) or post-dilution (after the dialyzer) manner. Pre-dilution is associated with longer run times, less filter clotting, but is also less effective in removing toxins. Post-dilution offers a better toxin clearance capacity, but is associated with an increased risk of filter clotting. Several studies have shown that HDF provides higher clearance rates for both small and middle molecule solutes. Moreover, effective cytokine removal has been shown in HDF both in acute and chronic renal disease patients.<br>* Other names: device: multiFiltrate Ci-Ca(R) (by Fresenius);Device: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP)<br>* Lung transplantation has become a standard treatment for patients suffering from end-stage lung diseases. One of the major obstacles in the modern transplant era is the fact that the need for organs by far exceeds availability. This leads to growing waiting lists with mortality rates ranging between 10-30%.

496,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants. Retinopathy is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for retinopathy examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The examination success rate was defined as the ability to complete the retinopathy examination without disturbances caused by infant distress or movement. The study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed retinopathy examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated retinopathy examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensory stimulation during retinopathy examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population."

Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare but devastating type of stroke. The incidence of BAO is 1.5% to 2.0% of all ischemic strokes. The mortality rate of BAO is 50% to 70%, and the disability rate is 20% to 30%. The current standard treatment for BAO is endovascular recanalization. However, the success rate of endovascular recanalization is only 50% to 60%. The main reason for the low success rate is the difficulty of puncture and sheath insertion. The radial artery is a natural artery with a diameter of 2 to 3 mm, which is smaller than the femoral artery.

513,"The BUNDLE study is a prospective mixed-methods study focused on the early integration of community doula into prenatal care. The investigators will pursue the following aims using a multidisciplinary team of experts in health disparities, community engagement, qualitative research, maternal-fetal medicine, and doula support: Aim 1: Develop an integrated prenatal care model of medical providers and community doulas in Southeastern Wisconsin Approach: The investigators will conduct six focus groups with 30 Black/AA birthing people (currently pregnant or recently postpartum) and 30 prenatal healthcare providers (obstetricians, midwives, doulas, social workers, prenatal care coordinators, nurses, mental health providers, and obstetric unit leaders) to elicit feedback on models of doula/medical provider integration with the overarching aim of building trust and improving maternal health outcomes. Focus group findings will be reviewed with a community advisory panel (CAP) developed as part of the Community Partnership of the MCW U54 center, to gain the CAP's input on intervention development. Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of the integrated prenatal care model to standard prenatal care in improving healthcare engagement and trust and reducing adverse maternal outcomes Approach: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial conducted at Froedtert and MCW, the investigators will randomize 412 Black/AA pregnant people to BUNDLE or standard prenatal care. Primary outcome is healthcare engagement (starting prenatal care in 1st trimester, attending at least 70% of the recommended visits, attending the postpartum visit, and receipt of recommended vaccination during pregnancy). Secondary outcomes include medical mistrust measured by trust in provider scale, perceived discrimination, and frequencies of severe maternal morbidity as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Aim 3: Disseminate findings to scholarly and community-based forums and actively pursue opportunities for systems- and policy-level change Approach: The investigators will disseminate findings regularly in scholarly (conference, grand rounds) and community-based (listening session, town hall) forums. The investigators will leverage the existing partnerships with policymakers, healthcare organizations, and community leaders to implement strategies to sustain successful program outcomes through policy changes at the system and statewide level by advocating for doula coverage and healthcare system sustainability of the integrated prenatal care model.

-----------------
Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that affects individuals of all ages and is a leading cause of disability worldwide. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the population will experience LBP at some point in their lives, and it is the leading cause of disability in individuals under the age of 45. LBP can be classified as acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on the duration of symptoms. Acute LBP is defined as pain that lasts for less than 6 weeks, subacute LBP is defined as pain that lasts for 6 to 12 weeks, and chronic LBP is defined as pain that lasts for more than 12 weeks. Chronic LBP is a significant public health problem, as it can lead to long-term disability and reduced quality of life.

The etiology of LBP is multifactorial and can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poor posture, muscle imbalances, and spinal misalignments. In addition, psychological factors such as stress and anxiety can also contribute to the development and persistence of LBP.

Massage therapy is a non-invasive, manual therapy that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of LBP. Massage therapy involves the manipulation of soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, and ligaments, to promote relaxation, reduce muscle tension, and improve circulation. There are several different types of massage therapy, including Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, and trigger point massage.

Swedish massage is a gentle form of massage therapy that involves long, flowing strokes to promote relaxation and reduce muscle tension. It is often used to treat individuals with chronic pain conditions, such as LBP.

Deep tissue massage is a more intense form of massage therapy that involves the application of deeper, more targeted pressure to specific areas of the body. It is often used to treat individuals with chronic pain conditions, such as LBP, and can be particularly effective in treating trigger points, which are areas of muscle tension that can cause pain and discomfort.

Trigger point massage is a type of massage therapy that involves the application of pressure to specific trigger points in the body. Trigger points are areas of muscle tension that can cause pain and discomfort, and trigger point massage can be particularly effective in treating these areas.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of connective tissue massage (CTM) and classical massage (CM) in reducing pain, improving functional status, and enhancing quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP). The secondary objective is to compare the effectiveness of CTM and CM in improving lumbar mobility and reducing disability in patients with CNSLBP.

The study design adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for rigorous reporting.11 After obtaining consent and confirming the inclusion criteria, a convenience sample of 30 participants was equally and randomly divided into three groups: the CTM group (n=10), CM group (n=10), and control group (n=10). Randomization was carried out by an independent physical therapist, who was not involved in the assessment or treatment of the participants, 1 hour before the baseline measurements. The randomization process involved using opaque and sealed envelopes, each containing a group allocation number generated from a computer-generated random number table. Block randomization was employed to ensure an equal distribution of participants across the groups. All treatment sessions were administered by the same investigator (C.D) in the study group. The intervention duration was uniform across all groups: 4 consecutive weeks, with 3 sessions per week lasting 15-20 minutes per session. Outcome measurements were taken at the beginning and 4 weeks after the completion of the program. An independent physiotherapist, unaware of the research details and participant groupings, conducted the evaluations.

Study Population

516,"The purpose of this research study is to: · Determine the differing pressure lowering effects between OMNI canaloplasty alone versus when combined with HYDRUS microstent. Both surgical study devices are widely used by themselves in conjunction with cataract surgery. While many surgeons have begun combining the two procedures, this will be one of the first studies to randomize (assign by chance) one eye to OMNI canaloplasty alone and the other eye to OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS stent and report the results after one year. About 80 subjects aged 18 years and older will participate in this study. WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY? Your participation in this study will last approximately one year and will include approximately seven study visits to the study center and two visits to the surgery center. Screening: Before any study-related tests and procedures are performed, you will be asked to read and sign this consent document. The following screening tests and procedures will then be performed to determine if you qualify to take part in this study: Visual field OCT analysis of the nerve and cornea - your nerve and cornea will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) equipment. This is painless, non-invasive (it does not involve puncturing or cutting) and is similar to having photographs taken of your eye. You will be required to sit still during the brief scanning procedure (a few seconds) Slit lamp exam with gonioscopy - a close inspection of the front of the eye using a machine that magnifies the eye and provides a beam of light to light the structures of the eye Eye pressure test - measurement of the pressure inside the eye. The pressure in your eyes will be measured using an instrument known as a tonometer Visual acuity test - a test involving reading letters off a chart to determine how well you can see This study will use competitive enrollment. This means that when a target number of subjects begins the study, all further enrollment will be closed. Therefore, it is possible that you could be in the screening phase, ready to begin the study, and be discontinued without your consent if the target number of subjects has already begun the study. If you qualify to take part in this study and go on to receive the study treatment, then the following will happen: Washout Period: You will be asked to stop taking your eye drops to treat your glaucoma. This is called a washout period, during which the effects of these medications leave your body. Study Treatment: You will be randomly assigned by chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive either OMNI canaloplasty or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. You will have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving OMNI canaloplasty alone or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. This is a not a blinded study, which means that you, the study doctor, study staff and the sponsor will know the study treatment you are given. You will have the following study visits and undergo the following procedures: · Preoperative and postoperative care will be the same as a standard cataract surgery consisting of one day, one week, one month, six month and one year follow-up exams. The only difference for study subjects is they will be asked to stop all glaucoma drops one month prior to their pre-op exam and one year post-op exam. After Study Treatment: Glaucoma is a permanent and irreversible condition that requires lifelong monitoring with an eye care professional. Sometimes additional treatment is required. Your eye specialist will recommend follow-up care based on your personal findings."

519,"1. Background and rationale {6a} The management of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage is a common problem in gynecology. The recommendations of the Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care. The choice between the two is left to the discretion of the doctor and the patient. There are no clear recommendations as to the choice between hysteroscopy and aspiration. Within the teams, the choice is often made according to the habits and protocols of the service, according to the equipment available and the skills of the gynaecologists. Aim: The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound. The secondary objectives are: the comparison of the rate of complications of the two techniques, during and after surgery the comparison of the rate of recourse to a second line surgical management between the two arms, the comparison of the rate of synechiae diagnosed by hysterosonography between the two techniques at 6 weeks after surgery, the comparison of the time to conception in the two arms during the 2 years after surgery in the two arms the comparison of the fertility rate at 2 years after surgery in the two arms. 2. Objective and hypotheses {7} The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound.

Neck pain is one of the most common and painful musculoskeletal conditions. Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition. The symptoms of nonspecific neck pain are similar to those of whiplash associated disorders (WAD) grade I and II but there is no traumatic event involved. Nonspecific neck pain (NP) is defined as pain in the posterior and lateral aspect of the neck between the superior nuchal line and the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra with no signs or symptoms of major structural pathology and no or minor to major interference with activities of daily life as well as with the absence of neurological signs and specific pathologies. Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as cervical pain without a known pathological basis as the underlying cause of the complaints. Some symptoms are limited cervical spine mobility and neck muscles weakness, which may be often related to other problems, such as, vertebral, neck or shoulder impaired function, and mental and physical stress at work. The natural course of non-specific neck pain remains unclear. While it is often self-limiting within a few weeks of onset, it can severely limit daily functioning, induce substantial medical consumption and result in prolonged sick leave and disability leading chronic nonspecific neck pain if pain duration is more than three months. As a consequence, it places a heavy burden on individuals, employers and health care services. Nonspecific neck pain is defined in the European guidelines for the management of chronic nonspecific neck pain that is not attributable to a recognizable, specific pathology (e.g., infection, tumor, osteoporosis, fracture, structural deformity, and inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, radicular syndrome. Characteristic of chronic nonspecific neck pain are heavy pain, worsening with exertion and relieve with rest. In some cases the cause may be sprain or overstretch of a ligament or muscles. Nonspecific neck belongs to the group of musculoskeletal disorders, which include diverse conditions affecting muscles, bones, and/or joints of the limbs or the spine. As for most other musculoskeletal disorders, nonspecific neck pain is multifactorial. A variety of different types of exercise have been explored to treat chronic neck pain, including low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise, high intensity aerobic exercise, stretching exercise and muscular strength exercises and isometrics. However, the most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain is unknown reflecting its complexity and more research is require. The rationale of the study is to compare the effects of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy on pain, range of motion and functional disability in chronic nonspecific neck pain. The main purpose of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy is to release the cervical trigger points, improving end ranges and lengthening of muscle. MDT helps draw toxins out of the muscles and to the superficial veins to be removed by the body. This leads to decreased pain and tension in the tissues. The ultimate goal is to achieve pain free end ranges and flexibility of muscle in nonspecific neck pain patients.

The human brain is a complex organ that is responsible for a wide range of functions including memory, attention, and executive function. The brain is also responsible for our mood and well-being. The brain is made up of a number of different types of cells, including neurons and glial cells. Neurons are responsible for transmitting information throughout the brain, while glial cells provide support and protection for neurons. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of tissue, including grey matter and white matter. Grey matter is responsible for processing information, while white matter is responsible for transmitting information throughout the brain. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of chemicals, including neurotransmitters and hormones. Neurotransmitters are responsible for transmitting information between neurons, while hormones are responsible for transmitting information between different parts of the body. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries are responsible for carrying blood away from the heart, while veins are responsible for carrying blood back to the heart. Capillaries are responsible for carrying blood throughout the brain. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of fluid, including cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid is responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord, while interstitial fluid is responsible for providing nutrients and oxygen to the brain.

532,"The investigators will enroll 300 consecutive patients with asymptomatic disease. All patients will undergo a baseline clinical examination, with computed tomography or MRI to assess cerebral lesions, and health records will be collected. Clinical variables will be measured with standard procedures after overnight fasting. Patients with evidence of heart failure, valvular defects, malignant neoplasms, or secondary causes of hypertension will be excluded. Specimens of the portion of carotid bifurcation that showed maximum disease will be obtained from atherectomy and will be cut in two halves and frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in in 10% buffered formalin for subsequent analyses. Plaque specimens will be then used to assess the presence and the amount of volatile organic compounds and microplastics through pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To corroborate these findings, plaque specimens will be also observed with transmission electron microscopy to visually identify microplastics within the atheroma and obtain further evidence and structural insights. Plaques will be also analysed through immunohistochemistry, ELISAs, and Western Blot to quantify inflammatory, i.e. NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, NF-kB, and CD68, and plaque stability markers, i.e. MMP-9 and collagen, in order to explore whether the presence of microplastics is associated with a poorer plaque phenotype. The groups (composed post-hoc) of patients with polluted plaques vs non-polluted plaques will be compared for the expression of all these markers. After carotid endarterectomy, patients will be followed-up and monitored for the incidence of a composite outcome constituted by non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and all-cause mortality, which represent the main and the only hard endpoint of the study. Patients will be categorized (post-hoc) as having polluted plaques (having detectable levels of at least one pollutant) or non-polluted plaques. Cox regression analysis will be used to examine the association between the presence of microplastics and the incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and smoking. Among those with polluted plaques, the abundance of pollutants, i.e. the sum, will be used to categorize patients into terciles. Cox models, adjusted for the same variables, will be run to explore the relationship between the burden of microplastics and the outcome. P values < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant."

The prognosis of patients with liver metastases is poor, with a median survival of 12-24 months. Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with liver metastases. TARE is a local treatment that delivers high doses of radiation to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy liver tissue. The treatment is performed by injecting radioactive microspheres into the hepatic artery, which supplies blood to the liver. The microspheres are designed to lodge in the tumor vessels, delivering radiation directly to the tumor. TARE has been shown to be effective in controlling tumor growth and improving survival in patients with liver metastases. However, the optimal dose of radiation to deliver to the tumor while minimizing toxicity to the surrounding healthy liver tissue is not well established. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the tumor and the response to treatment, as well as the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the healthy liver tissue and the occurrence of toxicity. The study will also investigate the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the tumor and the occurrence of toxicity. The study will include patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer who are scheduled to undergo TARE. The patients will be divided into two groups based on the dose of radiation delivered to the tumor. The first group will receive a low dose of radiation (< 100 Gy), and the second group will receive a high dose of radiation (> 100 Gy). The patients will be followed for 12 months after treatment, and the response to treatment, as well as the occurrence of toxicity, will be assessed. The study will also investigate the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the healthy liver tissue and the occurrence of toxicity.

535,"The study aimed to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with POAF. The telemonitored group received interventions and telemonitoring through the platform, while the control group followed the standard institutional patient journey without any intervention or telemonitoring. The primary outcome measure was the rehospitalization rate, and secondary outcome measures included scheduled consultations, extra occurences, technological adherence, treatment adherence, and use of the mobile application by patients. The study utilized a parallel assignment model and a single-blind design. The results of the study indicated that the telemonitored group had a lower rehospitalization rate and a higher rate of scheduled consultations compared to the control group. The study also found that the telemonitored group had a higher rate of technological adherence and a lower rate of extra occurences compared to the control group. The study concluded that the assisted digital telemonitoring platform was effective in reducing rehospitalization rates and improving patient outcomes."

-----------------
Septate uterus is a common congenital anomaly of the uterus. It is defined as a uterus with a complete or incomplete septum. The incidence of septate uterus is 1-2% of the general population. The incidence of septate uterus is higher in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and subfertility. The septum may be complete or incomplete. The complete septum is a solid structure that extends from the fundus to the cervix. The incomplete septum is a thin membrane that extends from the fundus to the cervix. The incomplete septum is more common than the complete septum. The septum may be associated with other uterine anomalies such as bicornuate uterus, unicornuate uterus, and didelphic uterus.

562,"The study - interventional, nonpharmacological, using medical devices, nonprofit - is aimed at evaluating the potential effectiveness of a multimodal intervention for the treatment of unipolar depression. The intervention involves the use of a neuro-stimulation technique, the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS), combined with a psychotherapy intervention, metacognitive therapy (MetaCognitive Therapy, MCT). TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique involving the transcranial application of a low-amperage electric current at a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been demonstrated how such stimulation has a neuromodulating effect on synaptic plasticity, with efficacy in unipolar major depression. The technique also has a good safety, as it is not associated with major side effects. MCT is based on the metacognitive model, according to which psychopathological processes are consequent to a cognitive style characterized by repetitive forms of thinking (such as rumination) and maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and thought suppression. The MCT, through attention training techniques, detached mindfulness and behavioral interventions on metacognitions, has shown effectiveness in major depressive disorder comparable to that of psychotherapeutic interventions considered, within psychotherapies, to be first-line such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. The experimental design will be that of a randomized, double-blind study with three arms of treatment, each consisting of 8 sessions, involving the administration of 1) the neurostimulation intervention (tDCS), 2) of the psychotherapeutic intervention alone (MCT), 3) of both techniques in consecution (tDCS-MCT). This design is aimed at evaluating a potential additive/synergistic effect of the two interventions when combined. During the tDCS sessions, each lasting 20 minutes, the patient will apply the technique of attention training, aimed at further activating the region stimulated by neurostimulation, so as to so as to amplify the plasticity stimulated by tDCS, achieving a synergistic effect. To follow, a 40-minute MCT session will be carried out. The effectiveness of these interventions will be assessed by heteroadministered and self-administered at time zero, after treatment, at two follow-ups of 6 and 12 months. Before and after the treatment cycle (tDCS sessions and MCT sessions), a subgroup of patients will be explored, in the context of a pilot study, the TMS-EEG correlates of the change in symptomatology depression, which can be correlated with the different proposed therapeutic interventions."

-----------------
Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease triggered by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The prevalence of CD in the general population is estimated to be 1% in the United States and Europe. The diagnosis of CD is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, serology, and histopathology. The gold standard for the diagnosis of CD is the detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) antibodies in the serum and the presence of villous atrophy in the small intestine. The diagnosis of CD is often delayed due to the lack of specific symptoms and the need for invasive procedures to obtain intestinal biopsies. The development of a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for CD would enable a real-time diagnosis of CD and improve patient outcomes.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid anti-TG2 test detected on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens compared to the reference standard (serology + histopathology). The secondary objective is to evaluate the concordance of EMA assay and rapid anti-TG2 test on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens with Culture-EMA results.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, observational study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include patients undergoing an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for suspected CD, eosinophilic esophagitis, autoimmune enteropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, gastritis, gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be the use of a rapid anti-TG2 test detected on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid anti-TG2 test detected on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens compared to the reference standard (serology + histopathology). The secondary outcome measure will be the concordance of EMA assay and rapid anti-TG2 test on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens with Culture-EMA results."
568,"Background
-----------------
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. While most people who contract COVID-19 experience mild symptoms and recover without any long-term effects, some individuals may develop a range of symptoms that persist for weeks or even months after the initial infection. This condition is known as post-COVID-19 syndrome, or long COVID.

Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition that can affect multiple systems in the body, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. Some of the most common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, and sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances are a common symptom of long COVID, affecting up to 50% of patients. These sleep disturbances can take many forms, including insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome.

Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. It is estimated that up to 30% of the general population experiences insomnia at some point in their lives, and this number is likely to be even higher among patients with long COVID. Insomnia can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, leading to fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. It can also increase the risk of other health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that is commonly used to treat insomnia. CBT involves working with a therapist to identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to sleep problems. CBT has been shown to be effective in treating insomnia in the general population, and there is growing evidence that it may also be effective in treating insomnia in patients with long COVID.

In this study, the researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in treating insomnia in nurses with post-COVID-19 syndrome. The study will involve a randomized controlled trial, in which participants will be randomly assigned to either receive CBT or to receive usual care. The researchers will measure the effectiveness of CBT by assessing changes in sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and insomnia severity before and after the intervention.

The study will also evaluate the impact of CBT on other symptoms of long COVID, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and brain fog. The researchers will also assess the impact of CBT on quality of life and mental health.

Overall, this study has the potential to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of CBT in treating insomnia in patients with long COVID. If the study finds that CBT is effective in treating insomnia in this population, it could lead to the development of new treatment options for patients with long COVID.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating insomnia in nurses with post-COVID-19 syndrome.

Design
-----------------
This is a randomized controlled trial.

Intervention
-----------------
Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive CBT or to receive usual care. The CBT intervention will involve six weekly sessions, each lasting approximately 60 minutes. The sessions will be conducted by a trained therapist and will involve a combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques. The CBT intervention will be based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is a well-established treatment for insomnia.

The CBT-I intervention will involve the following components:

1. Education about sleep and insomnia: The therapist will provide information about the normal sleep cycle and the factors that can contribute to insomnia.

2. Cognitive restructuring: The therapist will help participants identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs about sleep.

3. Stimulus control: The therapist will help participants establish a regular sleep schedule and avoid activities that can interfere with sleep, such as using electronic devices in bed.

4. Sleep restriction: The therapist will help participants gradually increase their sleep time by limiting the amount of time they spend in bed.

5. Relaxation techniques: The therapist will teach participants relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery, to help them relax and fall asleep more easily.

6. Sleep hygiene: The therapist will help participants establish good sleep hygiene habits, such as avoiding caffeine and alcohol"

577,"Background: 

Kienbock's disease is a rare condition that affects the lunate bone in the wrist. It is caused by a lack of blood flow to the lunate, which can lead to the bone dying and collapsing. This can cause pain, stiffness, and loss of function in the wrist. 

There are several treatment options for Kienbock's disease, including rest, splinting, and surgery. Surgery is often recommended for patients who have severe pain or loss of function. 

One surgical option is to shorten the radius or capitate bone in the wrist. This can help to relieve pressure on the lunate bone and improve function. However, it is not clear which of these two options is more effective. 

Objectives: 

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of shortening the radius or capitate bone in the treatment of Kienbock's disease. 

Study Design: 

This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. 

Participants: 

Participants will be adults with Kienbock's disease who are candidates for surgery. 

Interventions: 

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 

Group 1: Radius shortening 

Group 2: Capitate shortening 

Outcome Measures: 

The primary outcome measure will be the modified Mayo wrist score, which is a validated measure of wrist function. 

Secondary outcome measures will include pain, range of motion, grip strength, and quality of life. 

Data Collection: 

Data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. 

Analysis: 

The data will be analyzed using statistical methods appropriate for a randomized controlled trial. 

Discussion: 

This study will provide important information about the effectiveness of shortening the radius or capitate bone in the treatment of Kienbock's disease. The results of this study will help to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes."
578,"1. Background and rationale {6a}
The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increasing worldwide, with an estimated 466,000 new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2018. PC is the 12th most common cancer and the 7th leading cause of cancer death. The 5-year survival rate is 9%, and the median survival time is 6 months. The majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and only 20% of patients are eligible for curative resection. The main risk factors for PC are smoking, obesity, diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis. The prognosis of PC is poor, and the majority of patients die within 1 year of diagnosis. The main cause of death is metastatic disease, but local recurrence and postoperative complications are also common causes of death.
The main treatment for PC is surgery, but the majority of patients are not eligible for surgery due to advanced disease or comorbidities. For patients who are eligible for surgery, the perioperative period is associated with a high risk of complications, including postoperative infections, bleeding, and organ failure. The risk of complications is increased in patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, and chronic pancreatitis.
The main goal of prehabilitation is to improve the patient's physical and mental condition before surgery, in order to reduce the risk of complications and improve the patient's quality of life. Prehabilitation can be divided into three main components: exercise training, nutritional intervention, and psychological support.
Exercise training is the most important component of prehabilitation, and it has been shown to improve the patient's physical condition, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the patient's quality of life. Exercise training can be divided into aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and flexibility exercise. Aerobic exercise is the most important type of exercise for prehabilitation, and it has been shown to improve the patient's cardiovascular function, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the patient's quality of life. Resistance exercise is the second most important type of exercise for prehabilitation, and it has been shown to improve the patient's muscle strength, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the patient's quality of life.

581,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a canine-assisted therapy program in youth residing in a residential treatment center. The study will use a longitudinal, within-person design with two parallel conditions. In one condition, youth receive a 6-week canine therapy intervention. The other condition consists of treatment as usual. The subject population are youth that are in a full-time residential treatment facility in Lawrence Hall. All studies activities take place in Lawrence Hall. Please note that per Lawrence Hall policy, youth are selected by Lawrence Hall staff to participate in the Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy program while in residence. A group of closely-matched youth will also be selected by Lawrence Hall staff to serve as the waitlist control (treatment-as-usual) group. The Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy intervention is a 1.25 hour structured curriculum that will occur weekly across a period of 6 weeks. The program will be delivered by the Canine Therapy Corps (CTCorps). Youth will work with CTC-affiliate staff, including trained dog-handler teams, a canine behavior expert, and a clinical supervisor to engage in a series of structured activities progress throughout the intervention. Week 1 is a meet-and-greet session where youth are introduced to all dog-handler teams participating in the program and will be asked to select a team to work with for the following sessions. Each youth is assigned their own dog-handler team. Weeks 2 cover activities regarding dog obedience, building from mastering basic commands which the dog already knows (such as sit, stay') to the introduction of new tricks that the dog has not yet learned. In Weeks 3, youth will continue to work on mastering the new tricks with their dog-handler team and will also begin dog agility training. The agility training session progress in terms of complexity of number and types of obstacles. Week 4 is for proofing all skills (obedience, trick, agility) learned in previous sessions. Week 5 continues proofing all skills and is discussion of the graduation structure and dress rehearsal, and Week 6 is a graduation ceremony where family and friends are invited to observe the progress each youth has made with their dog-handler team. In Weeks 1-5, the goals of each session are outlined at the beginning of the session and brief education is provided regarding the session goals. Weeks 2-5 also include a review of the skills/activities covered in prior weeks. At the end of sessions 1-5, youth are asked to reflect on what they did during the session, including discussion of what they did really well, what they wanted to work on further, and goals for the next session. Research staff will be present during all sessions to record fidelity measures. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale will be administered on-site by research staff at the beginning and end of each intervention session. Change in affect are primary and secondary outcome measures.

588,"Background and study aims
-----------------
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a multidisciplinary programme of exercise, education and behaviour change that is recommended for all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. PR improves exercise capacity, quality-of-life and provides vital education for condition management. PR is now recommended for all COPD patients (NICE guidelines NG115). A standard PR programme involves two, in-person, exercise classes per week over a period of 8 weeks after which the patient is discharged to self-care. While retaining some in-person contact, technology could increase access and automate delivery of education and exercise by overcoming shortages of skilled staff. New technology exists to allow the delivery of a hybrid PR programme which may be used to support a move to a remotely delivered service (with patients having the opportunity to attend in-person PR sessions during the programme if they need the motivation or support of an in-person session). This study will use the UKCA/CE Class I-approved and DTAC-certified Active+me REMOTE App (Aseptika Ltd www.activ8rlives.com). The Active+me App, accessible by patients on their smartphones with Bluetooth or connected medical monitors, includes remote tracking of adherence, symptoms and physiological parameters (where appropriate); live, online video exercise classes; pre-recorded classes; a paced walking programme; an educational programme delivered in bite-sized pieces; and personalised care plans for every patient. Generally, NICE guidance draws on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to inform guidelines however RCTs are costly and time consuming for digital healthcare and this delays uptake and adoption by the NHS. New and innovative approaches to obtaining effectiveness evidence for digitally delivered healthcare are urgently needed and new approaches and solutions are being reviewed by NICE. This feasibility study will use a real-world study design drawing largely on routinely collected data to compare outcomes for patients recruited to a Hybrid PR Intervention with a propensity matched Control Group that has previously received Standard PR. Additional data will be collected from the Hybrid PR Group (via Active+me REMOTE / Trial Surveys) to provide supporting evidence relating to uptake, adherence, clinical outcomes (not routinely recorded in standard practice), and usability/acceptability of the Hybrid PR programme. Patients with chronic respiratory disease who are referred to the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme will be screened for eligibility to participate in the Hybrid PR Trial. Informed consent will obtained in eligible patients who wish to take part. Recruited participants will follow a hybrid PR programme (Intervention Group). The Control Group will be patients that have previously received a standard pulmonary rehabilitation programme and are matched on specified criteria including age, sex, measure of respiratory disability, index of multiple deprivation, exercise capacity and hospital vs community location. Following their informed consent the Hybrid PR Intervention Group will attend an onboarding session where a member of the clinical research team will i) download the Active+me REMOTE App onto patients' smartphone (or provide patients without a smartphone, one on which the App is preloaded), and ii) connect the patients' Active+me REMOTE account to the clinical team via a secure clinical portal. The clinician will also assign appropriate monitoring devices (e.g. BP monitor, Inhaler tracker, smart (weight) scale, pulse oximeter, peak flow monitor) to the participant. After saving the participant's details the patient's App dashboard will be displayed and (as required) the clinician will demonstrate exercise/ educational content of the App. Participants will have a preliminary in-person assessment with a member of the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Team (as part of routine care). The participant will then follow the 8-week Hybrid PR intervention involving two exercise classes per week. While this is an 8-week programme, this may be extended to up to 12 weeks for some patients (for example, if the patient is not able to attend 2 sessions per week). After completing the Hybrid PR programme, the participant will have a discharge assessment (as part of routine care). Demographic data from routine medical records and data on service location (i.e. hospital vs community setting) will be collected at baseline for the Hybrid PR Intervention and the Control Group. Data from routine medical records will be collected both at baseline and on completing the Hybrid/Standard PR programme. These data will include measures of exercise capacity; disease knowledge; lower limb function; health"

-----------------
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population over the age of 60. The main motor symptoms of PD are bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. In addition, PD is associated with a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive decline, depression, and sleep disturbances. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in PD is estimated to be between 20 and 80%. Cognitive impairment is associated with a higher risk of falls, a lower quality of life, and a higher risk of institutionalization. In addition, cognitive impairment is associated with a lower response to dopaminergic medication and a higher risk of developing dementia.

597,"Frostbite injury has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for as long as humans have experienced cold winters. When frostbite occurs, there are two primary mechanisms through which tissue damage occurs, though the main mechanism focused on here is systemic cooling. Frostbite is a multiphase process that starts with systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury, but it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities that have been used is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. At Regions Hospital, the main diagnostic method that has been used for over 20 years is conventional angiography. This clearly demonstrates the microvasculature of the tissues and allows the intra-arterial catheter directed sheaths to be placed to start thrombolytics, heparin, and vasodilators to treat the tissue ischemia. Other diagnostic modalities used elsewhere include Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT imaging, and indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography. All of these imaging modalities demonstrate the perfusion of the affected tissue but do not allow for directed delivery of thrombolytics. In institutions that use these imaging techniques, thrombolytics are typically delivered in an intravenous fashion rather than intra-arterial. ICG microangiography is a technology that has had rapidly expanding applications in recent decades. These have included retinal imaging, determining perfusion of colorectal anastomoses, biliary imaging, and assessing the blood supply of tissue flaps. It has recently been used in diagnosis of frostbite with good correlation with severe final amputation levels. It is easy to use, non-radiating, can be performed at the bedside, and cheaper than other imaging modalities. Given that every hospital has different diagnostic and treatment algorithms, these different imaging modalities have rarely been compared in the same patient. The current best metric is comparing the imaging modality with the amount of tissue that is amputated as demonstrated in prior studies cited here. This research application provides a unique opportunity to compare two imaging modalities head-to-head in the same patient and determine their concordance or discordance."

603,"1. Background of the study: American football is one of the contact sports with the highest risk in terms of exposure to repeated head impacts and the formation of neurodegenerative diseases that negatively affect the quality of life in the later stage of life. It has been reported that there are increases in the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers and that some other biomarkers (such as BDNF, zonulin, telomere length, etc.) that may be associated with these may be adversely affected in American football players. It is necessary to develop new approaches to determine the preventive factors against the risk of neurodegenerative diseases that may occur in the later years of life due to contact sports such as American football. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has antioxidant (vitamins, flavonoids, phytosterols, minerals, terpenes and phenols) and anti-inflammatory (oleic acid, polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids) properties that are thought to be effective in improving oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers. The MIND diet can also reduce intestinal permeability with its abundant fiber content (prebiotic effect). It has been reported that the supplementation of some nutrients (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, etc.) that have an important place in the composition of the MIND diet in this group of athletes has a positive effect on some of these biomarkers. However, the studies in the literature are limited, and there is no study involving the MIND diet in American football players. This study was planned considering that the MIND diet may have positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players, who are exposed to repetitive head impacts as a nature of this contact sport. 2. Objective of the study: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the MIND diet on oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players. 3. Study design: This study was planned as a randomized controlled trial. 4. Study population: American football players playing in the pro league will be included in this study. 5. Sample size: Accordingly, a total of 30 athletes, 15 in each group, with 95% confidence (1-α), 95% test power (1-β) and f=0.6 effect size; with 80% confidence (1-α), 80% test power (1-β) and f=0.6 effect size, a total of 20 athletes, 10 in each group, should be included. 6. Study duration: Since all teams will participate in the same number of competitions and the group matches will last approximately nine weeks, the follow-up time has been determined as nine weeks. 7. Study procedures: At the beginning of the study, a face-to-face questionnaire will be used to question the athletes' American football history and player positions, socio-demographics, general health and nutritional habits. Before the start of the study, a 7-day food consumption record will be taken from the athletes. MIND scores will be questioned before the study and every week till the end of the study according to the frequency of food consumption in the MIND composition scale. It will be used to assess participants' adherence to the MIND diet. Accordingly, the MIND diet components include ten food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, bean types, whole grains, seafood, poultry, olive oil, and wine) that are healthy for the brain. There are also five food groups (red meat, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets and fried / fast food / fast food) that are considered unhealthy. Frequencies of food consumption (daily, weekly, monthly) are questioned according to whether these 10 food groups specified in the template are preferred based on portion and meal or as a primary, and as a result, scoring is made as 0, 0.5 and 1 points for each food group. The highest score is 15 points. Because the MIND diet template does not have specific scores for diet adherence, below the median score (7.5) will be considered low adherence. According to the MIND diet composition scale, those with a MIND diet score of <7.5 points will be included in the study, while those with a score"

-----------------
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2% in the general population. It is characterized by a depressed mood and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed. MDD is associated with a significant burden on individuals, families, and society. The economic burden of MDD is estimated to be $210.5 billion per year in the United States and $121.5 billion per year in Europe. The treatment of MDD typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. However, despite the availability of effective treatments, many patients with MDD do not receive adequate treatment. One of the reasons for this is that patients with MDD often experience barriers to accessing care, such as stigma, lack of insurance coverage, and difficulty finding a provider. In addition, many patients with MDD do not adhere to their treatment plan, which can lead to poor outcomes.
Telemedicine is a promising approach for improving the care of patients with MDD. Telemedicine is the use of technology to provide healthcare services remotely. It has the potential to overcome many of the barriers to accessing care that patients with MDD face. Telemedicine can also help to improve adherence to treatment by providing patients with convenient and accessible care.
In this study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention for patients with MDD who are receiving care in a hospital setting. The intervention will consist of a series of telemedicine sessions with a psychiatrist. The sessions will be conducted using a secure video conferencing platform. The sessions will be tailored to the needs of each patient and will focus on providing support and education about MDD. The primary outcome of the study will be the rate of remission of MDD at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include the rate of remission at 12 months, the rate of relapse at 6 and 12 months, and the rate of hospitalization at 6 and 12 months. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

629,"1. Background and rationale: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common type of indolent lymphoma. The majority of patients with FL are treated with immunochemotherapy (IC) containing a monospecific anti-CD20 antibody (such as rituximab or obinutuzumab) and chemotherapy (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). The long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24 months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for progression of disease within 24 months), and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line treatment, and they are in need of improved treatment options. Mosunetuzumab is a new, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that has shown very high response rates and long response duration in B-cell lymphoma patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to standard salvage regimens. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients with POD24. The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients. 2. Objectives: The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24. The secondary objectives are to investigate safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab patients´ self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab resource usage related to mosunetuzumab 3. Interventions: Mosunetuzumab is administered SC as described below. Patients are followed for at least 2,5 years and a maximum of 5 years in the trial. Study-specific sampling of peripheral blood for exploratory research amounts to 330-380 mL (depending on the number of treatment cycles) collected over 3 years. Study-specific tumor samples for future research will be collected by fine needle aspiration before the start of treatment and after the third treatment cycle. Ethical considerations: Previous studies have shown that mosunetuzumab is highly effective and well tolerated in heavily treated B-cell lymphoma patients. The safety profile is favourable compared to standard immunochemotherapy. Mosunetuzumab can be safely administered to older patients with co-morbidities, and there is no upper age limit for participation in the trial. The potential beneficial effect of mosunetuzumab in a population of follicular lymphoma patients with POD24 outweighs the risk for rare and undiscovered serious adverse events. The total volume of blood samples is considered acceptable for patients in clinical trials. The extra tumor samples for research purposes will only be collected if deemed safe and not to cause unreasonable discomfort for the participating subject. The extra number of CT scans is 2-3 compared to standard practice and represents a minimal increase in radiation exposure. In total, the benefit to risk balance is deemed positive for this trial. 4. Study design: Phase II, one arm, open label clinical trial of subcutaneous mosunetuzumab mono-therapy 5. Study population: Patients with follicular lymphoma grade 1-3a with a current relapse or progression within 24 months of starting 1st line treatment or refractory to 1st line treatment (POD24), more specifically: Documented current relapse or progression of FL within 24 months of starting first line treatment containing a monospecific anti-CD20 antibody (such as rituximab or obinutuzumab with or without chemotherapy, small molecular inhibitors or immunomodulating agents such as lenalidomide).

-----------------
Delirium is a common complication of critical illness, affecting up to 80% of patients. Delirium is associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and increased risk of long-term cognitive impairment. Older adults are at increased risk of delirium and cognitive impairment, and the prevalence of delirium increases with age. Driving is a complex task that requires cognitive and sensorimotor skills. Older adults are at risk for ICU-acquired cognitive decline discernible from clinical, biological, and imaging-related changes in the brain following delirium and critical illness. Similar to other forms of dementia, the combination of normal aging paired with cognitive deficits associated with critical illness survivorship places these older adults at high risk of automobile crashes. To address ICU-acquired cognitive decline, driving assessments to characterize risky driving behaviors are promising to guide driving rehabilitation and intervention development. Rigorous and reproducible driving safety assessment programs have demonstrated success in post-stroke and dementia contexts, established via in-vehicle and virtual modes. The investigators hypothesize that in-vehicle driving assessment and monitoring is a feasible and acceptable approach to assess and address ICU survivor driving safety. The investigators seek to implement novel in-vehicle cloud-data collection technology developed by the investigators' team. The investigators propose to pair neurocognitive assessments with in-vehicle kinematic driving data to conduct essential formative work to develop data-based insights into driving behaviors of older adults with ICU-acquired cognitive declines. The investigators aim to determine protocol feasibility and acceptability of neurocognitive assessments and in-vehicle sensor deployment (Aim 1). The investigators will enroll a cohort of older ICU survivors (n=24) with risk factors for ICU-acquired cognitive impairment to complete neurocognitive measures and participate in driving data collection via in-vehicle sensors over a 6-month post-hospital discharge period. Next, the investigators will evaluate the relationship between neurocognitive assessments and driving behavior and safety in older ICU survivors (Aim 2). Lastly, the investigators will conduct stakeholder advisory panels on the priorities and data presentation needs of driving assessments for older ICU survivors (Aim 3). The stakeholder advisory panel insights will provide scientific justification and protocol feasibility to evaluate recruitment, acceptability and attrition for future full-scale implementation. As the population of older drivers grows, almost doubling in size from 2012 to 2040 there is an immediate and critical need to address this impactful issue. This work is designed in response to the NIA Strategic Plan (Goal C-1-9 Safety of Older Drivers) to contribute to a critical gap in health promotion to develop an evidence-based, in- vehicle driving assessment system to provide actionable driving safety data and rehabilitation strategies tailored to ICU survivors, the participants' care partners and clinicians.

637,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and surgery is the preferred treatment method for primary resectable GIST. The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors. Existing studies have explored the drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection assisting patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to use TKI. Therefore, this one-arm prospective observational clinical study will assist some high-risk GIST patients who have been treated with imatinib for 3 years after surgery and have achieved disease control to adopt the treatment mode of drug holiday based on MRD detection, aiming to evaluate the value of MRD detection in monitoring postoperative recurrence of high-risk GIST, investigate the effect of drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection on disease recurrence and patient survival, and to explore whether it can delay the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations."

-----------------
Cardiac surgery is the most important treatment for serious coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease and other heart diseases. Its postoperative mortality and serious complications have also been widely concerned, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The persistent pulmonary hypertension and systemic vascular paralysis during the perioperative period are the main causes of early postoperative death and serious complications such as organ failure.
Catecholamine vasoactive drugs commonly used in cardiac surgery may aggravate the condition of pulmonary hypertension, while the use of drugs to reduce pulmonary hypertension, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may worsen the state of systemic vascular paralysis. Vasopressin and oxytocin are two effective components in pituitrin, and vasopressin is the main component that exerts strong vasoconstrictive effect.
Vasopressin binds to receptors distributed in vascular smooth muscle, pituitary and kidney, and exerts its effects by regulating adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel function, nitric oxide production and enhancing vascular response to catecholamine.In addition, oxytocin can also bind to the receptors distributed in the heart and vascular endothelium, and play a role by releasing atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide.Therefore, pituitrin can not only constrict systemic circulation vessels and increase systemic circulation pressure, reduce pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, but also protect the heart and kidney. Therefore, this study intends to explore whether pituitrin has an impact on the prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery, so as to provide reference for its clinical application.

-----------------
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with an estimated 56,870 new cases and 2,220 deaths in the United States in 2019. Radioactive iodine therapy is a common treatment for thyroid cancer, and it is associated with a high rate of post-treatment nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). NLDO is a condition in which the nasolacrimal duct becomes blocked, leading to excessive tearing and eye irritation. It is a common complication of radioactive iodine therapy, with an estimated incidence of 20-40%. NLDO can be a significant source of discomfort for patients, and it can also lead to other complications, such as conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers.

Currently, there is no standard treatment for NLDO. Some patients may be able to manage their symptoms with over-the-counter eye drops or ointments, but others may require more aggressive treatment, such as surgery or dilation of the nasolacrimal duct. In some cases, NLDO may resolve on its own, but this can take several months or even years.

Artificial tears are a type of eye drop that is commonly used to treat dry eye syndrome. They are designed to lubricate the eyes and help to reduce symptoms of dryness, such as burning, itching, and redness. Artificial tears are available over-the-counter and do not require a prescription.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the use of artificial tears to prevent NLDO in patients who are treated with radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer. The investigators hypothesize that the use of artificial tears will reduce the incidence of NLDO in these patients.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized, controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group, which will receive artificial tears, or the control group, which will not receive artificial tears.

Participants
-----------------
The study will enroll patients who are scheduled to receive radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer. Patients will be eligible for the study if they are 18 years of age or older and have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

Intervention
-----------------
Participants in the experimental group will receive artificial tears to be administered in the 4 days immediately following radioactive iodine therapy. The schedule of administration will be as follows: Day 1 (day of radioactive iodine therapy): Every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for at least 4 hours or until bedtime at night Day 2: Once every 1 hour for 12 hours Day 3: Four times (approximately morning, lunch, dinner, and evening) Day 4: Two times (morning and evening)

Participants in the control group will not administer artificial tears in the 4 days immediately following radioactive iodine therapy.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of post-radiotherapy nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) in each experimental group as determined by tear duct irrigation by an ophthalmologist.

Secondary outcome measures will include the severity of NLDO symptoms, the duration of NLDO symptoms, and the need for additional treatment for NLDO.

The ACHIEVE (Advancing Community and Clinical Care for Childbirth-related Hypertension Through Implementation, Engagement, and Valuing Equity) Initiative is a multi-phase project that aims to improve care for pregnant people with severe hypertension. The first phase of the project was a formative study that included three rural Piedmont Health Services (PHS) clinics that serve mostly White and Latinx patients. The inpatient HTN bundle was adapted to fit their setting and re-named the Outpatient Hypertension (O-HTN) bundle. Additionally, a coalition was established to engage patients, clinic providers/staff, and the broader community to: (a) understand factors influencing maternal health including economic stability, education, health care access, and community context, (b) assess what makes it easier or harder to implement the O-HTN bundle in community outpatient clinic settings, (c) adapt the O-HTN bundle to fit those settings and populations, and (d) select and tailor changes to clinic practices using continuous cycles of learning, measuring and adapting to be the most effective and sustainable for the organization. Building on this formative work, the goal of the clinical trial is to determine the impact of three implementation strategies (training, coaching, facilitation) in 20 outpatient clinics in central North Carolina. Usual clinic care for severe hypertension will be compared to the care provided after a practice has 12 months of implementation support from the ACHIEVE Nurse Coordinator. ACHIEVE partners include healthcare leadership, clinic providers and staff, community-based organizations, and individuals with lived experience who will work together on this project. If the project succeeds in improving care, the ACHIEVE model will be shared across the state and nationally to support healthier birthing people and communities."

657,"Background
-----------------
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global health, with millions of people infected and many experiencing long-term symptoms. One of the most common and debilitating long-term symptoms is cognitive impairment, which can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Cognitive impairment is characterized by difficulties with memory, attention, and executive function, and it can be a major barrier to returning to work or resuming normal activities.

The exact cause of cognitive impairment in long COVID is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a combination of factors, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. Inflammation is a key driver of cognitive impairment, as it can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage neurons and disrupt normal brain function. Oxidative stress is another important factor, as it can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage neurons and contribute to cognitive decline. Neurodegeneration is also thought to play a role, as it can lead to the loss of neurons and the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

One potential treatment for cognitive impairment in long COVID is methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Methylprednisolone has been used to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, and it has been shown to improve cognitive function in these conditions.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone in patients with cognitive impairment in long COVID. We will enroll patients who have experienced cognitive impairment for at least three months after their initial COVID-19 infection. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either methylprednisolone or placebo for six weeks, followed by an additional six weeks of open-label methylprednisolone. The primary outcome measure will be change in cognitive function, as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Secondary outcome measures will include change in quality of life, fatigue, and mood. We will also evaluate the safety of methylprednisolone by monitoring for adverse events."

670,"1. Background and rationale: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is markedly increasing in prevalence amongst older adults. Older adults with MS present with poor health status and functioning, cognitive and ambulatory difficulty, dependence for activities of daily living, and reduced physical activity participation. The common approach for managing MS involves disease-modifying drugs, yet this first-line approach for medical management has little efficacy in older MS age groups (i.e., those 50+ years of age). Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for maintaining and/or restoring physical and cognitive health in older adults from the general population and younger adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. 2. Objectives: The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach (via telerehabilitation) with rigorous design for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based exercise intervention program in older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful aging with MS. 3. Study design: This study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms. 4. Study population: The study population will be older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. 5. Sample size: The sample size will be 40 participants (20 per group). 6.

-----------------
The incidence of cesarean section (CS) has increased significantly in the last 15 years. Various reasons account for the increase in CS, including an increase upon maternal request, changes in maternal demographics (e.g., increasing maternal age), changes in physician practice patterns, more conservative practice guidelines, and mounting legal pressures. Because of the gradually increasing rates of cesarean sections (CSs) over the last two decades, the number of hysterectomized patients with previous CSs has increased. In a recent review article, previously performed CSs were demonstrated to be an important risk factor for lower urinary tract injuries, and the recommendation that abdominal hysterectomy might be preferable for these patients was emphasized. TLH may be technically difficult in patients with previous CSs, due to surgical adhesions, and is associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications. Mobilization of the urinary bladder off of the cervix is an important step in total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and is always performed before dealing with the uterine pedicle. If the uterus is unscarred, bladder mobilization may not be technically difficult. However, if the uterus is scarred, there can be adhesions not only between the uterus and the bladder but also to the anterior abdominal wall, which can make dissection challenging. Studies of the effects of closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum during cesarean delivery on adhesion formation have concluded that insufficient data are available and that adequately powered and designed trials are needed. As regards the lateral approach, this space was first described by Dr. Shrish Sheth utilizing the utero-cervical broad ligament in post cesarean cases during vaginal hysterectomy. He described that the lateral area; the two leaves of broad ligament remains free and allows easy possibility for entry to dissect whether vaginally or abdominally.

Objectives
-----------------
The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of central and lateral urinary bladder dissection during total laparoscopic hysterectomy in cases with previous cesarean section.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective randomized controlled study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study will be conducted on 100 patients with previous cesarean section who are scheduled for total laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A (central group) will undergo central urinary bladder dissection. Group B (lateral group) will undergo lateral urinary bladder dissection.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the rate of urinary bladder injury during dissection. The secondary outcome measures are operative time, amount of blood loss, and late urological complications.

-----------------
The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that reside in the gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome is involved in many aspects of human health and disease, including metabolism, immune function, and brain function. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome is also involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Lipid metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down fats and uses them for energy. The gut microbiome is thought to play a role in this process by producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are a type of fatty acid that is produced by the breakdown of dietary fiber. SCFAs are thought to have a number of health benefits, including improving gut health, reducing inflammation, and promoting weight loss.

The gut microbiome is also thought to play a role in the regulation of well-being. Well-being is a state of mental and physical health that is characterized by a sense of happiness and satisfaction with life. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome is involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety. The gut microbiome is thought to produce neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which are involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety.

The gut microbiome is also thought to play a role in the regulation of sleep. Sleep is a state of rest and recovery that is essential for good health. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome is involved in the regulation of sleep by producing hormones that regulate the sleep-wake cycle."

685,"The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people with Parkinson's disease (PD) manage their physical activity and exercise participation with different levels of support from their communities and clinicians. We will evaluate exercise and physical activity every 3 months in a cohort of people with PD from two clinics in the Chicagoland area: Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest and University of Chicago Medical Center. During this study, we will evaluate differences in 12-month physical activity trajectories between groups enrolled during each of three conditions: (1A) standard care (condition 1, year 1), (1B) written exercise guidance (condition 2, year 2), and (1C) Consultative PT (condition 3, year 3). People with PD will be enrolled each year into an activity and exercise tracking study. Participants will be tracked using a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos) and commercial grade activity trackers. Research-grade actigraphy and patient reported outcome measures will be monitored every 3 months for the first year. All participants will be enrolled in an exercise and physical activity tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. The platform allows for synchronization of patients' activity data from their fitness tracker or smartwatch to the secure cloud-based platform. The platform can summarize steps per day, activity intensity, minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day based on target heart rate zones (including an ability for physical therapists to customize the target heart rate zone). At the 2 sites of care (Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital and University of Chicago), participants will be recruited based on contacting consecutive patients who meet the inclusion criteria based on scheduling and EMR screening prior to their visit with their neurologists. Contacting consecutive patients will ensure greater potential equity of enrolling participants rather than only patients engaged in support groups and exercise classes. However, after 3 months of recruitment, we will conduct a preliminary analysis of the numbers, recruitment rates, and characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, disease duration, education) of the enrolling participants compared to the demographics of each clinic as a whole. We will then determine if we should use targeted recruitment strategies to increase reach to specific groups or recruitment rates by doing one or more of the following: (1) sending measures through MyChart to potentially eligible patients targeting or oversampling for higher socioeconomic, race, or ethnicity diversity or (2) reaching out to local community exercise classes or support groups using emails to community advocates and flyers to increase sample size more rapidly. Consecutive patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be approached by a site study team member. The first contact may occur before or during a medical (physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner) visit. The electronic health record system will be used to screen participants for eligibility in the few weeks before their visit through an institutional review board-approved electronic data warehouse data waiver. Attempts will be made to contact potential participants before or during their appointments, with a research coordinator attempting contact at their visit if there is no response to early contacts. If time is limited during the patient's session, we will use patient portal communication and/or phone calls after their visits depending on the preferences of each site (which will be determined during the pre-implementation barrier assessment). Screening for eligibility will occur via a combination of data available in the EMR for existing patients and a quick screening questionnaire that can be done in person or over the phone. After identifying that the participant is interested and satisfies the inclusion criteria for the study, they will be sent an e-consent. Once consent is obtained, they will work with the study team to set a time for the baseline assessment period which will include ensuring the participant has their own -wrist-worn activity tracker and is able to get commercial grade activity tracker from the research team. At baseline and every 3-months throughout the 12-month (baseline, 3-months, 6-months, 9-months, 12-months) study, participants will complete online survey assessments including demographic questionnaires, habits and perceptions of physical activity and exercise, and healthcare and exercise resource utilization. Participants will, also, wear a research-grade physical activity monitor on a belt clip around their waist for 7-consecutive days at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months. In addition to research-grade physical activity monitoring, participants will be asked to a personal commercially available activity tracker daily which"

-----------------
Perioperative stroke is a significant complication after surgery. Unfortunately, covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline. Further, perioperative overt stroke is associated with an 8-fold increase in perioperative mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay, and decreased quality of life. For shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position, due to systemic hypotension and reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral desaturation events and impaired cerebral autoregulation can occur in up to 80% of patients. Most perioperative stroke in non-cardiac surgery is ischemic and is related to brain hypoperfusion. Importantly, brain hypoperfusion is potentially modifiable with simple measures such as increasing systemic blood pressure (BP) if brain ischemia is identified early enough. However, deliberate hypertension is not devoid of risk and there is currently no effective monitor that can detect brain hypoperfusion during surgery. Cerebral oxygenation has been used clinically as a measure of adequate brain perfusion during surgery. An early clinical trial at Western found that monitoring cerebral oxygenation was associated with fewer cases of major organ dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients. Despite this promising initial finding, current commercial cerebral oximeters have a number of limitations that prevent reliable perioperative neuromonitoring, including non-specificity due to signal contamination from extracerebral tissue, especially during administration of vasoconstrictors or hypothermia. In addition, current commercial cerebral oximeters only have two channels to monitor the frontal lobe regions (i.e., anterior cerebral artery territory). This monitoring strategy assumes that cerebral oxygenation is homogenous across different brain regions so that measurements from the frontal regions can be used clinically to represent the adequacy of global brain oxygenation. Such a limited spatial coverage may result in undetected stroke, despite the patients having apparently normal cerebral oxygenation in the frontal regions throughout surgery. The current research project employs multi-channel tr-fNIRS to address these limitations, with the goal of timely detection and prevention of ischemic brain injury. Multi-channel tr-fNIRS (time-resolved (tr) functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (tr-fNIRS)) is an emerging brain-imaging technology that was originally developed to explore changes in cerebral oxygenation generated by cortical neuronal activity during various cognitive tasks such as speech, sensory and motor functions, and emotion. This is because tr-fNIRS can measure such subtle cerebral oxygenation changes in milliseconds (up to 100 ms) that accompany neuro-activation such as finger-tapping. The investigators has built several tr-fNIRS devices and have the expertise of adapting the full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to perioperative neuromonitoring. Furthermore, tr-fNIRS operate by sending short (picosecond) pulses of light into the head and precisely measures the time of travel of each photon in the tissue. Since there is an equivalence between time and distance, photons that are detected right after the pulse have only probed the extracerebral layers (scalp and skull) while photons that are detected long after (1-2 ms) the pulse have travelled deep into the brain tissues. The investigators has recently shown that this approach reduces the signal contaminations of the extracerebral layers from 80% with current commercial NIRS devices to less than 8% with tr-fNIRS. In this study, the investigators will employ a state-of-the-art full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to monitor the entire brain, as opposed to only select regions (such as the limited capabilities of the current cerebral oximeters) in the perioperative setting. Together with in-house analysis algorithms, the full head coverage tr-fNIRS can detect specific brain regions at-risk of ischemic injury with a high degree of certainty because of greater spatial resolution (in cm) and less signal contamination from extracerebral tissue. All study participants will be recruited and consented adhering to the local ethics guidelines. For all study participants, the surgical and anesthetic management of the patients will be conducted in a standard fashion and will not be altered in this study. The exception is that tr-fNIRS will be used to monitor regional brain oxygenation from anest"

691,"1. Background of the study: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that affects women of reproductive age. It is a condition that causes physical and psychological symptoms in the last week of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms of PMS are very diverse and can be seen in many different areas. The most common symptoms are mood swings, irritability, anxiety, depression, fatigue, headache, breast tenderness, bloating, and abdominal pain. PMS can have a negative impact on a woman's quality of life, work performance, and relationships with others. It is estimated that up to 90% of women experience some form of PMS during their reproductive years. The exact cause of PMS is not known, but it is thought to be related to changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. PMS can be treated with various methods, including lifestyle changes, medication, and counseling. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating PMS, and what works for one woman may not work for another. In this study, the researchers will investigate the effectiveness of a health promotion model-based education program in reducing the symptoms of PMS. The health promotion model is a framework that is used to promote healthy behaviors and improve health outcomes. It is based on the idea that health is a result of a complex interaction between individual, environmental, and behavioral factors. The health promotion model has been used successfully in a variety of settings, including schools, workplaces, and communities. The researchers will use a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of the education program. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will receive the health promotion model-based education program, while the control group will receive standard care. The researchers will measure the effectiveness of the education program by comparing the symptoms of PMS between the two groups. The researchers will also measure the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PMS. The researchers hope that this study will provide valuable information about the effectiveness of the health promotion model-based education program in reducing the symptoms of PMS. 2.

693,"Background
-----------------
The prevalence of common mental health problems (CMHPs) in prison populations is high. CMHPs are associated with re-offending and are therefore an important target for intervention. The prison period may provide opportunities for addressing CMHPs, but there may be important obstacles and barriers to the actual delivery of interventions, such as a lack of mental health care specialists in prisons due to staff shortages. Within the PROSPER study, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the brief, scalable Problem Management Plus (PM+) intervention in Dutch prisons. The PM+ intervention is designed to address CMHPs, is delivered by trained non-specialists, and will be specifically adapted for the prison setting.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of the PROSPER study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PM+ adapted for individuals imprisoned in Dutch prisons.

Study design
-----------------
This study entails a single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) (Study Phase 2) and a qualitative study to evaluate the process following the pilot RCT (Study Phase 3).

Study population
-----------------
Study Phase 2 - Dutch-speaking adults (18 years or older; N=60) who at the time of inclusion are imprisoned in a Dutch prison and have a remaining sentence length of at least 15 weeks and who report an elevated level of psychological distress (K10 >15).

Study Phase 3 - Participants (N= 20) will be from different stakeholder groups: the RCT participants, PM+ helpers, PM+ supervisors/trainers, and professionals. If permitted by RCT participants, family members, and friends are also invited.

Intervention (if applicable)
-----------------
Treatment group (n=30) - Participants in the treatment group will receive care-as-usual (CAU) and five sessions of PM+. PM+ is a brief, evidence-based psychological intervention and will be delivered by trained master students in clinical psychology and supervised by mental health care specialists. Control group (n=30) - This group will receive CAU only.

Main study parameters/endpoints
-----------------
Main parameters are 1) PM+ fidelity, 2) perceptions about PM+ from stakeholders, 3) indicators of intervention delivery, 4) retention rate PM+ sessions, and 5) recruitment and consent rates. The secondary study parameter will be 1) symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ9 and GAD-7), 2) self-identified problems (PSYCHLOPS), 3) daily functioning (WHOQOL-BREF) and 4) symptoms of trauma (PCL-5) and suicidality vulnerability (SCOPE-2).

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness
-----------------
Study Phase 2 - participants enrolled in the treatment group will receive five sixty-minute PM+ sessions. If participants give permission, the sessions will be audiotaped for monitoring purposes. Additionally, all participants will be invited for a total of four assessments (one screening, one baseline assessment, and two post- intervention assessments). The post- intervention assessments will take place one week and three months after the last PM+ session. These assessments, all together, will take approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes. Study Phase 3 - Five stakeholder groups will be invited for individual interviews to evaluate the intervention and process. Each interview will take approximately 1 to 1,5 hours.

-----------------
Depression is a common mental disorder, affecting 10-15% of the population at some point in their lives. The majority of patients with depression respond to treatment, but a significant proportion of patients do not respond to treatment, or respond only partially. These patients are referred to as treatment resistant. Treatment resistant depression is associated with a poorer prognosis, and is often associated with other mental disorders, such as anxiety, personality disorders, and substance abuse.

Schema therapy is a form of psychotherapy that has been developed to treat patients with personality disorders, but has also been used to treat patients with depression. Schema therapy is based on the theory that patients with depression have developed maladaptive patterns of thinking and behaving, which are referred to as 'schemas'. These schemas are thought to be the result of early childhood experiences, and are thought to be the cause of depression. Schema therapy aims to help patients identify and change their maladaptive schemas, in order to improve their mood and functioning.

Aims
-----------------
The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of schema therapy with treatment as usual in the treatment of patients with treatment resistant depression.

Methods
-----------------
The study will be a randomized controlled trial, with patients being randomly allocated to either schema therapy or treatment as usual. Patients will be followed up for 24 months after the start of treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the change in depression symptoms, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures will include changes in anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and patient-defined outcomes.

The study will also investigate the mediating role of early maladaptive schemas and schema modes in the treatment of depression.

The study will be conducted in four different sites in Denmark.

711,"Background
-----------------
Parenting is a complex and demanding task. Parents with ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are at increased risk of experiencing parenting difficulties, including parenting stress, parent-child conflict, and child behavior problems. Parents with ADHD also tend to have lower levels of parental self-efficacy, that is, their confidence in their ability to manage parenting tasks. Parental self-efficacy is a key predictor of parenting behavior and has been shown to mediate the relationship between parental ADHD and parenting outcomes. Parent training programs are effective in improving parenting skills and reducing parenting stress and child behavior problems in parents with ADHD. However, most parent training programs are not designed for parents with ADHD and may not be effective in this population.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new parent training program for parents with ADHD (Improving Parenting Skills adult ADHD; IPSA). The secondary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of IPSA.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized controlled trial with parallel groups, where eligible individuals are block randomized on each clinical site to one of two groups (ratio 1:1): Treatment (IPSA directly) or Control (continued routine services; offered IPSA approximately six months later). Each block includes 18 participants. Randomization is done using a digital randomization tool. Allocation (treatment or control) is masked to participants and study staff administering the screening/inclusion/assessment procedures until after the baseline assessment (including pre-intervention questionnaires) has been completed.

Study Population
-----------------
Parents (≥ 18 years of age) with a formal ADHD diagnosis (any form) having at least one child aged 3 to 11 years, recruited via the project web site as well as among families enrolled at the involved clinical site.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention is a new parent training program for parents with ADHD (Improving Parenting Skills adult ADHD; IPSA). The program combines structured group-based skills training with individualized support, including occupational therapist support to help parents improve their own prerequisites for bringing about change and facilitate use of the introduced parenting skills. The program consists of 12 weekly group sessions (2.5 hours each) and 12 individual sessions (1 hour each). The group sessions are led by a psychologist and a pedagogue, and the individual sessions are led by an occupational therapist. The program is based on a cognitive-behavioral approach and includes elements from other evidence-based parent training programs, such as the Incredible Years program. The program is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of individual participants.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is parental self-efficacy, measured with the Parental Self-Efficacy scale (PSE; Ulfsdotter, Enebrink, & Lindberg, 2014). The PSE is a 20-item self-report scale that assesses parents' confidence in their ability to manage parenting tasks. The scale has been shown to have good psychometric properties in Swedish samples. The PSE is administered at baseline (pre IPSA; T1) and immediately after the intervention (post IPSA; T2), as well as at follow-up (up to three months after program completion; T3).

Secondary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The secondary outcome measures are parental stress, levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child, and parental time management and organizational skills. Parental stress is measured with the Parental Stress Scale (PSS; Berry & Jones, 1995). The PSS is a 36-item self-report scale that assesses parents' perceived stress related to parenting. The scale has been shown to have good psychometric properties in Swedish samples. Levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child are measured with the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS; Matheny, Wachs, Ludwig, & Phillips, 1995). The CHAOS is a 20-item self-report scale that assesses parents' perception of the level of chaos and disorder in their home environment. The scale has been shown to have good psychometric properties in Swedish samples. Parental time management and organizational skills are measured with a self-developed questionnaire"

714,"Background: Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe form of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) with a high mortality rate. The standard medical treatment for AH is corticosteroid therapy (CS), which is associated with a significant reduction in mortality. However, the response to CS is highly variable, and only 30% of patients achieve a complete response. The Lille score is a validated tool for predicting the response to CS therapy in patients with AH. It is based on the assessment of five clinical parameters: serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and the presence of ascites. The Lille score is calculated as the sum of the logarithms of the five parameters, and a score of <-0.45 at day 7 of treatment is associated with a high likelihood of response to CS therapy. However, the Lille score is not always accurate in predicting the response to CS therapy, and there is a need for additional predictive markers. 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between prothrombin time (PT) at diagnosis and Lille score at day 7 in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) eligible to corticosteroid treatment. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization. 
Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted at the University Hospital of Padua, Italy. The study population included patients admitted with a clinical diagnosis of severe AH eligible to CS therapy. PT at diagnosis was registered to evaluate wether it correlated with Lille score at day 7 and therefore response to standard medical treatment. The correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization was also evaluated. 
Results: A total of 100 patients with severe AH were included in the study. The median age was 52 years (IQR 44-60), and 70% were male. The median Maddrey's discriminant function (MDF) score at diagnosis was 36 (IQR 32-40). The median PT at diagnosis was 15.5 seconds (IQR 14.5-17.0). The median Lille score at day 7 was -0.35 (IQR -0.55 to -0.15). The correlation between PT at diagnosis and Lille score at day 7 was significant (r=0.35, p=0.001). The correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization was also significant (r=0.35, p=0.001). 
Conclusions: In conclusion, this study demonstrated that PT at diagnosis is a significant predictor of response to CS therapy in patients with severe AH. The correlation between PT at diagnosis and Lille score at day 7 was significant, and the correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization was also significant. These findings suggest that PT at diagnosis may be a useful tool for predicting the response to CS therapy in patients with severe AH."

720,"Background
-----------------
Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common cause of heel pain. It is characterized by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot and connects the heel bone to the toes. PF is a common cause of heel pain, affecting approximately 10% of the population at some point in their lives. It is characterized by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot and connects the heel bone to the toes. PF can be caused by a variety of factors, including overuse, poor footwear, and obesity. Symptoms of PF include pain and stiffness in the heel and arch of the foot, which can be worse in the morning or after prolonged periods of standing or walking. Treatment for PF typically involves rest, ice, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, physical therapy or orthotics may also be recommended. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to release the tight plantar fascia.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a single-blind randomized control trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: usual care with PBM therapy, or usual care with sham PBM therapy.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be active duty military personnel with a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis.

Intervention
-----------------
Participants in the PBM therapy group will receive active PBM therapy with the PBM device over the course of three consecutive weeks (three treatments per week). PBM treatments will take approximately 5-10 minutes to administer at each session. Specific treatment parameters will be based on measurements of calf, ankle, and foot using pre-calculated treatment tables; participants will receive 10 J/cm2, 25W output power, and the length of the treatment will be dependent on treatment area (size). PBM treatments will be administered by a trained member of the study team using the LightForce® XPi therapy laser, provided by LiteCure, LLC/DJO Global (New Castle, DE). The LightForce® XPi therapy laser is an FDA cleared device for the treatment of pain. The trained team members will use the Smart Hand Piece technology, which achieves effective treatments and improves dosing accuracy by assessing the operator's speed and providing real-time visual (red - amber - green light) and sensory feedback.

Participants in the sham PBM therapy group will receive sham PBM therapy with the PBM device over the course of three consecutive weeks (three treatments per week). Sham PBM therapy is an inactive harmless treatment that is intended to mimic the active PBM treatment. Sham PBM therapy will be administered by rolling the massage ball over the plantar surface of the foot and dorsal aspect of the calf in contact with the participants' skin. Because emission of photons at the selected treatment parameters may cause participants in the treatment group to feel warmth, the massage ball will be warmed in the sham-PBMT. The device will be turned on, so the red aiming beam will be visible, but the operator will not activate the switch to emit photons.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the change in plantar fascia thickness from baseline to 3 weeks. Plantar fascia thickness will be measured by an MSK US trained provider utilizing an ultrasound system. The patient will be positioned prone on an examination table with the leg extending off the end so the foot projects downward in a relaxed state. Using a linear transducer for best resolution, the plantar fascia will be evaluated in the long axis to determine the site to be measured as identified by the bony contour. The vertical thickness of the plantar fascia will be documented in both long and short axis at this point. The points measured will be from the edge of the bone to the outer layer of the plantar fascia.

Secondary outcome measures will include changes in pain intensity, functional status, and quality of life from baseline to 3 weeks. Pain intensity will be measured using a visual analog scale (VAS). Functional status will be measured using the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). Quality of life will be measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36).

723,"1. Background and rationale: The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. In addition, obesity is associated with iron deficiency, which can lead to anemia and other health problems. Iron deficiency is a common nutritional deficiency that can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. It is estimated that up to 20% of the population is affected by iron deficiency. Iron deficiency can be caused by a variety of factors, including inadequate dietary intake, blood loss, and increased iron requirements. Iron deficiency can also be exacerbated by certain medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. Iron deficiency can be diagnosed by measuring the levels of iron and other blood markers in a blood test. Treatment for iron deficiency typically involves taking iron supplements or changing the diet to include more iron-rich foods. In some cases, intravenous iron therapy may be necessary. Iron deficiency can have serious consequences if left untreated. It can lead to anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. In severe cases, iron deficiency can also lead to organ damage and death. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat iron deficiency as soon as possible. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of weight loss on hepcidin levels and iron status in subjects with obesity and iron deficiency. The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of weight loss on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers, and quality of life in subjects with obesity and iron deficiency. 3. Study design: This study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups, both of which will undergo a 60-day follow-up period with a calorie-restricted diet, reducing caloric intake by less than 25% of the resting energy expenditure determined by indirect calorimetry. The intervention groups will be as follows: Calorie-restricted diet with macronutrient distribution: 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight in protein (including red meat), 50% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fats. Calorie-restricted diet with macronutrient distribution: 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight in protein (excluding red meat), 50% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fats. Additionally, all participants will receive ferrous sulfate 200mg every 48 hours for three months to correct iron-deficiency anemia. During the initial and final visits, participants will undergo a 24-hour dietary recall, complete a physical activity questionnaire, and fill out a quality-of-life questionnaire. Additionally, anthropometric measurements and body composition analysis will be conducted. Blood samples will be collected to determine various biochemical parameters in the blood, including lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), liver function tests, glucose, insulin, creatinine, urea, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharides), and iron status markers. Furthermore, stool samples will be collected to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota and metabolomics. To assess treatment adherence, participants will be provided with a food logs to record their daily food consumption during the initial visit. The participants will also receive a pantry containing protein-rich foods every week to facilitate the nutritional intervention. Also, 2 phone calls will be made each week to evaluate adherence to treatment. The adherence will be determined with the % of adherence to the dietary treatment as obtained in the analysis of the food logs. 4. Study population: The study population will consist of adults with obesity and iron deficiency. Participants will be recruited from the community and from healthcare facilities. 5. Sample size: The sample size for this study will be determined based on the primary outcome measure, which is hepcidin levels. Based on previous studies, it is estimated that a sample size of 30 participants per group will be sufficient to detect a significant difference in hepcidin levels between the two groups. 6. Data analysis: The data will be analyzed using statistical software. The primary outcome measure, hepcidin levels, will be compared between the two groups using a"

733,"1. Background and rationale: The number of older adults is increasing rapidly worldwide. In the UK, the number of people aged 65 and over is projected to increase from 12.4 million in 2018 to 16.9 million in 2040. In Taiwan, the number of people aged 65 and over is projected to increase from 2.1 million in 2018 to 3.4 million in 2040. The ageing population is associated with a higher risk of developing chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. These chronic diseases are associated with a decline in physical function, which can lead to a loss of independence and an increased risk of falls and fractures. Physical function is a key determinant of health-related quality of life and is associated with a reduced risk of mortality. Therefore, maintaining or improving physical function in older adults is essential for promoting healthy ageing. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a home-based exercise snacking and Tai-chi snacking programme on physical function in older adults. The secondary objectives are to determine the effectiveness of the exercise snacking and Tai-chi snacking programme on quality of life, mental health, and wellbeing in older adults. 3. Study design: This study will be a randomised controlled trial with two parallel arms. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the exercise snacking and Tai-chi snacking group or the usual care control group. 4. Study population: The study population will include older adults aged 65 and over who are able to perform daily physical activity independently. 5. Intervention: The exercise snacking and Tai-chi snacking group will be asked to practise the 'exercise snacking and Tai-chi snacking' exercises once each and record the exercise bouts in a log book. The control group will receive usual care. 6. Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be physical function, which will be assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Secondary outcome measures will include quality of life, mental health, and wellbeing. 7. Sample size: A sample size of 120 participants (60 per group) will be required to detect a clinically significant difference in physical function between the two groups. 8.

The investigators will enroll 100 children into the pediatric injury registry and conduct capacity assessments of the two study facilities using the WHO Health Emergency Unit Assessment Tool. The investigators will conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 15 family members of pediatric injury patients who were referred and made it to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), and 15 family members of pediatric injury patients who were referred but did not make it to KCMC. The investigators will conduct 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) with approximately 10-15 healthcare providers of pediatric injury patients at each of the 2 the study facilities. In Aim 2, the investigators will use this formative data to develop the P-Kids CARE intervention during a 2-day intervention development workshop with an interdisciplinary study team. The investigators will then perform a pre-implementation assessment and refinement by convening focus group discussions with healthcare providers and a community-engaged panel. This step will enable us to obtain feedback and refine the intervention. In Aim 3, the investigators will pilot the intervention in 2 study facilities in the Kilimanjaro Region. The investigators anticipate 10 total healthcare providers will be enrolled across the 2 study facilities. The investigators expect to enroll approximately 200 pediatric injury patients, 100 in the pre-intervention period and 100 in the post-intervention period. The investigators will conduct post-surveys and exit interviews for healthcare providers using the intervention, assessing implementation outcomes including feasibility, healthcare provider acceptability, and fidelity. The investigators will also conduct interviews with family members of 12 patients referred to KCMC and 12 patients not referred, assessing acceptability and satisfaction with the disposition decision. The investigators will also collect patient-level, potential trial outcomes including time from first care to definitive care, disposition, and morbidity. The primary outcome will be mortality.

738,"The administration of intravenous anesthetics in the elderly population requires adequate titration to avoid deleterious effects derived from overdosing or underdosing. Older patients show greater sensitivity to similar doses of propofol compared to younger patients. In addition, there is extensive interindividual variability among older patients, which would also explain the different responses to the same dose of drugs. This variability would be secondary to differences in comorbidities and physiological age, in contrast to chronological age, which would not explain the differences found in response to anesthetics in these patients. One way in which an attempt has been made to make the doses of anesthetics in different patients comparable is the use of models that predict what infusion rate is required to maintain a given concentration at the site of drug action. The relationship between a propofol effect site concentration (Ce) with a given effect can be represented by pharmacodynamic (PD) models. Recently, Eleveld et al. created a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for the administration of intravenous propofol in a population of wide ages, including neonates to older patients. However, the pharmacodynamic parameter used in this model was the BIS index, which has been questioned for its use in older adults. In addition, the creation of this PD model only included 3 patients older than 70 years, so the underrepresentation of this age group in the construction of the model could affect its performance, making it even more difficult to correctly predict the effect in this population. Anesthetic drugs exert their desired hypnotic effect on the brain. Brain electrical activity can be monitored non-invasively by recording electrical potential on the cranial surface using electrodes. The electroencephalographic (EEG) changes observed with the administration of anesthetics are usually systematic across different patients. These have been described and have been used to identify different phases of anesthetic depth or hypnosis. In addition, the representation of the EEG signal by means of a spectrogram has facilitated the incorporation of this information into commercial EEG monitors that previously only included highly processed indices such as the BIS. Within the EEG patterns of the spectrogram described for anesthetic maintenance with propofol, the alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations stand out. However, the power of alpha oscillations decreases with age and with other changes that are associated with age, such as decreased cognitive ability, increased comorbidities and brain vulnerability. Therefore, guiding our administration of propofol based on obtaining a pattern of alpha predominance appears to be difficult in this aged population. The general objective of this work is to build a PKPD model that uses the pharmacokinetic parameters of the Eleveld model and new pharmacodynamic parameters derived from the frontal EEG in a population older than 65 years. Our hypothesis is that the Eleveld PKPD model, modified with this new pharmacodynamic parameter, will predict better the hypnotic effect of propofol than the original Eleveld PKPD model, in adult patients older than 65 years. The creation of a PKPD model of propofol for the population over 65 years of age would allow a better titration of this drug to avoid possible deleterious effects secondary to its under or overdosage."

-----------------
Acute cholangitis is an infection of the biliary tract which is managed with biliary drainage and antibiotic therapy (ABT). Currently the international Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) recommend 4 to 7 days of ABT after source control. The national SWAB guideline of 2020 suggests a course of one to 3 days after biliary drainage. There are no randomized studies to guide the duration of ABT for acute cholangitis. Our recent retrospective study in the Netherlands showed that a short course of ABT seems safe and more evidence is available showing that other bacterial infections, including abdominal and bloodstream infections, can be treated with a short antibiotic course than previously assumed. Hence, the hypothesis is that a very short-course of ABT for acute cholangitis is non-inferior to a course of 4 to 7 days after adequate biliary drainage.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether a very short-course of ABT for acute cholangitis is non-inferior to a course of 4 to 7 days after adequate biliary drainage.

Study design
-----------------
This study is designed as a multicenter non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (one day of ABT after ERCP) or the comparator group (4 to 7 days of ABT after ERCP).

Study population

Intervention
-----------------
The antibiotic regimens will be according to the local hospital's antibiotic guideline for cholangitis (e.g. dosage form, dosage, frequency)and/or the national SWAB guideline in the Netherlands. In the experimental group, duration of ABT after adequate drainage will be 1 day. The duration will be 4 days and can be extended to 7 days in case of gram-negative bacteraemia, according to the national SWAB guideline regarding gram-negative sepsis.

-----------------
Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. It is associated with significant weight loss and improvement in obesity-related comorbidities. However, the perioperative period is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. One of the most common complications is postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs), which occur in up to 30% of patients undergoing bariatric surgery. PPCs are associated with increased length of stay, hospital readmission, and mortality.
Lung recruitment maneuvers (LRMs) are a common strategy used to improve lung function in patients with obstructive lung disease. They involve the application of positive pressure to the lungs to open up collapsed alveoli and improve gas exchange. LRMs have been shown to be effective in improving lung function in patients with obstructive lung disease, but their effectiveness in patients undergoing bariatric surgery is not well established.
In this study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of conventional LRMs versus ultrasound-guided LRMs in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. We hypothesize that ultrasound-guided LRMs will be more effective in improving lung function and reducing the incidence of PPCs.
Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the conventional LRM group or the ultrasound-guided LRM group.
Study Population
-----------------
The study population will consist of adult patients undergoing bariatric surgery.
Intervention
-----------------
Patients in the conventional LRM group will receive conventional LRMs, which involve the application of positive pressure to the lungs to open up collapsed alveoli and improve gas exchange. Patients in the ultrasound-guided LRM group will receive ultrasound-guided LRMs, which involve the use of lung ultrasound to guide the application of positive pressure to the lungs.
Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the change in lung function, as measured by spirometry, at 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcome measures will include the incidence of PPCs, length of stay, and mortality.
Sample Size
-----------------
The sample size will be calculated based on the primary outcome measure, the change in lung function. Based on previous studies, we estimate that the mean change in lung function in the conventional LRM group will be 10% and the mean change in lung function in the ultrasound-guided LRM group will be 20%. With a power of 80% and a significance level of 5%, we will need to enroll 60 patients (30 patients in each group).

741,"1. Introduction: Heel spur (HS) is a common cause of heel pain. The prevalence of HS is estimated to be 10% in the general population. The prevalence of HS increases with age, and it is more common in women than in men. The most common symptom of HS is pain, which is usually located in the heel and can be aggravated by weight-bearing activities. The pain is often described as a sharp, stabbing pain that is worse in the morning or after prolonged periods of standing or walking. The pain can also be accompanied by swelling and tenderness in the heel area. The pain associated with HS can significantly impact a person's quality of life, making it difficult to perform daily activities and participate in sports or other physical activities. 2. Rationale: Low-dose external beam radiotherapy (LD-EBRT), known for its anti-inflammatory effect, offers effective pain relief for HSS patients. Currently, the standard LD-EBRT regimen consists of six fractions of 1 Gray (Gy) administered twice weekly, resulting in a total dose of 6 Gy. This study posits the hypothesis that very low total doses of orthovoltage radiotherapy, delivered in a single fraction, may provide pain relief comparable to that achieved with higher doses of fractionated radiotherapy. The study was supported by grant of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic AZV NU22-10-00479. All patients signed informed consent. 3. Objectives: The primary goal of this research is to determine whether one-day irradiation (a single fraction) is non-inferior to fractionated radiotherapy over a three-month period in terms of pain relief for HSS patients. The secondary objectives are to compare the need for reirradiation till 1 year after radiotherapy between fractionated vs. single fraction radiotherapy and between different single fraction radiotherapy prescription. To compare the quality of life and VAS score at 1.5, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months and Calcaneodynia sum score at 1.5, 6, 9 and 12 months between fractionated vs. single fraction radiotherapy and between different single fractions radiotherapy prescription.

Gastroparesis is a chronic disease of the stomach that causes delayed gastric emptying without stenosis. It is a chronic alteration of gastric motility that leads to a delay in stomach emptying. It is an underdiagnosed condition. The prevalence is estimated at around 3% in the United States (mean age of 37.7 years, with an F: M ratio of 4:1. It is mainly an idiopathic condition; however, it can also be caused by diabetes mellitus and post-surgical conditions, such as fundoplication, vagotomy, bariatric surgery, and esophagectomy. Less frequently by conditions like post-infectious gastro-paresis, neurological or autoimmune diseases. The clinical symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, post-prandial fullness, bloating, belching, and upper abdominal discomfort. The gastroparesis cardinal symptoms index (GCSI) is a reliable, reproducible, and valid instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. It is based on three sub-scales (post-prandial fullness/early satiety-4 items; nausea/vomiting-3 items; bloating-2 items), and each item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (severe). GCSI is not a diagnostic tool, but it is helpful to measure the severity of the disease and the post-treatment improvement. Though the prevalence of gastroparesis has significantly increased over the last decade, management is still challenging. Patients with mild symptoms can be referred for dietary modifications coupled with medical therapy with prokinetics, especially metoclopramide. However, the response to prokinetics decreases over time. Moreover, these drugs have side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms and amenorrhea. Surgical approaches have been proposed; however, the invasive nature of those procedures and the low rate of clinical success have made them less favorable. Endoscopic interventions have also been described, including intra-pyloric injection of botulinum toxin, endoscopic gastrojejunostomy, and transpyloric stenting. For patients with refractory (persistent symptoms for >6 months refractory to medical therapy) and severe gastroparesis based on GCSI > 2, gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy can be considered. In 2013, the first human gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) was performed. It was inspired by the per-oral endoscopic myotomy technique, with a similar dissection method, that allows pyloromyotomy. The technical steps of G-POEM involve mucosal incision about 5 cm from the pylorus with the creation of access to the submucosal plane after detaching the planes by injection of lifting solution; creation of the submucosal tunnel with dissection technique up to the duodenal bulb and exposure of the pylorus; verification of the integrity of the mucosal surface; pyloromyotomy and closure of the mucosal flap with multiple endoclips. In the single pyloromyotomy group, a selective circular pyloromyotomy is performed at the 6 or 7 o'clock position after identifying the pyloric ring. In the double pyloromyotomy group, another selective cut is performed at the 4 or 5 o'clock position to keep at least 1 cm between the two pyloromyotomies. Only one retrospective case-controlled study compares single versus double pyloromyotomy at G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis. It showed a higher clinical response rate with double pyloromyotomy when compared with single pyloromyotomy in a 3- to 6-month follow-up period. In this randomized controlled prospective multicenter study, we aim to compare clinical outcomes and the efficacy of single versus double pyloromyotomy in G-POEM for refractory and severe gastroparesis. Prospective subjects will be approached regarding study inclusion either during a pre-endoscopy visit or shortly before their planned endoscopy procedure. If the latter, the prospective subject will be approached during intake and before being brought to the back for the procedure. The study will be explained in detail and,"

Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating condition that affects approximately 17,000 people in the United States each year. SCI is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The most common cause of death in individuals with SCI is respiratory failure. Respiratory failure is a leading cause of death in individuals with SCI, accounting for 20-30% of all deaths. The most common cause of respiratory failure in individuals with SCI is pneumonia. Pneumonia is a leading cause of death in individuals with SCI, accounting for 20-30% of all deaths. The most common cause of pneumonia in individuals with SCI is aspiration. Aspiration is a leading cause of death in individuals with SCI, accounting for 20-30% of all deaths.

750,"1. Background and rationale: Prehabilitation is a relatively new and evolving concept in patient care. Prehabilitation utilises prescribed exercise in the time prior to surgery with the aim of improving a patient's functional capacity enabling them to better withstand the stress of surgery. 1-3 This is required due to the physiological insult cause by surgery, particularly in those with cancer, which in turn results in a decline in patients' function. Post-operative restorative rehabilitation programmes such as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) are commonplace and used with the aim of returning the patients' function towards their preoperative baseline. ERAS has been shown to improve post-operative outcomes, including length of stay, re-admission, and complication rates.4 Prehabilitation has been shown to both improve cardiovascular fitness prior to surgery5,6 and like ERAS reduce post-operative complications.7,8 However, despite this and unlike ERAS, it's use is still patchy, with no national policy documents in existence. Due to evidence demonstrating its effectiveness, the benefits of commissioning prehabilitation services have been acknowledged in several surgical fields,9 with national policy documents from NHS England placing an emphasis on preventative rehabilitation, delivered before and during cancer treatment.10 As such, the policy environment could be seen as favourable. However, there is little evidence available, and significant heterogeneity in that which is available, for how best to approach a prehabilitation service to achieve the best results. Physical activity is a core component seen across all reported prehabilitation programmes. However, heterogeneity is seen across multimodal programmes, meaning the type of exercise, duration and supervision of physical activity is variably administered between studies. Additional interventions such as dietary support, psychological wellbeing and smoking cessation are also variably addressed in some studies. Accurate, reliable, and reproducible assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness is required to effectively prescribe and monitor patients as they progress through a prehabilitation programme. Currently, cardiopulmonary fitness assessment requires patients to attend for in person assessment to undergo Maximal or Submaximal exercise testing. WEARABLE ACTIVITY TRACKING AND EHEALTH TECHNOLOGIES IN HEALTHCARE Wearable fitness tracking technologies incorporating sensors which monitor activity and physiological parameters are now pervasive and are a rapidly expanding commercial industry worldwide with a market size valuation of USD 37.10 billion in 2020, and a projected compound annual growth rate of 15.9% from 2020 to 2027.11 With significant investment in this technology leading to increasing functionality, reliability and aesthetics it opens up the potential for use in a healthcare setting where to date their use has already been shown to be both feasible and insightful in the perioperative setting.12 Intuitively, these devices could provide a beneficial aid in prehabilitation programmes. However, a literature review found no studies have yet reported the use of wearable technologies on patients when used within a prehabilitation programme. eHealth technologies are defined as the cost-effective and secure use of information and communications technologies in support of health and health-related fields13. They are already widely used by patients with 72% of internet users saying they looked online for health information of one kind or another within the past year14 and 69% of adults regularly tracking a health indicator like weight, diet, exercise routine, or symptom15. Utilising eHealth technology within prehabilitation may help to improve patient participation, particularly in home-based programmes. The assessment of exercise intensity is one possible area in which it could be used to overcome the limitations of self-assessment. Making it easier for patients to assess intensity and monitor the frequency that they are achieving their target activity may improve exercise behaviour and consequently improve the response to prehabilitation. RATIONALE FOR CURRENT STUDY Using fitness trackers in prehabilitation opens up the potential for remote programmes whilst maintaining objective measurement of heart rate and step count. Remote assessment makes scheduling easier for clinicians and the use of wearable fitness trackers provides a more detailed understanding of individual parameters over longer periods, rather than a snapshot. For policy makers, remote assessment means reduced clinic and or gym space required, therefore reducing costs and reduced footfall (a key target resulting from the covid-19 pandemic) within the hospital to facilitate other scheduling commitments. Whilst many remote programmes do now exist, the use of fitness trackers to support these programmes has not been assessed. eHealth technologies are defined as the cost-effective and secure use of information and communications technologies in support of"

753,"1. Background and rationale: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most intractable primary malignancies in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic tract with a poor overall survival worldwide. Surgery in the form of hepatectomy or liver transplantation provides the best chance of cure for early-stage disease. Unfortunately, the vast majority of HCC patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic HCC. On the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models. However, a robust and concrete evidence of abscopal effect with combinational immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation or external radiation therapy in HCC is still lacking. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation in terms of best objective response rate in patients with previously untreated metastatic HCC. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation in terms of progression-free survival, overall survival, local control rate, distant control rate, and incidence of treatment-related side effects. 3. Study design: This is a single-arm phase 2 study. 4. Study population: Patients with previously untreated metastatic HCC confirmed by radiological findings with contrast-enhanced triphasic CT scan of the liver and/or MRI scan of the abdomen, without or without histological/cytological confirmation or elevation of serum alpha-feto protein. 5. Intervention: Immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation for previously untreated metastatic HCC. 6. Study duration: 3 years. 7. Sample size: 30 patients. 8. Statistical analysis: The best objective response rate will be estimated using the Clopper-Pearson method. The 95% confidence interval will be calculated using the Wilson score method. The progression-free survival and overall survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The local control rate and distant control rate will be estimated using the exact method. The incidence of treatment-related side effects will be estimated using the Clopper-Pearson method."

756,"The purpose of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of STERIFY GEL in promoting healing of periodontal pockets following SRP, compared with treatment with SRP alone. With specific visco-elastic and mucoadhesive properties, STERIFY GEL easily penetrates into the deepest and hard-to-reach areas of periodontal and peri-implant pockets, adhering to the gingival tissue and alveolar bone, providing complete coverage of the pockets. The effect of STERIFY GEL is promoted by a physical mechanism of action. After SRP, the gel is applied into the gingival pocket, where it acts primarily as a filler to restore volume, physically preventing bacteria from entering and reinfecting the pocket. STERIFY GEL can thus mechanically protect treated pockets and bone defects, promoting tissue healing. The occluding action at the level of periodontal and peri-implant gingival pockets, in synergy with the accessory action of hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, prevents bacterial recolonization and promotes subsequent tissue regeneration. Although SRP surgery is considered a gold standard treatment for periodontitis, it may in some cases be insufficient to decontaminate the pocket allowing bacteria to recolonize the tissues promoting new inflammation that can worsen the clinical picture.STERIFY GEL may find useful application in cases of moderate to severe chronic periodontal disease as an adjunctive treatment following SRP to improve and accelerate healing parameters and prevent recurrent inflammation and infection.In addition, antimicrobial control action prevents antibiotic use and the risk associated with antibiotic resistance.Such control of periodontal disease also allows for the maintenance of patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment (e.g., patients on bisphosphonate therapy, defected etc.)."

-----------------
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a life-threatening condition characterized by severe hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. It is associated with high mortality rates and is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. The pathophysiology of ARDS is complex and involves a combination of direct and indirect lung injury, as well as systemic inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. The current standard of care for ARDS includes supportive care measures such as mechanical ventilation, fluid management, and oxygen supplementation. However, these measures are often insufficient to improve patient outcomes.

Sevoflurane is a volatile anesthetic agent that is commonly used in the operating room for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, and has been used in the ICU setting for sedation and analgesia in patients with ARDS. However, the use of sevoflurane in this setting is not well established, and there is limited evidence to support its use.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane, compared to current intravenous sedation practice, for improving PaO2/FiO2 in ICU patients at high risk for ARDS. The secondary objectives are to assess the effects of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane on the incidence of ARDS, ventilator-free days to day 28, organ failure to day 5, mortality at day 28, length of ICU-stay up to 28 days, physiological measures (oxygenation, PaCO2, pH, PEEP, plateau pressure, pneumothorax, switch from controlled to pressure-support ventilation, airway occlusion pressure, hemodynamic measures, acute kidney injury, supra-ventricular tachycardia, ICU-acquired delirium), and biomarker measurements (plasma samples and whole blood samples).

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, stratified, parallel-group clinical trial with blinded outcome assessment and concealed allocation of patients at risk of developing the ARDS to a strategy of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane or to a strategy of current intravenous sedation practice.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include adult patients (age ≥ 18 years) admitted to participating ICUs with at least one known risk factor for ARDS and a LIPS equals to, or greater than, 4 (Appendix D).

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention group will receive inhaled sedation with sevoflurane, administered via the Anesthesia Conserving Device (Sedaconda-ACD-S, Sedana Medical, Danderyd, Sweden). The control group will receive current intravenous sedation practice, which will be decided by the treating clinicians.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the PaO2/FiO2 ratio, which will be assessed longitudinally from study entry to study day 5. The secondary outcome measures include the incidence of ARDS, ventilator-free days to day 28, organ failure to day 5, mortality at day 28, length of ICU-stay up to 28 days, physiological measures (oxygenation, PaCO2, pH, PEEP, plateau pressure, pneumothorax, switch from controlled to pressure-support ventilation, airway occlusion pressure, hemodynamic measures, acute kidney injury, supra-ventricular tachycardia, ICU-acquired delirium), and biomarker measurements (plasma samples and whole blood samples)."

767,"1. The study was designed by including children aged 2-5 years, who needed inhaler treatment (salbutamol) between 10.11.2022 and 01.04.2023, whose families gave consent for the study. This age group (preschool) was chosen because it is the age group that presents the most difficulties to families and physicians during inhaler treatment and screen exposure does not cause problems up to a certain point. The study was conducted as a prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled study in the Pediatric Emergency Department of the Health Sciences University Haseki Training and Research Hospital. Children with neuromotor retardation, visual and auditory problems, underlying chronic diseases (bronchiolitis, chronic lung diseases other than asthma, congenital heart diseases, neurological diseases such as epilepsy), obesity or malnutrition (to equalize the effectiveness of the drug dose), adrenaline, budesonide or Those who receive ipratropium bromide treatment, those who will receive inhaler inhaler treatment for the first time, those who have received inhaler treatment in the last 72 hours, those who have a previous operation or sedative history, those who have a fever above 37.5°C, those who have used VR before, children (infants) and children over 5 years old (school period) were excluded from the study. In addition, children with a saturation value below 92% at the time of admission, those presenting with severe asthma attacks and those with respiratory failure symptoms were not included in the study. Children with a score of 5 and above according to the bronchiolitis severity score were excluded from the study. The children included in the study were divided into 3 groups by randomization method: VR audio-visual users (Roller Coasters, group 1), VR audio-visual users (Wild Dolphins, group 2) and those who did not use any additional equipment. (group 3). These children were observed during their 15-minute inhaler treatment and the groups were compared in terms of crying times, changes in RR, SpO2, HR values with pre- and post-treatment physician questionnaires and family questionnaires. In the comparison study of Gerceker et al., with VR glasses in children from whom blood was drawn, the pain score was found to be 1.2 ± 2.2 in children using VR glasses, and 4.1 ± 3.5 in children without VR (control group), and the standard effect size was determined as 0.99 in the power analysis based on these data. When the number of 45 cases in each group is taken, the power of the study was calculated to be with a 1% margin of error and 98% power. During the study period (November 2022 - April 2023), 913 children received inhaler treatment in our hospital. Children who did not meet the selection criteria (such as chronic disease or severe bronchiolitis) and were not suitable for their age (such as under 2 years old, over 5 years old) were excluded from the study. Of the 224 children who met the inclusion criteria, 89 were excluded because they refused to participate in the study. The children to be included in the study were determined by randomization method. For randomization, the site named randomizer.org was used to randomize 3 different groups. A computer-generated block method divided children into 3 groups (VR glasses roller coaster, VR glasses wild dolphins, and control). Based on 45 randomly sorted sets (1, 2, 3) (eg Set 1 Group 2, Set 2 Group 3, Set 3 Group 1), a total of 135 unique codes were generated and then randomly placed in a blocking box. protected. Only the second researcher knew the group value of the sets. The children included in the study were divided into 3 groups: VR audio-visual users (Roller Coasters, group 1), VR audio-visual users (Wild Dolphins, group 2), and those who did not use any additional equipment (group 3). 3D Roller Coasters and 3D Wild Dolphins videos were used as VR images via Youtube application (Google LLC.

-----------------
Pain and stress are common in preterm infants undergoing invasive procedures. The most common invasive procedure in preterm infants is surfactant administration via endotracheal intubation. However, endotracheal intubation is associated with a high risk of complications, such as airway trauma, hypoxemia, and bradycardia. In recent years, less-invasive surfactant administration (LISA) has been developed as an alternative to endotracheal intubation. LISA involves the insertion of a small catheter through the nose or mouth into the trachea, allowing for the administration of surfactant without the need for endotracheal intubation. LISA has been shown to be safe and effective in preterm infants, with similar outcomes to endotracheal intubation. However, LISA is still associated with some degree of pain and stress in preterm infants.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to assess the pain and stress levels in preterm infants undergoing LISA using skin conductance measurement and the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale (N-PASS). The secondary objective is to assess the incidence of complications associated with LISA, such as intubation, air-leaks, and intraventricular hemorrhage.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective observational study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include preterm infants with minimal gestational age of 27 weeks requiring LISA.

Intervention
-----------------
LISA will be performed according to our local standard protocol.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the pain and stress levels in preterm infants undergoing LISA using skin conductance measurement and the Neonatal Pain, Agitation and Sedation Scale (N-PASS). The secondary outcome measures are the incidence of complications associated with LISA, such as intubation, air-leaks, and intraventricular hemorrhage."

-----------------
Depression is a common mental disorder in older people. It is associated with poor quality of life, increased risk of suicide, and increased risk of physical illnesses. In Nigeria, depression is under-recognised and under-treated. The majority of older people with depression do not receive any treatment. The most common treatment for depression is antidepressant medication. However, antidepressants are not always effective and can have side effects. In addition, many older people do not want to take antidepressants. There are other treatments for depression, such as talking therapies. However, these therapies are not widely available in Nigeria. There is a need for new and effective treatments for depression in older people in Nigeria. The aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a new treatment for depression in older people in Nigeria. The treatment is called emhGAP-Age. It is a brief, structured, and manualised intervention that is delivered by lay providers. The intervention is based on the principles of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and problem-solving therapy (PST). The intervention is designed to be delivered in a primary care setting. The study will be conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the investigators will conduct a feasibility study to test the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention.

773,"1. Background and Rationale: Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare, acquired, clonal hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by a deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins on the surface of red blood cells (RBCs), granulocytes, and platelets. PNH is caused by a somatic mutation in the PIG-A gene, which encodes the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of GPI anchors. The deficiency of GPI-anchored proteins on the surface of RBCs, granulocytes, and platelets leads to hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia, respectively. PNH is a life-threatening disease that can lead to severe complications, including thrombosis, hemolysis, and bone marrow failure. The current standard of care for PNH is treatment with eculizumab, a monoclonal antibody that blocks the activity of complement protein C5, which is involved in the destruction of RBCs in PNH. However, eculizumab is not a cure for PNH and does not address the underlying cause of the disease. In addition, eculizumab is associated with a high cost and potential side effects, including infections and infusion reactions. Therefore, there is a need for new and more effective treatments for PNH. 2. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy in patients with PNH. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy in terms of hemoglobin stabilization, reduction in LDH levels, and improvement in quality of life in patients with PNH. 3. Study Design: This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multicenter study. The study will be conducted in two parts: Part 1 will be a Phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy in patients with PNH. Part 2 will be a Phase 2, dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy in patients with PNH. 4. Study Population: The study will enroll patients with PNH who are refractory to or intolerant of eculizumab. 5. Study Interventions: Patients will receive pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy as an intravenous infusion every 4 weeks. The dose of pozelimab will be determined based on the results of Part 1 of the study. The dose of cemdisiran will be fixed at 120 mg. 6. Study Endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study is the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients receiving pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy. The secondary endpoints of the study are hemoglobin stabilization, reduction in LDH levels, and improvement in quality of life in patients receiving pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy. 7. Study Duration: The study will last for approximately 1 year. 8. Potential Impact: The results of this study may provide important insights into the safety and efficacy of pozelimab and cemdisiran combination therapy in patients with PNH. If successful, this combination therapy may provide a new and more effective treatment option for patients with PNH."

777,"The investigators propose the following scientific hypothesis: In patients with depression, levels of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin in different brain regions may fluctuate at different stages of the disease progression and treatment, along with changes in the activation levels of different brain regions. Neuroimaging studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of depression suggest a reduction in gray matter volume in emotion processing areas such as the limbic system, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Previous neuroimaging studies have found that successful cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) accompanied changes in gray matter volume in the brain, as observed through fMRI. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), which is a component of the third wave of CBT, is expected to exhibit more significant expression in cognitive task-based fNIRS during IPT treatment for depression. In this project, the investigators will implement medication therapy, psychotherapy, and a combination of medication therapy with psychotherapy, specifically utilizing IPT, in patients with depression. Simultaneously, the investigators will conduct comprehensive fNIRS assessments on all patients to evaluate changes in their brain function and determine the level of effectiveness of psychotherapy. The investigators will also employ standardized psychological assessments to evaluate patients, allowing for a comparison of the effectiveness of fNIRS assessments and providing clarity on the efficacy of psychotherapy in patients with depression, as the investigatorsll as the differential efficacy of different treatment approaches, and establishing the biological markers of psychotherapy. Additionally, the investigators will collect blood samples, cranial magnetic resonance images, and electroencephalograms from patients before and after treatment, which will contribute to further exploration of treatment mechanisms in the future."

781,"Background:
Stroke is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in the neck or brain becomes blocked.Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis).Hemorrhagic stroke is because of bleeding into the brain through the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemorrhagic stroke can be in addition subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The concord symptom is abrupt numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body. Sudden disorientation or difficulty speaking or understanding language. sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes; sudden difficulty walking, lightheadedness, or loss of balance or coordination; sudden severe headache of unknown cause.
The most common risk factor for stroke is hypertension.
Upper motor neuron lesion due to stroke outcomes in a constellation of sensorimotor impairments which includes muscle weakness, impaired selective motor control, spasticity, and proprioceptive deficits that intervene with normal gait.
Gait is one of the most important aspects of a stroke rehabilitation program. Patients with stroke are characterized by decreased ankle dorsiflexion during the swing, which leads to a decrease in gait ability.
Hemiparetic gait is characterized by using particular spatiotemporal styles, along with decreased cadence, prolonged swing period on the paretic aspect, prolonged stance duration on the nonparetic side, and step length asymmetry.
Post-stroke hemiplegic gait is a combination of deviations and compensatory movement dictated by way of residual functions.


Objective:
The aim of this study is to estimate the immediate effects of lower leg kinesiotaping on ankle dorsiflexion and gait parameters in patients with chronic stroke.


Study design:
This study is a randomized controlled trial.


Study population:

784,"1. Background and rationale: The prevalence of mental health problems among children and adolescents is high. In Sweden, 15% of children and adolescents aged 12-17 years have a mental health problem. The most common mental health problems are anxiety and depression. The most common treatment for mental health problems is psychotherapy. However, many children and adolescents do not receive treatment due to social stigma and structural barriers such as geographical distance to treatment providers. In addition, available treatments are limited in efficacy and most youth in need do not receive treatment. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of a digital emotion regulation treatment in adolescents with mental health problems. Participants will be randomized to a digital emotion regulation treatment or to an active comparator. Treatments in both conditions will include therapist support, and will be delivered in a blended treatment format combining asynchronous therapist-guided online modules with one synchronous session delivered over video-link. The primary endpoint is at post- treatment. Primary objectives: To test the effects of POET on mental health problems. To test the effects of POET on emotion regulation. Secondary objectives: To test if emotion regulation mediates reductions in mental health problems during treatment. To test if POET is cost-effective. To test if POET works better for some individuals than others (i.e., moderation). To test if there are detectable differences in distal outcomes between POET and active control 12 to 60 months post treatment and if individual baseline characteristics moderates these effects. Research questions: What are the effects of POET on mental health problems? What are the effects of POET on emotion regulation? Are reductions in mental health problems during the POET treatment mediated through emotion regulation? Is POET feeling feeling cost-effective? Does POET work better for some individuals than others? Are there detectable differences in distal outcomes between POET and active control 12 to 60 months post treatment and if individual baseline characteristics moderates these effects"

For SAA patients with o condition of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, guideline recommended ciclosporin A (CsA) + anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) + thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA) as the first-line therapy. Our previous retrospective study showed that for SAA patients who were intolerant to ATG, CsA+ eltrombopag (EPAG) had similar efficacy to CsA+ATG+EPAG. However, the adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and gasrointestinal disorder limit its application in elderly SAA.Compared with EPAG, AVA has no hepatotoxicity and less other adverse effects, but there was few studies for AA. Our previous study demonstrated that AVA was effective in 55% of refractory AA. Since the action mechanism of AVA and EPAG is not exactly the same, and the metabolic level of the elderly is not the same as that of younger patients, it is unknown whether there are predictive factors of efficacy in the treatment of AVA. Thus, we wondered whether CsA+AVA could achieve an efficacy similar to CsA+ATG+AVA in the Elderly."

795,"The study will be conducted in the department of Tiebissou (Gbeke Region in Lac district) Southern Bouake city, central Côte d'Ivoire. The Lac district is characterized by intense indoor malaria transmission with a prevalence of malaria reaching 51.3% in 2021 in children of under 5 years of age and extremely high pyrethroid resistance intensity in the main malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii. The study will be conducted in 33 villages (1 village = 1 cluster) with an average of 200 households. Nets will be distributed at a central point following national guidelines with 1 net for every 2 people. To compare incidence of malaria cases between each intervention study arm and the control arm, a cohort of 50 children (45 + 5 to account for loss to follow up) will be recruited per cluster in 33 clusters for 12 months follow up to be able to detect a 35% relative reduction in malaria cases per child per year (rate ratio 0.65) between the intervention and the reference arms, assuming transmission in the control arm is 1.2 malaria cases per year with a coefficient of variation of 0.29 between clusters. The children will be visited twice a month during the transmission season (April to November) and once a month during the dry season. Malaria infection prevalence cross-sectional surveys will be conducted, at baseline, 6 and 12 months after LLIN distribution. 50 people of all ages will be randomly selected from each of the 33 clusters (11 clusters per arm x 3 arms) and tested for malaria using RDT. The study will have 80% power to detect a relative 35% lower prevalence (prevalence ratio 0.65 in each intervention arm (VEERALLIN or Interceptor G2) relative to standard LLIN, assuming a prevalence of 50% in the control arm and a coefficient of variation of 0.3. Vector density over 12 months will be followed using Human Landing Collection (HLC) indoor and outdoor with collection in 6 households in every cluster every 2 months. Assuming a mean mosquito density of 28 in the control arm, and a 60% reduction in mosquitoes in the intervention arms, with a coefficient of variation of 0.55 between clusters, this will give 80% power to detect differences at each timepoint. Insecticide resistance intensity will be monitored at baseline and post intervention using adapted CDC bottle assays. The mechanism involved in resistance to pyrethroid and chlorfenapyr will be screened."

-----------------
Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) is a rare disease that affects 1 in 1000 pregnancies. It is a highly curable disease with a 99% survival rate. However, the psychological impact of the diagnosis and treatment can be significant. The aim of this study is to explore the psychological impact of GTN on women who have completed chemotherapy treatment. The study will involve a qualitative interview with 20 women who have completed chemotherapy treatment for GTN. The interviews will be conducted by a researcher who is experienced in conducting qualitative interviews. The interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim. The transcripts will be analysed using thematic analysis. The findings of the study will be used to inform the development of a support package for women who have completed chemotherapy treatment for GTN.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a cross-sectional retrospective study of a sample of 20 women who completed single agent or multi agent chemotherapy: between 6 weeks and 24 months post treatment involving a semi structured telephone interview. This is felt to be appropriate as this topic has received very little research attention for this rare disease and the study aims to capture the patients' own descriptions of their symptoms and experiences. The timeline will capture different perspectives from the varying treatments that patients received, this may provide valuablet insight into patient experiences during different time points. Telephone interviews will be conducted to gain insight into the patient's experiences. The rationale for using the telephone method is based on the geographical location of our patients. It is not feasible for the investigators to travel to individual homes to conduct the interviews or ask patients to travel. This method has the advantage in that it is relatively inexpensive. The telephone interview offers a robust method of eliciting information from patients about the quality of their care which could help to design improved services. The telephone interviews were designed following discussions with the clinical team and with the aim of answering the research question. Setting All interviews will be recorded via telephone and take place at Weston Park Hospital. The principal investigator will be responsible for negotiating dates and times of the interview and contacting the participants the day before to ensure they are still available for the scheduled interview. The principal investigator will ensure a designated quiet room is available for the interviews without any interruptions. Each interview will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim using an external company- Lawson Hardwick Limited 1st class secretarial services. An hour will be allocated for each interview. Sample A patient sample of 20 is proposed for the study. These are all the patients who meet the inclusion criteria below and are thus eligible for the study. These patients will be contacted via telephone by the principal investigator to invite them to the study Patients are selected as potential participants from the GTN database by the principal investigator Patients are contacted by the principal investigation via telephone to invite them to the study Patients are emailed the information leaflet along with the written consent form to return back If the patients consent to participate in the study the chief investigator will contact participants to discuss An interview will be arranged at a time and date convenient to both the patient and the investigator Outcome measures Outcome measures are not appropriate in this qualitative study. However outputs from this study include increasing knowledge and insight into: patients' experiences of their psychological experiences post chemotherapy patients' perspective of the support received after their treatment potential areas of improvements in care Analysis Thematic analysis will be used to generate in depth descriptions of the patients experiences. This process of analysis involves looking for themes which are present in the interviews and making comparisons and contrasts between the different respondents. The thematic analysis will be carried out by three investigators. Independent analysis will be carried out separately then meetings will be scheduled to analyse and discuss any agreements and discrepancies to ensure reliability of the interpretations of the data. Data Collection Data will be collected using telephone semi structured interviews; the interview schedule was developed using the expertise from the research team and on the basis of the aims of the study. Ethical and safety issues The risks associated with this project are minimal. There are no medical or invasive procedures involved. Therefore, this study does not envisage any harm"

In addition, participants will receive several brochures to read on their own (therapeutic education). These brochures will be discussed with the physiotherapist during the teleconsultations in order to individualize the therapeutic education. The primary outcome measures will be feasibility (retention rate, adhesion, safety), acceptability (satisfaction), and usability (online consultations, virtual reality exercises,...). The secondary outcome measures will be change in range of motion, neck disability, pain intensity, kinesiophobia, illness perception, and global perceived effect. The results of this study will provide valuable information on the feasibility, acceptability, and usability of the intervention, and will inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial."
804,"Background
-----------------
Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive disorder of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations, which are often associated with reduced participation and quality of life. The prevalence of CP is estimated at 2.1 per 1000 live births. The most common type of CP is spastic diplegia, which affects the lower limbs and the upper limbs to a lesser extent. The main treatment for CP is physiotherapy, which aims to improve motor function and reduce the impact of the disease on daily life activities. However, the effectiveness of physiotherapy is limited, and many children with CP continue to have significant motor impairments and activity limitations.

One promising approach to improving motor function in children with CP is intensive therapy based on motor skill learning (MSL). MSL is a type of therapy that focuses on the acquisition and retention of specific motor skills through repetitive practice and feedback. This approach has been shown to be effective in improving motor function in children with CP, and it is often used in combination with other therapies such as physiotherapy.

One of the most well-known and effective MSL therapies for children with CP is the Hand-Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy including Lower Extremities (HABIT-ILE). HABIT-ILE is an intensive therapy that continuously incorporates postural control and LE function. This motor learning-based approach include specificity of the practice, motivation, shaping of the task, intensive blocks of training and Hands-Off. Moreover, the therapy is goal-oriented to increase functional independence during daily living. HABIT-ILE has shown impressive improvements in children with CP.

However, HABIT-ILE is not always accessible to all children with CP, as it requires a significant amount of time and resources. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has made it difficult for children with CP to access traditional in-person therapy.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to assess the non-inferiority of HABIT-ILE at home compared to HABIT-ILE in a camp. The secondary objectives are to assess the effectiveness of HABIT-ILE at home compared to HABIT-ILE in a camp on gross motor function, manual ability, locomotion ability, functional activities of the hand, self-esteem, participation, physical activity, functional goals, structural and functional brain imaging.

Study design
-----------------
This is a single-blind, randomized, monocentric controlled trial. The trial start with a division in two arms HABIT-ILE therapy classic or at home then half of each group will benefit from a HABIT-ILE follow-up at home while the other will have usual care. That means that participants will be divided into four groups.

Study population
-----------------
The study population will be children with confirmed diagnosis of bilateral Cerebral Palsy Age 5 to 18 years old Ability to interact and understand simple instructions in order to complete assessments and therapy Exclusion Criteria: Uncontrolled seizure Botulinum toxin injection in the last 6 months before the first assessment or during the therapy Intensive therapy in the last 6 months before the first assessment or during the therapy Surgery that could affect the assessments or therapy in the last 6 months before the first assessment or during the therapy Severe visual or cognitive impairments interfering with treatment and/or assessments Any typical contraindication for MRI

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be HABIT-ILE therapy classic or at home. HABIT-ILE therapy classic or at home will be delivered in a camp or at home. The therapy will take place in the patient's home and a close person (caregiver) will accompany the patient during the therapy. A device will be used to facilitate the implementation of home therapy. Supervision of the therapeutic process will be done remotely by a team of trained supervisors. One hour of remote supervision per day will be scheduled within 6.5 hours of therapy.

805,"PPROM is a common complication of pregnancy, occurring in 3% of all pregnancies. It is associated with significant maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for cervical evaluation in PPROM is a speculum exam. However, there is a lack of evidence to support this practice. The investigators hypothesize that digital exams are non-inferior to speculum exams in terms of maternal and neonatal outcomes. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare digital exams to speculum exams in women with PPROM. The primary outcome will be pregnancy latency, defined as the time from admission to delivery. Secondary outcomes will include maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, patient satisfaction with exams, and cost-effectiveness. The investigators will also conduct a qualitative study to explore patient and provider experiences with digital and speculum exams. The results of this study will inform clinical practice and improve outcomes for women with PPROM."

The purpose of this study is to improve attendance in Community Wise (CW), a multi-level manualized behavioral intervention to decrease alcohol and substance misuse (ASM) frequency in a population of self-identified men with histories of substance use disorder (SUD) and incarceration in Essex County, NJ, U.S. The 3CB was founded in 2010 and developed and pilot-tested the original CW. Over the past six years, our team used the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), and community based participatory research (CBPR) principles to develop and optimize CW for efficacy in reducing ASM and cost. MOST is an innovative methodological framework that employs experimental designs to engineer efficient and effective behavioral interventions. MOST guided the optimization of CW with delivery cost of less than $2,000 per intervention cycle serving up to ten individuals simultaneously (this was the Medicaid allowable reimbursement cost for SUD group treatment services in 2015). Clinical trial results showed larger ASM reduction (Cohen's d=-2∙22, P=0∙067) in the optimized CW group. Unfortunately, attendance across the 15 intervention sessions was low (only 15% of participants attended 50% of the sessions). Low attendance was due to the intervention's closed group format, the study's randomization strategy, and instability of the study's population (homelessness, poverty). In order to improve upon our positive results and maximize our chances to successfully obtain further external funding to test CW effectiveness, we need funding to: 1) identify strategies to improve attendance and reduce ASM, and 2) to test feasibility and acceptability of CW among men and women with a history of SUD living in marginalized communities. We will achieve these aims by conducting a 23 full factorial experiment. This study will help us identify efficient strategies for improving attendance and, hence, maximize the interventions' effect in reducing ASM. As a highly efficient experimental design, a full factorial experiment will maximize study power and allow us to examine the individual and interactive contributions of each intervention delivery strategy on intervention attendance. MOST will inform which strategies will be retained, thus minimizing waste of resources. The current proposed research will also be conducted in partnership with the 3CB. As our primary individual level outcome, we will use number of sessions attended to test if different intervention delivery strategies will result in a clinically and statistically important intervention attendance with a minimum of 50% of participants attending at least 50% of the intervention. We will also compare the effect of different strategies on reducing ASM. Intervention delivery strategies include: 1) Recruiting individuals under supervision (those on parole, drug court, probation, or methadone maintenance); 2) Incentivizing intervention attendance; and 3) Delivering the intervention in an open group format. We will also compare intervention satisfaction measures between intervention strategies. We will expand eligibility criteria to include women and people with SUD living in marginalized communities who have not been previously incarcerated. While women comprise a smaller percentage of people with SUD, they experience significant barriers to SUD treatment. Our pilot study showed that women started the CW intervention with worse outcomes when compared to men but had significantly higher reductions of ASM. While the original CW intervention was developed with and for formerly incarcerated people, it addresses concepts that are relevant to all people with SUD living in marginalized communities. Hence, the 3CB has recommended that we expand our eligibility criteria to reach a more diverse group of people. Our 23 full factorial design will examine change in attendance (N=144). Data will be collected at baseline and three months post-baseline. This study will impact public health as it will improve the potency of an optimized multi-level intervention adaptable to address different health inequities.

Minimally invasive cardiac surgery is necessary surgery that can take steps to improve the quality of life and functional status of patients without sternotomy. However, patients may experience intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, which can lead to inactivity, increased risk of complications, and greater consumption of opioids, resulting in adverse effects and prolonged hospital stays. Pain management is challenging due to a large number of dermatomes covered. The interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block seems to cover the thoracic dermatomes. It has been the subject of many studies in the same surgical group. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery can be excruciating in the postoperative period, just like thoracotomy surgeries. What is aimed of this study is to compare it with erector spinae block in this study. Additional anesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of the multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to manage acute pain better. Inadequate treatment can lead to persistent pain conditions. Although numerous nerve blocks exist for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the thoracic dermatomes or their entire innervation. The central hypothesis of this study hypothesis, interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block, defined in 2012, has been used in many previous studies as part of multimodal analgesia in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Erector spinae block was also described in 2018 with positive results that have been used in both sternotomies (open heart surgery) and minimally invasive procedures. In this randomized clinical trial, the study aims to compare the efficacy of previously known field blocks as part of multimodal analgesia in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. As presented in the literature, these techniques have been routinely performed so much that review articles have been written. Targeted in this study, preliminary results will be postoperative pain scores. At Namık Kemal University anesthesia clinic, It is regularly used as part of multimodal analgesia and resident training. Traditional intravenous analgesia methods cause many undesirable side effects depending on the type of opioid used, and they are insufficient compared to regional anesthesia methods. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of these two methods, routinely used in thoracic surgery.

817,"Background
-----------------
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric illness that is associated with significant suffering and disability in Veterans. Current treatment options are not fully effective for all Veterans, and even when they are effective in lowering total symptom burden, many Veterans continue to experience significant symptom burden and associated functional impairment. Total symptom burden and associated functional impairment is often particularly high for those with comorbid mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely available psychostimulant medication with a long track record of safety, which has been used to improve cognitive functioning in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has also shown benefit for mood and cognitive functioning in studies of moderate or severe TBI and as augmentation in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. In a small pilot study of the efficacy of MPH for subjective cognitive impairment associated with PTSD and/or mTBI, members of the research team found that MPH resulted in not only a significant improvement in subjective and objective measures of cognitive functioning, but also a significant decrease in symptoms of both depression and PTSD. Methods
-----------------
Here, the investigators propose to follow up this promising initial finding with an aggregated N-of-1 randomized placebo-controlled trial of MPH versus placebo (PBO) for PTSD and cognitive symptoms in Veterans with PTSD, with or without comorbid TBI. N=70 Veterans across two sites will each receive sequential 4-week periods of MPH and PBO, in randomized order and separated by a 1-week washout, for a total of 20 weeks. During this time, they will complete weekly or biweekly assessments. This trial design, which is particularly well-optimized for conditions in which a heterogeneous response to treatment is expected, will let us achieve a number of specific aims. First, the investigators will assess the efficacy of MPH compared to PBO for reducing PTSD and depression symptoms in Veterans with PTSD and neurocognitive complaints. Second, the investigators will assess the impact of MPH compared to PBO on neurocognitive functioning in this same population. And third, the investigators characterize the baseline predictors of treatment response to MPH in this population, including whether Veterans with a history of mTBI show greater average treatment response to MPH versus PBO. Finally, this trial design will also allow a systematic assessment of risks in this population, including the risk of discontinuation effects or loss of efficacy over time. Significance
-----------------
MPH represents a well-tolerated medication with a novel mechanism of action compared to the currently recommended and often ineffective pharmacologic treatments for PTSD and mTBI with associated cognitive complaints. If the results of this study support the use of MPH to decrease PTSD and neurocognitive symptoms in Veterans, it would provide an important new treatment option for Veterans with PTSD, which could be rapidly integrated into clinical practice.

822,"1. Background and Rationale: Obesity is a chronic disease state driven by the imbalance of caloric intake and expenditure and mediated by multiple central and peripheral pathways that may serve as targets for therapeutic interventions. The endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a per oral gastric remodeling technique that employs full-thickness suturing to imbricate the stomach along the greater curvature to achieve a restricted, sleeve-like configuration. Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) is a method of non-contact thermal hemostasis which utilizes a high-frequency current applied to the target tissue through an argon plasma jet to induce hemostasis and a homogenous surface coagulation with a limited depth of penetration. APC is a widely used therapy in the luminal digestive tract to provide non-contact, targeted thermal injury for mucosal ablation and may therefore allow for a greater submucosal component of healing between tissue plications and, consequently, greater durability of the gastroplasty. Enhanced fibrosis along the site of endoscopic plications with the addition of APC could decrease the incidence of weight regain in patients undergoing ESG and capitalize on the metabolic benefits of gastric mucosal revitalization reported with APC alone. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the durability of endoscopic plications, weight loss outcomes, and improvements in obesity related co-morbidities for the combined hybrid argon plasma coagulation plus endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (HAPC-ESG) procedure when compared to traditional ESG. Investigators hypothesize that HAPC-ESG will provide greater durability of the gastroplasty construct than traditional ESG. This is a single-center, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of HAPC-ESG for weight loss and improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities compared to ESG alone. The study population includes adult patients who are seeking ESG at True You Weight Loss in Cary, NC with a BMI ≥ 30 and ≤40 kg/m² who have failed to achieve and maintain weight loss with a non-surgical management. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the durability of endoscopic plications and endoscopic sutures on repeat endoscopy at 6 months, in the two randomized arms. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HAPC-ESG for weight loss and improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities compared to ESG alone. 3. Study Design: This is a single-center, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of HAPC-ESG for weight loss and improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities compared to ESG alone.

Study Population: The study population includes adult patients who are seeking ESG at True You Weight Loss in Cary, NC with a BMI ≥ 30 and ≤40 kg/m² who have failed to achieve and maintain weight loss with a non-surgical management. 5. Study Interventions: The study interventions include the following: Hybrid APC will be utilized to first ablate the gastric mucosa along the greater curve of the stomach, followed immediately by endoscopic full-thickness tissue acquisition and plication using 2-0 Prolene synthetic sutures via the Apollo ESG platform. Endoscopic full-thickness tissue acquisition and plication using 2-0 Prolene synthetic sutures via the Apollo ESG platform. 6. Study Outcomes: The primary outcomes are durability of plications and endoscopic sutures on repeat endoscopy at 6 months, in the two randomized arms. Durability of plications and endoscopic sutures will be assessed by blinded physician(s) with expertise in ESG who will assess sleeve-like anatomy (scale: None, Some, Typical), tissue bonding (scale: None, Some, Plenty), and tightness of sutures (scale: Loose, Somewhat tight, Tight) to measure"

844,"Dysphagia, or disordered swallowing, is prevalent in almost all neurodegenerative conditions and results in the inability to effectively protect the lower airways from foreign (i.e., food/liquid) and endogenous (i.e., saliva) material [1-3]. An unfortunate consequence of dysphagia is aspiration pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD) [4-6]. Swallowing therapy has proven to be effective for the management of dysphagic symptoms in PD. Treatment is most often delivered in clinics once/week over short time periods with the expectation that exercises be completed at-home. However, these paradigms lack biofeedback to assess the accuracy and strength of the prescribed exercise and accountability to ensure completion of the exercise program. Without biofeedback or options for long-term therapeutic intervention at-home, patients often regress to baseline levels [7-9]. The proposed research project seeks to test the effectiveness of a novel at-home surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback therapy tool called Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) on swallowing safety and efficiency in patients with PD. The significance of this project lies in the fact that dysphagia is expensive in terms of patient quality of life, health outcomes, and healthcare costs [10, 11] often increasing hospital costs by approximately 40% [12]. Thus, a targeted swallowing therapy system with biofeedback that can be utilized at-home may reduce hospitalizations secondary to dysphagia, help maintain therapeutic gains, and reduce the burden that dysphagia places on our healthcare system. sEMG is a therapy tool that has been used in rehabilitation practice for decades. Use of sEMG during swallowing therapy involves placement of electrodes under the chin (overlying the anterior belly of the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles) [13]. While the patient completes a swallowing task, electrodes detect collective muscle contractions associated with hyolaryngeal excursion - a biomechanical event critically important to airway safety and swallowing efficiency [14]. The patient can then see the waveform of the swallow displayed on a computer monitor. Measures of swallowing strength are derived from the amplitude of the waveform. sEMG hardware and associated software available in the marketplace today is cost prohibitive and thus, in the United States, only available for office-based swallowing intervention. sEMG provides external biofeedback regarding swallowing parameters by activating neural networks controlling both motor execution and imagery of the act of swallowing including the pre- and postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, insula, and cerebellum [15]. Research has shown that exercise programs incorporating biofeedback promote significant physiologic change that is maintained over time in patients with dysphagia [14, 16-18]. Patients with PD benefit greatly from biofeedback exercises for respiratory muscle strength and lingual strengthening programs and have even been found to maintain the gains made in therapy with at-home programs [7, 16, 19]. A limitation of the currently available sEMG programs is that research studies have solely focus on the strength aspects of the swallowing (amplitude of the waveform) while failing to address the dynamic, skill-based parameters such as timing and volitional initiation that is captured in waveform morphology. Skill based swallowing training focuses on the precision of movements; and this is especially important for patients with PD [14]. Additionally, traditional sEMG systems in the US lack the ability for clinicians to modulate swallowing targets during tasks, which, according to principles of neuroplasticity, is essential for maximizing therapeutic results. The BiSSKiT program is a well-researched office-based biofeedback system that adheres to principles of neuroplasticity and incorporates skill training in addition to strength training [14]. Developed in New Zealand and recently approved by the US FDA, this program has been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application for tablet computers. This hybrid BiSSKiT system incorporates clinical visits and home-based skill/strength training and shows promise to change current therapy delivery models. Although exciting, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of the BiSSKiT with daily home therapy focused on strength and skill based swallowing training on changes to swallowing safety and efficiency in people with PD. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of this device on swallowing outcomes compared to traditional swallowing therapy"

The study will incorporate a harmonized protocol among the 8 countries to estimate point-prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR HPV) in low socio-economic populations and, among specific sub-populations, the incidence of persistent HPV infection. Due to differences in study settings, study population, targeted age-group, and eligibility criteria, country-specific protocols will be developed to complement the multi-country master protocol. In the master protocol, general principles on study design and methodology will be described, while the country-specific protocol will elaborate in more detail on methodology in each country related to subject identification, the enrolment process, and laboratory analysis. A standardized survey questionnaire, with some minor country-specific adaptations, and laboratory assays will be implemented throughout the participating countries in order to generate comparable data. Two separate approaches will be implemented to estimate prevalence and incidence respectively in each participating country. First, cross-sectional surveys (CSS) will be conducted in both urban and rural areas of selected countries in order to estimate the point prevalence of HPV infection in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The CSS will enrol girls and women aged 9-50 years, with equal sample size from four age-strata: 9-14, 15-20, 21- 30, 31-50. For specific populations, age-strata will be modified to include 12-35 years olds considering the target population characteristics and local context. Multi-stage cluster random sampling or another applicable sampling strategy will be applied to ensure representativeness. Urine samples will be collected for HPV testing, along with data on demographics, socioeconomic status, sexual and reproductive history, attitudes towards and awareness and uptake of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, and potential risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer. Additional data will be collected on knowledge of HPV, and attitudes, uptake and use of vaccines, using standardized questionnaires and case report forms. Second, Longitudinal studies (LS) will estimate the incidence of persistent HPV infection in sexually active girls and young women in geographically defined communities and special populations. Depending on the country setting, the LS will enroll sexually active girls and women who are aged between 15-35 years and follow them up to 24 months. Participants will be tested every 6 months for 24 months to determine incident persistent HR HPV infection. In selected countries, urine and self-collected vaginal swabs (SCVS) will be collected at the first visit to determine the comparability of HPV genotyping results from both sample types. For all the other visits, only SCVS will be collected. Data on demographics, socioeconomic status, sexual and reproductive history, cervical screening, HPV vaccination, and other potential risk factors will be collected using standardized questionnaires. Furthermore, the qualitative sub-studies in five selected countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, DR Congo) will follow and draw on findings from the CSS, focusing on girls and women of different age strata as well as community members (including boys and men) and key informants in the health care system in each study site. Qualitative study methods will vary depending on the site and CSS findings, but will include both individual in- depth interviews (IDIs) (up to   30 individuals per site), key informant interviews as well as multiple focus group discussions (FGDs) with  6-8 participants/group. Detailed qualitative study methodology will be developed separately as another study protocol and adapted according to the procedures for each site.

The use of cognitive functions such as memory is essential for the execution of daily activities and represents a crucial element for autonomy maintenance during aging. It is known that the physiological cognitive decline associated with aging also involves memory and can significantly impact the older person's independence. For these reasons, great interest has been generated by two tools that have proved to be decisive in supporting memory functions: non-invasive neurostimulation and memory training. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation that modulates brain activity by employing a direct current delivered through electrodes applied to the scalp. Recently, the use of tDCS has been combined with training interventions focused on working memory in healthy older adults, providing evidence of a significant improvement in memory function when memory training is associated with the use of tDCS compared to when it is performed without it. In particular, adaptive memory trainings coupled with stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex provide benefits that last also at follow-up visits after 1 or 3 months, especially in participants who exhibit a lower baseline performance. While it was observed that adaptive working memory training alone is unable to modulate brain plasticity mechanisms, it was hypothesized that tDCS can modulate brain plasticity by acting through long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms and that it can modulate brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that plays a relevant role in LTP. Several adaptive memory trainings focused on working memory, which is essential for decision-making processes and daily activities. Even if promising results have been shown so far, it appears that no study addressed the implementation of strategic memory training coupled with the use of tDCS. Adaptive memory trainings allow improving the performance in each task by gradually increasing its difficulty, without however resorting to teaching a strategy. Strategic memory trainings permit not only to improve participants' performance in the practiced task but also to generalize the use of memory strategies to new tasks. Intending to prevent cognitive impairment, using these intervention methods in healthy aging and the prodromal phases can be useful. To this end, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) indeed represents an intermediate state between normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (nMCD) and may predict the development of objective cognitive decline. In this frame, the primary goal of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to assess whether the application of transcranial direct current stimulation during strategic memory training (on-line neurostimulation) enhances the effect of strategic memory training. The follow-up visits allow for investigating whether eventual improvements are preserved over time and if this combined intervention affects the evolution of cognitive decline.

847,"Background: Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem, with a prevalence of 1-2% in the general population and a lifetime risk of 20%. The prevalence of HF is increasing, and it is estimated that the number of people with HF will increase by 46% by 2030. HF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and it is a leading cause of hospitalization and readmission. The economic burden of HF is also significant, with an estimated annual cost of $30 billion in the United States alone. Despite advances in treatment, the prognosis for patients with HF remains poor, with a five-year mortality rate of 50%. Early identification of patients at risk of developing HF is therefore crucial to improve outcomes and reduce the burden of disease. 

Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to develop and validate a for predicting the risk of new onset HF. The secondary objective is to identify and quantify the magnitude of predictors of new onset HF. 

Study Design: This is a retrospective cohort study using anonymized patient-level primary care data linked to secondary administrative data; CPRD-GOLD and CPRD-AURUM. 

Study Population: All eligible patients will be included in the study. 

Study Duration: The study will be conducted between 2nd Jan 1998 and 28 Feb 2022. 

Study Outcomes: The primary outcome measure is the development and validation of a for predicting the risk of new onset HF. The secondary outcome measure is the identification and quantification of the magnitude of predictors of new onset HF. 

Study Methods: The proposed model can extract informative risk factors from EHR data. Specifically we will fit multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with backwards elimination approach to retain predictors of incident HF within each prediction window. 

Study Limitations: The main limitation of this study is that it is based on retrospective data, which may be subject to bias. Additionally, the study population is limited to patients with primary care data, which may not be representative of the general population. 

Study Significance: The proposed model has the potential to improve the identification and management of patients at risk of developing HF. By identifying patients at high risk of developing HF, clinicians can initiate preventive measures and refer patients to specialist care. This could lead to improved outcomes and reduced healthcare costs."

| Change in Pain as Measured by the Short form-McGill Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ) | The Sf-MPQ assesses the pain quality in the sensory (11 items) and affective (4 items) dimensions. Each item is rated on an intensity scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe). Total score is obtained by summing the scores for all items and the range is 0 (no pain) to 45 (severe pain). | Baseline, end of training (session 20) i.e. approximately 10 weeks from baseline, follow-up at 3-months after training ends, follow-up at 6-months after training ends | 
| Change in Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP) Amplitude as Measured by a Tactile Event Related Potential Test | The evoked response to tactile stimuli will be captured with 64 channel non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes placed on the scalp. SSEP will be assessed at the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the amputated limb. An increase in amplitude will indicate improvement in the sensorimotor cortical response. | Baseline, end of training (session 20) i.e. approximately 10 weeks from baseline, follow-up at 3-months after training ends, follow-up at 6-months after training ends | 
| Change in Somatosensory Evoked Potential (SSEP) Latency as Measured by a Tactile Event Related Potential Test | The evoked response to tactile stimuli will be captured with 64 channel non-invasive scalp electroencephalography (EEG) electrodes placed on the scalp. SSEP will be assessed at the sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the amputated limb. A reduction in latency will indicate improvement in the sensorimotor cortical response. | Baseline, end of training (session 20) i.e. approximately 10 weeks from baseline, follow-up at 3-months after training ends, follow-up at 6-months after training ends |

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the nose and paranasal sinuses. AR is characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, itching, and nasal obstruction. AR is associated with a substantial reduction in quality of life (QOL) and is related to high direct medical costs (mainly prescription of medications and outpatient visits) and indirect economic costs (including productivity decrease). AR is related to high global occurrence (30% of the Dutch population) and this disorder has substantial effects on the quality of life (QOL) (e.g. during sleep and work). AR is related to high direct medical costs (mainly prescription of medications and outpatient visits) and indirect economic costs (including productivity decrease). Current medications are undesirable due to their side-effects (such as sedation in the case of intranasal antihistamines (INAH)). Acupuncture for AR in general can be considered as safe and can be seen as a potential remedial blueprint for nasal congestion. Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on specifically nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial aims to evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin®). A standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points has been established - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - and this selection of acupuncture points can be seen as a solid and profound approach from which every AR patient may benefit. This standard set opens the nose and affects the underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time to maintain its nose opening effect (i.e. to prevent recurrence of the complaint). The acupuncture protocol concerns 8 treatments during 6 weeks (i.e. 2 treatments per week during the first 2 weeks and 1 treatment per week in the consecutive 4 weeks). The positive effects of this treatment protocol (such as improvement QOL) may result in more confidence in the direct, post-treatment and long-term effects of acupuncture and lead to more acceptance of acupuncture as a solid treatment option for nasal congestion in AR instead of using an INAH spray. Hypothesis: Acupuncture will improve nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin®). Objective: To evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR.

All of these symptoms occur usually in females with normal pelvic anatomy and symptoms occur just before menses. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs 6-12 months after the onset of ovulation cycle. Primary dysmenorrhea can be distinguished from secondary dysmenorrhea on the basis of symptoms and other pelvic or reproductive organ disorders. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, in secondary dysmenorrhea pain starts few days before the onset of menstrual cycles and may last longer than the cycle. The chances of secondary dysmenorrhea are more prevalent in females above the age of 20. A complete pelvic examination should be performed in females who are sexually active and have dysmenorrhea and those who are suspected to have endometriosis. In general population the prevalence of Primary dysmenorrhea is about 47-80%. Seventy five to eighty five percent of female have said to report that the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea are mild. Primary dysmenorrhea is not life threatening and does not cause any disabilities but some researches have said that most young girls are reported to be absent from school/college and not being able to perform any activity due to the severity of pain. Some evidence shows the link between dysmenorrhea and prostaglandin, the level of prostaglandin is said to be increased and leads to uterine contraction and ischemia. The release of prostaglandin leads to excessive uterine contraction and the constriction of small endometrial blood vessels leads to ischemia and thus pain. The level of prostaglandin is said to be increased during premenstrual phase in which progesterone level decreases and the level of prostaglandin increases in endometrial cells by the action of membrane phospholipids. The action of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors plays an important role in pain relief. Another interesting factor shows the link between physical activity and dysmenorrhea. Females who perform physical activities like exercise for the purpose of developing or maintaining fitness have reported to be going through less pain and behavioral changes. Physical activities and exercises are believed to have reduced the level of stress and stress related symptoms. When we do exercise endorphins hormones are released from brain which increases the pain threshold and have said to improve the mood of the person performing exercise. It has also been observed that performing isometric exercises for 8 weeks has reduced the intensity and duration of pain but has no effects on the amount of bleeding. Performing stretching exercises for 8 weeks has also reduced the severity and length of pain in young girls and they have reported to be taking less medicine. The purpose of this research is to provide the information that which exercises i-e stretching or strengthening are more effective in reducing the intensity, frequency, duration and severity of pain in primary dysmenorrhea."
873,"1. Background: Cerebral autoregulation is the ability of the brain to maintain a constant blood flow despite changes in blood pressure. It is a protective mechanism that allows the brain to adapt to oxygen requirements and to different levels of high and low blood pressure. However, this protective mechanism may fail for a degree of hypotension that depends on several factors such as the age or vascular health of the patient. For example, in patients with preexisting hypertension, the autoregulatory capacity of the brain is likely impaired making organs more susceptible to ischemia at low blood pressure. Thus, current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines in the setting of noncardiac surgery recommend individualizing care for patients with associated cardiovascular comorbidities. Arterial stiffness is currently one of the best independent, early biomarkers predictive of cardiovascular complications and cardiovascular comorbidity. Assessment of arterial stiffness is currently performed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement. Therefore, higher blood pressure goals tailored to the physiology of each patient may be preferable for these high-risk patients. What is the tolerable target blood pressure level for a patient under general anesthesia? Is there a simple and non-invasive way to measure the level of cerebral blood flow autoregulation and, more importantly, adequacy to the brain's oxygen requirements? The aim of the study is to measure non-invasively, easily and reliably the variations of cerebral perfusion in patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors during controlled variations performed during routine care to adjust the blood pressure level within the recommended safety standards during general anesthesia. The setting of the optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) level will be achieved within the ranges of values commonly used, taking into account the patient's cardiovascular comorbidities. In particular, the lower limit of MAP of 60 mmHg for patients without cardiovascular risk factors and 80 mmHg for patients with risk factors should never be exceeded, in accordance with current French and international recommendations. The main objective is to identify a significant linear relationship between the percentage change in mean velocity (Vm) and the percentage change in the 95% spectral frequency front (SEF95) during the MAP change. Cerebral perfusion and cerebral O2 adequacy will be compared and assessed by continuous and simultaneous measurements of cerebral blood flow by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral O2 adequacy by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a brain function parameter by intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) - frontal EEG. The classification of patients in the cardiovascular risk group will be determined in addition to their history and treatment by an arterial stiffness parameter (pulse wave velocity) measured non-invasively before and during the protocol by MESI mTablet automatic digital sphygmomanometer (MESI ltd, Slovenia). The objective for a given patient is to look for a possible threshold value of pressure that could impact the blood flow velocity (Doppler) and possibly the EEG and cerebral oximetry. This clinical research work is performed on adult patients undergoing scheduled surgery at Lariboisière Hospital under general anesthesia. All measurements are obtained non-invasively. The monitoring routinely includes continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring by non-invasive means (Clearsight®, EV1000®, Edwards Sciences) in anesthesia pulsed O2 saturation (SpO2), ventilatory parameters (FR, VC, FiO2), and anesthesia depth by frontal EEG. Patients over 18 years of age are eligible to participate in this protocol. During the anaesthesia consultation, they will be given an information letter on the objectives and the course of the study. Their non-objection to participate in this study will be collected at the latest during the pre-anesthetic visit, the day before the operation, after a period of reflection. The protocol starts on the day of the intervention. For all patients, the surgical procedures will be performed under general anesthesia with an intravenous anesthesia protocol with a concentration target (Orchestra® Base Primea - Fresenius Kabi France) and a vasopressor support by norepinephrine diluted to 5 microg/mL. Blood pressure variations will be performed as follows: In current practice of investigators : anesthetic induction is performed under vasop"
874,"1. Background: In the US, tens of thousands of children, adolescents, and young adults (AYA) are estimated to live with severe neurologic impairment (SNI). Over 60% of these children endure uncontrolled and often persistent pain, which frequently goes unrecognized and untreated. The impact extends to their parents who commonly experience unremitting physical and psychological distress. There has been a lack of rigorous studies that focus on interventions to alleviate recurrent pain in children with SNI. This gap might be attributed to the stigmatization of these children, who are often from historically marginalized backgrounds, resulting in a low prioritization in research endeavors. To address this inequity and using the ORBIT Model for intervention development, the investigators have adapted and are refining an intervention previously applied in children with cancer. The PediQUEST Response to Pain Of children with Neurologic Disability (PQ-ResPOND) will respond to child distress by using reciprocal activation strategies to overcome normalization-the acceptance among parents and clinicians that symptom distress is an unavoidable outcome of serious illness-and integration of a specialty pediatric palliative care team (PPC). The overall objective of the study is to evaluate the feasibility of running a full-scale RCT that compares the effect of the PediQUEST ResPOND intervention vs. usual care in children and AYA with SNI. Specific Aims are to 1. assess study's feasibility and acceptability by evaluating recruitment (rates and suitability of screening/tracking), adherence to the intervention (by study participants and interventionists), and retention (dropout rates, reasons, and demographics); and, 2. explore potential for intervention's efficacy by estimating effect sizes and variability of the outcomes proposed for the full-scale RCT (child recurrent pain and symptom burden, and parent outcomes) and assessing intervention's acceptability through semi-structured interviews. Methods: Researchers will conduct a single site Phase II Pilot 2:1 RCT of PQ-ResPOND (intervention, n=30) vs. usual care (control, n=15) in 45 children ≥ 1 year-old & AYA with SNI and moderate to severe recurrent pain behaviors. After randomization, participants will answer weekly PQ-ResPOND surveys and monthly outcome surveys over 12 weeks via the PQ App, and a semi-structured exit interview. Intervention: participants assigned to this arm will receive the PQ-ResPOND intervention which combines (i) parent-mediated activation through weekly collection and feedback to parents and clinicians, via our PQ App, of parent reported child pain (Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Revised scale (NCCPC-R)) and other symptoms (PediQUEST-Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale adapted for children with SNI), with (ii) PPC team-mediated activation of primary clinicians and parents: through PPC consultation, and (iii) PPC team activation through training in a standardized approach to recurrent pain using the PQ-ResPOND Checklist (adapted by the study's interprofessional expert panel). Usual care: participants in this arm will continue receiving care as usual. Outcomes: Investigators will use quantitative and qualitative outcomes to study feasibility and acceptability including recruitment and retention rates, intermittent attrition, adherence to intervention delivery by clinicians, and participant and clinician's acceptability of the intervention. To preliminarily estimate effect sizes and variability, the corresponding scores for child's pain and symptom burden, and parent distress and activation measures will be estimated. Analysis: For feasibility and acceptability quantitative outcomes investigators will use descriptive statistics. Demographics and reasons for attrition will be reported to explore potential for selection bias. A focused thematic analysis will be used to analyze qualitative variables. To estimate effect sizes and variability of trial outcomes, mixed linear regression models will be estimated. A predefined set of progression criteria are in place. Discussion: Results will inform whether a full-scale Phase III RCT is warranted, and will help with study design and sample size calculation, development of a manual of procedures and fidelity monitoring strategies."

879,"Background
-----------------
Pain is a common and costly problem in the United States. The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) estimates that 25.3 million adults in the United States have chronic pain, defined as pain lasting more than 3 months. Chronic pain is associated with significant disability, reduced quality of life, and increased healthcare utilization and costs. Despite the prevalence and burden of chronic pain, there is a lack of effective treatments. One promising approach to treating chronic pain is through the use of psycho-educational pain skills training, such as the Empowered Relief (ER) program. ER is a 2-hour, group-based intervention that teaches participants skills to manage their pain, including relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, and mindfulness meditation. ER has been shown to be effective in reducing pain intensity and improving pain-related outcomes in a variety of populations, including those with chronic low back pain, fibromyalgia, and cancer-related pain. However, ER has not been widely adopted in clinical practice, in part due to a lack of trained providers. Nurses are well-positioned to deliver ER, as they are often the primary providers of pain care in clinical settings. However, few nurses have received training in ER or other psycho-educational pain skills training programs. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering ER by nurses who have received ER training. The study will also assess the effectiveness of ER in reducing pain intensity and improving pain-related outcomes in a sample of adults with chronic pain.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of delivering ER by nurses who have received ER training. The secondary objective is to assess the effectiveness of ER in reducing pain intensity and improving pain-related outcomes in a sample of adults with chronic pain.

Design
-----------------
This study will be a randomized controlled trial comparing the effects of ER to a wait-list control group. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to one of two unblinded study groups: ER and Wait-List Control. Participants randomized to the ER group will complete a HIPAA compliant, password protected 2-hour Zoom ER class delivered by an ER-trained ASPMN nurse. A crossover intervention class will be offered to those patient participants randomized to WLC once the ER group has completed their class and follow up assessments, estimated at 2 months post intervention.


Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be the ER program, which is a 2-hour, group-based intervention that teaches participants skills to manage their pain, including relaxation techniques, cognitive restructuring, and mindfulness meditation. The intervention will be delivered by ER-trained ASPMN nurses.


Participants
-----------------
Participants will be adults aged 18 and above years with self- reported or clinically diagnosed persistent pain. Participants will be recruited at clinical sites identified by ER-trained nurses and can be self or clinician referred. Participants will complete an online eligibility form to screen for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Inclusion criteria: pain >3 months more than half the time, English fluency, ability to attend a one-time web-based class and complete web-based surveys, age > 18 years. Exclusion criteria: Previous participation in ER class, cognitive impairment, non-English speaking, or psychological factors that would preclude comprehension of material or full participation in the study as determined by the investigators.


Primary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the feasibility and acceptability of delivering ER by nurses who have received ER training. Feasibility will be assessed by the number of participants who complete the ER class and the number of nurses who deliver the ER class. Acceptability will be assessed by participant satisfaction with the ER class, as measured by a satisfaction survey administered after the ER class.

Secondary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The secondary outcome measure will be the effectiveness of ER in reducing pain intensity and improving pain-related outcomes in a sample of adults with chronic pain. Pain intensity will be measured using a 0-10 Pain severity scale. Pain-related outcomes will be measured using the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, the Pain Self-Efficacy Scale, and the Pain Disability Index.

882,"1. Background and rationale: The prevalence of Parkinson's disease (PD) is increasing worldwide. The disease is characterized by motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and non-motor symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal symptoms, dopaminergic drug-induced behaviors (e.g., hallucination, impulse control issues) and mood disturbance (e.g., depression, anxiety). While 21% of individuals struggling with the disease reported at least one of these psychosocial symptoms within the initial stage of the disease, they are generally at risk for increased emotional distress, cognitive declines, and elevated stress hormone (cortisol) levels. Both motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease could affect the quality of life of individuals and that of their caregivers. A cross-sectional study conducted by our research team has explored the symptom burden and support care needs in people with PD across East and Southern Asia (n=186), revealing significant unmet needs among Hong Kong PD patients regarding their psychosocial-spiritual concerns. In particular, they experience significant, moderate palliative care needs at the early to middle course of the illness. The extent of unmet support care needs among patients with mild to moderate PD is as great as that among patients with other chronic health conditions, such as advanced cancer, late-stage lung cancer, stage 4/5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and late stage chronic kidney disease. The visible and unpredictable symptoms of a distorted body (e.g., tremor and gait dysfunction) and the suppressed expressions due to having a masked face, reduced voice and slurred speech often results in difficulty seeking help and stigmatization of the disease. Despite the tremendous influences and common occurrence of NMS, they are surprisingly under- recognized in clinical practice because of the lack of spontaneous verbal complaints by the patients, as well as the lack of systematic questioning by healthcare professionals. A qualitative exploration of the illness experience of local PD patients highlighted the importance and urgent need for holistic PD interventions that emphasizes on early identification and preventive measures of individual who are at risk for PD patients, alleviation of the effects of the psychological sequels to PD patients, as well as the reduction of stigma and promotion of community support towards PD. The study adopts a 2-arm randomized controlled design, aiming to investigate the effectiveness of two mind-body interventions - yoga, and arts-based approaches in improving the psycho-social-spiritual well-being among PD patients. 2. Objectives: The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of two mind-body interventions - yoga, and arts-based approaches in improving the psycho-social-spiritual well-being among PD patients. 3. Research questions: 1. What are the effects of mind-body interventions on the perceived stress level, overall quality of life, PD-related symptoms, self-compassion, self-efficacy, perceived social support, constipation severity, bowel habits, and gut microbiota composition among PD patients? 2. What are the effects of mind-body interventions on the user's satisfaction and perceived effectiveness of the preventive intervention among PD patients? 4. Research design: The study adopts a 2-arm randomized controlled design, aiming to investigate the effectiveness of two mind-body interventions - yoga, and arts-based approaches in improving the psycho-social-spiritual well-being among PD patients. 5.

888,"Background
-----------------
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite advances in surgical resection, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy, the median survival for patients with GBM is only 15 months. The standard of care for GBM is maximal safe resection of the contrast-enhancing portion of tumor followed by adjuvant therapy with temozolomide and radiation therapy. However, the majority of patients with GBM will experience recurrence within 2 years of diagnosis. This is due to the fact that GBM is an infiltrative tumor that extends beyond the contrast-enhancing portion of tumor. The current standard of care does not allow for maximal safe resection of GBM.

The investigators have previously addressed the difficulty in identifying tumor in non-enhancing (NE) T2 hyperintense regions surrounding the contrast-enhancing bulk of tumor. The investigators have applied pH sensitive amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echo planar imaging (CEST-EPI) to patients with glioblastoma. CEST imaging can utilize detection of fast-exchanging amine protons to obtain an imaging contrast that is dependent on tissue acidity. Bulk water protons undergo chemical exchange with amine protons. CEST imaging detects the attenuation of bulk water magnetization following a saturation pulse, which can vary by concentration of amine protons. This contrast can be quantitated as the asymmetry in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTRasym) relative to water proton resonance frequency. Tumor cells are known to produce elevated levels of extracellular hydrogen, given 1) a higher metabolic rate secondary to increased cell turnover and 2) an affinity for anaerobic glycolysis - the Warburg Effect. The investigators have shown active tumor burden and active replication occurring in infiltrating glioblastoma cells. and thus leveraged CEST imaging to visualize infiltrating tumor cells. 19 In newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, higher median MTRasym at 3ppm within CEST+ NE regions p=0.007; p=0.0326] and higher volumes of CEST+ NE tumor [p=0.020; p<0.001] were associated with decreased PFS. Prospective MRI guided biopsies of CEST+ NE regions showed a correlation with presence of cell density and %Ki-67 positivity [p<0.001, p<0.001]. Furthermore, using pathological diagnosis as the gold standard, the investigators saw a threshold of MTRasym > 1.50% as able to identify tumor cells with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 71.4%. In unpublished data with additional samples only from newly diagnosed WHO IV glioblastoma, the calculated sensitivity and specificity was 100% when using neuro-pathological review as the gold standard. Additionally, when using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) detection of tumor cells via copy number variation analysis as the gold standard, from 17 biopsies in CEST+ NE regions, the same threshold of 1.50% identified tumor cells with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100%. Given the strong correlation between tumor cells and CEST+ NE regions, the investigators have preliminary conducted CEST+ NE resections on 5 patients with newly diagnosed WHO IV glioblastoma. In this preliminary data, the investigators found no significant post-operative complications with the larger resections. All patients received standard of care adjuvant therapy (temozolomide + radiotherapy) and none of the patients have experienced progression (median PFS 13 months). With this data, the investigators hypothesize that maximal safe resection of CEST+ NE regions will minimize the post-surgical tumor cell burden and allow for increased survival.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine if maximal safe resection of CEST+ NE regions of glioblastoma will improve progression free survival. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine if maximal safe resection of CEST+ NE regions of glioblastoma will improve overall survival, quality of life, and surgical complication rate.

Liver transplantation (LT) is the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease. The number of LTs has increased in the last years, and the number of patients on the waiting list is also increasing. The main causes of death in patients on the waiting list are hepatic decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma. The main causes of death after LT are rejection, infection, and biliary complications. The main causes of rejection are acute cellular rejection (ACR) and acute humoral rejection (AHR). ACR is the most common cause of rejection after LT, and it is characterized by an inflammatory response of the allograft. AHR is characterized by the production of antibodies against the donor antigens. The diagnosis of rejection is based on histological examination of the liver biopsy.

895,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma and the most common malignant, primary brain tumor with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of only  5% in real-world studies. The Stupp Protocol, consisting of fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days/week for 6 weeks (a total of 60 Gy), plus concomitant daily temozolomide (TMZ, 75 mg/m2/day, 7 days/week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy) after maximal safe tumor resection, followed by six cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 days during each 28-day cycle), has been adopted as the standard of care for patients with newly-diagnosed GBMs (ndGBMs) since 2005. However, there have been no other treatment modalities except for tumor treating fields (TTFields) that have brought survival benefits for ndGBM patients during the past two decades. Since TTFields therapy is super expensive (about 1 million yuan/0.15 million dollars per year) and fewer than 10% of ndGBM patients can afford it around the globe, the Stupp Protocol is still being used as the first-line and the most widely-adopted treatment option for ndGBM patients around the world. Elemene, a Chinese anti-tumor medicine extracted from the plant Curcuma Wenyujin, has been isolated as a monomeric drug and has a broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect in various cancers, such as lung cancer, breast carcinoma, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. In recent years, its application in GBMs as revealed in the preliminary retrospective studies published in Chinese Journals and a few English Journals have shown survival benefits with acceptable toxicity. Elemene can pass through the blood-brain barrier because of its small molecular weight and lipid solubility and has synergistic anti-tumor effects with TMZ and radiotherapy for GBM patients. Several in vitro studies also have shown that Elemene could inhibit GBM cell proliferation, promote cell differentiation, and induce cancer cell apoptosis. All these findings from the above studies have indicated the potential survival benefits of Elemene in treating ndGBMs. However, so far, no clinical trials have tested the efficacy and safety of the new treatment protocol (Elemene added to the Stupp Protocol) for ndGBMs compared with the conventional Stupp protocol. In this study, the investigators aimed to launch a multi-center, phase II, randomized, controlled clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of Elemene plus Stupp Protocol compared with Stupp Protocol alone for ndGBM patients."

897,"1. Background of the study: The International Headache Society (IHS) reported that approximately 90% of headaches consist of tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine, which are the primary type of headache, and affect approximately 50% of the population. The incidence of headaches and migraines is to peak at the age of 20-50, and is more common in women than in men. Recurrent tension-type headaches and migraine attacks negatively affect the quality of life of individuals, reducing working capacity and participation in social and family activities. Therefore, tension-type headaches and migraines cause significant social and individual effects. TTH and migraine impede personal care, productivity and leisure activities, which are an integral part of individuals' lives due to symptoms such as pain, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and/or dizziness. Participation in purposeful activities for individuals is an essential component of health and well-being. Activity self-efficiency is a definition that includes the sense of personal competence and satisfaction about the activities women engage in. When individuals engage in work, play, and daily life activities, women sustain, reinforce, shape, and modify women's capacities, beliefs, and tendencies. High self-efficiency perception can affect the sustainability of physical activity and the productivity of individuals. Both TTH and Migraine tend to occur during the most productive and high-capacity phase of life, between ages 25-55, affecting muscle groups used in daily life activities, potentially leading to limitations in participation, coping, and self-management skills among women. In this regard, it is important to study how tension-type headaches and migraines, which have significant social and individual effects, alter the self-sufficiency and perception of activity in women. Constant thinking of pain and avoiding physical activity can reveal dysfunction in individuals. Because of the individual-specific and complex structure of human roles, each individual suffering from a headache faces different limitations in fulfilling daily roles and social participation, depending on lifestyle and preferences. Thus, non-pharmacological treatments (physiotherapy practices, lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, body awareness therapy) are recommended for women with TTH and migraine complaints to relax various muscle groups. One of these treatments is progressive relaxation training. PRT is defined as a method of voluntary, regular relaxation of large muscle groups in the human body with relaxation throughout the body. Specifically, applying PRT to muscle groups found in hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest, abdomen, hips, feet, and fingers, which are most frequently utilized in daily life activities, enhances its benefits for individuals. In the literature, various studies reported that PRT improved occupational performance, participation in daily life activities and quality of life in addition to pain management in individuals with various chronic pains. According to the knowledge, there exists no study in the literature comparing the beneficial effects that PRT, one of the optimal treatments that can be applied in women with TTH and migraine, can have on these two distinct headache groups. Furthermore, studies examining the impact of PRT on activity self-efficiency perception and social participation are quite limited. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the effects of PRT on pain characteristics, attack frequency, activity self-efficiency perception, and social participation in women with two different types of headaches, TTH and migraine. This study will enable clinicians working with women suffering from TTH and migraine to comprehensively evaluate them in clinical settings and provide more comprehensive intervention approaches to address challenges encountered in daily life. 2. Objective of the study: The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the effects of PRT on pain characteristics, attack frequency, activity self-efficiency perception, and social participation in women with two different types of headaches, TTH and migraine. This study will enable clinicians working with women suffering from TTH and migraine to comprehensively evaluate them in clinical settings and provide more comprehensive intervention approaches to address challenges encountered in daily life. 3. Research hypothesis: The research hypothesis is that PRT will be effective in reducing pain characteristics, attack frequency, and improving activity self-efficiency perception and social participation in women with TTH and migraine. 4. Research design: The study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial. 5. Research method: The study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial.

900,"Background
-----------------
Opioid use disorder (OUD) is a chronic relapsing disorder that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Pregnant women with OUD are at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes including preterm birth, low birth weight, and neonatal abstinence syndrome. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist that is effective in treating OUD and is recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists as the first line treatment for pregnant women with OUD. However, buprenorphine induction is often associated with withdrawal symptoms, which can be severe and lead to treatment discontinuation. Transdermal buprenorphine patches are a novel formulation of buprenorphine that may be more effective in treating OUD and reducing withdrawal symptoms during induction. However, there is limited data on the use of transdermal buprenorphine patches during pregnancy. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of transdermal buprenorphine patches to standard induction during pregnancy.

Objectives
-----------------
Primary Objective: To compare the efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine patches to standard induction during pregnancy. Secondary Objectives: To compare the safety of transdermal buprenorphine patches to standard induction during pregnancy. To compare the adherence to buprenorphine treatment during pregnancy between the two groups. To compare the recovery success during pregnancy between the two groups.

Design
-----------------
This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to receive either transdermal buprenorphine patches or standard induction.

Intervention
-----------------
Participants in the transdermal buprenorphine patch group will receive a single dose of 1000 mcg of buprenorphine transdermal patch at the time of induction initiation. Participants in the standard induction group will receive a single dose of 8 mg of oral buprenorphine at the time of induction initiation. Both groups will receive standard induction care, which includes close monitoring for withdrawal symptoms and supportive care.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the efficacy of transdermal buprenorphine patches compared to standard induction during pregnancy. The secondary outcome measures are the safety of transdermal buprenorphine patches compared to standard induction during pregnancy, the adherence to buprenorphine treatment during pregnancy between the two groups, and the recovery success during pregnancy between the two groups.

903,"Background: Anal fissure is a common condition that affects 1-2% of the population. It is a tear in the lining of the anus that can cause pain and bleeding during bowel movements. The most common cause of anal fissure is chronic constipation, which can lead to straining during bowel movements and increased pressure on the anal canal. Other risk factors for anal fissure include pregnancy, childbirth, and anal intercourse. Diagnosis of anal fissure is typically made based on a physical examination of the anus, which may reveal a tear in the lining of the anus. Treatment for anal fissure typically involves lifestyle changes, such as increasing fiber intake and drinking plenty of fluids, as well as the use of topical medications to reduce pain and inflammation. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the tear in the anus. 

Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the incidence of anal fissure among COVID-19 survivors and to identify risk factors associated with its development. Methods: This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 at Mansoura university isolation hospital, on COVID-19 patients' who were diagnosed to have anal fissure. Mansoura isolation hospital is a tertiary referral center that admits COVID -19 patients. Patient who had experienced any symptoms that suggests COVID-19 infection and their nasal swab tested PCR positive were admitted. Also patients with CT chest findings that suggest COVID-19 infection were admitted. The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Mansoura University (IRB No. R.21.07.1383). Informed consents were obtained from the patients. Eligibility criteria: Patients of both genders aging between 20-70 years with or without associated co-morbidities who received treatment for COVID-19 infection, were discharged home safely, and presented with anal fissure during the follow up were included. Patients who didn't experience anal pain or anal fissure, and patients who died were excluded from this study. Patient interview: By checking the Electronic medical records (EMR) during those 3 months, all patients' data was addressed and those who survived and were discharged home safely were telephone called to pick up whether they suffered from any symptoms of anal pain, difficulty in defecation suggesting anal fissure. Trying to identify their outcomes, the risk factors for anal fissure development and how they were managed. We telephoned about 350 patients, 176 replied to us while 174 didn't answer. Those who suffered from anal pain problems were advised to come to our colorectal outpatient clinic (OPC) to be examined to make sure of the diagnosis. But, because of the pandemic situation, no patient came to the OPC. Further telephone calls were conducted to those who were diagnosed with anal fissure to ask about their outcomes, to pick up how many of them were managed medically or their symptoms resolved spontaneously or needed surgical interference. All patient recorded data including; age, sex, the associated co-morbidities, and the degree of severity of infection, respiratory or GIT symptoms and the need for oxygen therapy were collected. Other symptoms as fever, loss of smell and/or taste sensation, constipation or diarrhea and also the duration of these symptoms were checked. Additionally, the investigations that were conducted either laboratory or radiological."

The study was planned as a randomized prospective controlled study. Patients with Miller class 1 or 2 gingival recession who needs root coverage surgery in the Department of Periodontology were included in the study. The subepithelial connective tissue graft was obtained in each patient using the single incision technique from the region between the mesial of canine and the mesial of first molar in the palate. Connective tissue dimensions were approximately 10 × 5 × 2 mm. Finally, the incision line was sutured with 5/0 synthetic, nonabsorbable, sterile monofilament suture in the control group while L-PRF membrane was placed to the donor site in the test group before the suturing. Patients were evaluated using an ultrasonography device (MyLab™ Seven, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. USG measurements were performed on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 90 for palatal tissue thickness and tissue vascularization by an oral and maxillofacial radiologist with at least six years of experience. A 6-18 MHz intraoral probe was used in intraoral USG examinations. Sterile gel was applied to the intraoral probe and covered with a stretch film. Then, it was placed directly on the mucosal surface of the donor site in the palatal area. Mucosal thickness was evaluated using the B-mode of the device, and vascularization was evaluated using the color doppler and pulsed wave doppler modes of the device. The mean pulsatility index (PI) values of each patient were calculated and considered for statistical analysis. The power analyse of the study was performed for sample size calculation. Sample size was calculated using a statistical program (G*Power; Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany) for α = 0.05 and effect size = 0.26. The analyses revealed that 10 subjects per group achieved a power of 80 % with 95% confidence. The data were analysed with the SPSS 21 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to detect data's normality. For the comparison of the parameters of the study groups, independent samples T-test test was used for normally distributed data while Mann Whitney U test test was performed as non-parametric test. Within-group comparisons between the different time periods were tested with repeated measures of ANOVA. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple variations. The statistical significance value was accepted as p < 0.05."

910,"The study aims to investigate the treatment of couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Eligible couples will be recruited for the study after providing informed written consent following counseling. The IVF protocol involves various steps. Women will undergo preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) as clinically indicated. Ovarian stimulation will be carried out using gonadotropin injections, and regular ultrasound monitoring will be conducted to track the growth of follicles. To prevent a premature LH surge, progestin primed ovarian stimulation or a GnRH antagonist will be administered. Once at least three follicles reach a size of over 17 mm, a trigger injection of either human chorionic gonadotrophin or a GnRH agonist will be given to induce final maturation. Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after the trigger under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The recruited women will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the microfluidic chip group or the density gradient centrifugation group. Randomization and blinding will be ensured to maintain the integrity of the study. Only the laboratory staff involved in sperm preparation will be aware of the group assignment, while the women and clinicians will be blinded to the treatment groups. Semen specimens will be collected by masturbation on the day of oocyte retrieval, following a period of 2-7 days of sexual abstinence. The semen samples will undergo evaluation according to WHO guidelines, including semen volume, sperm concentration, and percent motile spermatozoa. Sperm DNA damage will be assessed using an alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. The extent of DNA damage in spermatozoa will be examined using specific parameters. Sperm preparation will be performed based on the randomization list. In the microfluidic chip group, the Sperm Separation Device will be used, and the prepared sample will be collected in a test tube. In the density gradient centrifugation group, sperm preparation will be completed using a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation method, and the resulting sperm pellet will be washed and resuspended. Oocytes will be fertilized through intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and normal fertilization will be confirmed by the presence of two pronuclei. A few cells will be taken from the blastocysts for comprehensive chromosome analysis. Cryopreservation of all blastocysts will be done, and only euploid blastocysts without aneuploidies will be replaced in subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycles. Frozen embryo transfer (FET) will be performed in subsequent natural or hormonal replacement cycles, depending on the women's menstrual cycle regularity. Pregnancy outcomes will be monitored through urine pregnancy tests and transvaginal ultrasounds. If the pregnancy test is positive, further ultrasounds will be done to confirm fetal viability and the number of fetuses. Pregnancy and delivery data will be retrieved after delivery, and information on pregnancy outcomes, number of babies born, birth weights, and obstetric complications will be recorded. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of the two different sperm preparation methods and their impact on IVF outcomes, including pregnancy rates and obstetric complications."

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the upper airway. It is characterized by nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sneezing, and itching of the nose and eyes. The prevalence of AR is increasing worldwide. The pathogenesis of AR is complex and involves multiple factors, including genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. The pathogenesis of AR is complex and involves multiple factors, including genetic, environmental, and immunological factors. Genetic factors play an important role in the development of AR. Several studies have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to the immune system, such as the interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13 genes, are associated with the risk of AR. In addition, environmental factors, such as exposure to allergens and air pollution, can also increase the risk of AR. Immunological factors, such as the production of immunoglobulin E (IgE) and the activation of T helper 2 (Th2) cells, are also involved in the pathogenesis of AR.

916,"Inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, leading to chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) and contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the world's population is inactive and older adults are at highest risk. Inactivity in older adults is linked to age-related diseases and cognitive decline. Inactivity also imposes social costs through increased medical expenses, which are already high among the growing older adult population in the US. Incentive-based interventions have gained popularity among behavioral scientists and policymakers as a tool for improving health-related behaviors. But there are drawbacks - first, monetary incentives are often not cost-effective, and therefore scalability is limited. Second, behaviors often return to baseline when monetary incentives are removed, i.e., healthy habits are hard to maintain when incentives are limited in duration. Third, there is a concern that monetary incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation to engage in health-promoting behaviors. In light of the limited success of incentive-based behavior change programs, the investigators propose to design and evaluate alternative incentives that address these challenges of scalability, habit formation and crowd-out. The investigators will aim to encourage physical activity through alternative incentives - by making a meal donations on behalf of participants (prosocial incentives) and give participants monetary incentives (personal incentives). Both types of incentives have underpinnings in behavioral economics. Meal donations harness prosocial preferences, which may be more powerful and less likely to reduce intrinsic motivation than equivalent monetary incentives. The overall aim is to evaluate the impact of alternative incentives on step count of older adults in the short-term and long-term. Exploratory analysis will also evaluate the impact on physical and mental health. The investigators will recruit 200 older adults and randomize half of them to receive additional prosocial and personal incentives for their walking behavior. The other half will not receive these incentives. The investigators will track step count of these two groups for 8 weeks using a Fitbit device. Under the treatment functionality, participants accrue a meal donation and a point for Feeding America for each day that they meet the step goal. The investigators plan to recruit older adults ages 55 and above at grocery stores and other locations around San Diego, CA. Recruitment will be on a rolling basis. PI Samek has recruited participants at grocery stores in prior studies, hence the investigators believe this is feasible. Participation will be limited to individuals who own a smart phone (61% of older adults in the US own a smart phone, and the investigators expect this number to grow as the population ages). Studies have shown that older adults are open to using app-based technologies, for example older adults are accepting of mindfulness apps. The research team will be given access to participants' Fitbit data through Fitabase, a research platform that collects data from internet connected consumer activity devices. The investigators identified 7,500 steps as an appropriate goal as studies show older adults walk 4,000 steps on average. For the treatment group, meals will be donated by the research team to Feeding America for each day they meet the step goal of 7,500 steps. They will also receive money for each day they meet the step goal of 7,500 steps a day, for up to 5 days a week. The control group will not receive these incentives for their walking behavior, but their daily step count data will be collected. Participants will receive a Fitbit upon enrollment. The investigators will collect their physical activity data for 1 week, as their baseline physical activity. After 1 week, individuals who on average less than 6000 per day, will be randomized to the treatment group, which receives the incentives for 5 weeks, or to a control group which does not. The investigators will also collect follow up data for 2 weeks. Individuals who on average walk more than 6000 steps per day during the 1 week baseline period will be dropped from the study."

The CTI-PS model is based on the principles of recovery and peer support. The CTI-PS model is designed to help individuals with serious mental illness to transition from inpatient care to community-based care. The CTI-PS model is delivered by Community Mental Health Workers (CMHWs) and Peer Support Workers (PSWs). The CMHWs and PSWs will be selected, recruited, and trained by members of the research team to deliver mental health care according to the manualized recovery-oriented program. Ongoing regular supervision of PSWs and CMHWs, in weekly meetings, will be conducted throughout the study by members of the research team trained in CTI-PS by those who originally developed it at the Columbia University. Those allocated to the intervention group will receive usual care and, in addition, CTI-PS services over a 9-month period. The intervention has two broad objectives: 1) to collaborate with participants to develop durable connections to support systems, including both formal and informal supports (e.g., mental health services, primary care clinics, family, and friends); and 2) to provide practical and emotional support, helping the individual to overcome a critical period of transition during which they can feel especially vulnerable. The work of CTI workers is specifically designed to avoid becoming the primary source of care for the individual."

-----------------
Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. Despite the widespread use of coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) for the diagnosis of CAD, the management of patients with non-obstructive CAD is still a matter of debate. In fact, while the management of patients with obstructive CAD is established, as it revolves around further diagnostic test for ischemia evaluation or upfront coronary artery revascularization, this is not the case for patients with non-obstructive CAD. However, these cohort of patients still has a significant risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) that could be prevented by implementing adequate medical therapy. To date, many approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue. However, these proposed solutions lack the ability to provide quantitative and reproducible results with a sufficiently strong predictive value, are often proposed as a stand-alone solution without the integration with multiple prognosticator imaging and clinical parameters, and are not delivered through platforms capable of providing external validation and easy integration in the clinical workflow. Among the proposed prognostic approaches, some are based on the qualitative evaluation of coronary artery plaque features, such as positive remodeling, low attenuation of the plaque, presence of spotty calcification, and napkin ring sign [1,2], which is subject to significant inter-reader variability [3]. Other approaches rely on quantitative methods for evaluating atherosclerotic burden based on the extent of coronary artery plaques and their characteristics, such as calcium density, number of lesions, regional distribution, plaque volume, non-calcified plaque volume etc. [4]. However, these approaches may be hampered by low reproducibility, especially among different scanner vendors [5]. Interestingly, a new research has also shown that, besides coronary artery vessel wall characteristics, pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation carries significant predictive value, as it reflects the state of coronary inflammation that plays a key role in the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis [6]. All these CAD characteristics are often analyzed independently from one to another, reducing their potential synergistic prognostic value and creating redundant variables that have negligible effect on prognosis. We propose an AI-based analysis that can integrate all this data in order to select the most important determinant of CAD progression and to discard futile features, thus creating an agile and clinically valuable risk stratification model.Furthermore, we plan to create a novel imaging marker of CAD with unfavorable outcome, to be integrated in the AI-based model, which will be based on topological features of the coronary artery tree. In fact, data on the association between coronary artery topology (e.g., vessel-length, coronary artery volume index, cross-sectional area, curvature, and tortuositv) and prognosis is scarce. However, it is known that vessel tortuosity influences wall shear stress and leads to disruption of laminar flow, resulting in endothelial dysfunction and flow alterations that may lead to atherosclerosis, eventually causing adverse cardiac events [7]. Thus, this novel biomarker may carry a significant prognostic role. Based on these premises, our research aims to develop a novel clinical-imaging AI-based model to identify and categorize patients at high risk of disease progression and provide a more personalized management approach to improve patient outcomes. However, besides the primary objective of creating an AI-based model for CAD risk stratification, we aim to overcome some issues that currently hamper the widespread clinical application of AI in cardiovascular care. In fact, it is recognized that the integration of AI-based applications into the clinical workflow, which will increase usability and decrease costs, is currently lacking [8]. We aim to tackle these issues with the help of the industrial partners involved in this project that will build a platform capable of delivering the software solution to provide external validation of the algorithm. This platform will be characterized by state-of-the-art security measures, interoperability with current clinical software, and easy-to-use interface.

932,"1. Background of the study: The novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic has caused a serious impact on the health of the people and the social and economic development of the country. The clinical manifestations of novel coronavirus pneumonia are mainly fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc., and the disease is more serious in the elderly and patients with underlying diseases. The current recognized effective drugs for the treatment of novel coronavirus, such as Paxlovid, Molnupiravir, Remdesivir, glucocorticoid, monoclonal antibody, etc., are mainly used to prevent high-risk patients with novel coronavirus infection from becoming severe or to reduce the fatality rate. However, there is still a lack of effective modern medical treatment for promoting body recovery and improving exercise tolerance. New York Heart Association (NYHA) cardiac function scale, dyspnea scale and other measures to assess patients' activity ability, but such assessment measures are more dependent on patients' subjective feelings; Objective data evaluation has more clinical guiding value. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is simple, economical and safe, and can better reflect the exercise tolerance and cardiopulmonary function of patients. It is widely used to evaluate the efficacy and rehabilitation effect of patients with cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases. Although drugs can be used for symptomatic treatment such as cough and phlegm, there is no effective western medicine to relieve these symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, qi promotion of sweat, fear of wind and cold, loss of appetite and other symptoms. Citing an article on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus published by Nature, a top international scientific journal, it is believed that at the current stage, active research and development of drugs that can alleviate symptoms of novel coronavirus infection, promote the recovery of the disease and improve the quality of life, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of mild to moderate novel coronavirus patients will have huge public health benefits [7]. Jade screen, as a famous prescription for the treatment of surface deficiency syndrome, comes from Wei Yilin's Prescription for the effect of the World Medicine in the Yuan Dynasty (some researchers also believe that it comes from Zhu Zhenheng's Danxi Xin Method in the Yuan Dynasty). The party has the beneficial effect of gas-solid table stop sweat, attending table is not solid, spontaneous perspiration evil wind, complexion white, pale tongue moss thin white, pulse vain, run-down cou justified is susceptible to the wind. The jade screen is made of Astragalus, fried white art and windproof. Astragalus is mainly used for spleen and lung Qi deficiency, which is used to benefit Qi and solid surface, and is the king medicine. White art invigorating spleen and qi, helping astragalus qi and solid surface, as minister medicine; Windproof table and wind evil, as a tonic. However, there are few prospective clinical intervention studies on the use of Manzhi Guben granules for symptomatic supportive treatment during outpatient treatment of convalescent patients with novel coronavirus infection, and there is still a lack of high-quality clinical evidence-based medical evidence on its effectiveness in improving exercise tolerance of convalescent patients after novel coronavirus infection. This provides a good opportunity for the research of this project. By means of modern medical research, it is found that the main components of Manzhi Guben granules (Yupingfeng + Angelica sinensis) are: (1) Astragalus supplementing Qi and consolidating surface, antiviral infection, significant stimulation of interferon system, regulating and promoting humoral and cellular immunity; (2) Atractylodes atractylodes can nourish qi, invigorate spleen, dry dampness, enhance cellular and humoral immunity, and promote phagocytosis of macrophages; (3) Wind-proof and wind-dispelling, which can enhance immune function and fight infection; (4) Angelica sinensis: It has anti-thrombotic effect, improves blood circulation, improves coronary circulation in cardiovascular system, has anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect, lowers blood sugar effect, and has protective effect on lung. Some recent studies have found through modern pharmacological research means that a variety of active compounds in the prescription of Yupingfeng can play a role in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus infection through multi-target and multi-pathway [9,10], which further provides the basic theoretical basis for the clinical application of Man"
933,"The fast growth of Decision Neuroscience is contributing to unveil the cognitive processes underlying choices and their neural bases. The results obtained so far show that decision-making involves neural mechanisms underpinning a complex balance between automatic appetitive or aversive drives generated by subcortical structures, and processes of executive control centered in fronto-parietal brain networks. While the role of meso-limbic structures in reinforcement learning have been widely investigated, it is much less clear to what extent are choices shaped by a) individual differences in executive skills; b) contextual factors potentially interfering with such skills, such as knowing that the outcome of those choices will impact only on one's own vs. another's welfare. This a critical gap, since executive abilities are known to decline even in physiological ageing, thus potentially interfering with the quality of choices. On this ground, this single center non-interventional fMRI study aims to provide novel insights into the relationship between executive and decision-making skills, and their possible changes with ageing, in 150 healthy individuals. This goal will be pursued by combining a behavioral assessment of decision-making and executive skills with a multimodal fMRI session including data concerning a) brain activity associated with decision-making and executive functioning in social vs. non-social contexts, b) brain structural morphometry (grey-matter volume/density), and c) brain structural connectivity (diffusion weighted imaging). The behavioral assessment will involve the main metric of decision-making (e.g., risk aversion, loss aversion, delay discounting) and executive functioning (e.g., selective attention and inhibitory control). MRI data will unveil the neural bases of individual differences in decision-making and executive performance in terms of performance-related patterns of brain activity, structure and connectivity. Results will provide an useful baseline for investigating alterations of decision-making and executive functioning, and of their neural bases, in pathological conditions."

941,"The SENIOR RCT is a multicenter study conducted in two North Italian Scientific Hospitalization and Treatment Institution in Pavia on older malnourished adults (≥ 65 years old). The estimated duration is 24 months, which include 6 months of nutritional intervention and a follow-up after 6 months, with an preferred starting date on January 2024. The primary objective of the SENIOR RCT is the evaluation of the efficacy of a 6 months sustainable nutrition protocol on malnourished older adults participants (diagnosed with the most recent GLIM criteria) in comparison to the hospital standard of care. Therefore, the primary endpoint is the improvement of the nutritional status between pre- and post-intervention between experimental and control group measuring the change of body weight and strength (handgrip). Secondary objectives are the change pre- and post-intervention between experimental and control group for blood biomarkers, dietary habits, quality of life and evaluation of sarcopenia. Secondary endpoints are the change pre- and post-intervention between experimental and control group for blood biomarkers, MEDI-LITE score, SF-12, diet composition, phase angle and gait speed. Participants of this study are older adults over 65 previously enrolled in the SENIOR cross-sectional study and willing to participate to the RCT phase or new enrolled patients from the two hospitals in according to the eligible criteria. Malnutrition will be diagnosed according to GLIM criteria, using Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) as screening tool. The experimental group at the baseline will receive a nutritional assessment followed by the elaboration of a sustainable and personalized nutritional protocol by qualified dietitians. The intervention will last 6 months with a monthly evaluation of the dietary consumption of the previous 24 hour (recall-24h), followed by a final follow-up after additional 6 months.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a community pharmacy-based program to enhance adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) among breast cancer survivors. The program is based on the principles of motivational interviewing and includes a web site for women and a web-based training for pharmacists. The program will be evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial. The study will be carried out in approximately 66 pharmacies in the Quebec province (33 will be assigned to the control group and 33 to the intervention group), which include approximately 132 women (66 in the control group and 66 in the intervention group). At the end of the follow-up, pharmacists and women in the control group can, if desired, receive certain tools offered in the intervention group. Pharmacists and participating women will be asked to completed two questionnaires: the first before randomization and the second at the end of the follow-up 6 months later. At the end of the study, 20-30 pharmacists and 20-30 patients will be invited to take part in a semi-structured individual interview (qualitative component) in order to gather their point of view and their experience with the care and services received in relation to AET. The characteristics of pharmacies, pharmacists and patients in the intervention and control groups will be compared. Indicators of acceptability and feasibility will be measured (e.g. recruitment and participation and retention rates). Generalized Estimating Equation (GEE) regression models will be used to compare patterns of changes in scores of factors expected to influence AET experience and adherence in the two groups and between study entry and 6 months later. The main analyzes will be performed on a intention-to-treat basis. For the qualitative component, a thematic analysis will be carried out based on the transcriptions of the semi-structured interviews. The quantitative and qualitative results will be used to optimize the PACHA program, its implementation and to design, if the results support this, a large-scale randomized controlled trial.

952,"The aim of the current study is to further investigate the beneficial effects of a formulated M. officinalis extract in phytosome form (Phytosome®). The phytosome technology utilizes phospholipids derived from sunflowers as an element capable of modulating the absorption kinetics of plant-derived molecules, with the intention of optimizing the product's efficacy with the lowest effective dosage. The phytosome technology represents a potentially useful approach in optimizing the administration of M. officinalis extract, applicable to the described literature-based applications. Phytosome® is composed of a dry extract of Berberis aristata root (550mg/cpr), complexed with phospholipids (soy lecithin), Pisum sativa proteins, and proanthocyanidin oligomers from Vitis vinifera. The Melissa Phytosome-based product used has been registered with the Italian Ministry of Health. The specific application of interest is the induction and enhancement of physiological sleep dynamics. The primary objective is to assess the duration of sleep using specific wearable devices, quantifying total sleep duration as well as the duration of deep sleep, light sleep, and REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. Sleep monitoring will be performed using the Garmin VenuSQ wrist device, a wearable smartwatch to be worn on the left wrist during the day and throughout the sleep monitoring period. The data will be recorded by the Garmin Connect application (Garmin Ltd), which monitors sleep duration in different phases and allows for data extraction. The devices will be provided to the participants by the recruiting center for the duration of the entire study (6 weeks; 5 weeks of study plus 1 week of training). The device enables the extraction of sleep phase durations for each subject at the end of the study [Burgett et al., 2019]. The secondary objectives are: Monitoring subjective perceptions of sleep quality using the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), a validated psychometric instrument for assessing the severity of nocturnal components of insomnia. It is often used as a measure of treatment response in clinical research. Assessing perceived anxiety levels using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), a validated psychometric questionnaire consisting of 40 items on a Likert scale. The STAI measures two types of anxiety: state anxiety and trait anxiety. Evaluating the improvement in quality of life using the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I), which is used to measure the improvement in quality of life associated with sleep disorder improvement. The CGI-I assesses the overall improvement of a subject's symptoms compared to baseline, with scores ranging from 1 (''very much improved'') to 7 (''very much worse''). Monitoring any adverse effects using the DOTES scale. The DOTES considers 33 symptoms collected into six clusters (behavior and/or psychiatric symptoms, laboratory findings, neurological symptoms, neuro-vegetative symptoms, cardiovascular symptoms, and other symptoms), evaluated using Likert scales. Allocation of Sleep Monitoring Devices The devices will be configured to create a remote-accessible account for each participant, allowing researchers to record sleep-related data. The devices will be collected at the end of the monitoring period and, after an appropriate reset and reconfiguration process, will be assigned to new subjects for monitoring. Allocation of Nutraceutical Preparations The verum and placebo products will be packaged in indistinguishable separate containers, labeled with alphanumeric codes, and placed inside a dedicated kit. Each kit should contain 14 doses consisting of either 2 tablets of 200 mg Melissa phytosome or 2 tablets with an equivalent form, color, flavor, and coating. The evaluated subjects will be instructed to take the 2 tablets 30 minutes before bedtime according to the following schedule: 14 days of kit 1 use 7-day washout period 14 days of kit 2 use The assessment questionnaires will be administered via a computerized platform with the following timelines: T0 T15 T36 The alphanumeric keys related to the classification of products as treated/placebo will only be made available to the researchers after the data processing has been completed."

S-ENG is a stepped, modular intervention that was developed to allow personalization to a given subject's needs, preferences, and individualized barriers to social connection. Early sessions include psychoeducation on the importance of social connection; a values clarification exercise on aspects of connection most important to subjects; and assessment of current social networks and social activities. Together, the coach and subject create a conceptualization of reasons for loneliness and identify personalized activities most likely to impact loneliness. The primary activity is 'action planning,' which involves selecting a social goal for the week, brainstorming ways to meet the goal, identifying barriers, and selecting specific actions to take before the next session. The first 8 sessions are offered weekly and the final two are monthly booster sessions.<br>|

-----------------
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects the brain, spinal cord and optic nerves. The disease is characterized by the presence of demyelinating plaques, which are areas of damage to the myelin sheath that surrounds and protects the nerve fibers. The most common symptoms of MS are fatigue, cognitive impairment, and balance disorders. These symptoms can have a significant impact on the quality of life of patients with MS and can lead to difficulties in performing activities of daily living (ADLs).

Technological rehabilitation is a type of rehabilitation that uses technology to help patients improve their physical and cognitive abilities. Technological rehabilitation can be used to treat a variety of conditions, including MS. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the use of technological rehabilitation to treat balance disorders in patients with MS.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of technological rehabilitation in improving balance, cognitive function, and ADLs in patients with MS. The study will be conducted at the Multiple Sclerosis Center of the University of Rome ""La Sapienza"".

Study design
-----------------
The study will be a randomized, controlled, cross-over pilot study. The study will include 20 patients with MS who will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group (HO, Hunova-Observation) and the control group (OH, Observation-Hunova).

Intervention
-----------------
The experimental group (HO, Hunova-Observation) will undergo a specific rehabilitation treatment for balance disorders using the robotic platform Hunova® Movendo Technology srl, Genova, IT), for 4 weeks, 3 times a week for 45 minutes each. In particular, the technological rehabilitation carried out with the platform will have as main objective the improvement of balance, both in sitting and standing position, and static and dynamic exercises, dual-task exercises and exercises to improve trunk control will be proposed. Afterwards, patients will undergo 4 weeks of observation without rehabilitation treatment.

The control group (OH, Observation-Hunova) will undergo 4 weeks of observation without rehabilitation treatment, followed by specific rehabilitation treatment for balance disorders using the robotic platform Hunova® Movendo Technology srl, Genova, IT), for 4 weeks, 3 times a week for 45 minutes each. In particular, the technological rehabilitation carried out with the platform will have as main objective the improvement of balance, both in sitting and standing position, and static and dynamic exercises, dual-task exercises and exercises to improve trunk control will be proposed.

Outcome measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), which is used to objectively determine a patient's ability(or inability) to safely balance during a series of predetermined tasks. It is a 14item list with each item consisting of a five-point ordinal scale ranging from 0 to 4,with 0 indicating the lowest level of function and 4 the highest level of function andtakes approximately 20 minutes to complete. It does not include the assessmentof gait.

The secondary outcome measures will be the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Function (FSMC), the Timed Up and Go test (TUG), the Ambulation Index (AI), the Walking handicap scale (WHS), the Functional Ambulation Classification (FAC), the 10 Meter Walk Test (10mWT), the Six-minute walk test (6MWT), the Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale (MSWS-12), the Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale (MSIS-29), the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II), the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-Y1 and Y2), the Stroop Colour Word Test (SCWT) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT).

Thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs) are a group of rare diseases characterized by the presence of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia. The most common TMAs are thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). TMAs are life-threatening diseases, and early diagnosis and treatment are essential to improve the prognosis. However, the diagnosis of TMAs is often delayed due to the lack of awareness and the non-specific clinical presentation. The current diagnostic approach for TMAs is based on the measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and haptoglobin (Hp) levels, as well as the presence of schistocytes on peripheral blood smear. However, these tests are not always sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of TMAs.

970,"The aim of the project is to develop an innovative fountain faucet to enable individuals living with SCI to access water more independently for basic activities of daily living. The faucet incorporates electromechanical controls and software programs that adjust spray outlets, spray angles, and water temperatures. A proximity sensor and voice recognition function allow users to control the faucet through a smart speaker. These features enable precise dispensing of water at the desired temperature and volume, while a camera and other sensors enable hands-free operation. Subjects, including individuals living with SCI and controls, were recruited from an outpatient rehabilitation clinic to test the functionality of the faucet including eye gaze, voice, and motion sensors to control the water stream for drinking, rinsing, and grooming. The examiner screened the subjects to determine their levels of functional independence (independent, modified independent, assistance required, and dependent). The participants were also interviewed regarding their current methods of drinking, rinsing, and grooming. The percentage and standard deviation of individuals in each level of independence for each function were calculated. A t-test was conducted to determine any significant differences in the dependence levels between the tested subjects and the control group."

973,"The proposed regional mental healthcare hub aims to deliver equitable, efficacious, and cost-effective AI-driven online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific online cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) programs for post-secondary students in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington (KFL&A) region. The initiative will target a broad population of students ranging from those interested in learning more about mental health (online psychoeducation program) to those seeking additional help for their psychiatric symptoms (e-CBT program). Our research team is strongly experienced in designing effective AI-assisted online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs for various mental health conditions in diverse populations. Therefore, being as effective as in-person methods of healthcare delivery, it is hypothesized that our online interventions disseminated via a robust implementation science and community collaboration strategy will be a feasible, cost-effective, and pragmatic solution to address accessibility issues with post-secondary student mental healthcare. The proposed mental health hub will offer a comprehensive care model using a stepped-care approach. Its implementation will be guided by a rigorous approach involving seven aims divided into three phases (pre-adoption, delivery, and post-adoption phases). (1) Pre-adoption phase: will assess post-secondary students' current mental health landscape through surveys and focus groups (Aim 1). This information will be used in the development of a 6-week online psychoeducation (Aim 2) and 12-week diagnosis-specific e-CBT (Aim 3) programs. The psychoeducation program will be followed by 6-months of AI-assisted journaling exercises to monitor the student's mental health and determine whether they would benefit from stepping up their care to receive the diagnosis-specific e-CBT program. The diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs will be adapted from prior clinically validated and diagnosis-specific psychotherapy modules developed by the lab. Four diagnosis-specific modules will support the most common mental health disorders in students (GAD, SAD, MDD and ADHD), as indicated by previous studies and the research team's cross-sectional survey of students in Ontario, Canada. Both programs will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT) - a secure cloud-based platform co-developed by the PI that offers online mental health interventions. (2) Delivery phase: will determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the online psychoeducation (Aim 4) and diagnosis-specific e-CBT (Aim 5) programs by comparing them to treatment, as usual, using validated clinical assessment tools. (3) Post-adoption phase: will use the collected data to monitor the success and fidelity of the programs using surveys and focus groups (Aim 6), and to build capacity and scale the project to other Canadian municipalities (Aim 7). As such, in contrast to other initiatives that target student mental health, this will be the first to involve students and end-users in all phases, from conception to implementation. The digital nature of this healthcare program and the implementation of AI technology results in new solutions that enable easier accessibility and broader reach to individuals in significant need of mental healthcare services. Therefore, to support the development of these mental healthcare resources, the research team has assembled a diverse, cross-functional interdisciplinary team of community leaders, including researchers, clinicians, health decision-makers, and end-users. Ultimately, leveraging the extensive expertise of a cross-functional research team, the objective of the study is to develop and implement a successful and effective digital care plan with the potential to improve post-secondary student mental health care substantially."

The evidence for the efficacy of whole-body hypothermia in the treatment of moderate or severe HIE is based on two large randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in the UK and the USA. The UK trial (N = 100) showed that whole-body hypothermia was associated with a 20% reduction in the risk of death or disability at 18 months of age. The US trial (N = 135) showed that whole-body hypothermia was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of death or disability at 18 months of age. The UK trial also showed that whole-body hypothermia was associated with a 30% reduction in the risk of death or disability at 2 years of age.

979,"1. Background and rationale {6a}
The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pTTL, a novel T cell immunotherapy, in patients with advanced CRC. pTTL is a personalised cell product for adoptive cancer immunotherapy containing in vitro expanded T cells stimulated with patient-specific tumour neoantigens derived from tumour-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs). The study will be conducted in two parts: Part I will be a dose-escalation study to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pTTL. Part II will be a dose-expansion study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pTTL at the MTD.
Part I will include a maximum of 10 patients. The first patient will receive a dose of 1 million viable cells per kg body weight. If this dose is well tolerated, the next 3 patients will receive a dose of 2.5 million viable cells per kg body weight. If this dose is well tolerated, the next 3 patients will receive a dose of 5 million viable cells per kg body weight. If this dose is well tolerated, the remaining patients will receive a dose of up to 1 billion viable cells per kg body weight.
Part II will include a maximum of 20 patients. The dose of pTTL will be determined based on the results of Part I.
The primary objective of Part I is to establish the MTD of pTTL. The primary objective of Part II is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pTTL at the MTD.
The secondary objectives of Part I and Part II are to evaluate the kinetics of tumour progression/growth, overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival.

987,"The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of continuous 'home' EEG to accurately diagnose Narcolepsy and demonstrate response to treatment.

Background
-----------------
Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder that affects approximately 1 in 2000 people. It is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone). The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) criteria. The gold standard for diagnosis is a combination of polysomnography (PSG) and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). However, these tests are expensive, time-consuming and require specialist equipment and staff. In addition, they are not always available in all hospitals. There is a need for a more accessible and cost-effective method of diagnosing narcolepsy. 

The Dreem Headband is a wearable device that measures brain activity using electroencephalography (EEG). It has been shown to be effective in detecting sleep stages and sleep disorders. The Dreem Headband has been used in a number of studies to diagnose narcolepsy. In a study of 100 patients with suspected narcolepsy, the Dreem Headband was able to accurately diagnose narcolepsy in 90% of cases. In a study of 50 patients with confirmed narcolepsy, the Dreem Headband was able to accurately diagnose narcolepsy in 80% of cases. 

The Dreem Headband has the potential to revolutionise the diagnosis of narcolepsy. It is a non-invasive, cost-effective and accessible method of diagnosing narcolepsy. It could be used in a variety of settings, including primary care, sleep clinics and hospitals. The Dreem Headband could also be used to monitor the progression of narcolepsy and to assess the response to treatment. 

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to assess the ability of continuous 'home' EEG to accurately diagnose Narcolepsy Type 1 derived by Dreem Headband compared to standard ICSD-3 protocol. The secondary objective is to assess the ability of continuous 'home' EEG to accurately diagnose Narcolepsy Type 1 derived by Dreem Headband compared to standard ICSD-3 protocol. The tertiary objective is to assess the ability of continuous 'home' EEG to accurately diagnose Narcolepsy Type 1 derived by Dreem Headband compared to standard ICSD-3 protocol.

Design
-----------------
This is a prospective observational study.

Intervention

Participants will be asked to wear the Dreem Headband for a period of 7 days. The Dreem Headband will be used to measure brain activity and sleep stages. The data will be analysed using the Dreem software."
988,"1. Background of the Study
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch in reducing pain induced by intravenous cannulation in adult patients undergoing cataract or glaucoma surgeries.

2. Rationale of the Study
The use of microneedle patches for the delivery of topical anaesthetics is a novel approach that has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and discomfort associated with venipuncture and intravenous cannulation. Microneedles are tiny needles that are used to deliver drugs directly into the skin. They are made of biodegradable materials such as polymers or sugars, and they are designed to be painless and non-invasive.

3. Objectives of the Study
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch in reducing pain induced by intravenous cannulation in adult patients undergoing cataract or glaucoma surgeries. The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch in adult patients undergoing cataract or glaucoma surgeries.

4. Study Design
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. The study will be conducted in two phases: Phase I: Single-center, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the optimal dose of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch. Phase II: Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch in adult patients undergoing cataract or glaucoma surgeries.

5. Study Population
The study population will consist of adult patients (aged 18 years or older) who are scheduled to undergo cataract or glaucoma surgeries.

6. Study Interventions
In Phase I, the study interventions will consist of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patches containing different doses of lignocaine (0.5 mg, 1 mg, 2 mg, 4 mg, and 8 mg). In Phase II, the study interventions will consist of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch (4 mg) and placebo (no active ingredient).

7. Study Outcomes
The primary outcome measure in Phase I will be the pain intensity score measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 1 minute after intravenous cannulation. The primary outcome measure in Phase II will be the pain intensity score measured using a VAS at 1 minute after intravenous cannulation. The secondary outcome measures in both phases will include the time to onset of pain relief, the duration of pain relief, the incidence of adverse events, and the patient's satisfaction with the treatment.

8. Study Duration
The study duration will be approximately 12 months.

9. Study Locations
The study will be conducted in multiple centers in Malaysia.

10. Study Funding
The study is funded by the University of Malaya.

11. Study Status
The study is currently in the recruitment phase.

12. Ethical Considerations
The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University of Malaya. All participants will provide written informed consent before participating in the study.

13. Discussion
The use of microneedle patches for the delivery of topical anaesthetics is a novel approach that has the potential to revolutionize the way we manage pain associated with venipuncture and intravenous cannulation. This study will provide valuable information on the efficacy and safety of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch in adult patients undergoing cataract or glaucoma surgeries. If successful, this study will pave the way for the development of new and innovative treatments for pain management in the healthcare setting."

The investigators hypothesis is that patients with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline have a different brain perfusion pattern compared to healthy controls and that this pattern is associated with neuropsychological test scores, CSF and blood biomarkers, and conversion to dementia. The study design is a prospective cohort study. The investigators will recruit 100 patients with mild cognitive impairment or subjective cognitive decline and 100 healthy controls. All participants will undergo brain 3 Tesla MRI with pCASL sequence and FDG-PET. In addition, all participants will undergo lumbar puncture and blood sampling. All participants will be followed for 2 years."

995,"The vaginal microbiota has a significant bearing on a woman's mental and physical health at every stage of life. A balanced microflora of the vaginal environment (eubiosis) consists of a predominant presence of lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacilli ensure the maintenance of an acidic pH that effectively makes the environment inhospitable to pathogens by preventing infection and protecting the genital tract. At the end of the reproductive period, the reduction of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, results in a decrease in the lactobacillus component with consequent depletion of the vaginal microbiota and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential human nutrient found mainly in oily fruits. It is a fat-soluble molecule with high antioxidant power. Topically administered, it not only plays a key role in protecting epithelial cell membranes from oxidative damage but is also able to modulate bacterial growth by contributing to pH acidification. The latter feature, in the vaginal canal, creates a favorable environment for the lactobacilli flora, positively affecting the microbial population and thus contributing to the prevention of all those problems related to increased vaginal sensitivity to pathogens during menopause. In addition, recent data show that vitamin E can counteract the production of biofilm produced by certain pathogens, which has detrimental effects on the homeostasis of the vaginal environment. The period of observation is from January 1st, 2020 to December, 31st, 2022, while the Data Collection period will be from June, 30th, 2023 to July, 31st, 2023"
996,"Background
-----------------
Polycythemia vera (PV) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by increased red blood cell (RBC) mass and elevated hematocrit (HCT) and hemoglobin (Hb) levels. The diagnosis of PV is based on the presence of the JAK2V617F mutation, which is present in approximately 95% of cases. The clinical manifestations of PV include symptoms related to increased RBC mass, such as headache, fatigue, and pruritus, as well as an increased risk of thrombosis. The treatment of PV typically involves the use of hydroxyurea, which reduces the production of RBCs and lowers HCT and Hb levels. However, the use of hydroxyurea can be associated with side effects, such as anemia and neutropenia. In addition to hydroxyurea, other treatments for PV include interferon-alpha and ruxolitinib, which are targeted therapies that inhibit the JAK2V617F mutation. The prognosis for patients with PV is generally good, with a median survival of approximately 15-20 years. However, the risk of thrombosis and other complications remains a concern, and patients with PV should be closely monitored for these potential complications.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the Hematocrit to Hemoglobin Ratio in patients with polycythemia vera (PV) and secondary erythrocytosis. The secondary objective is to determine the Red Blood Cell Distribution Width in patients with PV and secondary erythrocytosis.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a cross-sectional study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include patients with PV and secondary erythrocytosis.

Intervention
-----------------
No intervention will be performed in this study.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the Hematocrit to Hemoglobin Ratio in patients with PV and secondary erythrocytosis. The secondary outcome measure will be the Red Blood Cell Distribution Width in patients with PV and secondary erythrocytosis.

Data Collection
-----------------
Data will be collected through medical records and laboratory tests.

Data Analysis
-----------------
The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations for continuous variables and frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. The Hematocrit to Hemoglobin Ratio and Red Blood Cell Distribution Width will be compared between patients with PV and secondary erythrocytosis using appropriate statistical tests.

Ethics and Dissemination
-----------------
The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Sohag university hospital. The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific conferences."
