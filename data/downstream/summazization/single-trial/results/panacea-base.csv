-----------------
Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition that affects 15% of the population. It is characterized by urinary urgency, frequency and nocturia. The first line treatment is anticholinergic medication. However, 30-50% of patients do not respond to this treatment. The second line treatment is onabotulinum toxin A (Botox) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM). Botox is a toxin that is injected into the bladder wall. It is effective in 50-80% of patients. SNM is a surgical procedure that involves implanting a small device in the lower back. It is effective in 60-80% of patients. However, there is no consensus on which treatment is the best for patients with OAB. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) is a method that can be used to measure patient preferences for different treatments. It involves asking patients to choose between two fictive treatments, each option comes with it's own botox and SNM characteristics. The DCE will be used to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy. The results of the DCE will be used to inform clinical decision making.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to measure patient preferences for second line OAB therapy.

9,"1. Background and rationale: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is a chronic condition that requires lifelong management to prevent complications. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is a technology that can help people with T1D manage their blood glucose levels more effectively. CGM devices measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid continuously and provide real-time data to the user. This information can help people with T1D make more informed decisions about their diabetes management, such as adjusting insulin doses, dietary choices, or physical activity levels. However, the use of CGM devices is not widespread in South Africa due to a lack of evidence on their effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. In addition, there is limited evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use on blood glucose levels in people living with T1D in South Africa. The secondary objectives are to assess the impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 3. Study design: This is a three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled study. The study will be conducted in three study clinics in South Africa. The study will enroll 150 participants who will be randomly assigned to one of the three study arms: Arm 1: continuous CGM use; Arm 2: intermittent CGM use; Arm 3: standard of care (control). The study will be conducted over a period of 15 months. 4. Study population: The study population will include people living with T1D who are attending for diabetes care at the study clinics. The study will also include caregivers of children/adolescents living with T1D and healthcare providers involved in clinical care at the study sites. 5. Study interventions: The study interventions will include continuous and intermittent CGM use, standard of care, and qualitative methods. 6. Study outcomes: The primary study outcome will be the change in HbA1c levels before and after treatment in standard of care, continuous, and intermittent CGM arms. The secondary study outcomes will include the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes, unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications, quality of life of recipients of care and their caregivers (where applicable), acceptability and feasibility of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a healthcare provider, recipients of care and care givers perspective, and cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. 7. Study methods: The study will use a mixed methods approach, including quantitative and qualitative methods. The study will use a range of data collection methods, including surveys, interviews, and focus group discussions. 8. Study analysis: The study will use a range of statistical and analytical methods to analyze the study data. The study will use descriptive statistics to summarize the study data, and inferential statistics to test the study hypotheses. The study will also use qualitative methods to analyze the study data. 9. Study dissemination: The study results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations, and other appropriate channels. The study results will also be shared with the study participants and other stakeholders. 10. Study limitations: The study has several limitations, including the potential for selection bias, the potential for measurement bias, and the potential for confounding. The study will use a range of methods to minimize these limitations. 11. Study implications: The study results will have important implications for the management of T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries. The study results will provide evidence on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of continuous and intermittent CGM use in people living with T1D in South Africa. The study results will also provide evidence on the feasibility and acceptability of CGM use in South Africa. The study results will inform policy and decision-making related to the use of CGM devices in people living with T1D in South Africa and other low- and middle-income countries."

11,"Background
-----------------
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways, characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing, breathlessness, chest tightness and coughing, particularly at night or in the early morning. It is the most common chronic disease in childhood, with a prevalence of 10% in children aged 12-17 years. The disease is characterized by a high variability in the clinical course, with a significant impact on the quality of life of patients and their families. The main objective of asthma treatment is to control symptoms and prevent exacerbations. The treatment plan is based on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2 agonists (LABA), which are the mainstay of asthma treatment. However, adherence to treatment is often poor, especially in children, and this can lead to poor control of the disease and an increased risk of exacerbations. In recent years, the use of digital technologies in the management of chronic diseases has been increasingly studied. In particular, the use of serious games (SG) has been proposed as a tool to improve adherence to treatment and to promote a healthy lifestyle in children with asthma. SG are interactive games that are designed to promote learning and behavior change. They can be used to educate patients about their disease and to promote healthy behaviors, such as physical activity and healthy eating. In this study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma. The SG will be designed to be fun and engaging, and will be based on the principles of gamification. The SG will be used in conjunction with a standard treatment plan, and patients will be followed for six months. The primary outcome of the study will be adherence to treatment, as measured by the number of days of treatment taken and the number of exacerbations. Secondary outcomes will include quality of life, as measured by the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL), and the Skills and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Ita). The study will be conducted in collaboration with the Italian National Research Council (CNR) and will involve 60 children with asthma. The study will be conducted in two groups: one group will receive the SG in addition to the standard treatment plan, while the other group will receive the standard treatment plan only. The study will be conducted in a randomized, controlled trial design. The results of the study will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SG in improving adherence to treatment and quality of life in children with asthma.

SG will include an adaptive tool to enable the experience based on the child's specific motor skills. The dynamics of SG will be adapted by considering real motor and physiological data acquired during each SG session via a wristband. These data are necessary to keep the child in the aerobic zone (60-80% of maximum heart rate). The movements are: Side bending: Moving an obstacle to open a passage.

13,"1. Background:

The investigators hypothesize that the current practice of weaning infants off of CPAP too early is associated with an increased risk of lung injury and poor lung growth.

2. Objectives:

The investigators aim to determine whether a standardized maintenance/weaning protocol for CPAP will reduce the number of infants who fail to wean off of CPAP.

3. Study Design:

This is a multicenter, non-blinded, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks CGA exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations. The control group will be weaned according to the unit's or medical team's practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations"

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the incidence of HF diagnosis in outpatient settings, urgent heart failure visit, heart failure hospitalization, and prescription for guideline recommended HF therapies in patients diagnosed with HFrEF within 6 months.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be patients with at least two additional risk factors for HF. Male or female > 40 years of age Informed consent At least two additional risk factors for Heart Failure (HF): Coronary artery disease (either a previous documented type 1 myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass grafting or percutaneous coronary intervention or documented stenosis or an epicardial coronary artery (50% left main stem or >70% left anterior descending, circumflex or right coronary artery)). Diabetes type 1 or 2. Persistent or permanent atrial fibrillation. Previous ischemic or embolic stroke. Peripheral artery disease (previous surgical or percutaneous revascularization or documented stenosis >50% of major peripheral arterial vessel. Chronic kidney disease (defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)<60 milliliters per minute (mL/min)/1.73m2 or eGFR 60-90 mL/min/1.73m2 and urine albumin-creatinine ration (UACR) >300mg/g). Regular loop diuretic use for >30 days within 12 months prior to consent. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) evidenced by one of the following: Pulmonary Function Test (PFT) showing airway obstruction, diagnosis of respiratory physician, CT scan reporting presence of emphysema, or treatment with national guidance advocated COPD therapy. Exclusion Criteria: Inability to give informed consent (e.g. due to significant cognitive impairment). Previous diagnosis of heart failure. This is any diagnosis of heart failure with any ejection fraction of any cause. Renal replacement therapy. Anyone who, in the investigator's opinion, is not suitable to participate in the trial for other reasons e.g., a diagnosis which may compromise survival over the study period.

Propofol is a widely used intravenous anesthetic agent. It is a short-acting anesthetic agent that is used in the induction and maintenance of anesthesia. It is a lipophilic drug that is rapidly distributed in the body and has a short half-life. It is metabolized in the liver and excreted in the urine. Propofol is a safe and effective anesthetic agent, but it can cause adverse effects such as respiratory depression, hypotension, and bradycardia. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction varies depending on the patient's weight. The recommended dose of propofol for anesthesia induction is 2-2.5 mg/kg for adults. However, the dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may vary depending on the patient's weight. Patients with a higher body weight may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients with a lower body weight may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's age, gender, and medical history. Patients with a history of liver or kidney disease may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients with a history of heart disease may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's physical condition. Patients who are obese or have a history of obesity may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients who are underweight or have a history of underweight may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction. The dose of propofol required for anesthesia induction may also vary depending on the patient's psychological condition. Patients who are anxious or have a history of anxiety may require a higher dose of propofol for anesthesia induction, while patients who are calm or have a history of calmness may require a lower dose of propofol for anesthesia induction.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common opportunistic infection in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. CMV infection is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in SOT recipients. CMV prophylaxis is recommended for all SOT recipients who are CMV seropositive and have a CMV seropositive donor. The current standard of care for CMV prophylaxis is valganciclovir. However, valganciclovir is associated with significant toxicity, including bone marrow suppression, renal toxicity, and gastrointestinal (GI) intolerance. Letermovir is a novel oral antiviral agent that is approved for the prevention of CMV infection in adult CMV seropositive kidney transplant recipients. Letermovir is a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable inhibitor of CMV DNA polymerase. Letermovir is dosed at 480mg daily for patients with CrCl >10. Dose adjustment, as per package insert, is recommended in setting of co-administration of cyclosporine, with dose reduction of letermovir to 240mg daily. Missed doses of letermovir will not be made up.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in thoracic organ transplant recipients. The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of letermovir for CMV prophylaxis in thoracic organ transplant recipients.

Study Design
-----------------
This study is a prospective cohort design. Subjects exposed to letermovir for CMV prophylaxis following heart or lung transplantation will be compared with those who received standard valganciclovir prophylaxis in the two years before the study began (referred to as the pre-intervention period). The goal is to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of letermovir.

Study Population

-----------------
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The two main subtypes of IBD are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). The incidence of IBD is increasing worldwide, and the disease is associated with a reduced quality of life (QoL) and increased risk of colorectal cancer. The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Diet is one of the most important environmental factors that can influence the development and progression of IBD. A diet high in fiber has been shown to be beneficial for IBD patients, as it can help to reduce inflammation and improve gut health. However, many IBD patients do not consume enough fiber, as they often experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to explore the effect of a 4-week WholeFiberTM intervention on inflammation, fecal gut microbiota and metabolites, IBD-complaints and QoL in patients with CD and UC. The secondary objective is to assess the feasibility of the intervention.

Dyspnea is a common symptom in patients under invasive mechanical ventilation. It is a subjective sensation of breathing discomfort that can be difficult to assess in patients who are intubated and sedated. The assessment of dyspnea is therefore often based on the observation of the patient's behavior and the evaluation of the respiratory rate and the respiratory effort. The assessment of dyspnea is also based on the evaluation of the patient's respiratory variability. The respiratory variability is defined as the variation in the amplitude of the respiratory movements. It is measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the chest expansion. The CV is the ratio of the standard deviation of the chest expansion to the mean chest expansion. The CV is a measure of the variability of the respiratory movements.

29,"1. Introduction: The term MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) refers to the transitional state between normal cognitive changes associated with aging and very early dementia. It is a disorder characterized by impairments in both short-term and long-term memory, but without functional deficits. MCI is considered a precursor to dementia. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), it was estimated that in 2014 there were 5.0 million adults with cognitive impairment (CI) in the population aged 65 years and older, and it is projected that by 2060, this number will increase to nearly 14 million. A study by Gómez on sentinel health networks in Spain describes a prevalence of MCI among individuals aged 65 years and older ranging from 14.5% to 17.6% , which increases with age. Another study reports a prevalence of 11.6% in individuals aged 65 to 69 years, which rises to an average of 22.9% among those aged 85 years and older. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of 9 Spanish studies on different types of dementia showed a prevalence ranging from 3.2% to 12.3% in individuals aged 70 years and older, with higher prevalence in women and increasing with age. Activities of daily living (ADL) rely on a combination of motor, cognitive, and socioemotional skills . Therefore, CI can directly impact independence in ADL, leading to immobility and social isolation . Gait and balance impairments are common in individuals with dementia, including slower gait speeds, decreased stride length, altered swing time, among others. However, these motor alterations are often overlooked when addressing CI . Balance impairment combined with gait deficits significantly increases the risk of falls, with approximately 60% of individuals with CI experiencing falls annually, twice as frequently as cognitively intact counterparts . Individuals with CI are also more prone to falls resulting in injuries, with up to a three-fold increase in the incidence of hip fractures compared to those without CI. Recognizing and addressing this connection between cognitive and motor deficits is crucial . Action Observation Therapy (AOT) involves observing a motor gesture performed by another individual and then imitating the same movement. This technique has been developed as a physical rehabilitation approach that promotes brain plasticity by activating the mirror neuron system . Previous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of action observation learning. A study conducted with children with cerebral palsy, presented by Naura et al. , showed that motor learning through observation is more effective and provides more evident benefits when subjects learn from other patients with the same condition but less severity, compared to learning by observing a therapist or another person without motor impairment. However, these results have not been corroborated in older patients or those with CI. The current literature includes various studies consistently demonstrating that AOT is an effective way to learn or improve specific motor skills. Buccino's work summarizes several studies that have employed AOT, including one in which the intervention was carried out with healthy individuals to imitate a motor action in a new environment for them. Another study showed that AOT facilitates motor learning and the construction of a motor memory trace in adults and in patients who have had a stroke. In another study, it was demonstrated that, in healthy adults, AOT is superior to motor imagery as a strategy for learning a complex motor task, at least in the early phase of motor learning. Buccino concludes that these results can have significant implications in educational activities, sports training, and neurorehabilitation. Specifically in the field of pathology, evidence exists regarding the application of AOT for upper limb rehabilitation in patients who have had a stroke. A pilot study by Yu-Wei Hsieh concluded that AOT resulted in improvements in most outcomes, suggesting it as a promising alternative to contemporary bilateral arm training interventions (i.e., active control intervention) for subacute stroke patients . In a randomized controlled pilot study by Mancuso et al., it was proposed that AOT is a promising treatment for functional recovery and upper limb function in individuals with moderate to severe upper limb impairment following a stroke. AOT could become a useful strategy in stroke rehabilitation programs, as it improves functionality of the paretic upper limb and allows for regaining maximum independence in ADL . Evidence also exists for AOT in children diagnosed with cerebral palsy, specifying that AOT increases spontaneous use of the affected upper limb through observation and imitation"

31,"Episiotomy is a planned surgical incision to the perineum and posterior wall of the vagina during the second stage of labor. The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and non-ablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Er:YAG laser on the tissue healing of the episiotomy scars and the reduction of vulvar pain."

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in children. The prevalence of CP is estimated to be 2.1 per 1000 live births. CP is a heterogeneous disorder, with a wide range of clinical manifestations. The most common type of CP is spastic hemiplegic CP, which is characterized by a unilateral distribution of motor impairments. In addition to motor impairments, children and adolescents with unilateral CP often present with somatosensory impairments, which are defined as a deficit in the processing of sensory information. Somatosensory impairments are present in 50-80% of children and adolescents with unilateral CP and are associated with poorer functional hand use.

Currently, the majority of upper limb therapy programs for children and adolescents with unilateral CP focus on motor training. However, the effects of motor training on somatosensory function are still unclear. In addition, the effects of motor training on functional hand use are often limited. Therefore, there is a need for novel therapy programs that focus on somatosensory function and that are able to improve functional hand use.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of an intensive upper limb therapy program focused on somatosensation in children and adolescents with unilateral CP. The secondary objective is to determine the predictive value of clinical and neuroimaging variables on the therapy response.

Study design
-----------------
A randomized controlled trial will be carried out in 50 children and adolescents with spastic unilateral CP aged between 7 and 15 years old. Participants will be randomized to the intervention group or the active control group. Participants in both groups will receive three session of 45 minutes upper limb therapy per week for a period of 8 weeks, resulting in a total therapy intensity of 18 hours. The intervention group will receive Sense for Kids therapy, which consists of component-based training and occupation-based training. During the component-based training participants will perform graded and structured practice of tactile object recognition, texture discrimination and proprioception. During the occupation-based practice, participants will repetitively and structured practice of self-chosen activities of daily living while attention is denoted to somatosensory aspects necessary for successful task completion (e.g., position of the upper limb, texture of materials, localization of materials based on touch). Participants in the control group will receive an equal amount of motor training, consisting of unimanual motor tasks and bimanual goal directed training. All therapy sessions will be performed under supervision of a trained physical and/or occupational therapist. Therapy adherence and progression will be closely monitored by the therapist. Outcomes will be assessed at three different points in time, being within two weeks prior to therapy commencement (baseline), within one week following therapy completion (post-intervention) and 6 months after the therapy has ended (follow-up).

33,"Background: Gallstone disease affects 10-15% of people in the United Kingdom (UK) and over 65,000 patients undergoing cholecystectomy each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) over 110 million. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without (including reduced diversity, decreased prevalence of beneficial and increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria) but there are only a handful of small scale studies exploring the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. Hypothesis and Objectives: This pilot study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including: Patients who develop complications of gallstone disease(including but not limited to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis and gallstone ileus) following diagnosis and Patients who develop post-operative complications including short (hospital stay, wound healing etc) and intermediate (development of post-cholecystectomy diarrhoea) outcomes. Design and Methods: A prospective cohort design will be used to collect data from 75 adult patients presenting to East Kent University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Hospitals with newly diagnosed gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging investigations. Data will be collected from electronic patient records including clinical history and diagnostic investigations, anthropometry, blood and imaging results (if taken as part of routine clinical care) for the initial presentation and subsequent readmissions/planned follow-up timepoints. Stool samples will be collected from patients either during admission or at home at each timepoint. Samples will be returned by post to the research team where they will be stored and analysed. Patients will also be asked to provide a 3 day food diary card Patients will have a sample collected at time of diagnosis and then at 6 monthly intervals whilst awaiting cholecystectomy. A pre-operative sample will be required within 6 weeks of any surgical intervention. Following cholecystectomy an immediate post-operative sample (within the first week) will be collected as well as a sample at 6 months. Clinical and Scientific Impact: At least 20% of those patients awaiting cholecystectomy experience complications, costing the NHS over £25 million per year. Therefore, there is a huge need to understand mechanisms behind the development of complications and to reduce the symptom burden for patients as well as the financial burden for the NHS. This study is the crucial first step in identifying differences in the gut microbiome between patients who experience complications (both pre and post-op) and those who do not. Once differences are discovered the next step will be to use the information discovered to determine interventions to reduce the development of these complications."

-----------------
Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) is a common complication of sepsis, which is associated with increased mortality. The pathogenesis of SALD is complex and multifactorial, including direct injury to hepatocytes, hypoxia, and inflammatory response. The diagnosis of SALD is based on the presence of elevated liver enzymes and/or bilirubin levels. However, the diagnosis of SALD is often delayed due to the lack of specific diagnostic tests. The prognosis of SALD is poor, with a mortality rate of up to 50%. Therefore, early diagnosis and treatment of SALD are crucial for improving patient outcomes.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to investigate the association between initial aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI) and the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

Methods
-----------------
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the MIMIC IV database. We included adult sepsis patients (≥18 years) as study participants, but only those who had data available for their first hospitalization and first ICU admission were enrolled in our study, if they had multiple admission records in the database. Exclusion criteria include: all types of chronic liver disease; viral hepatitis; primary acute cholangiopathies; cholecystitis; hepatic infarction; liver necrosis; liver trauma; length of ICU stay < 24 hours. Patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission were also excluded. The following indicators were extracted directly or derived from the database(MIMIC IV): age; weight; gender; comorbidity, including hypertension, old myocardial infarct, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease and diabetes; infection site, including blood, lung, skin and soft tissue, abdominal cavity and urinary tract; disease severity scores within the first day of ICU admission, including Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Oxford Acute Severity of illness Score (OASIS) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II); mean vital signs in first 24h, including heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2); treatment received within the first day of ICU admission, including invasive ventilation, vasopressor therapy, renal replacement therapy and parenteral nutrition (PN) support; initial laboratory parameters, including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell (RBC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, bicarbonate, anionic gap, sodium, potassium, chloride, total calcium, glucose, prothrombin time (PT), partial prothrombine time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR) and APRI; clinical outcome measures, including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. The disease severity scores, including APS III, SOFA, LODS, OASIS, SAPS II, are calculated using the SQL code provided by Johnson et al. APRI is calculated by (AST(IU/L)/ upper limits of normal)/PLT(k/uL)×100. Sepsis is diagnosed according to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3"

38,"The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as taught muscle bands, trigger points (TPs), and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker)."

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The disease is characterized by progressive muscle weakness and atrophy, which leads to paralysis and death. The disease is rare, with an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 person-years. The median survival time is 3-5 years after diagnosis. The disease is progressive and there is no cure. The only treatment that has been shown to prolong survival is long term mechanical ventilation support (LTMV). LTMV is a treatment that involves the use of a ventilator to help a person breathe. The ventilator is connected to a tube that is inserted into the person’s airway. The ventilator delivers oxygen and other gases to the lungs. LTMV is a life-saving treatment for people with ALS who have lost the ability to breathe on their own. LTMV can help people with ALS to live longer and more comfortably. However, LTMV is not without risks. The most common risks associated with LTMV are pneumonia, respiratory infections, and skin breakdown. In addition, LTMV can be burdensome for caregivers. Caregivers may experience stress, anxiety, and depression as a result of caring for a loved one with ALS. They may also experience financial strain as a result of the costs associated with LTMV. Despite the risks and burdens associated with LTMV, many people with ALS choose to receive this treatment. This is because LTMV can help people with ALS to live longer and more comfortably. In addition, LTMV can help people with ALS to maintain their quality of life.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the overall quality of life of ALS patients who choose life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families with ALS patients who decline life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families. The secondary objective of this study is to compare the health-related quality of life, disease-specific quality of life, and caregiver burden of ALS patients who choose life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families with ALS patients who decline life prolonging treatment with LTMV and their families.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that affects young adults. It is characterized by the presence of demyelinating lesions in the brain and spinal cord, which are responsible for the clinical symptoms of the disease. The pathophysiology of MS is complex and involves both immune and neurodegenerative mechanisms. The mainstay of treatment for MS is immunomodulatory therapy, which aims to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses and slow the progression of disability. Ocrelizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, a surface protein expressed on B cells. It is approved for the treatment of relapsing forms of MS (RRMS) and primary progressive MS (PPMS). Ocrelizumab is administered as an intravenous infusion every 6 months. The recommended dose is 600 mg, administered as two 300 mg infusions given 2 weeks apart. The efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab have been demonstrated in several clinical trials. In the OPERA I and II trials, ocrelizumab was shown to be superior to interferon beta-1a in reducing the number of relapses and the accumulation of disability in patients with RRMS. In the ORATORIO trial, ocrelizumab was shown to be superior to placebo in reducing the progression of disability in patients with PPMS. Ocrelizumab is generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being infusion-related reactions and infections. However, there are concerns about the long-term safety of ocrelizumab, particularly with regard to the risk of malignancy and immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS). IRIS is a rare but serious complication of ocrelizumab therapy, in which the immune system reacts aggressively to the re-emergence of latent infections or the reactivation of autoimmune diseases. IRIS can be life-threatening and requires prompt treatment. The risk of IRIS is highest in patients who have been treated with ocrelizumab for a long time and who have a history of latent infections or autoimmune diseases. To minimize the risk of IRIS, patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection or autoimmune disease. If IRIS is suspected, the patient should be referred to a specialist for evaluation and treatment. In conclusion, ocrelizumab is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for MS. However, there are concerns about the long-term safety of the drug, particularly with regard to the risk of malignancy and IRIS. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of infection or autoimmune disease, and prompt treatment should be initiated if IRIS is suspected.

47,"The purpose of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% hypertonic saline (HS) is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with neuromuscular disease (NMD) or neurodisability.

Background
-----------------
Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) are a group of disorders that affect the nerves and muscles. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, autoimmune diseases, and infections. NMD can cause a range of symptoms, including muscle weakness, difficulty breathing, and difficulty swallowing. People with NMD often have a reduced quality of life and a shorter life expectancy.

Neurodisability is a term used to describe a range of conditions that affect the brain and nervous system. These conditions can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, infections, and trauma. Neurodisability can cause a range of symptoms, including cognitive impairment, difficulty with movement, and difficulty with communication. People with neurodisability often have a reduced quality of life and a shorter life expectancy.

Both NMD and neurodisability can cause respiratory problems, including difficulty breathing and difficulty clearing secretions from the lungs. These respiratory problems can lead to respiratory infections, which can be life-threatening in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Hypertonic saline (HS) is a solution that contains a higher concentration of salt than normal saline. It is used to treat a variety of conditions, including respiratory infections and cystic fibrosis. HS is thought to work by drawing water out of the lungs, which helps to clear secretions and improve breathing.

There is some evidence that HS may be effective in treating respiratory infections in people with NMD or neurodisability. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence to support this. The purpose of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% HS is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether nebulised 6% HS is effective in reducing the number of respiratory exacerbations in people with NMD or neurodisability.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a phase 2 open label pilot study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include people with NMD or neurodisability who are aged 5 years and above.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be nebulised 6% HS. Participants will receive 3ml of 6% HS via nebuliser twice daily for 52 weeks.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the number of respiratory exacerbations. A respiratory exacerbation will be defined as a worsening of respiratory symptoms that requires antibiotic treatment.

Secondary outcome measures will include:

- Lung clearance index (LCI)
- Forced oscillation technique (FOT)
- Lung ultrasound
- Electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
- Airway inflammation
- Bacterial diversity
- Ease of airway clearance
- Health-related quality of life
- Patient and main carer treatment satisfaction
- Family impact
- Health economics

49,"18FDG PET is the current standard of care for metabolic imaging of brain tumors. However, it is expensive, requires a cyclotron, and is not widely available. Activity MRI (aMRI) is a new metabolic imaging approach that uses the same MRI scanner as conventional MRI, but does not require a cyclotron. aMRI is based on the fact that the magnetic resonance signal is sensitive to the presence of paramagnetic ions, such as iron. Iron is a byproduct of metabolism, and its concentration in the brain is related to the metabolic activity of the brain. aMRI can be used to measure the concentration of iron in the brain, and this concentration is related to the metabolic activity of the brain. aMRI has been shown to be a sensitive and specific metabolic imaging approach in animal models of brain tumors. The purpose of this study is to determine whether aMRI is a valid metabolic imaging approach in human subjects with brain tumors."

58,"Background
-----------------
Family planning (FP) is a key component of reproductive health and is essential for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) . The World Health Organization (WHO) defines FP as the ability of individuals and couples to anticipate and attain their desired number of children and the spacing and timing of their births . The WHO recommends that FP services should be available to all individuals and couples who want to avoid or delay pregnancy, regardless of their marital status, age, or parity . In Egypt, the total fertility rate (TFR) has declined from 6.7 in 1992 to 3.5 in 2014 . However, the unmet need for family planning (UNFP) remains high, with an estimated 22% of women of reproductive age (15-49 years) who want to avoid or delay pregnancy but are not using any method of contraception . The high UNFP rate is a major public health concern, as it increases the risk of unintended pregnancies, maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, and other adverse health outcomes .
The quality of FP services is a critical factor in determining the effectiveness of FP programs . Poor-quality FP services can lead to negative health outcomes, such as unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions, and maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality . The quality of FP services is determined by various factors, including the availability of trained providers, the availability of appropriate contraceptive methods, and the quality of counseling provided to clients .
In Egypt, the quality of FP services has been a concern for many years . A study conducted in 2014 found that only 40% of women who received FP services reported receiving high-quality counseling . The study also found that the quality of counseling varied significantly across different types of health facilities, with private clinics providing the highest quality of counseling and public hospitals providing the lowest quality of counseling .
The quality of FP services in Egypt is further compounded by the lack of standardized guidelines for FP counseling . The current guidelines for FP counseling in Egypt are based on the WHO Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use (MEC) . However, these guidelines do not provide specific guidance on how to provide high-quality counseling to clients .
In order to improve the quality of FP services in Egypt, it is essential to develop and implement standardized guidelines for FP counseling. These guidelines should be based on the latest evidence and should be tailored to the specific needs of clients in different settings. The guidelines should also be regularly updated to reflect changes in the evidence base and to ensure that they remain relevant and effective.
In addition to developing and implementing standardized guidelines for FP counseling, it is also essential to train healthcare providers in the provision of high-quality counseling. This training should be comprehensive and should cover all aspects of FP counseling, including the provision of information about contraceptive methods, the assessment of client needs and preferences, and the provision of support and guidance to clients.
The provision of high-quality FP counseling is essential for achieving the SDGs and for improving the health and well-being of women and their families in Egypt. By developing and implementing standardized guidelines for FP counseling and by training healthcare providers in the provision of high-quality counseling, we can ensure that all women who want to avoid or delay pregnancy have access to high-quality FP services.

-----------------
Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus (DM) and is a leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. DFO is a complication of a large amount of diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) and is a major trigger of lower limb amputations. DFO is defined as an infection of the bone and/or joint space in a patient with DM and a DFU. The diagnosis of DFO is based on clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria. The microbiological diagnosis of DFO is based on the isolation of microorganisms from bone biopsy (BB) samples. The gold standard for the diagnosis of DFO is the bone biopsy (BB) procedure. However, BB is underused in clinical practice for various reasons including lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find BB cumbersome or too invasive. To overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by a physician at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete DFU healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside versus conventional BB in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non inferior to conventional BB in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. The main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological) on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives of this study are to: compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy compare microbiological culture results between groups compare the safety of both procedures compare DFO remission according to results of BB (negative or positive) The health economic of this study are to: to estimate total costs for the intervention and total medical costs in each groups to estimate total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based upon EQ5D5L scores to calculate the point estimate of the incremental cost utility ratio and estimate the probability of decremental cost effectiveness for the beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional biopsy.

75,"Aging is a complex process that involves changes in multiple organ systems. The aging process is associated with a decline in physical and cognitive function, which can lead to frailty and disability. Frailty is a state of increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes, such as falls, hospitalization, and death. It is estimated that approximately 10-15% of older adults are frail, and this number is expected to increase as the population ages. Frailty is associated with a higher risk of adverse health outcomes, including falls, hospitalization, and death.

The AGE SELF CARE group visit program is a virtual program that aims to promote healthy aging and prevent frailty in older adults. The program is designed to be delivered in a group setting, with each session lasting approximately 90 minutes. The program is led by an aging expert, such as a geriatrician, and includes education and behavioral change elements in the broad areas of self/health, home environment, and community.

76,"1. Background and rationale: The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hard, and older and vulnerable persons are more likely to get very ill when infected, and have the highest morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required. Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments. The goal of geriatric rehabilitation has been defined as to assist [older people] to manage personal activities of daily living without the assistance of another person. If this is not possible, the goal is to minimize the need for external assistance through the use of adaptive techniques and equipment. Thereby focussing on the amelioration of dependency in activities of daily living. However, we are still in the dark about the amount of functional recovery of geriatric post-COVID-19 patients. We do know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious. Before being able to assure the best outcomes for older post-COVID geriatric rehabilitation patients, we first have to be informed about what the clinical characteristics are, what treatment is provided, and what outcomes geriatric post-COVID-19 patients have in geriatric rehabilitation. Therefore, members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the European Geriatric Medical Society (EuGMS) decided to conduct this multi-center observational cohort study into usual care data on the course of functional and clinical outcomes in post-COVID-19 geriatric rehabilitation patients in several European countries. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study to get insight into the course of functional and medical recovery in (geriatric) rehabilitation patients affected by COVID-19 in Europe. The secondary objective is to get insight into the treatment modalities employed and the organisation of geriatric rehabilitation that post-COVID patients in Europe receive. 3. Study design: In principle, patients admitted for geriatric rehabilitation due to COVID-19 morbidity will be informed by letter and asked if they have objections that their regular care data will be anonymously used for research purposes to improve practice in geriatric rehabilitation. If they do, the data will not be used (opt-out procedure). In some countries this will be conducted under the guidelines for service evaluation and audit, as it uses routine data, held entirely by the clinical care team. Where this is not possible because of local legislation or guidelines, informed consent will be obtained (opt-in procedure). During one-year (October 2020 - November 2021), patients were enrolled in the study. Participants will receive standard rehabilitation treatment according to the discretion of clinical teams, which will likely be adapted to the specific needs of post-COVID-19 patients. This treatment includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medical treatment by an advanced nursing practitioner, geriatrician or medical specialist. This study will not influence any therapy provided or decisions about the medical treatment or treatment programs already used in the participating geriatric rehabilitation setting. This study is observational and it is not anticipated that the observations will influence therapy or treatment, particularly since such indices, questionnaires and measurements are a regular part of the rehabilitation program. 4. Study management: For each participating geriatric rehabilitation facility in Europe one instructed local care professional will complete an online CASTOR database in which anonymous data from the clinical records of the included patients will be collected at admission, discharge and 6 weeks and 6 months follow-up. For countries with multiple participating sites, a country coordinator was appointed. Most country coordinators were the members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the EuGMS. 5. Data collection: Variables collected Demographic factors: In all participants, selected demographic factors such as year of birth/age, gender, and residency premorbid will be documented. Information from hospital / general practitioner: hospital length of stay (days), ICU length of stay (days), complications during hospital stay or at home (Thromboembolism, Delirium, Pressure Ulcer), and COVID-19 diagnosis"
77,"1. Background and rationale: The immunogenicity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens is diminished in kidney transplant recipients. This patient group therefore remains extremely vulnerable for viral infections despite vaccination. This impaired immune response is related to the use of immunosuppressive agents, especially Mycophenolate Mofetil/Mycophenolic Acid (MMF/MPA). Patients that use everolimus instead of MMF/MPA elicit a higher immune response after vaccination. 2. Objective: To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. 3. Study design: This is a multicentre, open-label, controlled, randomized study to evaluate replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in KTR on immunogenicity and safety after vaccination. The seven participating study sites are Amsterdam UMC, Erasmus MC, Leiden UMC, Maastricht UMC+, Radboudumc, UMC Groningen and UMC Utrecht. At the first study visit, eligibility for study participation will be checked, blood will be drawn, and participants will subsequently be 1:1 randomised to: Continue immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA Replace immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA by everolimus After randomisation, the study will continue in 2 parts: Part 1 - Run-in and COVID-19 vaccination (≥6 weeks + 28 days) The aim of this phase is to first ensure complete washout of MMF/MPA and attaining optimal trough levels of everolimus in patients randomized to everolimus. To monitor tolerability, safety and trough levels, participants will be invited at week 1 and week 3 after randomisation for a blood withdrawal and spot urine collection. At least 6 weeks after randomisation, patients will receive the COVID-19 vaccination (=baseline visit). After 28 days patients will be invited for a study visit for blood withdrawal. Part 2 (optional) - Herpes zoster vaccination (+56 days) Patients that opted to participate in this part of the study will continue their randomised treatment for the next 56 days. During this period patients will receive 2 herpes zoster vaccinations with an interval of 28 days between each vaccination. At 28 days after the second vaccination patients will be invited for the last study visit for blood withdrawal. After completion of the study (either 28 days after COVID-19 vaccination or 28 days after the last herpes zoster vaccination) patients will be offered the option to continue everolimus instead of MMF/MPA as part of shared clinical decision making. 4. Study population: Kidney transplant recipients on immunosuppressive therapy with either triple or dual therapy including MMF/MPA with a minimum daily dose of 1000 mg (MMF) or 720 mg (MPA) and a CNI. 5. Sample size: 100 participants will be included in the study. 6. Statistical analysis: The primary outcome measure is the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. The primary analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population. The primary analysis will be performed using a linear mixed model with the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain as the dependent variable and the treatment group as the independent variable. The model will be adjusted for the baseline neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. The primary analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population.

Endometriosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects 10% of women of reproductive age. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. The disease is associated with infertility and recurrent miscarriages. The pathophysiology of endometriosis is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic, hormonal and environmental factors. One of the main theories is that endometriosis is caused by retrograde menstruation, in which endometrial tissue is transported through the fallopian tubes and implanted in the pelvic cavity. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the fallopian tubes and increase the risk of retrograde menstruation. Another theory is that endometriosis is caused by an immune system dysfunction, which allows endometrial tissue to survive and grow outside the uterus. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Endometriosis is associated with infertility, which is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of unprotected sexual intercourse. The exact mechanism by which endometriosis causes infertility is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of factors. One of the main theories is that endometriosis causes inflammation in the pelvic cavity, which can damage the fallopian tubes and prevent the sperm from reaching the egg. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the fallopian tubes and increase the risk of infertility. Another theory is that endometriosis causes changes in the hormonal environment of the uterus, which can affect the quality of the egg and the ability of the embryo to implant in the uterine lining. This theory is supported by the fact that endometriosis is more common in women with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is associated with hormonal imbalances.

The diagnosis of endometriosis is based on the presence of characteristic symptoms, such as pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea, and dyspareunia, as well as the presence of endometriosis lesions on pelvic imaging. The most common imaging modality used to diagnose endometriosis is transvaginal ultrasound, which can detect endometriomas (cysts filled with endometrial tissue) and other endometriosis lesions. However, the diagnosis of endometriosis can be challenging, as the symptoms can be non-specific and the lesions can be difficult to detect on imaging.

The treatment of endometriosis depends on the severity of the disease and the symptoms experienced by the patient. The most common treatment options include hormonal therapy, surgical excision of endometriosis lesions, and assisted reproductive technologies (ART). Hormonal therapy is the most common treatment option for endometriosis, as it can reduce the symptoms of the disease and prevent the growth of endometriosis lesions. The most commonly used hormonal therapies for endometriosis include oral contraceptives, progestins, and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. Surgical excision of endometriosis lesions is another treatment option for endometriosis, as it can improve the symptoms of the disease and increase the chances of pregnancy. ART is a treatment option for women with endometriosis who are unable to conceive despite hormonal therapy and surgical excision of endometriosis lesions. ART involves the use of assisted reproductive technologies, such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), to help women conceive.

The prognosis of endometriosis depends on the severity of the disease and the treatment options available. The majority of women with endometriosis can be successfully treated with hormonal therapy or surgical excision of endometriosis lesions. However, some women may require more aggressive treatment options, such as ART, to conceive. The long-term prognosis of endometriosis is also affected by the risk of recurrence, which is higher in women who undergo surgical excision of endometriosis lesions."

-----------------
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cells. It is caused by a mutation in the gene that produces hemoglobin, the protein that carries oxygen in the blood. In people with SCD, the red blood cells become sickle-shaped, which can cause them to become stuck in small blood vessels, leading to pain, organ damage, and other complications. SCD is a chronic disease that can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life. It can cause pain, fatigue, and other symptoms that can make it difficult to participate in daily activities and enjoy life. In addition, SCD can also lead to complications such as stroke, lung disease, and kidney damage, which can further impact a person's quality of life. Despite the significant impact of SCD on a person's quality of life, there is limited research on the effectiveness of interventions to improve quality of life in people with SCD. One potential intervention that has been shown to improve quality of life in people with chronic diseases is exercise training. Exercise training has been shown to improve physical function, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve mental health in people with chronic diseases. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of exercise training in people with SCD. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week exercise training program on quality of life in people with SCD. The study will compare the effects of the exercise training program to a control group that does not receive the intervention. The study will also evaluate the effects of the exercise training program on pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD.

Objective
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 6-week exercise training program on quality of life in people with SCD. The study will compare the effects of the exercise training program to a control group that does not receive the intervention. The study will also evaluate the effects of the exercise training program on pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD.

Design
-----------------
The study will be a randomized controlled trial with two groups: an exercise training group and a control group. The exercise training group will receive a 6-week exercise training program, while the control group will not receive the intervention. The study will be conducted at a hospital or clinic that specializes in the treatment of SCD.

Participants
-----------------
The study will include people with SCD who are between the ages of 18 and 65. Participants will be recruited through advertisements in the community and through referrals from healthcare providers.

Intervention
-----------------
The exercise training program will consist of a combination of aerobic and resistance exercises. The program will be designed to be safe and effective for people with SCD. The program will be supervised by a trained exercise professional and will be tailored to the individual needs and abilities of each participant. The program will be conducted three times per week for 60 minutes per session.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be quality of life, as measured by the Sickle Cell Quality of Life (SCQOL) questionnaire. The SCQOL is a validated questionnaire that assesses quality of life in people with SCD. The questionnaire consists of 30 items that assess physical, emotional, and social functioning. The questionnaire will be administered at baseline and at the end of the 6-week intervention period.

Secondary outcome measures will include pain, fatigue, and other symptoms associated with SCD. Pain will be assessed using the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses pain intensity and pain interference. Fatigue will be assessed using the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses the severity of fatigue. Other symptoms associated with SCD, such as depression and anxiety, will be assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which is a validated questionnaire that assesses the severity of anxiety and depression.

Statistical Analysis
-----------------
The data will be analyzed using statistical software, such as SPSS or SAS. The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics, such as means and standard deviations, to describe the characteristics of the study population. The data will also be analyzed using inferential statistics, such as t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), to compare the effects of the exercise training program to the control group.

-----------------
Bronchiectasis is a chronic disease characterized by irreversible dilatation of the bronchi. It is associated with chronic cough and sputum production, and is predisposed to recurrent airway infections. Many systemic diseases can cause bronchiectasis: cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiencies (PID) and idiopathic bronchiectasis (IB) represent a significant proportion of patients with bronchiectasis starting in early age. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. It can be speculated that for some of the bronchiectasis patients, hyper-reactive airways or asthma can contribute to the reversible pattern. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to ATS/ERS statement, the proper way to determine BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered a positive BDR. While in most scenarios it is reasonable to assume that the change in FEV1 measured after the waiting time can be attributed solely to the affect of bronchodilators, this is not necessarily the case in bronchiectasis. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectatic disease might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives are to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma and use of inhaled steroids.

Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.

Intervention
-----------------
Each group of patients and controls will be randomly assigned to two study arms as follows: patients in both arms will perform regular spirometry. After the first series of spirometry testing, patients in the first arm will receive bronchodilators as per bronchodilator response protocol (Salbutamol, 100 mcg, 4 puffs via spacer) and patients in the second arm will receive four puffs of placebo. After a waiting time of 15 minutes, spirometry will be repeated. Following the second spirometry testing those who received salbutamol will now receive placebo and those receiving placebo will receive Salbutamol. After a second period of 15 minutes, a third series of spirometry will be recorded.

Main study parameters
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the change in FEV1 from pre to post bronchodilator inhalation, compared to the same change after placebo.

96,"The evolution of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is marked by dyspnea, anxiety and pain, major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort (scale A1 of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire) of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated with NIV. This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study. ALS patients will be recruited during their respiratory evaluation carried out as part of their usual care provided in an ambulatory setting (day care hospital) in the Pneumology Department of Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital. Eligibility criteria will be verified during this visit. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, the investigator will present the study to him using the information letter. After a period of reflection that the patient deems necessary to make his decision and after having obtained an answer to all his questions, his written consent will be collected by the investigator. The patient will then be offered a digital therapy session based on immersive virtual reality (IVR) and a music therapy session, 60 minutes apart. The IVR session will be based on medical hypnosis (GAMIDA®) and the music therapy session will be based on the choice of music that the patient wishes. Each session will last 15 minutes. Patients will start either with the medical hypnosis session by IVR or with the music session depending on the randomization carried out before the start of the study.

The study will be conducted in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire regions, in a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The intervention will be a selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility testing, with a list of antibiotics restricted according to four E. coli susceptibility profiles, with an emphasis on narrower-spectrum antibiotics. The control arm will be a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing report. The primary endpoint will be the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing, defined as the number of urine cultures associated with a prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin) prescribed by GPs in the same practice over a period from 3 days before to 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing, relative to the total number of urine cultures. This period of interest corresponds to the period of empirical antibiotic therapy (=within 3 days before report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), and the period of directed antibiotic therapy (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing). A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out by varying the time window for broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing around the date of the antibiotic susceptibility testing result, up to a maximum of 7 days before and 14 days after. The secondary endpoints will be the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), the rate of antibiotic de-escalation, the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, as a continuous variable (dose-effect) and ordinal variable (threshold-effect), the characteristics of GPs and patients, and the E. coli antimicrobial susceptibility profiles."

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells.

SBP is considered the most common infection in cirrhotic patients with ascites. SBP is diagnosed by the presence of ≥250 polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)/mm3 in the ascetic fluid in absence of surgical and treatable causes of intra-abdominal infections. SBP has many pictures of clinical presentation.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Radiotherapy is an essential component of breast cancer treatment, and it is highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial randomizing R&R vs. standard-of-care management in patients with radiotherapy in DIBH for left breast cancer. The investigators primary endpoint will assess heart dose (Dmax), and secondary endpoints include longitudinal anxiety and quality of life assessment and clinic workflow efficiency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a validated patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced-technology-based cardiac dose reduction, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of communication and relaxation techniques (R&R) in addition to standard DIBH training reduces the maximum dose to the heart (Dmax) in DIBH under adjuvant radiotherapy of left sided breast cancer. The secondary objectives are to determine whether the use of R&R in addition to standard DIBH training improves quality of life, reduces anxiety, and improves clinic workflow efficiency.

This is a prospective randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized to either the R&R arm or the standard arm.

-----------------
Cesarean section is the most common major surgical procedure in obstetrics. It is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. Postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is the leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide. It is defined as blood loss of more than 500 ml within 24 hours after delivery. The incidence of PPH is 3-5% in the general population and 10-15% in women undergoing cesarean section. The risk of PPH is increased in women with a history of PPH, multiple pregnancies, placenta previa, and uterine atony. The most common cause of PPH is uterine atony, which occurs in about 50% of cases. Other causes include retained placenta, uterine rupture, and coagulopathy. The management of PPH includes uterine massage, oxytocin administration, and uterine artery ligation. In severe cases, hysterectomy may be necessary. The use of tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce blood loss in women undergoing cesarean section. TXA is a synthetic antifibrinolytic agent that inhibits the breakdown of fibrin clots. It has been shown to be effective in reducing blood loss in women with heavy menstrual bleeding and in women undergoing surgery for uterine fibroids. The use of TXA in women undergoing cesarean section has been shown to be safe and effective in reducing blood loss. A recent meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that the use of TXA in women undergoing cesarean section reduced the risk of PPH by 30%.

117,"Background
-----------------
Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is characterized as the overproduction of very low density cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (i.e. bad cholesterol) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) (i.e. good cholesterol). Amongst individuals with mild to moderate hyperlipidaemia, lifestyle changes is the first treatment option, such as a healthy diet. Therefore, seeking to develop food-based approaches for hyperlipidaemia therapy is a timely endeavour. Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive option, as it is a spice throughout the world which possesses medicinal properties in regulating human nutrient metabolism. In a recent review of the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperlipidaemia in humans with diabetes and prediabetes, this analysis suggested that fenugreek has total cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The effects of fenugreek on triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol showed a trend towards reduction and an incremental trend for HDL-cholesterol but needed further confirmation. The effect of fenugreek in human subjects with hyperlipidaemia without diabetes has not been investigated. This research aims to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed consumed as a tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. Changes in plasma microRNAs will be analysed to establish non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. The secondary objective of this study is to determine the effect of fenugreek seed tea on plasma microRNAs as non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia.

Study Design
-----------------
This will be a randomised controlled trial. 114 participants will be randomized into two groups (57/group) to receive either fenugreek seed tea or a control black tea, respectively.

Study Population
-----------------
Patients with hyperlipidaemia (plasma triglyceride level between 1.7 - 4.5mmol/l) not on any lipid-lowering treatment or on a stable lipid-lowering treatment (last six months) but still have confirmation of high triglycerides within the range required for study.

Intervention
-----------------
Fenugreek seeds will be delivered at a dose of 5g/day, drunk as a tea (2.5g/per tea bag), p.o. twice a day at a 12-hour interval) for 8 weeks (56 days). The tea bags will be brewed in a cup (200ml) of boiled hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. This will be self-administered by the subjects, twice a day at a 12-hour interval. The rationale for choosing the dose and intervention time course were based on the previous studies where metabolic effects have been detected. Literature reports from 12 human studies on diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects gave doses of fenugreek seed ranging from 1 to 100g/day, with the median treatment dose being 6.3g/day, to the participants; the intervention time course ranged from 1 week to 3 years, with the median treatment time being 60 days. The dose and duration in this study was therefore designed as being similar to these studies where metabolic effects have been detected and where participant burden will not be too onerous."

The disease is characterized by a wide range of symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, loss of taste and smell, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and skin rash. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. However, some patients may experience more severe symptoms, such as pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and multi-organ failure. The disease can also lead to long-term complications, such as fatigue, muscle weakness, and cognitive impairment. The long-term effects of COVID-19 are not yet fully understood, but it is clear that the disease can have a significant impact on a person's health and quality of life. 2. Objectives {7} The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of an individually tailored exercise and its impact on time in upright position and health-related quality of life (HRQoL), physical activity, physical and psychological function and work-ability in persons with POTS, post COVID-19 condition. 3. Trial design {8} The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel groups. 4.

124,"1. Background of the study
The incidence of stroke is increasing year by year, and the mortality rate is high. The main pathological changes of stroke are cerebral infarction and cerebral hemorrhage. Cerebral infarction is the most common type of stroke, accounting for about 80% of all strokes. The main pathological changes of cerebral infarction are atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall, which is characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaques in the arterial wall. Atherosclerotic plaques are composed of lipids, fibrous tissue, and inflammatory cells. When atherosclerotic plaques rupture, thrombosis occurs, and cerebral infarction occurs. The pathogenesis of cerebral infarction is complex, and the main risk factors include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, and family history of stroke. The treatment of cerebral infarction mainly includes antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation therapy, and thrombolysis therapy. However, the efficacy of these treatments is limited, and the recurrence rate of cerebral infarction is still high.
Therefore, it is necessary to find new and effective treatments for cerebral infarction. Tirofiban is a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonist that can inhibit platelet aggregation and reduce the risk of thrombosis. It has been used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and peripheral arterial disease. However, its efficacy and safety in the treatment of cerebral infarction have not been fully studied.
2. Objective of the study
The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in the treatment of cerebral infarction. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score: 0-1) at 90 days after treatment. The secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with excellent functional outcome at 7 days after treatment, the proportion of patients with early neurological deterioration, the NIHSS score, the Barthel index score, the proportion of patients with new-onset ischemic stroke, the proportion of patients with new-onset stroke, the proportion of patients with new-onset transient ischemic attack, the composite endpoint, the proportion of major bleeding, the proportion of serious adverse events, the proportion of adverse events, the proportion of all-cause death, the changes in hemoglobin, the changes in the count of red blood cell, the changes in the count of white blood cell, the changes in the count of platelets, the changes in alanine transaminase, the changes in aspartate aminotransferase, the changes in direct bilirubin, the changes in indirect bilirubin, the changes in the concentration of Na, the changes in the concentration of K, the changes in the concentration of creatinine, the changes in the concentration of albumin, the changes in the urinary occult blood, and the changes in the fecal occult blood.
3. Study design
This is a multi-center, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint, parallel controlled trial. The study will be conducted in 10 hospitals in China.

One of the main factors that contribute to skin ageing is the loss of collagen and hyaluronic acid, which are essential components of the skin that provide structure and hydration. In addition, the skin is constantly exposed to oxidative stress, which can cause damage to the skin cells and accelerate the ageing process. The intestinal microbiota is also involved in skin ageing, as it can produce metabolites that can affect the skin.

139,"The objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults.

Background: 
Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: 
eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.

142,"The purpose of this study is to test new algorithms for detecting pump/infusion set malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery. The study consists of three phases: Phase 1: Preliminary Data Collection (Free-living Data) In this phase, data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions are collected. This data is obtained from a download form the patient's artificial pancreas. The one-month session is designed to gather a substantial amount of patient-specific data to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals impact the patient's glycemia as recorded by the CGM sensor. During this phase, the patient continues to use their artificial pancreas in their daily life. Phase 2: Induction of Hyperglycemia The second phase involves the patient visiting the clinic, where, according to a specific protocol and a defined schedule, insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump malfunction. The resulting episode of hyperglycemia is closely monitored under medical supervision. At the end of the experiment, the study team assists the patient in restoring euglycemia before returning home. Phase 3: Retrospective Data Analysis In this phase, the collected data is retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detecting insulin suspension, simulating a pump malfunction. The sensitivity of the tested methods is assessed as the fraction of insulin suspensions (simulating a malfunction) correctly detected. The uniqueness of this dataset lies in the controlled induction of malfunction, achieved by disconnecting the insulin pump and monitoring the resulting hyperglycemic episode. The presence of malfunctions in this data is certain and precisely characterized in terms of the start time and duration. The dataset resulting from this experimentation will be a valuable tool for the scientific community, enabling the retrospective testing of fault detection algorithms."

144,"1. Background and rationale: Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare cancer with an incidence of 4.5 per 100,000 person-years. The treatment of STS is complex and requires a multidisciplinary approach. The treatment decision is based on the patient's age, tumor size, tumor depth and histology. The treatment decision is often difficult for patients and professionals, because of the complexity of the decision and the lack of evidence-based guidelines. 2. Objective: The objective of this study is to assess whether the use of the personalized risk assessment tool (PERSARC) is (cost)effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing informed choices in high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients compared to usual care (co-primary outcomes). In addition, we aim to assess in a process evaluation (a) the involvement of patients in decision-making (b) the extent and way PERSARC is used by patients and professionals, and (c) how satisfied patients and professionals were with the use of PERSARC. 3. Study design: To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue sarcoma expertise centers. Hospitals will be randomized between standard care (control condition) or care with the use of PERSARC (intervention). Outcomes will be assessed within one week after treatment decision has been made (T1), and after 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment decision has been made (T2, T3, T4) in at least 120 patients. See main study parameters/endpoints for a description of the outcomes that will be measured at these time points. Actual use of PERSARC, satisfaction with/added value of PERSARC and barriers and facilitators for the integration of PERSARC in treatment decision-making processes during patient-clinician encounters will be measured in a process evaluation using questionnaires, interviews, and audio-recording/observation of consultations. 4. Study population: Patients (>= 18 years) with primarily diagnosed (histologically confirmed) grade 2-3 extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma, who do not have a treatment plan yet and will be treated with curative intent. Patients with sarcoma subtypes or treatment options other than those mentioned in PERSARC are unable to participate. Furthermore, patients need to be Dutch fluency and literacy and mentally competent. 5. Intervention (if applicable): High-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients will either receive standard care (control group) or care with the use of PERSARC; i.e. PERSARC will be used in multidisciplinary tumour boards to guide treatment advice and in consultation in which the oncological/orthopaedic surgeon informs the patient about his/her diagnoses and discusses the benefits and harms of all relevant treatment options (intervention group). 6. Main study parameters/endpoints: The co-primary outcomes are decisional conflict (Decisional Conflict Scale(DCS) (T1) and informed choice (T1). Informed choice is a combined outcome incorporating knowledge, attitudes concerning trade-offs between quality and length of life (QQ_Questionnaire) (T1), and treatment decision (T1). Secondary outcomes, include regret (Decision_Regret_Scale) (T3, T4), worry (Cancer_Worry_scale) (T1, T2, T3, T4), involvement in decision-making according to patients (SDM-Q-9) (T1), patient reported outcome using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMIS Global health) (T1, 2, 3, 4), and (PROMIS physical function) (T1, 2, 3, 4), utilities for the cost-effectiveness analysis (EQ-5D-5L) (T1, T2, T3, T4), health care cost (iMCQ) (T2, T3, T4) and absenteeism/presenteeism from paid work (T2, T3, T4). 7. Study design: To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue"

3. Study design
This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, parallel-group study.

4. Study setting
This study will be conducted at the intensive care unit of a university hospital.

5. Study population
The study population will be adult patients (19 years of age or older) who are intubated after admission to the intensive care unit.

6. Sample size
The sample size is calculated based on the primary outcome, which is the time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation. The time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation in the control group is assumed to be 30 minutes, and the time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation in the intervention group is assumed to be 15 minutes. The standard deviation of the time for neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation is assumed to be 10 minutes. The significance level is set to 0.05, and the power is set to 0.8. Based on these assumptions, the sample size is calculated to be 100 patients per group.

7. Recruitment
Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be recruited for the study.

8. Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria are as follows:
1. Adult patients (19 years of age or older) who are intubated after admission to the intensive care unit.
2. Patients who are neurologically evaluable or have concomitant neurologic dysfunction.

162,"The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (CBT+VR) enriched with the contribution of virtual reality (VR), which the investigators prepared to intervene in psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. If the CBT+VR protocol is effective, it can be used to increase the quality of physical rehabilitation and therefore to ensure that the perceptions of athletes regarding their psychological outcomes about their return to sport are positive. CBT+VR protocol will be tested, and if it is found effective, it will make a significant contribution to both the literature and practice. The main peculiarity of this study is that a holistic protocol including virtual intervention will be developed for the solution of psychological problems encountered in the rehabilitation process of sports injuries for the first time. The research will be conducted with 60 athletes who meet the inclusion criteria. In the study, which is planned as a 4X5 (groupXmeasurement) mixed factorial design model with four groups (intervention1-intervention2-intervention3, control), the athletes will be filled with psychological assessment scales in order to collect the first data within the first week of starting physical therapy after ACL operation. The CBT+VR protocol will be applied to the first intervention group. Only the behavioral intervention part of the protocol in the VR environment will be applied to the second intervention group. The CBT protocol will be applied without the VR environment for the third intervention group. It is planned that for all intervention groups and the control group, there will be 10 sessions in total once a week, and each session lasts 50 minutes. There will be conversation in the control group sessions; in addition, images that give calmness from nature will be watched for 5 minutes with VR glasses. The remaining 45 minutes will continue with a conversation with encouragement and emotional support, which will not create a therapeutic effect. The scales will also be filled in three more times. The data obtained will be analyzed with multi-level statistics. Whether the anxiety levels of the athletes increase in the VR environment will be monitored with the biofeedback system, which will provide concrete data as well as subjective scales."
163,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical decision support tool (PT-PENCIL) in improving the proportion of patients discharged home from the hospital.

172,"1. Background: CAR T-cell therapy is a promising treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies. However, the treatment is associated with significant toxicities, including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune effector cell associated-neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS). The incidence of CRS and ICANS is high, and the severity of these toxicities can be life-threatening. 2. Hypothesis: Interferon-beta-1a (FP-1201) can prevent CRS and ICANS in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. 3. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of FP-1201 in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. The secondary aims are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of FP-1201 in preventing CRS and ICANS in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. 4. Study design: This is a phase 1/2, open-label, dose-escalation study. Patients will receive FP-1201 prior to CAR T-cell infusion. The study will be conducted in two parts: a dose-escalation part and a dose-expansion part. 5. Study population: The study population will include patients with relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancies who are candidates for CAR T-cell therapy. 6. Study interventions: Patients will receive FP-1201 prior to CAR T-cell infusion. The dose of FP-1201 will be escalated in the dose-escalation part of the study. 7. Study outcomes: The primary outcome of the study is the incidence of CRS and ICANS in patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy. The secondary outcomes include overall response rate, complete response rate, and safety of FP-1201. 8. Potential impact: If successful, this study could lead to the development of a new treatment for patients receiving CAR T-cell therapy, which could improve the safety and efficacy of this treatment."

-----------------
Small bowel obstruction (SBO) is a common surgical emergency. The most common cause of SBO is adhesions, which are formed after abdominal surgery. The most common treatment for SBO is surgical intervention. However, surgery is not always necessary, and in some cases, conservative management with nasogastric tube (NGT) decompression and water-soluble contrast (WSC) administration may be effective. The use of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO is controversial, and there is limited evidence to support their use. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO, and to evaluate the patient-reported outcomes of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled trial.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will consist of patients with a diagnosis of SBO who are candidates for conservative management with NGTs and WSCs.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomized to receive either NGTs and WSCs, or NGTs and saline.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the rate of successful conservative management of SBO. The secondary outcome measures will include the rate of complications, the rate of recurrent SBO, and the patient-reported outcomes of NGTs and WSCs in the management of SBO."

-----------------
Infertility is a common problem affecting 15% of couples worldwide. Male factor infertility is the cause of infertility in 50% of couples. The most common cause of male factor infertility is oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT), which is characterized by low sperm count, low sperm motility, and abnormal sperm morphology. In addition to OAT, another common cause of male factor infertility is azoospermia, which is defined as the absence of sperm in the ejaculate. Azoospermia can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic abnormalities, testicular injury, and certain medical conditions. In cases of azoospermia, the most common treatment option is testicular sperm extraction (TESA), which involves surgically removing sperm from the testicles. However, TESA can be a challenging procedure, and the success rate of TESA-ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) is often low. In recent years, a new technique called microfluidic sperm separation (MSS) has been developed as an alternative to TESA. MSS involves using a microfluidic device to separate sperm from the semen sample. This technique has been shown to be more effective than TESA in terms of sperm retrieval and fertilization rates. However, there is limited data on the effectiveness of MSS in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation. In this study, we aim to compare the effectiveness of TESA-ICSI and MSS-ICSI in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation. We hypothesize that MSS-ICSI will result in higher fertilization rates and clinical pregnancy rates than TESA-ICSI.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the clinical pregnancy rate in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation undergoing TESA-ICSI vs Zymot-ICSI. The secondary objective is to compare the number of utilizable blastocysts obtained in couples using TESA-ICSI vs Zymot-ICSI.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. Couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation will be randomized to undergo TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will consist of couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation undergoing ICSI.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention in this study is the use of TESA-ICSI or Zymot-ICSI in couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the clinical pregnancy rate, which will be assessed by ultrasound at approximately 8 weeks after embryo transfer. The secondary outcome measure is the number of utilizable blastocysts obtained, which will be assessed by embryo culture and grading.

Data Collection and Management
-----------------
Data will be collected from medical records and patient questionnaires. Data will be entered into a secure electronic database and analyzed using statistical software.

Statistical Analysis
-----------------
The primary analysis will be a comparison of the clinical pregnancy rate between the TESA-ICSI and Zymot-ICSI groups using a chi-square test. The secondary analysis will be a comparison of the number of utilizable blastocysts obtained between the two groups using a t-test.

Ethics and Dissemination
-----------------
The study protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the participating institution. All participants will provide written informed consent before enrollment in the study. The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and presentations at scientific conferences.

198,"1. Background of the study: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and stability of left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) for ventricular pacing in symptomatic bradycardia patients with a conventional bipolar, active fixation pacing lead. 2. Rationale of the study: The conventional bipolar pacing lead is the most commonly used pacing lead in the world. However, the conventional bipolar pacing lead is not designed for LBBAP. The Solia S lead is a family of 5.6 French, steroid-eluting, transvenous, endocardial, bipolar active fixation leads with an extendable/retractable and electrically active screw. The Solia S lead is manufactured, like its predecessor, the Siello S lead, in three different models (45, 53, and 60 cm in length). It has an isodiametric structure and silicone insulation. The inner and outer conductors consist of quadruple wire coils. The Solia S has a diameter of 5.6 F and is covered by a polyurethane overlay for improved gliding. It has an IS-1 connector and a 10 mm pole distance. The area between tip and ring is flexible in order to minimize the perforation risk. The fixation screw of the Solia S is electrically active and has a fractal iridium coating. The screw can be extended by 1.8 mm and has an active surface area of 4.5 mm2. The ring electrode of Solia S has a surface area of approximately 17.4 mm2 and is fractally coated with iridium. The Solia S has a dexamethasone eluting steroid collar containing 0.85 mg dexamethasone acetate. The accessories that are delivered with the lead are identical to the accessories of the Siello S. 3. Objective of the study: The purpose of the primary endpoint is to evaluate the overall success rate of the implanted system, including Solia ventricular lead to sense and deliver pacing at 12- month post-implant. Successful sensing performance at 12 months is the demonstrated ability to appropriately sense without intervention for undersensing (i.e., Solia lead-related adverse event for lead undersensing or loss of sensing) in the period from implant to 12 months, except for normal pulse generator reprogramming. Successful pacing is the demonstrated ability at 12 months to deliver a stimulation pulse with capture, without intervention (i.e., Solia lead-related adverse event for intermittent capture or no lead capture) other than normal pulse generator reprogramming. Success is determined at the subject level. 4. Study design: This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study to investigate the feasibility and stability of LBBAP for ventricular pacing in symptomatic bradycardia patients with a conventional bipolar, active fixation pacing lead. Eligible patients will be enrolled through the process of informed consent in the seven clinical investigational sites across Taiwan with competitive enrollment. All subjects enrolled in the study will undergo LBBAP implantation using one or two Solia S leads in combination with any legally marketed BIOTRONIK pacemaker system delivered through a preshaped sheath (Selectra 3D) via left cephalic, left subclavian, or left axillary venous access. The available lengths of Solia S are 45, 53, and 60 cm. As for which one will be used, it will depend on the lead configuration and the anatomy of the subject. During the screening period, the subject's medical history and demographic information will be collected. The baseline data will be obtained prior to the pacing implantation. Depending on the needs of the subject, the screening and implantation procedures may be performed on the same day. Implant data will include lead measurements, implant technique, and lead positioning. After completion of pacemaker implantation, subjects will be followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months or until lead failure (dislodgment, high capture threshold, or inadequate sensing requiring revision of the lead) or death. During follow-up, a determination will be made whether the system is able to provide appropriate pacing and sensing.

203,"The study is structured into two parts. In the first part the investigators will be recruiting 10 patients with MDD-AD and 10 HC, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each participant will be evaluated by a team of experienced psychologists and clinicians, administering structured clinical interviews to assess the presence/absence of axis I and II psychiatric disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II) (first visit). Furthermore, in all subjects the degree of depressive/manic dysintomatology will be measured through the use of clinical scales and psychopathological tests such as:the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery- Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating scale (BPRS)(second visit; within one week of the first screening visit). Moreover, additional clinical data will beextrapolated from medical records and interviews with psychiatrists (if available). The investigators will also evaluate the suitability of each participant to undergo the multimodal acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data with a 7T GE scanner. The neuroimaging session, performed during the third visit (within one month of the second visit) will include: T1-weighted image acquisition: to study the volumetric differences of white and gray matter between subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. fMRI: to assess functional connections between prefrontal cortex and limbic system. 1H-MRS: to study glutamatergic neurotransmission within the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The sequences will be optimized thanks to the 32-channel brain coil (NovaMedical), to reduce artifacts and inhomogeneities in images. The second part of the study will involve murine models. More specifically, to assess whether Pcdh9 deficits affect the number and morphology of excitatory synapses, electron microscopic analyses will be performed in Pcdh9-knockout mice. Glutamatergic signaling will also be studied at the biochemical level: the expression levels of all major glutamate receptor subunits (ionotropic and metabotropic) will be investigated by analyzing cortical protein lysates (total lysates) in adult mice (3-4 months). In addition, to identify finer changes in glutamate receptor expression, their intracellular and surface expression will be analyzed using the BS3 crosslinking assay. The investigators will also proceed in the characterization of the interaction between integrin β3 and Protocadherin9 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis from mouse brain: in case of positive results (at least 3 replicates), further analysis will be conducted to study whether the two proteins bind directly. Electrophysiological characterization of Itgb3 and Pcdh9 murine patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex at both synaptic and local network levels will also be performed and, lastly, an evaluation of functional recovery of behavioral and electrophysiological deficits mediated by CRISPRa will be conducted. In this case, experiments on murine models will be perform to determine whether overexpression of integrin β3 or protocadherin9 could compensate for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs."

218,"Background: Prognostic awareness among patients with life-limiting diseases has been shown to be associated with less depression, better quality of care and earlier referral to palliative care. Moreover, accurate understanding of their illness may support patients to make informed decisions about their future in alignment with their preferences, values or needs. Supportive care in cancer is the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. This includes management of physical and psychological symptoms and side effects. Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) is a relatively new initiative implementing early supportive care in patients with advanced cancer. Although studies have shown that a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer remain unaware that their disease is not curable, research regarding prognostic awareness in patients referred to Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) services is still scarce. A deeper knowledge of the factors and patient characteristics associated with prognostic awareness is an important first step to develop interventions to improve prognostic communication and thereby to facilitate delivery of high-quality ESC. General aim: The ESC team at University College London Hospital is embedded within the oncology outpatient service, providing specialist symptom control and Advanced Care Planning to patients with advanced cancer. The primary aim of this study is to better understand the prognostic awareness of patients referred to the ESC service. A secondary aim is to evaluate the relationship between patients' prognostic awareness and levels of psychological distress, quality of life, trust in medical professionals and perceived quality of care. Patient population: Consecutive adult patients with advanced cancer referred to the ESC service will be eligible to participate. Patients unable to complete questionnaires due to cognitive impairment such as dementia will be excluded. Patients who have already been referred to community palliative care services will also be excluded. Methods: This will be a cross-sectional prospective study. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by members of the ESC team and will be informed about the study. Interested patients will then discuss the study with the research team and will be invited to participate. After informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete a questionnaire which will cover their level of prognostic awareness, psychological symptoms, and quality of life). The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire can be completed online via RedCap. Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is the level of patients' prognostic awareness, which will be assessed by the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire. This questionnaire has previously been successfully used in research to assess patients' information preferences, perceptions about their prognosis and the goals of therapy and communication preferences about end-of-life care. Secondary endpoints will be (a) patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information assessed through the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire (b) symptoms of depression evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), (c) symptoms of anxiety evaluated through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), (d) quality of life and (d) patients' trust in their medical team and (e) other aspects of perceived quality of care, rated on a visual analogue scale (NRS) from 0-10. Sample size and statistics: The investigators will conduct univariable and multivariable regression analyses to evaluate associations between sociodemographic or clinical variables and outcomes. The investigators aim to include 100 patients. This will give us at least 10 degrees of freedom to assess association of potential risk factors with outcome and to evaluate confounders in a multivariable analysis. Discussion: This will be the first prospective study to assess prognostic awareness among cancer patients referred to ESC services in a British setting. Identifying covariates for prognostic unawareness and psychological burden among patients with advanced cancer will inform the future development of strategies to improve care and communication with this patient group."
219,"Background: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are a common cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. The diagnosis of BSI is based on the presence of positive blood cultures. However, the time to positive blood cultures is often delayed, and the results of blood cultures are often not available to guide antibiotic therapy. Direct-from-blood testing (DFB) is a novel technology that allows for the rapid detection of bacteria in blood. The purpose of this study is to determine whether DFB testing can reduce the time to appropriate antibiotic therapy in patients with suspected BSI. Methods: This is a pragmatic, randomized controlled clinical trial with parallel group assignment. Patients will be randomized to receive either DFB testing or usual care. The primary outcome is the time to last dose of intravenous vancomycin. Secondary outcomes include the time to last dose of systemic anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam antibiotic, the proportion of patients who receive appropriate antibiotic therapy within 24 hours of randomization, and the proportion of patients who are discharged from the hospital within 30 days of randomization."
220,"Background
-----------------
Arterial hypertension is one of the most important risk factors in developing a cardiovascular disease. While medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications should always be included. Besides physical activity and a balanced diet, there are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine. One very important part in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended. Even though hydrotherapy has been a part of complementary medicine for more than a century now some therapeutic approaches lack of scientific evidence - especially when it comes to their effect on arterial hypertension. This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual). All 50 participants will be monitored with three 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure measurements (24h ABPM) at the beginning of the trial after randomization, at 8 weeks and at 6 months. The intervention group will be advised to perform the armbaths on 5 of 7 days per week for 8 weeks total. Each participant will get a detailed instruction how to perform the armbath and will be handed a diary to document their performance. After 6 months, each participant of the control group will be offered to be instructed on performing the armbaths as well. Within the active period of 8 weeks, participants of both groups will be called regularly to ask about their health and whether they have questions regarding the trial.

225,"1. Background and rationale {6a} The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pay for performance (PFP) program for high-utilizers of mental health services in Santa Clara County, California. The PFP program was implemented in 2012 and is designed to improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care for high-utilizers of mental health services. The program provides financial incentives to contracted providers for meeting performance targets related to the quality of care and the cost of care. The program also provides technical assistance and support to contracted providers to help them improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care. The program is being evaluated using a randomized controlled trial design. The study will compare the outcomes of participants in the PFP program to the outcomes of participants in a control group that receives usual care. The study will also compare the outcomes of participants in the PFP program to the outcomes of participants in a historical control group that received care before the PFP program was implemented. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of the PFP program in improving the quality of care and reducing the cost of care for high-utilizers of mental health services. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the utilization of mental health services, the incidence of hospitalizations, and the incidence of arrests. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the quality of life of participants. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the satisfaction of participants with their care. The study will also evaluate the impact of the PFP program on the satisfaction of providers with the care they provide.

226,"Background
-----------------
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population worldwide. It is associated with significant disability and premature mortality. The majority of people with schizophrenia have their first episode of psychosis (FEP) in their late teens or early twenties. FEP is a critical period in the course of schizophrenia, as it is associated with a high risk of relapse and poor long-term outcomes. Early intervention services (EIS) are designed to provide intensive and coordinated care to people with FEP. EIS have been shown to improve clinical outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse in people with FEP. However, there is limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that supports the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of EIS in LMICs.

Aims
-----------------
The primary aim of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Culturally adapted Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CaCBT) and Culturally adapted Family Intervention (CulFI) compared to TAU in reducing overall symptoms of psychosis in individuals with FEP in Pakistan. The secondary aim is to determine the cost-effectiveness of CaCBT and CulFI compared to TAU in Pakistan.

Study design
-----------------
This is a multi-centre, randomised controlled trial (RCT) with three parallel arms. The study will include 390 participants with FEP from psychiatric units of hospitals in ten centres (i.e. Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, Qambar Shahdakot, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta and Multan). Consented participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomised in a 1:1:1 allocation to CaCBT + TAU, CulFI + TAU or TAU alone. Participants in CaCBT intervention group will receive 12-weekly one-to-one sessions. Participants in CulFI group will receive 10-weekly one-to-one sessions. Each CaCBT and CulFI session will last for approximately 1 hour. Sessions will be delivered by trained psychologists who will receive regular weekly supervision to maintain fidelity. Assessments will be carried out at baseline, months 3, 6, and 12 by trained, blinded assessors. . Process evaluation will help to build the implementation knowledge base for proposed interventions across study settings. We will conduct economic evaluations (i.e., the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses) of the CaCBT and CulFI interventions, as add-on to TAU.

-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the barriers and facilitators of integrating Horyzons, an evidence-based digital intervention, in outpatient mental health clinics in North Carolina that provide care to individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders. The primary aim is to evaluate and identify the unique barriers and facilitators in implementing Horyzons at each first episode psychosis (FEP) clinic as part of standard care and distinct implementation strategies. The secondary and tertiary aims are to evaluate client engagement with Horyzons and attrition as part of clinical care and assess the change in clients' psychological measures across in addition to their use of state-funded services (e.g., emergency department and social services) across the 12-month intervention.

Methods
-----------------
Service provider participants will be recruited over a 4-6 week period at their respective clinics. They will be asked to complete an adapted measure, the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network (CPCRN) Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Survey, assessing clinical readiness, leadership, acceptance, adoption, and perspective on evidence-based practices. Service providers will then participate in implementing and integrating Horyzons within clinical practice including preferred implementation strategy that is distinct for each clinic (e.g., Horyzons training, access to the platform by clinicians, ongoing technical support, attendance and update at monthly team meetings, etc.). Service providers will meet with research staff at approximately the 6-month timepoint (+/- 4 weeks) to complete the CPCRN FQHC Survey then upon completion of the effectiveness trial with clients, service providers will complete this measure once again in addition to participating in a qualitative interview based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) around their experience with integrating the platform and identification of barriers and facilitators to Horyzons' implementation. Service providers will be compensated for the completion feedback, including the questionnaire and qualitative interviews. Client participants will be recruited over a 16- to 20-week period at their respective clinic. Participants will participate in a baseline visit to provide informed consent and complete a brief battery of measures (Demographics and Characteristics, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale, MOS Social Supports Survey). Participants will then meet with a research assistant, peer support specialist, or clinician to be given guidance and instruction for using the site (i.e., Horyzons onboarding). Clients will then engage in the platform, where site usage information as well as experience will be collected from participants through the Horyzons platform. Site usage (e.g., number of posts/comments made on the online platform, number and type of 'Journeys' or 'Tracks', self-guided therapeutic content, completed during time on the platform) will automatically be collected via the platform. Participants will have access and engage in this platform for approximately 12 months, depending on when recruited into trial. During this 12 month engagement period with the platform, client participants will meet with research staff at their midway point to complete the brief battery of measures assessing loneliness and social support and feedback on Horyzons. Upon completion of their engagement with the platform, client participants will additionally participate two additional research visits to complete the battery of measures at 12-months and at a 3-month follow-up. Horyzons will be monitored daily (two hours per weekday and one hour per weekend day) by trained peer support specialists, master's level clinicians, and/or graduate students with relevant clinical/research experience with individuals with psychosis. Drs. David Penn and Kelsey Ludwig, who are clinical psychologists, lead weekly supervision calls to ensure appropriate care and support of clients involved in the trial, to discuss case conceptualization and suggestions for engaging clients in the platform.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common cause of hospitalization in the United States and Europe. The mainstay of treatment for ADHF is diuretic therapy. However, diuretic therapy is associated with a high incidence of adverse events, including acute kidney injury (AKI). AKI is associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with ADHF.

-----------------
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The 5-year survival rate is only 9%. The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease and are not eligible for curative treatment. The standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer is chemotherapy. However, the median overall survival (OS) is only 6-11 months. The prognosis of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer is poor and new treatment options are needed.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a new class of drugs that have shown promising results in the treatment of several types of cancer. ICIs work by blocking the interaction between the immune checkpoint proteins PD-1 and PD-L1 on T cells and tumor cells, respectively. This allows the immune system to recognize and attack the tumor cells. Durvalumab is a human anti-PD-L1 antibody that has shown promising results in the treatment of several types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer.
In addition to ICIs, other immunotherapies are being investigated for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. One such therapy is the use of TLR-3 agonists. TLR-3 agonists are synthetic double-stranded ribonucleic acid (dsRNA) molecules that activate the immune system by stimulating the production of type I interferons (IFNs). Type I IFNs have been shown to have anti-tumor effects by activating the immune system and promoting the production of tumor-specific antibodies. Rintatolimod is a TLR-3 agonist that has shown promising results in the treatment of several types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer.
In this study, we will investigate the combination of durvalumab and rintatolimod in the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We hypothesize that the combination of these two immunotherapies will be more effective than either drug alone.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the combination of durvalumab and rintatolimod in the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the clinical benefit rate, progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of the combination therapy. We will also explore the immunogenic effect of the combination therapy on the circulating and infiltrating immune profile.

Design
-----------------
This is a single-center, open-label, phase I-II study. The study will be conducted in two phases. In the phase Ib, we will determine the safety of the combination therapy by enrolling 12 patients and administering the combination therapy for 6 weeks. In the phase II, we will enroll 25 patients and administer the combination therapy for 12 weeks.

Intervention
-----------------
In the phase Ib, we will administer durvalumab at a dose of 1500 mg and rintatolimod at a dose of 200 mg twice per week for 6 weeks. In the phase II, we will administer durvalumab at a dose of 1500 mg and rintatolimod at a dose of 400 mg twice per week for 12 weeks.

Outcome measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure of this study is the safety of the combination therapy, as determined by the incidence of adverse events (AEs). The secondary outcome measures of this study are the clinical benefit rate, PFS, and OS of the combination therapy. We will also explore the immunogenic effect of the combination therapy on the circulating and infiltrating immune profile."
244,"The present project will be carried out through a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of approximately 40 female athletes pertaining to the Londrina Esporte Clube (name in Portuguese of the team) women's five-a-side soccer will be recruited for the study. The choice of exclusively women individuals is due to sexual dimorphism in pain perception, thus contributing to the results being more homogeneous and reliable. The criteria for inclusion of volunteer participants in the project will be to be between 16 and 35 years old, and to be able to perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Exclusion criteria will include locomotor system dysfunctions or use of analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication at the time of recruitment, as well as being on a calorie-restricted diet or ergogenic supplementation. The study will consist of two experimental groups, made up of healthy individuals, who will perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol, as follows: 1) control group that will receive placebo supplementation (corn starch tablets at a concentration of 750 mg); and 2) intervention group that will receive supplementation with diosmin (tablets at a concentration of 750 mg). Treatment of study participants will occur orally, and everyone will ingest identical opaque capsules containing placebo or diosmin with water. The treatment protocol will be applied before the start (pre-treatment) of the intense dynamic exercise sessions, once a day, during the two days before, and on the day (immediately before) the execution of the exercise protocol. Each experimental group will consist of approximately 20 participants. The project is approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) for Human Beings/Brazil Platform(protocol number 64025122.2.0000.0108). The selected participants will be informed about the objectives and methodology of the study and when there is agreement with the proposed design, the agreement to voluntarily participate in the study will be registered by means of an Informed Consent Form. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed (concentric and eccentric contractions) for the study will follow the following approach: participants will perform a standardized muscle injury protocol that will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until fatigue of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45° angle. Each The participant will have their load previously defined through the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) test, and 70% of the defined weight will be used during the intense dynamic exercise protocol. During each action, the load will be resisted with the legs placed on the leg-press supporter from full knee extension to the 90° knee flexion angle, lasting approximately 3-5 seconds. Between each series, participants will be able to take a 1-minute rest period. The intense dynamic exercise protocol that will be carried out by all participants will be supervised by the project manager and/or collaborators duly trained for such assessments. Participants' clinical signs will be monitored frequently during the activities and in case of discomfort, the activity will be stopped immediately. Analyzes of clinical and blood parameters will be carried out before the start (baseline) and after the end of the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol (24 and 48 hours) aiming to investigate the possible effects of diosmin on DOMS and related pathological events."

246,"Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common condition among pregnant women with metabolic implications for both the mother and offspring. Studies have suggested a potential role of vitamin D status in GDM risk, but evidence from randomized controlled trials is inadequate and inconclusive. A research has been planned to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM development among high risk pregnant women through a well-designed RCT.

Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM development among high risk pregnant women. The secondary objective is to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation on maternal and neonatal outcomes.

Study Design: This study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a parallel group design.

Study Population: Pregnant women at a risk to develop GDM with low vitamin D levels (<30 ng/mL) at 07-11 weeks of gestation will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D3 supplementation (2 00,000 IU/Week) for 04 -06 weeks or placebo.

Intervention: The intervention group will receive vitamin D3 supplementation (2 00,000 IU/Week) for 04 -06 weeks. The control group will receive placebo.

Outcomes: The primary outcome will be the incidence of GDM based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups Criteria after 75 g OGTT. The secondary outcomes will include maternal and neonatal outcomes such as maternal weight gain, gestational age at delivery, birth weight, and neonatal hypoglycemia.

Sample Size: The sample size will be calculated based on the incidence of GDM in the intervention and control groups. A total of 100 participants will be recruited in each group, with a total sample size of 200.

Data Collection: Data will be collected at baseline, during the intervention period, and at delivery. The data will include demographic information, medical history, vitamin D levels, and outcomes related to GDM and maternal and neonatal health.

Data Analysis: The data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods, including descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, and logistic regression analysis. The effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM development will be assessed using the incidence of GDM in the intervention and control groups. The secondary outcomes will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods.

Ethical Considerations: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board. Informed consent will be obtained from all participants before enrollment in the study.

Conclusion: This study will contribute to the understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and GDM risk through a well-designed RCT with integrated approaches. The findings may inform clinical practice and public health recommendations for vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy."

254,"Background
-----------------
Psychotic disorders are among the top ten causes of long-term disability and have a high chronicity potential and a high risk of invalidity. One-fifth of all patients with schizophrenia suffer from chronic symptoms and impairments, and the disease is associated with low long-term work performance, a high degree of all mental health care resources and high socioeconomic costs. These findings demonstrate the importance of sufficient treatment for psychotic disorders and, most importantly, point to a need for research so that more effective treatments can be developed in the future. In the recent decade, various psychotherapeutic programs with cognitive-behavioral background have been developed for patients with psychosis, and their efficacy has been investigated. Meta-analyses have shown superiority of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis over standard treatment, both in combination with antipsychotic medication and without. Many of the psychological approaches have focused primarily on treating the deficits associated with psychosis, as for example cognitive remediation or social skills training. However, these methods are not feasible in the acute setting and there are only a few psychotherapeutic instruments that can be used within a short period of time for inpatient treatment. The guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia recommend a combination of antipsychotic medication and psychosis-specific cognitive behavioral therapy. This includes all stages of the illness, also in the acute phase. The Swiss Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (SGPP) has stated in its treatment guidelines for schizophrenia that our group recommends a structured psychotherapeutic approach even in the acute phase of the disease. The best evidence currently exists for cognitive-behavioral approaches, […]. In any case, the psychotherapeutic procedure must be adapted to the circumstances of the acute phase and there is an urgent need for research on how this can be arranged in the setting of an acute ward. (p.10). Despite this explicit recommendation, to our knowledge there have been no studies that have systematically investigated this in the acute setting and results of which could therefore inform future treatment recommendations. As proposed by the SGPP, we would like to systematically test and evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions in the setting of an acute care unit in an initial pilot trial. Therapeutic alliance during the acute phase of psychotic illness is one of the most pressing obstacles for successful long term recovery. In order for patients to accept much-needed medication and psychosocial therapy and not drop out prematurely, intrinsic motivation to adhere to therapy is crucial. Motivational Interviewing is a method, that has been developed and evaluated over the last three decades and that shows promising results, not only for patients with addiction but also for other patients who struggle with compliance and ambivalence towards treatment and change of behavior. It is well known from clinical experience that patients are offered psychotherapy only late during the course of hospitalizations and not when it is highly needed - during the acute phase of their illness. Accordingly, there is a clear gap in the literature as to which interventions are particularly useful in this challenging yet crucial phase of the illness. (p.10).

-----------------
Schizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that affects approximately 1% of the world’s population. In India, the prevalence of schizophrenia is estimated to be 0.9% and the disease burden is expected to increase as the population ages and the prevalence of chronic medical conditions increases. The burden of disability due to schizophrenia is often underestimated as many epidemiological studies do not adequately account for the added burden of chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes that disproportionately impact individuals living with schizophrenia. Globally, the dramatically reduced life expectancy observed among individuals living with schizophrenia is largely due to preventable and treatable medical conditions. Recent epidemiological studies in India have further observed a mortality rate among individuals living with schizophrenia that is twice the rate observed in the general population, with calls for greater efforts to address this significant health disparity. In addition to recognizing the need to address the alarming care gap, where in India it is estimated that upwards of 75% of individuals living with schizophrenia do not have access to essential mental health care, urgent attention is also needed towards responding to the medical and physical health needs of this vulnerable patient population. Psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness and integration of task shared delivery of the evidence-based COPSI (Community care for People with Schizophrenia in India) program in primary care settings in India. We will build on important preliminary work led by project collaborators to support our aims to evaluate whether a novel digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness (Aim 1) and the integration (Aim 2) of an evidence-based psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India.

Objectives

258,"1. Background of the study
The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of occlusal splint therapy on the level of inflammatory cytokines in the blood and gingival crevicular fluid of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD).
TMD is a multifactorial disease with complex etiopathogenesis. The main symptoms are persistent pain in the masticatory muscles and preauricular region, limitations in jaw function, and sounds in the temporomandibular joints. The most commonly used therapy is the occlusal splint (OS). The therapeutic effect of OS is attributed to various factors, however the exact mechanism is still unknown. One of the potential diagnostic methods is the use of molecular biomarkers. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between inflammatory cytokines and pain in TMD patients compared to healthy controls. Molecular biomarker levels can be determined from tissue samples and body fluids. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is a serum exudate that enters the gingival sulcus from the gingival plexus of blood vessels and contains proteins, various cell types, electrolytes, cytokines, etc. Considering its composition, wide availability, non-invasive method, and speed of collection, GCF could be a new source of TMD biomarkers with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes.

266,"1. The investigators hypothesize that malaria and intestinal parasitic diseases may result in enhanced or tolerogenic innate immune responses that decrease the risk of symptomatic COVID-19. On the other hand, these conditions and deficiency of micronutrients may decrease the acquisition and longevity of antibodies induced by natural infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, increasing the risk of re-infection and breakthrough infections to vaccination. To test these hypotheses, up to 200 symptomatic individuals (index cases)will be enrolled, their household contacts (anticipated  700), and up to 600 vaccinees. The specific innate immune phenotypes that differentiate uninfected Malawians from Western controls (based on samples from blood banks) and whether those responses are protecting Malawians from infection and/or progression of disease will be assessed. Infected participants and vaccinees will be followed for up to 1.5 years to assess acquisition and longevity of Ab responses and memory B cells. 2.

| Change from baseline in the health-related quality of life assessed by the Euroqol-5 | The 5-level EQ-5D version (EQ-5D-5L) essentially consists of 2 pages: the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual analogue scale (EQ VAS). The descriptive system comprises five dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems and extreme problems. The patient is asked to indicate his/her health state by ticking the box next to the most appropriate statement in each of the five dimensions. This decision results in a 1-digit number that expresses the level selected for that dimension. The digits for the five dimensions can be combined into a 5-digit number that describes the patient's health state. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scal fom 0 to 100 points. | 12 months | 
| Relationship between hypoxic burden and hemoglobin and hematocrit | HB was defined as the total area under the oxygen saturation curve from a pre-event baseline oxygen desaturation. For each apnea and hypopnea the termination of the event is called time-zero. The oxygen saturation signals around time-zero are synchronized with respect to time-zero.The time-aligned oxygen saturation signals are ensemble-averaged such that the mean value at each time point is calculated, resulting in a subject-specific average oxygen saturation curve specific to apneas and hypopneas.A subject-specific search window to quantify the area under the desaturation curve for each respiratory event is defined as the interval between the pre-event and post-event maximum oxygen saturation values. This time-locked search window will be used to determine the start and end of oxygen desaturation and calculate the area under desaturation curve for each respiratory event.Total HB (%min/h) is defined as the sum of individual areas (%min) divided by total sleep time (h). | 12 months |

273,"Background
-----------------
Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the standard of care for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition. To this extent, two strategies have both proven to be effective in reducing bleeding complications while preserving efficacy compared with maintaining long-term DAPT with aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor: a) DAPT de-escalation (i.e., switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel while maintaining aspirin) and b) potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (i.e., maintaining prasugrel or ticagrelor and dropping aspirin). These strategies have been tested in a number of trials and have led to changes in practice guidelines to consider either one of these strategies as bleeding reduction approaches among ACS patients undergoing PCI. However, comparative assessments between DAPT de-escalation and potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy are lacking.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the thrombus formation (measured by T-TAS) between potent P2Y12 monotherapy strategy and de-escalation strategy (trough effect).

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective randomized study.

Study Population
-----------------
Patients who presented with chronic coronary syndrome, underwent PCI and have been on maintenance treatment with DAPT, composed of low-dose aspirin (81mg od) and prasugrel (10 mg od) or ticagrelor (90 mg bid) for at least 30 days. Or patients that presented with an Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) event and underwent PCI and have been on maintenance treatment with DAPT, composed of low-dose aspirin (81mg od) and prasugrel (10mg od) or ticagrelor (90mg bid) for 3 months or greater.

Intervention
-----------------
After at least 30 days of DAPT [with aspirin 81-mg od and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel 10 mg od or ticagrelor 90-mg BID)] in chronic coronary syndrome or after at least 90 days of DAPT in acute coronary syndromes; patients will continue aspirin and switch to clopidogrel 75-mg."

Participants will be prompted to use a pattern recognition-based myoelectric controller to operate a virtual prosthesis and complete a simulation of the GaMA Cup Transfer Task. The control group will be provided motor imagery exercises that involve brief attempts to move the missing limb in a similar manner to how they would control their pattern recognition system to strengthen their muscles. These exercises do not involve any real-time control feedback or functional assessment. The primary outcome measure is the time to successfully complete the entire task trial (all 4 cup movements) from start to finish; averaged over all successful trials. Secondary outcome measures include the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric Controls (ACMC), the GaMA Cup Transfer Task Completion Rate, and the GaMA Cup Transfer Task Wrist Activation."

285,"The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies. The investigators will first use our previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status. The investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns. The true value of this novel HBV chimera vh-DNA will be revealed. The results will also support the consolidative use of personalized vh-DNA for earlier evaluating treatment response after RT, for post-RT disease monitoring, and for differentiating clonality at recurrence to design future clinical trial on combinational treatment."

288,"Background
-----------------
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin secretion. It is a major public health concern, affecting approximately 463 million adults worldwide. T2DM is associated with a range of complications, including cardiovascular disease, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Nephropathy is a common complication of T2DM, affecting approximately 30-40% of patients. It is characterized by albuminuria, a condition in which albumin is excreted in the urine at levels higher than normal. Albuminuria is a strong predictor of kidney disease progression and cardiovascular events in patients with T2DM.

Currently, the standard of care for the treatment of albuminuria in patients with T2DM is the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). However, these medications are not always effective in reducing albuminuria, and they can cause side effects such as cough and dizziness. In recent years, there has been growing interest in the use of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors as a treatment for albuminuria in patients with T2DM. SGLT2 inhibitors work by blocking the reabsorption of glucose and sodium in the kidneys, leading to increased urinary excretion of these substances. This, in turn, can lead to a reduction in albuminuria.

Finerenone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRA) that is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for albuminuria in patients with T2DM. Finerenone works by blocking the action of aldosterone, a hormone that is involved in the regulation of blood pressure and fluid balance. By blocking the action of aldosterone, finerenone can reduce albuminuria and improve kidney function in patients with T2DM.

In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate the individual response to empagliflozin and finerenone in patients with T2DM and albuminuria. The investigators will also assess the feasibility of conducting a remote clinical trial using digital technologies.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the individual response to empagliflozin and finerenone in patients with T2DM and albuminuria. The investigators will assess the change in urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) from baseline to the end of treatment with empagliflozin and finerenone.

The secondary objectives of this study are to evaluate the individual response to empagliflozin and finerenone in terms of changes in systolic blood pressure, body weight, eGFR, and fasting plasma glucose from baseline to the end of treatment. The investigators will also assess the feasibility of conducting a remote clinical trial using digital technologies.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, crossover study. The study will be conducted in two phases: a screening phase and a treatment phase.

In the screening phase, eligible patients will undergo a series of baseline assessments, including a medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and urine collection. Patients will also be asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their perspectives on the feasibility of participating in a remote clinical trial using digital technologies.

In the treatment phase, eligible patients will be randomized to one of three treatment groups: empagliflozin monotherapy, finerenone monotherapy, or empagliflozin followed by finerenone. Patients in the empagliflozin monotherapy group will receive empagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 28 days. Patients in the finerenone monotherapy group will receive finerenone 10 mg once daily for 28 days. Patients in the empagliflozin followed by finerenone group will receive empagliflozin 10 mg once daily for 28 days, followed by finerenone 10 mg once daily for 28 days.

During the treatment phase, patients will be asked to collect their urine samples using a validated urine collection device (PeeSpot) and send them to the laboratory for analysis. Patients will also be asked to measure their blood pressure and body weight using validated devices (Withings BPM Connect and Withings Body) and send the"

290,"1. Background and significance: Dental erosion is a multifactorial disease that is caused by the loss of tooth structure due to chemical dissolution. It is a common condition that affects people of all ages and can lead to tooth sensitivity, pain, and even tooth loss. The prevalence of dental erosion has been reported to be as high as 90% in some populations, and it is estimated that approximately 10% of the global population is affected by this condition. Dental erosion is a significant public health problem that can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life. It can cause pain, discomfort, and difficulty eating, speaking, and smiling. In addition, dental erosion can lead to the need for costly dental treatments, such as fillings, crowns, and root canal therapy. 2. Aims and objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash on the oral microbiome, salivary pellicle, and vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. The specific objectives of this study are as follows: To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on the oral microbiome in individuals with dental erosion. To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on the salivary pellicle in individuals with dental erosion. To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. To determine the effect of CHX mouthwash on oxidative stress markers and redox-related molecules in individuals with dental erosion. 3. Methods: The study will involve a randomised, double-blind, crossover trial design. A total of 24 participants will be recruited, with 12 participants in each group. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either CHX mouthwash or a placebo mouthwash for a period of 7 days. After a washout period of 12 weeks, participants will switch to the other mouthwash for another 7 days. During the study, participants will be asked to provide saliva and blood samples at baseline and at various time points during the study. The samples will be analysed using a variety of techniques, including DNA sequencing, proteomics analysis, and ELISA. 4. Expected outcomes: The expected outcomes of this study are as follows: To identify changes in the oral microbiome in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. To identify changes in the salivary pellicle in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. To identify changes in vascular function in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. To identify changes in oxidative stress markers and redox-related molecules in individuals with dental erosion following the use of CHX mouthwash. 5. Potential impact: The results of this study will provide valuable information on the effect of CHX mouthwash on the oral microbiome, salivary pellicle, and vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. This information will be useful for developing new treatments for dental erosion and for improving the overall oral health of individuals with this condition. In addition, the results of this study will contribute to our understanding of the role of the oral microbiome and salivary pellicle in the development and progression of dental erosion. 6. Ethical considerations: The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and all relevant ethical guidelines. Participants will be informed of the potential risks and benefits of participating in the study, and they will be asked to provide written informed consent before participating in the study. The study will be conducted in a safe and ethical manner, and all participants will be treated with respect and dignity. 7. Conclusion: In conclusion, this study will provide valuable information on the effect of CHX mouthwash on the oral microbiome, salivary pellicle, and vascular function in individuals with dental erosion. The results of this study will be useful for developing new treatments for dental erosion and for improving the overall oral health of individuals with this condition."
291,"Background
-----------------
Opioid use is a major public health concern in many countries. In the USA, the opioid epidemic has led to a significant increase in opioid-related deaths and a decline in life expectancy. In Norway, the use of opioids has also increased in recent years, and the number of opioid-related deaths has increased. However, the impact of the opioid epidemic in Norway has been less severe than in the USA. One possible explanation for this is the different approaches to opioid prescribing and management in the two countries. In the USA, opioid prescribing is often more liberal, and there is a greater emphasis on treating pain with opioids. In Norway, opioid prescribing is more conservative, and there is a greater emphasis on non-pharmacological approaches to pain management.
-----------------
The aim of this study is to explore if a Pain and Coordination Plan (PAC-plan) for patients after accidental injury can reduce opioid use and improve quality of life.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of a PAC-plan on opioid use in patients after accidental injury. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the effect of the PAC-plan on pain, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and other patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs).

Study design
-----------------
The study is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT). Participants will be assigned randomly to study conditions (1:1) through permuted block randomization with various sizes of the blocks (4, 6, 8, 10) in random order. The randomization will be performed manually by the principle investigator (PI). Sealed, opaque, numbered envelopes will be used, and will be opened after consent from the patient. For the intervention group, the patients receive a Pain- and Coordination plan (PAC-plan) at discharge from the hospital. The PAC-plan includes: Upon discharge, patients have a patient-centered conversation and receive written information covering patient education on opioids, a tapering plan, and a plan for contact and follow-up with the general practitioner. The information is based on the Norwegian National Guide for Addictive Medications. Before discharge, patients are scheduled an appointment with the GP, preferably within the first 2 weeks (2-4 weeks), for a follow-up regarding the injury and pain management. The GP is invited to maintain contact with the study nurse at the hospital for one year. The general practitioner can call for consultation with the study nurse, and if necessary, be connected with relevant medical specialists for advice and eventually further follow-up.

Sessions will occur weekly over the course of 4 consecutive weeks and will not exceed 60 minutes in length. Each session will include a 15- to 20-minute writing stint whereby participants are asked to write about their deepest thoughts and feelings regarding their loved one's cancer and their role as caregiver. All participants will be given a Rocketbook for this purpose, a spiral notebook that has the look and feel of a standard paper notebook but uses a pen with erasable ink. The writing stint will be followed by a group discussion; participants will be invited to share what they wrote about (if so desired) and their reactions to the writing process. Each session will end with a debriefing and erasure of the writing content just created.

Gender affirming mastectomy (GAM) is a surgical procedure that is performed to remove breast tissue in transgender and non-binary individuals. The procedure is typically performed in two stages, with the first stage involving the removal of breast tissue and the second stage involving the reconstruction of the chest. GAM is a relatively new procedure, and there is limited data on the safety and efficacy of the procedure. One of the most common complications of GAM is postoperative bleeding, which can lead to hematoma formation, seroma formation, and increased drain output. Hematoma formation is a collection of blood outside of blood vessels that requires intervention such as aspiration or surgical drainage. Seroma formation is a collection of fluid that accumulates in the surgical site after mastectomy that requires intervention such as aspiration or surgical drainage. Drain output is the amount of fluid (in milliliters) collected in surgical drains after mastectomy. The volume of fluid collected will be recorded by patients daily until the drains are removed. All patients will have surgical drains placed after mastectomy. Patients will be instructed to report any unusual drainage or bleeding to their healthcare provider. Data on drain output will be collected as a continuous variable, as well as the duration of drain placement. Time to drain removal will be defined as the number of days from mastectomy surgery to the day the surgical drains are removed. The timing of drain removal will be determined by the primary surgeon, based on the amount and character of fluid collected in the drain, and the presence of factors such as infection, hematoma, or seroma. However, drains will typically be removed when they have produced < 30cc/day for at least 3 days. The timing of drain removal will be recorded by nursing staff at the time of removal. Data on time to drain removal will be collected as a continuous variable, as well as the reason for early or delayed drain removal.

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled single-surgeon trial performed at the University of California San Francisco that investigates the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing GAM. All patients who meet WPATH guidelines for GAM, undergo GAM, ASA I-III, and are >18 years old will have the opportunity to be enrolled. Patients will be randomized by a random computer generator and will be notified after randomization as to which group they are assigned. The investigators will enroll patients into this prospective trial investigating the effect of IV TXA on postoperative bleeding, hematoma, seroma, drain output, and time to drain removal. Patients will be randomized into two groups, an experimental group receiving IV TXA and a control group that will not receive IV TXA. Patients will be excluded if they are <18 years old, have a history of prior chest surgeries, coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, and have a history of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Patients will also be excluded if they are chronically anticoagulated, are on antiplatelet medications or have ever had an adverse reaction to IV TXA. All patients who are being scheduled to undergo bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction will be recruited to participate in the study. Patients will be consented to participate in the preoperative visit. Experimental Group: Patients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Postoperative care will be standard and based on established UCSF guidelines. Control Group: Patients in the control group will not receive any TXA intraoperatively and will undergo a traditional GAM. Tranexamic Acid is available as a sterile, single-dose. This 1g vial is readily available in the anesthesia cart in the operating room. Immediately following induction, the anesthesia team will administer 1g of TXA intravenously. After obtaining hemostasis and irrigating as per standard practice, anesthesia shall not use any other hemostatic agents. Post-procedure, each patient will be provided with standard postoperative instructions which will include a chart to record daily drain outputs for the right and left sides. At subsequent postoperative visits, drain output will be assessed at each clinic visit to determine timing for removal. The total drain output will be measured by the patient and later logged into our chart for later analysis. Dr"

324,"The investigators discovered that frontal lobe damage and Aiming SN both predict optimal recovery of functional independence after prism adaptation treatment (PAT). These findings argue for the development of an [objective, biomarker-based process to identify patients who should be administered PAT. The algorithm will be developed by identifying specific neurobiological features predictive of PAT treatment response. Thus, the investigators expect this research will deliver a critical missing element to rehabilitation, eliminating clinician uncertainty about SN diagnosis and appropriateness of PAT, and allowing a more personalized health care approach to SN rehabilitation. The team of researchers at three high-performing VA medical centers, distinguished in cognitive neurology analysis of brain imaging predictors, and stroke rehabilitation, from both advanced and clinical data, will develop the first biological parameter that can be used to assign SN rehabilitation. In 180 Veterans (120 with SN, 60 without), the investigators will define and validate brain imaging biomarkers that predict the presence of Aiming SN (Aim 1), a strong predictor of functional recovery after receiving PAT. The expectation that disconnection of frontal regions with subcortical and parietal regions will predict Aiming SN. The investigators will also examine the correlation between the brain imaging biomarkers predicting Aiming SN and improvements in daily life function after PAT (Aim 2).] Then, the investigators will determine if adding behavioral predictors to biomarker predictors (Aim 3) accounts for additional variance in the trajectory of functional recovery. The overall impact of the investigators' work will be to establish the utility of a validated biomarker that routinely identifies Veterans with SN after stroke who are the best candidates for PAT. Armed with a biomarker-based algorithm, the investigators can then carry out a large-scale PAT clinical trial, and personalized SN care. This care pathway could reduce reliance on specialized SN assessment, [coordinate VA and community systems providing Veteran stroke care,] and improve stroke care efficiency, to enhance outcomes and quality of life after stroke for thousands of Veterans."
325,"The investigators want to start a pilot study of this technique in those patients with brain lesions in the resonance images compatible with a glioma-like tumor. In particular, the main aim of the study is to analyze the blood samples obtained from these patients in order to detect and quantify the circulating DNA (ctDNA) of tumor cells on it. These DNA fragments are expelled into the bloodstream by mechanisms still unknown as a result of numerous processes of apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells. By analyzing them through a ddPCR, the investigators will try to detect the specific mutations present in this tumoral ctDNA, allowing the team to confirm the presence of a glioma-type tumor, and providing real-time information of its classification as astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma."

-----------------
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects the red blood cells. The most common form of SCD is sickle cell anemia (SCA), which is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene. This mutation causes the red blood cells to become sickle-shaped, which can lead to a number of complications, including pain crises. Pain crises are one of the most common and debilitating complications of SCD. They are caused by a blockage of blood flow to the tissues, which can lead to severe pain. Pain crises can last for days or even weeks, and they can be very difficult to treat.

Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that uses computer-generated images to create a simulated environment. VR has been used to treat a variety of conditions, including pain. There is some evidence that VR can be effective in reducing pain in patients with SCD. However, there is a lack of high-quality studies on the use of VR for pain management in patients with SCD.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of VR in reducing pain in patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis. The study will also examine the safety of VR in this population.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of VR in reducing pain in patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis. The secondary objectives of this study are to determine the safety of VR in this population and to examine the feasibility of using VR in this setting.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be VR therapy. Patients will be given a VR headset and will be asked to use it for 30 minutes.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity, as measured by the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). The secondary outcome measures will be safety, as measured by the number of adverse events, and feasibility, as measured by the number of patients who complete the study.

Data Collection and Management
-----------------
Data will be collected at baseline and at the end of the study. Data will be collected using a standardized data collection form.

Statistical Analysis
-----------------
The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics. The primary outcome measure will be analyzed using a paired t-test. The secondary outcome measures will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.

Discussion
-----------------
This study will provide important information on the effectiveness of VR in reducing pain in patients with SCD who are experiencing a pain crisis. The study will also provide information on the safety and feasibility of using VR in this setting.

341,"The main purpose of this project is to investigate the accuracy of pocket-sized ultrasound (PsUS) in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures. The primary research objective is to determine the test performance characteristics of PSUS performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians compared to radiography for the detection of pediatric elbow fractures. The project will consist of two parts, first involving a feasibility study and followed by an active study. This project will consist of two parts, involving first a brief feasibility phase followed by a pilot study conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department (Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago, IL). For the feasibility phase, the purpose is to demonstrate that novice PsUS users are able to obtain accurate and adequate imaging for interpretation. This phase will initially involve the study providers receiving the elbow PsUS exam training. Once trained, each study provider will obtain 3 elbow exams of participants between the ages of 1-16 years old. Providers will use the standardized views reviewed in the ultrasound training to perform the exam, with verbal consent obtained from each participant's parent for inclusion in the feasibility study. These images will be reviewed by study staff to ensure US examiners are obtaining the correct standardized views. Once the feasibility exams are completed, the study providers are able to begin active study recruitment which will involve recruiting children between the ages of 1-16 years old with isolated acute elbow pain. Parents will initially be approached in the emergency department (ED), with written consent obtained if interested and eligible. Once consented, patients will undergo bilaterally standardized elbow exams using the pocket-sized ultrasound. All images will be stored on a password protected, cloud-based imaging database with all identifying information removed. After the exam, a basic assessment of the images will be made by the bedside ultrasound provider, as positive, negative or equivocal for signs of elbow fracture, but before reviewing any radiographic imaging. A positive PsUS will be defined as the presence of signs of elbow fracture, either as direct signs including cortical discontinuities or indirect signs including posterior fat pad with or without lipohemarthrosis on ultrasound exam. Following the ultrasound exam, patients will undergo standard clinical care for acute elbow injury per primary ED team which may consist of Xray or possible bedside nursemaid reduction. When applicable, study investigators will review the final blinded radiology readings of the initial or subsequent x-ray images after the patient encounter. Additionally, research staff will also attempt to follow up with participants after their ED visit for their elbow injury to determine if any additional radiographic imaging or care was obtained and if subsequent occult fractures were discovered on later imaging that may have been missed on the initial evaluation. The primary aim of the feasibility portion of the study is to determine acceptability of the PsUS study training to obtain adequate elbow images. The primary aim of the active study is to compare the initial test performance characteristics of PSUS performed by bedside physicians compared to standard radiography in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures."

-----------------
Hallux valgus is a common foot deformity that causes pain and discomfort in the foot. It is characterized by the deviation of the big toe towards the second toe, resulting in a bunion on the inside of the foot. The condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, foot structure, and wearing ill-fitting shoes. Hallux valgus can lead to a range of symptoms, including pain, swelling, and difficulty walking. In severe cases, it can also lead to the development of arthritis in the joint of the big toe.

Treatment options for hallux valgus include conservative and surgical approaches. Conservative treatments include the use of orthotics, such as toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses. These devices are designed to realign the big toe and reduce the pressure on the bunion. They can be worn during the day or at night, depending on the severity of the condition.

Toe separator orthoses are designed to separate the toes and realign the big toe. They are made of silicone and do not use tape or straps to separate the first and second toes and pull them medially to realign the first metatarsal. The orthoses reduce the pain in the bunion area by reducing the high friction between the shoe and the bunion.

Dynamic orthoses, on the other hand, contain a free joint that does not hinder the movement of the first metatarsophalangeal joint. The working principle of the orthosis is to provide healing of the deformity with low torque and long-term stretching. The dynamic orthosis corrects the hallux valgus angle by realigning the hallux, thus allowing plantarflexion and dorsiflexion.

Both toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses have been shown to be effective in reducing the symptoms of hallux valgus. However, there is limited research comparing the effectiveness of these two types of orthoses. Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses in reducing the symptoms of hallux valgus.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of toe separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses in reducing the symptoms of hallux valgus. The secondary objectives are to compare the effectiveness of these two types of orthoses in reducing the hallux valgus angle and improving foot function and quality of life.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the toe separator orthosis group and the dynamic orthosis group.

Participants
-----------------
Participants will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology at Istanbul Medipol University. The inclusion criteria are as follows:

- Age between 18 and 65 years
- Diagnosis of mild to moderate hallux valgus
- Willingness to participate in the study and sign the informed consent form

The exclusion criteria are as follows:

- History of surgery on the foot
- Presence of rheumatoid arthritis disease
- Hallux valgus deformity is rigid

Interventions
-----------------
Participants in both groups will be asked to use their orthoses for an average of 8 hours per day for 1 month. The orthoses to be used during the study will be randomly distributed to the individuals participating in the study.

Primary Outcome Measure
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the hallux valgus angle. The angle will be measured using a goniometer. The measurement will be performed by a single researcher.

Secondary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The secondary outcome measures are foot function and quality of life. Foot function will be assessed using the Foot Function Index (FFI). Quality of life will be assessed using the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ).

Data Collection

344,"1. Background: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a common mental disorder that seriously affects the physical and mental health of patients. The pathogenesis of AUD is complex and involves multiple factors. The gut microbiota is an important factor in the pathogenesis of AUD. The gut microbiota is closely related to the immune system, and the imbalance of the gut microbiota can lead to the release of inflammatory factors, which can further aggravate the symptoms of AUD. Probiotics are live microorganisms that can improve the balance of the gut microbiota. Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a psychological intervention that can help patients accept and cope with their emotions and thoughts. It has been shown to be effective in treating AUD. 2. Objective: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of probiotics and ACT on the gut microbiota and inflammatory factors in patients with AUD. 3. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial. A total of 120 patients with AUD will be recruited and randomly assigned to three groups: probiotics group, ACT group, and placebo group. The probiotics group will receive probiotics supplementation, the ACT group will receive ACT intervention, and the placebo group will receive placebo supplementation. The gut microbiota and inflammatory factors of patients will be analyzed at baseline and at the end of the intervention. 4. Expected Results: We expect that probiotics and ACT can improve the gut microbiota and inflammatory factors in patients with AUD, and that these improvements can lead to better treatment outcomes. 5. Significance: This study will provide new insights into the treatment of AUD and may lead to the development of new treatments for this disorder."

346,"The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. Objectives Primary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. Secondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers. Study design The primary hypothesis will be tested using cognitive tasks performed by participants in an fMRI scanner. In order to assess striatal reactivity to reward, the investigators will use fMRI combined with a reward task. The investigators will use fMRI combined with a facial emotion recognition task to measure the reactivity of the amygdala to emotional stimuli. These tasks will allow the investigators to establish the brain phenotypes characterizing impulsive and emotional gamblers, and test the hypothesis that these phenotypes are diametrically opposed in these two sub-populations. The secondary hypothesis will be tested by combining fMRI measures with behavioral measures from everyday life (EMA). In concrete terms, gamblers will be followed longitudinally for up to 4 weeks, and will receive short questionnaires 3 to 4 times a day on their smartphones to assess their gambling behavior (number of hours spent gambling, amount of money spent...) as well as their emotions (positive and negative). These measurements will enable the investigators to test the hypothesis that the brain phenotypes described above are capable of predicting the relationship between emotions and gambling behavior in everyday life. Study population This study will focus on individuals with gambling problems. This category includes individuals suffering from gambling addiction as defined by the DSM-5, and individuals suffering from problem gambling, just below the DSM-5 diagnostic threshold. Extending recruitment to individuals with problem gambling should facilitate recruitment, while considering the existence of a continuum of gambling problems. The study will also include a control group of healthy subjects with no gambling problems and no psychiatric comorbidities. The plan is to recruit 60 gamblers and 60 healthy controls."

-----------------
Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by progressive and generalized loss of skeletal muscle mass and strength with a risk of adverse outcomes such as physical disability, poor quality of life and death. The prevalence of sarcopenia is increasing with the aging of the population. The pathophysiology of sarcopenia is multifactorial and includes age-related changes in muscle, hormonal changes, and inflammation. The inflammatory process is characterized by increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). These cytokines can lead to muscle atrophy and weakness. In addition, sarcopenia is associated with a decrease in insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) levels, which is an important regulator of muscle growth and repair. IGF-1 levels are known to decrease with age, and this may contribute to the development of sarcopenia.

Ophiochepalus striatus is a traditional Chinese medicine that has been used for centuries to treat various conditions, including sarcopenia. Recent studies have shown that Ophiochepalus striatus extract can increase IGF-1 levels and reduce inflammation in animal models. However, there is limited evidence on the effects of Ophiochepalus striatus extract on IGF-1 levels and inflammation in humans.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Ophiochepalus striatus extract on IGF-1 levels and inflammation in elderly patients with sarcopenia. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Ophiochepalus striatus extract or placebo for 14 days. IGF-1 levels and inflammatory markers will be measured at baseline and after the intervention period. The primary outcome of the study will be the change in IGF-1 levels from baseline to the end of the intervention period. Secondary outcomes will include changes in muscle mass, muscle strength, and physical performance.

Breast reduction surgery is a common procedure performed in adolescent girls. It is associated with significant post-operative pain. The use of local anesthetics has been shown to decrease post-operative pain in other surgical procedures. The use of local anesthetics in breast reduction surgery has been shown to decrease post-operative pain in adult patients. However, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of local anesthetics in adolescent patients. The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of local anesthetics in the form of subpectoral bupivacaine in adolescent patients undergoing breast reduction surgery will decrease post-operative pain.

Objectives
-----------------
Primary: To determine if the use of subpectoral bupivacaine in adolescent patients undergoing breast reduction surgery will decrease post-operative pain. Secondary: To determine if the use of subpectoral bupivacaine in adolescent patients undergoing breast reduction surgery will decrease narcotic use, length of stay in the post-anesthesia care unit, and time to return to full activity.

Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomized into either the study group (receiving intraoperative subpectoral bupivacaine) or the control group (will not receive subpectoral bupivacaine.) Block randomization will be performed using randomizer.org. For every forty patients, twenty will be randomized into the control group, and twenty into the bupivacaine group. Patients will be blinded to the which group they are placed in. The PI and study staff are not blinded. Per standard protocol, patients will undergo urine pregnancy testing in the pre-operative area. If results are positive, patients will be informed of the results in a private area. Surgery will be postponed and patients will be then excluded from the study. Patients will undergo their procedure with their assigned intervention. Intra-operative anesthetic and pain control regimens will otherwise be standardized with the anesthesia team to remove other confounding factors/variables. Administration of the saline/bupivacaine will be just below the fascia of the pectroalis major. This will occur following resection of the specimen and achievement of hemostasis, prior to closure of the wounds. Injections will be in a fan-like pattern, beginning at the inferolateral border of the pectoral is muscle, extending superomedially with injection, spanning the anterior surface of the pectroalis major. This will be performed under direct visualization; no imaging assistance is necessary. Each patient will receive 5 injections, 3mL per injection bilaterally. A total of 30mL of saline or bupivacaine will be injected. PACU nurses will record pain scores upon arrival into the PACU, as well as upon discharge home from the hospital. All patients will receive the same amount of prescribed narcotic. They will be sent home with a log. Patients will record a daily pain score, and the number of doses of ibuprofen, acetaminophen and oxycodone. As an internal quality control measure, research staff will call patients within 72 hours from surgery to ensure they are completing the pain score and medication log daily. The clinician (MD, PA, or nurse) will go through the survey questions with patients at their 1 and 4 week post-operative visits. These questions are typical questions asked at follow-up and will not add significant time to the clinic visit. All clinical staff asking these surveys is familiar with the information. (see appendices) Data will be collected at the 1 and 4 week post-operative visit in the plastic surgery clinic Further data (PACU length of stay, PACU pain scores) will be determined by performing chart review. To minimize error and maximize quality, only a few clinicians (3-4 max) will be those obtaining the survey results in clinic. All questions will be asked by reading verbatim from the survey to avoid bias when questioning. Scores will be entered into an excel file each day at the end of clinic. The spreadsheet will be password protected to ensure patient privacy. Only the surgeon, PA and RN will have access to this. Interim analyses will be performed after 60 patients have undergone treatment in order to assess if the study is meeting the intended objectives.

In the United States, LBP is the second most common reason for visits to primary care physicians, and the most common reason for missed work. The annual cost of LBP in the United States is estimated to be $100 billion. The prevalence of LBP is estimated to be 23% in the general population, and 60-85% of the population will experience LBP at some point in their lives. LBP is a complex condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including muscle strain, disc herniation, and spinal stenosis. While there are many treatments for LBP, including medication, physical therapy, and surgery, these treatments are often ineffective or have significant side effects. There is a need for safe and effective treatments for LBP that do not require medication or surgery. 2. Hypothesis: T'ai Chi and Qigong is a safe and effective treatment for LBP that does not require medication or surgery. 3. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to examine whether a safe and moderate online t'ai chi and qigong exercise program, offered without cost to individuals with chronic back pain, improves pain levels, sleep, and quality of life. The secondary objective is to explore whether improvements in pain levels are different among smokers and those with unhealthy BMI than among others. 4. Study design: The study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with two groups: a t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and a waitlist control group. The treatment group started the t'ai chi and qigong classes in September 2022; the waitlist control group was offered instruction beginning in January 2023. The waitlist control group will simply be a comparison group. Thus, we will be comparing the outcomes of key measures between the treatment group receiving t'ai chi and qigong instruction starting in September and the waitlist control group. 5. Methods: The study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with two groups: a t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and a waitlist control group. The treatment group started the t'ai chi and qigong classes in September 2022; the waitlist control group was offered instruction beginning in January 2023. The waitlist control group will simply be a comparison group. Thus, we will be comparing the outcomes of key measures between the treatment group receiving t'ai chi and qigong instruction starting in September and the waitlist control group. After the baseline survey was closed to further responses, the data was exported as an SPSS file, then converted to Stata, by the PI onto his NYMC-issued, password-protected computer, which is in a secure space. Participants then were randomized either to start class in September 2022 (the treatment group) or January 2023 (the waitlisted control group). The treatment and waitlist control groups were randomized using Stata statistical software through a standard randomization algorithm. The algorithm would ensure that participants had an equal chance of being assigned to either arm. A simple, post-randomization analysis of participants assigned to the two arms was conducted to confirm that participants in the treatment and control groups are similar in terms of baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores. (A comparison of means t-test will be used.) Previously validated, self-administered survey instruments will be included in the Survey to be used to assess the primary outcome of interest, low back pain, as well as associated outcomes of sleep and quality of life, including: The Oswestry Disability Index (primary pain measurement) The Visual Analog Scale for Back and Leg Pain (additional pain measurement) The SF-36, Short Form Health Survey questionnaire (health and quality of life) 19-Item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index A maximum of 300 people with chronic low back pain were selected to participate in the program on a first-come basis. The treatment and control groups were divided into roughly equal numbers, with a maximum of 150 participants selected for participation in the live Zoom t'ai chi classes starting in September 2022 and a maximum of 150 participants selected for the waitlist control. The project will include a minimum of 200 total recruited participants, which, accounting for possible attrition, will result in a minimum of 50 participants in each study group, enough to statistically analyze the primary outcome of pain alleviation (see Sample Size and Power below"

Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common non-cutaneous malignancy in men in the United States. Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the standard of care for men with hormone-sensitive PC. ADT is associated with a number of adverse effects, including cognitive decline. Cognitive decline is a common side effect of ADT, with up to 50% of men experiencing cognitive decline after starting ADT. Cognitive decline is associated with a decline in quality of life (QoL) and is a significant source of distress for men and their families. The mechanisms underlying cognitive decline after ADT are not well understood. One potential mechanism is the accumulation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the brain. Aβ is a protein that is normally cleared from the brain by the glymphatic system. However, in some individuals, Aβ accumulates in the brain and forms plaques. These plaques are a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia. Aβ plaques are also found in the brains of individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. MCI is a condition in which individuals have mild cognitive impairment but do not meet the criteria for dementia. ADT is associated with a number of adverse effects, including cognitive decline.

Cellulitis is a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, and many patients are hospitalized. Current evidence is lacking regarding the optimal management of cellulitis. If high-dose cephalexin is found to be superior to standard-dose cephalexin, this will change practice, with the potential to reduce unnecessary IV antibiotic use, hospitalization, and costs. The results will help inform future skin and soft tissue infection treatment guidelines.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to determine whether high-dose cephalexin is superior to standard-dose cephalexin in the treatment of ED adult patients with cellulitis.

Study Design
-----------------
The investigators will conduct a multicentre, parallel-arm double-blind, individually randomized trial comparing high-dose (1000 mg) cephalexin to standard-dose (500 mg) cephalexin to treat ED adult patients with cellulitis. This is a superiority trial. The trial will be conducted at 8 Canadian EDs. A total sample size of 446 patients (223 per group) will be required.

Study Population
-----------------
Inclusion Criteria: Adults (age ≥18 years) diagnosed with non-purulent cellulitis and determined by the treating emergency physician to be eligible for outpatient oral antibiotics.

Exclusion Criteria: Age <18 years; Patient already taking oral antibiotics; Treating physician decides IV antibiotics are required; Abscess requiring an incision and drainage procedure; Known prior cellulitis secondary to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); Cellulitis secondary to a human or animal bite wound; Penetrating wound or water exposure resulting in cellulitis; Surgical site infection; Patient found at a follow up visit to have an alternative, non-infectious etiology (e.g., deep vein thrombosis); bilateral symptoms (e.g., both legs involved); Malignancy and currently being treated with chemotherapy; Solid organ or bone marrow transplant recipient; Renal impairment with an estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 mL/min documented on the health record at any time within the past three months; Allergy to cephalosporins or history of anaphylaxis to penicillin; Inability to provide informed consent

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention is high-dose cephalexin (1000mg PO QID) for seven days. The comparator is standard-dose cephalexin (500mg PO QID) plus oral placebo for seven days.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome is outpatient oral antibiotic treatment failure, defined as a change in antibiotic (change in class of oral antibiotic or step up to IV therapy) within 7 days due to worsening infection. Any of the following meet criteria for worsening infection (at day 3 or 8 follow-up): (1) New fever (temperature ≥38.0C) or persistent fever at follow-up; (2) Increasing area of erythema (in cm2) ≥20% from baseline; or (3) Increasing pain ≥2 points from baseline (using the numeric rating scale).

Secondary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The secondary outcome measures are: clinical cure, clinical response, unplanned visits to a healthcare provider for cellulitis, unplanned hospitalization for cellulitis, adverse events, antibiotic intolerance, antibiotic allergy, medication adherence, and health-related quality of life."

376,"This is a prospective, longitudinal cohort study in people with Cystic Fibrosis (pwCF) that involves the repeated serial sampling of participants. This study design was chosen to provide comprehensive information on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence changes over time and the subsequent clinical impact on pwCF. The study will be conducted at participating CF centers over a 3-year period. Study participants will include pediatric and adult pwCF. For the UK section of the study, UK investigators in the European Cystic Fibrosis Society-Clinical Trials Network (ECFS-CTN) will be invited to participate. Participating investigators can enroll all eligible pwCF over a 12-month period. Participants are then followed up for 24 months. Participants will donate blood samples at their routine clinic visits. Blood samples will be collected at Day 0 (baseline), at Months 6, 12, 18, and 24 (to coincide with routine clinical reviews). Additional blood samples will be taken opportunistically every time the participant visits the clinic for blood draws. These blood samples could be related to, routine care, annual review visits, pulmonary exacerbations (PEx), CF complications, or when initiating new treatments (e.g. CFTR modulators). Serum from blood samples will be shipped to a central laboratory (Queen's University Belfast) for standardized measurement of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Alongside the blood samples, the investigators will also collect clinical data from the patient's health records and will input this data into the case report form (CRF). Clinical data will be collected in conjunction with routine care visits, according to local clinical practice. Investigators will collect data elements from information routinely recorded in the patient's medical records. Data will be collected at baseline, months 6, 12, 18, and 24 as per the study schedule, and at additional blood sampling time points as previously explained above. Data collection will include routine data available from CF clinic follow-ups including background demographic information, CF medical history, medications, exacerbation information, sputum microbiology, and clinical and lung function parameters. Information on SARS-CoV-2 infection history and vaccine receipt will also be collected. The maximum follow-up duration of participation in the study for each patient will be 24 months. This study duration (24-month follow-up) is justified as it provides sufficient time to observe changes in antibody prevalence over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as sufficient time to determine long-term clinical outcomes for pwCF who are SARS-CoV-2 seropositive. Furthermore, we anticipate the 2-year study follow-up period will provide sufficient time to observe the impact of vaccination on antibody levels given that a number of vaccines are now commercially available. The investigators will compare the level of antibody responses between natural COVID-19 infection and vaccination in pwCF and how this varies over time. This will be achieved by analyzing seroprevalence and antibody levels according to natural infection and vaccination status and according to time of sample post-infection or post-vaccination, if known. Optional Study sample collection: For participants who consent, a second blood sample will also be drawn into EDTA tubes (plasma). Consent to this optional study sample would allow this sample and any remaining serum (following antibody testing) to be stored for future analysis and allow further research to be carried out on related studies to COVID-19 and CF."

380,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of different NMES protocols applied to the triceps surae muscle for evoked torque, muscle fatigue, sensory discomfort, and peripheral oxygen extraction. The effects of the types of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) protocols on the aforementioned outcomes will be evaluated in the same participant by randomizing the sequences of the protocols applied. The study is considered double-blind, as individuals will not know the sequence of the protocols applied. The evaluator will also not know which protocol will be used at the time of the intervention. It will consist of a total of 5 sessions with seven days between them. In the first session, anthropometry, the maximum intensity level for each electrical stimulation protocol as well as the protocol sequence for each individual will be evaluated. From the second to the fifth session, the following will be considered: voluntary and evoked maximum joint torque of the triceps surae muscle, muscle fatigue through the evaluation of the H-reflex, M-wave, fatigue index, torque-time-integral and recruitment curve, peripheral oxygen extraction, electromyographic signals through RMS (root mean square) and median frequency, and level of sensory discomfort with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS). From the second to the fifth session will be composed by the following evaluation sequence: warm-up with six submaximal contractions with 6 seconds of duration and 10 seconds of rest between them; then the assessment of muscle fatigue; then two maximal isometric contractions, then two maximal evoked contractions; fatigue protocol at 20% of the maximum isometric contraction (this fatigue protocol will use the NMES sequence randomized in the first session; after the fatigue protocol, two maximum evoked contractions will be performed again; then two maximal isometric contractions and at the end, the muscle fatigue evaluation will be performed again.

-----------------
Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) in monochorionic twins is a common complication of twin pregnancies. The incidence of sFGR is estimated to be 10-15% of all twin pregnancies. The current diagnostic classification system based on three different umbilical artery flow patterns has no increasing scale of severity and the observed flow patterns may be volatile in nature. This hinders optimal diagnostic management and complicates outcome prediction as the survival outcome differs per umbilical artery flow type. Consequently, parents encounter a great deal of uncertainty during the pregnancy. Since there is no treatment available for sFGR, predicting fetal deterioration is key in preventing single or double demise. By testing several predictors, the investigators are aiming to improve outcome prediction at the time of sFGR diagnosis. The investigators furthermore hypothesize that additional ultrasound parameters could be of benefit in making the current classification system more accurate and less variable. Extensive histological placental examinations will shine a light on microscopic abnormalities which can increase our knowledge of the pathophysiology. Examining neurodevelopment of sFGR twins at two years of age will additionally be of great value for our understanding of the impact of sFGR and contribute to adequate patient counselling. Our study will evaluate the impact of a sFGR pregnancy on parental mental health and parent-to-infant(s) attachment, which has not been carried out this extensively before.

-----------------
The term contextual effect has been used to reinforce the view that the placebo effect should be understood as an effect related to the therapeutic context, and not restricted to the use of inert treatments. Thus, the placebo effect is inherent to any therapeutic context and also can be used to enhance the effects of treatment with active components. There is evidence of the effectiveness of manipulative therapy in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP), however, for most physical therapy interventions, its effect is small. Thus, strategies to enhance the effects of this therapy, such as through the use of context factors, may contribute to better therapeutic outcomes. The literature describes that positively induced expectations can trigger a placebo effect. There are previous studies that investigated the effect of different speech on SMT in patients with chronic neck pain, but there is no study in CLBP. In addition, no previous study investigated further the perceptions of patients regarding the content and perceptions of the videos. The objective of this study will be to identify the short-term impact of positive, neutral, or negative speech on pain intensity (primary outcome). The secondary outcomes assessed will be the global perceived effect of improvement, patient's expectations regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) intervention, and perception of empathy in the therapeutic encounter in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) Methods
-----------------
It will be a randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor. It will be investigated the effect of the use of a hidden conditioning procedure and the induction of positive expectations on pain intensity after the administration of a manipulative therapy approach. This is an exploratory randomized clinical trial. The three groups will receive one session of SMT after watching the video proposed for their group. First participants will be assessed for pain intensity, low back pain disability, psychosocial aspects, and expectations related to treatment. Secondly, a researcher not involved in the recruitment of patients will randomly allocate the participants into three different groups (G1- group submitted to positive expectation speech, G2- group submitted to neutral expectation speech, and G3- group submitted to negative expectation speech). After the allocation, the participants will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering positive, negative, or neutral messages regarding SMT. And finally, a physiotherapist will administer one session of SMT and participants will be re-assessed to investigate the immediate effect of the videos on the pain intensity, global perceived effect of improvement, and expectations. Ultimately, patients will be submitted to a semi-structured interview in which their perceptions about the videos will be investigated. It will help to understand if the content of the videos actually causes an impact on the expectations of the patients. The main hypothesis of this study is that the group submitted to the positive expectation speech will have a higher hypoalgesic effect, greater perception of improvement, and higher expectations regarding SMT than the other groups immediately post-treatment. Outcomes will be assessed just immediately after one SMT session.

393,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on resting state functional connectivity in healthy individuals. The investigators will use a neuroimaging technique called resting state functional connectivity, which is a statistical dependence between time series of electro-physiological activity and (de)oxygenated blood levels in distinct regions of the brain. Functional connectivity strength calculation determines whether the activity between a pair of brain regions covaries or correlates over time. We will investigate the strength of the functional connectivity between the stimulation target (Nucleus Accumbens) and connected areas, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and sensory areas of the brain at baseline, and then will determine whether tFUS increases or decreases the resting-state connectivity between these regions after the NAC has been stimulated."

402,"Background
-----------------
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract, including ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). The incidence of IBD is increasing worldwide, and the prevalence of IBD in China is increasing year by year. The main clinical manifestations of IBD are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloody stool. The diagnosis of IBD is based on recognized standards, including clinical symptoms, endoscopy, radiology, pathology and surgical history. The main treatment methods for IBD are drug therapy, surgery and other treatments. The main drugs used in the treatment of IBD are 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, biological agents, etc. The purpose of drug therapy is to control the activity of the disease, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the quality of life of patients. However, the long-term use of drugs may lead to drug resistance, drug toxicity, and other adverse reactions. Therefore, it is necessary to find new and effective treatment methods for IBD.

Bowel preparation is an important part of colonoscopy. It is used to clean the intestines and improve the quality of colonoscopy. The most commonly used bowel preparation drugs are polyethylene glycol (PEG) and lactulose. PEG is a non-absorbable osmotic laxative that can draw water into the intestines and increase the volume of intestinal contents, which can effectively clean the intestines. Lactulose is a non-absorbable disaccharide that can be fermented by intestinal bacteria to produce short-chain fatty acids, which can stimulate intestinal peristalsis and promote the excretion of intestinal contents. However, the use of PEG and lactulose for bowel preparation in patients with IBD has not been well studied.

Objective
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lactulose for bowel preparation in patients with IBD.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, randomized, controlled study. Patients with IBD who require colonoscopy will be randomly assigned to receive either lactulose or PEG for bowel preparation. The primary outcome is the effective preparation rate, which is defined as a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) score of 6 or higher with a partial score of 2 or higher in each colon segment. The secondary outcomes include the incidence of adverse events, taste score evaluated by patients, effects of bowel preparation drugs on liver function, and effects of bowel preparation drugs on serum electrolyte.

Study Population
-----------------
Patients with IBD who require colonoscopy will be recruited for this study. The inclusion criteria are as follows: age 18-75 years, confirmed diagnosis of IBD, and scheduled for colonoscopy. The exclusion criteria are as follows: pregnant or lactating women, known or suspected gastrointestinal obstruction, bowel perforation, toxic colitis or megacolon, recent or active gastrointestinal bleeding, severe renal failure, severe dehydration or electrolyte disturbances, known or suspected allergy to PEG or lactulose, diabetes, lactose or galactose intolerance, and refusal to participate in this study.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either lactulose or PEG for bowel preparation. The dose of lactulose is 30 mL/kg body weight, and the dose of PEG is 2 L. Patients will be instructed to take the bowel preparation drug the night before the colonoscopy and to drink plenty of water. The taste score evaluated by patients will be recorded. The effects of bowel preparation drugs on liver function and serum electrolyte will be evaluated.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome is the effective preparation rate, which is defined as a BBPS score of 6 or higher with a partial score of 2 or higher in each colon segment.

-----------------
The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of two methods of soft tissue augmentation around dental implants: using a free connective tissue graft from the tuberosity area of the upper jaw and using a xenogeneic collagen matrix Fibro-Gide.

Methods
-----------------
The study was conducted in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery of the E.N. Meshalkin National Medical Research Center of Dentistry and Maxillofacial Surgery of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation. The study included 20 patients with a sufficient volume of bone tissue in the distal part of the lower jaw and a soft tissue thickness of less than 3 mm on the vestibular side. The patients were divided into two groups: the first group underwent implant placement in combination with an increase in the thickness of soft tissues using a free connective tissue graft from the maxilla tuberosity area, the second group underwent implant placement in combination with an increase in the thickness of soft tissues using a xenogeneic collagen matrix Fibro-Gide. The patients were examined on the 90th and 180th days after the operation. The amount of soft tissue thickness gain was evaluated using the GOM Inspect program. The severity of pain syndrome was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). The severity of edema was assessed by its volume. The quality of life was assessed using the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) questionnaire. The width of the keratinised attached mucosa was measured using the UNC-15 periodontal probe.

-----------------
Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness with a high mortality rate. The pathogenesis of AN is complex and not fully understood. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is closely related to the core symptoms of AN, and proposed the hypothesis of AN-ACC pathological network, suggesting that ACC overactivation and abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions (anterior frontal lobe, parietal lobe, precuneus, and striatum) is the neuropathological mechanism for the onset of AN. Currently, rare studies have been conducted on dTMS targeting ACC as an intervention in patients with AN. In this research, dTMS, a neuroregulatory technology, was used for the first time to intervene with ACC in the treatment of adult AN. A randomized controlled study design was adopted, in which patients with AN were divided into the dTMS treatment group and the pseudo-stimulation group by 1:1 randomization, followed by 6-week intervention and half-year follow up, to clarify the near-term and long-term efficacy and safety of the dTMS treatment. Psychometric and fMRI examinations are performed at baseline in both groups. The rest of the time follow-up of symptoms and psychometrics and side-effects questionnaires are performed at week 2, 4, and 6 (during treatment) as well as at week 4, 12, and 24 ( after completion of treatment). Meanwhile, baseline fMRI data were extracted and combined with clinical features to establish an efficacy prediction model. We will explore factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group, divided into two groups according to whether dTMS was effective or not at the end of treatment (week 6) (effective is defined as BMI increasing by ≥1.2 kg/m2 at the end of treatment), using pre-treatment (baseline) demographic information, psychological assessment questionnaires, and neuroimaging data in the two groups. This will provide theoretical and practical basis for the pioneering ACC-targeted dTMS treatment in China, helping to establish a new type of intervention program for AN, with expected results of innovation.

Objective
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of dTMS targeting ACC in the treatment of adult AN, and to explore the factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group.

418,"Background
-----------------
Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly health problem. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide, with an estimated 540 million people affected. In the United States, LBP is the most common cause of job-related disability and accounts for more than $50 billion in annual healthcare costs. Despite the prevalence and impact of LBP, there is no universally accepted treatment for the condition. Current treatments for LBP include medication, physical therapy, and surgery. However, these treatments are often ineffective or have significant side effects. As a result, there is a need for new and effective treatments for LBP.

Tai Chi and Qigong are two traditional Chinese exercises that have been shown to be effective in treating a variety of health conditions, including LBP. Tai Chi is a slow, gentle form of exercise that involves a series of movements that are performed in a slow, controlled manner. Qigong is a form of exercise that involves a series of postures and movements that are designed to promote relaxation and improve energy flow. Both Tai Chi and Qigong have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with LBP.

Aims
-----------------
The primary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Tai Chi and Qigong in reducing pain and improving function in people with LBP. The secondary aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Tai Chi and Qigong in reducing the use of pain medication and improving sleep quality in people with LBP.

Methods
-----------------
This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the Tai Chi and Qigong group or the control group. The Tai Chi and Qigong group will receive 12 weeks of Tai Chi and Qigong instruction, while the control group will receive no intervention. Both groups will be assessed at baseline and at 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be pain intensity, as measured by a visual analogue scale. The secondary outcome measures will be function, as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index, and sleep quality, as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index.

Discussion
-----------------
This study will provide important information about the effectiveness of Tai Chi and Qigong in treating LBP. If these exercises are found to be effective, they could be used as a first-line treatment for LBP. This would be a significant advance in the treatment of LBP, as current treatments are often ineffective or have significant side effects.

420,"This is a UK-based observational study that aims to discover novel predictive biomarkers with the potential to guide treatment decision making and prolong PFS and OS in patients with advanced TNBC. Patients will undergo a mandatory, study-specific core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour or metastasis before commencing their next line of therapy. The research sample will be run on Pear Bio's test whilst the patient receives therapy as per their physician's choice. This study will not use Pear Bio's tool to inform the choice of treatment, with the treating oncologist being blinded to the test results. Treatment response data will be collected at multiple timepoints to conduct analyses on the study's secondary and tertiary objectives. Fresh tissue resections that arrive at Pear Bio's lab will undergo processing, cell culture and various drug dosing and omics assays (depending on extracted cell numbers). Tumour samples will be processed using a cell isolation kit to retrieve a viable single-cell suspension. A minimum of 100,000 cells (10,000 viable cells per chip) will be used for staining with live and dead cell-tracking dyes. In parallel, blood vials will be processed for PBMCs and further effector cell extraction (flow cytometry, Dynabeads, etc). The remaining cells will be used for sequencing (DNA/RNA), fixed for immunofluorescence characterisation of biomarkers/receptor status or used for further omics assays (if cell numbers allow). This may include tumour mutational burden and microsatellite instability testing. The stained cells will be cultured in a biomimetic hydrogel within Pear Bio's organ-on-a-chip to provide a physiological 3D environment for drug dosing experiments. Using a microfluidic device, samples in each chip will be exposed to approved therapies (either as monotherapy or combination therapies, as outlined below) over multiple days. In parallel, PBMCs will be extracted from whole blood, characterised and sorted via flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic beads selection. Cells of interest (e.g. CD8+ T cells) will be used for culture in Pear Bio's chips jointly with cells isolated from the matched tumour sample. To test immunotherapies, tumour cells will be co-cultured with immune cells in a modified organ-on-a-chip architecture. Chips receiving immunotherapies may be tested for tumour mutational burden and/or microsatellite instability. Confocal microscopy will be conducted daily to collect 3D image data of the cells and track their position and behaviour over time. At the end of the assay, the 3D cell cultures will be fixed for further 3D immunofluorescence analyses or used for embedding, sectioning and assessment of spatial transcriptomics. For targeted therapies, RNAseq, IF and other omics data will be integrated to confirm drug MoA and identify other potential therapeutic targets. Concurrently, 3D image data is processed through a computer vision pipeline to measure functional metrics of the ex vivo 3D cell cultures, including cell viability, cell culture width and cell migration, both at a bulk tumour level and at a single-cell resolution. For immunotherapies, additional metrics such as immune cell infiltration and immune cell killing will be recorded. A patient report is then generated to outline an individual patient sample's response to each therapy tested."
421,"Background: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract. The most common types of IBD are Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. IBD is a disease that can be treated with medication, but sometimes surgery is needed. In Sweden, there is a waiting list for surgery, and the waiting time can be long. The purpose of this study is to investigate how health economy including quality of life is affected when surgery is delayed.

426,"1. Background and aims. Population-based newborn screening (NBS) is an important public health program that has vastly improved the course of several diseases through early detection. The selection of screened disorders generally follows the 10 principles outlined by Wilson and Jungner. In Germany, NBS has been a voluntary National Health Service program since 1969 which currently covers 17 disorders. Current NBS methods, which employ tandem mass-spectrometric analysis of newborn dried blood spots, cannot detect many potentially treatable genetic conditions. At the same time, molecular-based NBS is increasingly feasible because DNA can be extracted from a dried blood spot, next generation sequencing has become economical, and molecular diagnostics have greater reliability and increased validity as genetic databases become more refined and comprehensive. Nephropathic cystinosis and hyperoxaluria (PH) are eligible for molecular-based NBS because effective therapies are available. In a first pilot project, the scientific basis for NBS for cystinosis could already be established. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the transferability of genetic NBS for Cystinosis to other laboratories and to lay the scientific basis for screening for PH. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis. Cystinosis Nephropathic cystinosis, due to impaired transport of cystine out of lysosomes, occurs with an incidence of 1 in 100-200,000 live births. It is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome in the first year of life and glomerular dysfunction progression to end-stage kidney disease by approximately 10 years of age. Treatment with oral cysteamine therapy helps preserve glomerular function, but affected individuals eventually require kidney replacement therapy Cysteamine treatment generally begins at the time of diagnosis in the second year of life, but some glomerular and tubular damage has already occurred by then. This situation could be ameliorated by diagnosing patients shortly after birth, employing molecular genetics-based newborn screening. Standard mass spectrometry-based methods for newborn screening cannot detect the increased cystine content of cystinosis leukocytes. For cystinosis screening, the first tier involved multiplex PCR to detect two of the three most common CTNS mutations in Germany. Heterozygous samples will be submitted to amplicon-based next-generation sequencing for 175 pathogenic CTNS mutations (Labor Limbach, Mainz). A detection rate of 96.5% is predicted using this approach. Primary Hyperoxaluria Three different defaults in the glyoxylate metabolism lead to PH. The severe type PH1 is the most common variant (1-3 out of 106 patients). Population-based studies estimate a prevalence of 1:58,000. The estimated number of unreported cases is high. The deposit of calcium oxalate crystals in the kidneys triggers a chronic inflammation which results in terminal renal failure. Decreased oxalate excretion in the plasma and subsequently deposits of calcium oxalate in the organs and tissue (systemic oxalosis). The clinical course is highly variable. Examples of infantile oxalosis with early renal function loss up to a-/oligosymptomatic patients in adulthood are described. Clinically, PH2 is calmer, but about 50% of patients develop end-stage renal failure. PH3 used to be considered a mild variant, but it is known today that PH3 patients can also develop kidney stones in childhood and develop terminal renal failure with a systemic oxalosis. The PH registry of OxalEurope (European hyperoxaluria consortium) currently lists 1137 genetically diagnosed patients, comprising 81.9% with PH1, 7.9% with PH2 and 8.4% with PH3. So far, primary hyperoxaluria has been diagnosed according to clinical findings through urine analysis (or plasma test in case of terminal renal failure). Therefore, the diagnosis is usually made once patients have already developed terminal renal failure. But existing medications (Vitamin B6) or the new RNAi medications (Lumasiran, Nedosiran) can prevent renal failure and are making the disease treatable. The purpose of this pilot project is to identify the most common mutations in"

428,"The 3 FDA-approved CDK4, 6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, all provided progression-free survival benefits when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. But, not all of them provided overall survival benefit in the same setting. One of the proposed mechanisms that influence the overall survival difference is from the different influence of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors on tumor microenvironment and / or immune system. However, there was no head-to-head comparison of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors in the same study. Neoadjuvant therapy provides a window to obtain tissue samples before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment. We aim to compare the immune modulation effects of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib with letrozole in neoadjuvant treatment for ER+/HER2- early breast cancer. We will collect tumor tissue, blood, and stool samples prospectively before treatment, at 2 weeks after treatment, and after 12 weeks of treatment at the time of surgery. Immune modulation effects will be compared between 3 treatment groups from breast tumor RNAseq analysis."

432,"Background
-----------------
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. The majority of breast cancers are hormone receptor positive (ER+) and HER2-negative. In these patients, the standard of care is endocrine therapy. In patients with HER2-positive breast cancer, the standard of care is a combination of trastuzumab and chemotherapy.

In the last decade, the introduction of targeted therapies has led to a significant improvement in the treatment of breast cancer. However, the majority of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer still relapse after initial treatment.

Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a novel antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that is currently being investigated in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. T-DXd is composed of a humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) conjugated to a topoisomerase I inhibitor (deruxtecan). T-DXd has shown promising results in the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.

In this study, the investigators will investigate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer. The investigators will also investigate the efficacy and safety of T-DXd in the neoadjuvant treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer in patients with a molecular subtype of HER2-enriched.

Study design
-----------------
This is a randomized, open-label, phase III study. Patients will be randomized to receive either T-DXd or standard neoadjuvant therapy (docetaxel, carboplatin, trastuzumab, pertuzumab). Patients will be stratified by molecular subtype (HER2-enriched versus non-HER2-enriched).

434,"1. Background and rationale: Physical activity (PA) is a key factor for health and well-being. However, the majority of the population does not meet the recommended PA levels. In addition, the nursing profession is characterized by a high prevalence of musculoskeletal complaints and a high risk of work disability. The promotion of physical activity-related health competence (PAHCO) is a promising approach to increase PA levels and to reduce the risk of musculoskeletal complaints and work disability. However, the implementation of PAHCO in nursing education is still in its infancy. 2. Objectives: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of different approaches to the implementation of PAHCO in nursing education. 3. Study design: Cluster-randomized controlled trial (cRCT) with 16 schools. 4. Study population: Nursing students in Bavaria. 5. Interventions: The study will compare three different approaches to the implementation of PAHCO: (1) cooperative planning, (2) expert-based intervention delivered by external physical activity specialists, and (3) expert-based intervention delivered by teachers. 6. Main study parameters: Physical activity-related health competence, psychological movement quality, quality physical activity, general health status, work ability, and musculoskeletal complaints. 7. Study duration: 2 years. 8. Expected results: The study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of different approaches to the implementation of PAHCO in nursing education. The results will inform the development of evidence-based interventions to promote PAHCO in nursing education. 9. Potential impact: The study will contribute to the development of evidence-based interventions to promote PAHCO in nursing education. This will have a positive impact on the health and well-being of nursing students and on the quality of nursing care.

436,"1. Background and Rationale: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the European Union (EU) (267,000 deaths/year) and the fourth most common cancer (321,000 new cases/year). To date, radical surgery remains the best curative option in patients with early-stage lung cancer. Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to frequent diagnoses of indeterminate pulmonary nodules, many requiring surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention. Nevertheless, the increase in the utilization of minimally invasive procedures (e.g., video-assisted thoracic surgery -VATS- and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery -RATS- ) remains mandatory in order to reduce the significant morbidity of classic surgery, the surgical trauma, to preserve organs function and to improve patient's quality of life. Nevertheless, minimally invasive surgery does not consent to manual lung palpation, making localizing the not superficial lung nodule problematic. Several approaches have been developed to enhance the localization of indeterminate lung nodules and decrease the time to diagnosis and rate of conversion to open surgery. Nevertheless, none of these is 100% sensitive or without complications, also of severe grade. Numerous pre-operative methods are being employed, including percutaneous CT-guided placement techniques, encompassing the use of microcoils, hook-wires, and spiral-wires. These devices can support nodule localization during minimally invasive lung procedures; nevertheless, they could be easily displaced during patient transport and positioning, intraoperative atelectasis, single lung ventilation, and surgeon manipulation. Moreover, some locations of the lung as the apex, near the diaphragm, and the proximity of mediastinum and great vessels. Furthermore, all these pre-operative localization techniques require two different procedures, one for the CT-guided referral placement and one for surgical treatment. Finally, the rate of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and subcutaneous emphysema are not insignificant, and these complications are mandatory to avoid in several sub-groups of patients. Of note, methylene blue has limited application in patients with anthracotic pigmentation. Moreover, also these procedures remain complicated by the risk of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, dye air embolism, and cerebrovascular accident, and cases of lethal anaphylaxis to the dye of choice. On the other hand, clinical pre-operative staging and surgical planning are based on pre-operative images taken before surgery, either by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These pre-operative imaging assessments frequently underestimate lymph node involvement and secondary localizations. This results in an upstaging after surgical resection ranging from 9 to 24 % in clinical Stage I lung cancer. [10, 11] Nevertheless, the current system of intraoperative imaging, based on direct injection of a tracker in the principal tumoral mass, demonstrated a substantial limitation in lung cancer. This is principally due to the deeper location of the lymph node, usually profoundly engaged in normal fat tissue, and to the irregular lymph node drain system in the respiratory region. In this context, intraoperative fluorescence imaging can enhance the real-time identification of cancer cells during minimally invasive surgical procedures. This could overcome the difficulty of finding cancer nodules located deep in the lung parenchyma, not visible on the surface of normal, uninvolved tissue. The Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700-1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, which provides high contrast between the target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a more comprehensive dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence because of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. However, the conventional near-infrared (NIR) indocyanine green (ICG) method demonstrated a significant limitation in deep cancer recognition, principally due to its intrinsic low-depth tissue penetration. Similarly, the lymph-node sentinel approach conducted by the ICG method proved to be inefficient, mainly due to the non-specificity of the tracker and the irregular pathway of pulmonary lymph node drainage.

437,"Background
-----------------
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The majority of patients with pancreatic cancer undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD), also known as the Whipple procedure. The perioperative mortality rate after PD is 1-2%. The most common postoperative complications after PD are surgical site infections (SSIs), which occur in 10-20% of patients. The most common SSIs after PD are organ/space infections (OSIs), which occur in 5-10% of patients. OSIs are associated with a prolonged hospital stay, increased morbidity and mortality, and increased healthcare costs. The additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment after PD is undetermined as previous research reported conflicting results regarding infectious complications.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment on clinically relevant organ/space surgical site infections (OSIs) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile.

Study design
-----------------
This multicenter, randomized controlled, superiority trial compares perioperative versus pre-emptive antibiotic treatment during five postoperative days after PD in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile.

Study population
-----------------
Adult patients undergoing PD with a high risk for contaminated bile (patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy).

Intervention
-----------------
Participants will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation before surgery into the intervention or control group: Patients in the intervention group will receive perioperative prophylaxis (similar to the control group) followed by five days of 1500mg IV cefuroxime and 500mg IV metronidazole thrice daily. Patients in the control group will only receive perioperative prophylaxis (a single dose of 5-7mg/kg gentamicin followed by 2gr IV cefazolin and 500mg IV metronidazole every 4 hours of surgery), which will be discontinued after surgery.

Main study endpoints
-----------------
The primary endpoint are organ/space infections (OSIs) within 90 days after surgery requiring a therapeutic intervention.

Secondary endpoints
-----------------
The secondary endpoints are OSIs, isolated OSIs, wound infections, postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile or enteric anastomotic leakage, post pancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥III), reintervention, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, readmission, and in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Besides, switch of postoperative antibiotics, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and concordance between perioperative bile and postoperative surgical site cultures are analyzed.

444,"1.Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common malignancy with a high recurrence rate after liver transplantation. The current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation is limited to surveillance and treatment of recurrence. However, the recurrence rate after liver transplantation is still high, and the prognosis is poor. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop effective adjuvant therapies to reduce the recurrence rate and improve the prognosis of patients with HCC after liver transplantation. 2.Rationale: Multi-kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are a class of targeted drugs that inhibit the activity of multiple kinases involved in tumor growth and angiogenesis. Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is a key mediator of tumor angiogenesis. The combination of TKIs and bevacizumab has shown promising results in the treatment of advanced HCC. However, there is limited evidence on the use of this combination as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation. 3.Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation in patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this combination therapy, as well as to assess the impact of this therapy on quality of life and graft survival. 4.Study Design: This is a multicenter, randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial. Patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation will be randomly assigned to receive either multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab or no adjuvant therapy. The primary endpoint is one-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate). The secondary endpoints include recurrence-free survival (RFS) duration, overall survival (OS), two-year and three-year RFS rates, graft survival, quality of life evaluation, and incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. 5.Study Population: The study population will include patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after liver transplantation. The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria will be determined based on the current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation. 6.Intervention: Patients in the intervention group will receive multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation. The specific multi-kinase inhibitor and bevacizumab regimen will be determined based on the current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation. 7.Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is one-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate). The secondary outcome measures include recurrence-free survival (RFS) duration, overall survival (OS), two-year and three-year RFS rates, graft survival, quality of life evaluation, and incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events. 8.Statistical Analysis: The sample size will be determined based on the primary endpoint of one-year recurrence-free survival rate (1-year RFS rate). The statistical analysis plan will be developed based on the current standard of care for HCC after liver transplantation. 9.Ethics and Dissemination: The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and scientific conferences. 10.Conclusion: This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy after liver transplantation in patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence. The results of this study will provide valuable information for the development of effective adjuvant therapies for patients with HCC after liver transplantation."
445,"1. Background: Limb loss is a life-altering event that can have a significant impact on one's mental health. Inpatient rehabilitation is a critical time for patients to receive support and treatment for their mental health needs. However, there is a lack of evidence-based interventions to address mental health concerns in this population. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic trial using a supportive-expressive (SEGT) group therapy intervention for addressing anxiety and depression for inpatients with limb loss. The secondary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of implementing the SEGT intervention in an inpatient rehabilitation setting. 3. Study Design: This is a two-arm pragmatic trial that will evaluate the effectiveness of the SEGT intervention compared to treatment as usual (TAU). The study will be conducted at St. John's Rehab, a specialized inpatient rehabilitation hospital in Toronto, Canada. 4. Study Population: The study population will include inpatients with limb loss who are admitted to St. John's Rehab. 5. Intervention: The SEGT intervention will be delivered by a team of allied healthcare professionals, including a psychiatrist, social worker, and occupational therapist. The intervention will consist of six 1-hour sessions that will be delivered over a 3-week period. The sessions will focus on guided discussions on coping with limb loss, managing sequelae associated with limb loss (e.g., pain), goal setting and strategies for community living. 6. Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measures will be the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) questionnaires, which will be administered at baseline, discharge, and 3 months post-discharge. Secondary outcome measures will include the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale (GSE) and the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist- 5 (PCL-5). 7. Data Analysis: The primary analysis will be a comparison of the mean change in PHQ-9 and GAD-7 scores between the SEGT and TAU groups using a mixed-effects model. Secondary analyses will include comparisons of the mean change in GSE and PCL-5 scores between the two groups. 8. Conclusion: This study will provide important evidence on the effectiveness of the SEGT intervention for addressing mental health concerns in inpatients with limb loss. If successful, the intervention could be implemented in other inpatient rehabilitation settings to improve mental health outcomes for this population."

453,"The investigators will perform basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH) designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. These experiments will follow standard procedures for collecting behavioral data, and involve simple perceptual tasks (e.g., signal detection, object recognition) and behavioral tasks (e.g., walking towards a goal location). The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when using an external computer to directly specify pulse trains (e.g., for Argus II, a 1s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12). These direct pulse trains are then sent to the VPU. This VPU contains software that makes sure that these pulse trains are within FDA-approved safety limits. For example, these pulses must be charge-balanced (equal anodic/cathodic charge) and must have a charge density below 35 microCoulombs/cm2. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. Sometimes the investigators will directly send pulses to the VPU by directly specifying pulse trains (e.g., send a 1 s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microAmps to Electrode 12 of an Argus II implant). Important parameters for safety include a) pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), b) charge density should be limited. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust to extremely high rates of stimulation and high current levels. However, high frequency pulse trains or high amplitude pulse trains can produce discomfort in patients (analogous to going from a dark movie theatre to sunlight) due to inducing large-scale neuronal firing. The investigators will normally be focusing on pulse-train frequencies/amplitudes that are in the normal range used by the patient when using their device. If the investigators use parameters that might be expected to produce a more intense neural response (and therefore have the potential to cause discomfort), they will always introduce them in a step-wise function (e.g. gradually increasing amplitude) while checking that the sensation is not 'uncomfortably bright', and the investigators will immediately decrease the intensity of stimulation if patients report that the sensation approaches discomfort. The PI has experience in this approach and will train all personnel on these protocols. In response to the stimulation/image on the monitor, subjects will be asked to either make a perceptual judgment or perform a simple behavioral task. Examples include detecting a stimulus ('did you see a light on that trial'), reporting size by drawing on a touch screen, or walking to a target location. Both patient response and reaction time will be recorded. None of these stimuli will elicit emotional responses or be aversive in any way. In some cases, the investigators will also collect data measuring subjects' eye position. This is a noninvasive procedure that will be carried out using standard eye-tracking equipment via an infra-red camera that tracks the position of the subjects' pupil. Only measurements like eye position or eye blinks will be recorded, so these data do not contain identifiable information. Subject"

Schechter Investigator: Mrs. Sandra Rusconi Serpa, MSc, FSP Study Title Feasibility of a brief manualized psychotherapy for traumatized mothers and their young children: Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) Short Title / Study ID CAVEAT Feasibility Study Protocol Version and Date Version 1.0, DATE Study registration Registered on international register (clinicaltrial.gov) provisionally Study category and Rationale This feasibility study conforms to a clinical trial of category A Background and Rationale The present study aims to determine if the manualized brief psychotherapy Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure-Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) can be administered to violence-exposed mothers and their young children (ages 1-5 years) in the ambulatory care center of a Swiss public hospital (SUPEA, CHUV) during a psychotherapy of 16 sessions. CAVEAT is based on an amalgam of four existing evidence-based psychotherapy models (Child-Parent psychotherapy, Parental Mentalization, Interaction Guidance, Prolonged Exposure) for parents, infants and young children and traumatized adults that led to the novel, core therapeutic technique developed by Prof. Schechter and colleagues Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Session(s) or CAVES which has been shown to be successful in positively altering mothers' perception of their young children in two open trials. From the existing literature, the investigataors know that parent-child relationship-based psychotherapies improve significantly maternal sensitivity to their child's communication, which is in part based on maternal capacity to perceive more accurately the young child's emotional communication and to take the child's perspective. Moreover, dyadic psychotherapy models using video-feedback and support of parental mentalization have been shown across models more generally to improve the quality of mother-child interaction. Risk / Benefit Assessment The risks of participating in this study are estimated as minimal (category A). The proposed intervention involves standard, validated psychotherapeutic procedures with the addition of clinician-assisted videofeedback exposure to naturalistic challenges that are typically stressful for young children and that are in situation by the clinician in collaboration with the child's mother during the filmed parent-child interaction sessions. This latter technique has been used without complication in both mental health referred and non-referred pediatrics samples with positive clinical effects in both studies. The investigators estimate that the risks of such an intervention are therefore limited. Though, if a matter arises that is severe, urgent or cannot be dealt with in the psychotherapy as conceived in the model, based on the therapist assessment, proper interventions and/or referrals will be made. Regarding the potential benefits An increase in maternal ability to take her very young child's perspective To respond more sensitively to the child's developmental needs and emotional communication, To be aware of what triggers post-traumatic stress during parent-child interactions, Reduction in re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions, and hyperarousal in day-to-day life with one's child Acquisition of increased tools for self and mutual regulation and stress-reduction during are benefits of participating in the study. If this form of manualized psychotherapy proves feasible to administer in a public hospital outpatient mental health clinic for children, it could potentially be implemented for this group of patients in a study that tests its efficacy in terms of improvement in parental stress, maternal sensitivity, and reduction of parent-child relational disturbance, potentially benefitting the larger group of these difficult-to-treat child-parent dyads. Objective(s) The aim of the submitted study is to determine whether the manualized, brief child-parent psychotherapy CAVEAT can be feasibly performed in a child and adolescent psychiatric ambulatory care center at the CHUV, a public university-hospital, this with child and mothers who have experienced IPV and who present to the clinic with concerns about their child's risk for emotional and/or behavior difficulties and/or who note relational disturbances with their very young children ages 1-5 years and/or problems with their parenting.

459,"1. Background and rationale: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a major public health problem worldwide. The prevalence of T2D in Singapore is 11.3% (2018) and is projected to increase to 15.9% by 2030. T2D is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, and chronic kidney disease (CKD). The risk of T2D is increased in women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). GDM is defined as diabetes diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy and has traditionally been considered a benign condition because typically glucose levels return to normal after delivery. However, women with pregnancies complicated by GDM often progress to develop T2D later in life. The risk of T2D is increased in women with a history of GDM by 3- to 10-fold.

-----------------
Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, thus being the focus of extensive research. The primary treatment goals of this disease consist in controlling local disease, reducing the risk of distant metastases, and avoiding enucleation whenever possible. Plaque brachytherapy is currently the standard treatment for small and medium-sized uveal melanomas. In clinical practice, ruthenium (Ru-106) or iodine (I-125) are the most commonly employed radioisotopes. Ruthenium is the most utilized radioisotope in Europe and South America due to its availability and good clinical outcomes. It is currently the only available option in Brazil's public health system (SUS). However, its use for large tumors (greater than 10 mm in thickness and/or 22 mm in diameter) is limited by the inability of delivering an adequate therapeutic dose of radiation without causing further damage to the surrounding retinal tissue. For this reason, researchers in medical physics have been investigating new treatment options in the last decades, including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radiosurgery (gamma knife or linear accelerator), and proton beam therapy. Although gamma knife radiosurgery and proton beam therapy are effective treatments with reliable tumor control rates, they are associated with poor visual outcomes, inadequate globe retention, and their use is reportedly limited in public health systems of low- or middle-income countries. EBRT carries potential side effects related to a broader radiation field, with an increased risk for complications in ocular and periocular structures, such as eyelids, sclera, lens, and retina. Finally, enucleation is an effective management for very large tumors, but it is usually a last resource. Considering the above-mentioned treatment limitations for large choroidal melanomas, our group explored an alternative approach using intra-arterial melphalan for tumor chemoreduction, aiming to reduce thickness and allow subsequent brachytherapy using a Ru-106 plaque. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan has been used to treat multiple cancers, including liver metastases from uveal and skin melanomas, but it has never been described as a primary tumor treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated a reasonable safety profile of the therapy when used for the treatment of other tumors. This is a phase I clinical trial that assesses the safety profile of chemoreduction with intra-arterial melphalan, followed by ruthenium brachytherapy, performed in patients that would otherwise need enucleation due to tumor size.

-----------------
Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is a heterogeneous disease that represents an incurable condition wherein pharmacological interventions are directed towards deferring disease progression and alleviating symptoms, thereby extending survival rates and preserving the quality of life (QoL) and psychological well-being. Clinical advancements in anticancer treatments have notably augmented survival rates among MBC patients. However, accruing evidence reported that adherence to medications is a critical issue in the disease trajectory of breast cancer patients, particularly in the context of oral anticancer treatments (OATs). Emerging evidence indicates that patients with advanced cancer, such as those with MBC, often exhibit significant levels of nonadherence. MBC patients encounter various barriers to the daily management of OATs, including emotional and physical distress associated with side effects, dosage variations, treatment interruptions, and a lack of disease-related knowledge. Prediction models for adherence have been previously developed and tested across diverse scenarios and diseases. Evidence suggested that leveraging of the machine learning models in clinical practice enables the provision of personalized predictions on medication adherence for individual patients, thereby supporting adherence and facilitating targeted interventions. Even so, existing studies have yet to systematically address medication adherence among MBC patients by designing and implementing a decision support system (DSS) that integrates risk predictive models alongside educational and training tools. The current protocol aims to assess the efficacy of the DSS, a web-based solution named TREAT (TREatment Adherence SupporT), and a machine learning web application in promoting adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a sample of MBC patients. This protocol is part of a project titled Enhancing Therapy Adherence Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients (Tracking Number 65080791). The overarching goal of this project is to develop a predictive model of nonadherence, an associated DSS, and guidelines to enhance patient engagement and therapy adherence among MBC patients. The web-based DSS was developed in the first year of the Pfizer Project (65080791) using a patient-centric approach and comprises four sections: i) Metastatic Breast Cancer; ii) Adherence to Cancer Therapies; iii) Promoting Adherence; iv) My Adherence Diary. Moreover, a machine learning web-based application was designed to focus on predicting patients' risk factors for adherence to anticancer treatment, specifically considering physical status, comorbid conditions, and short- and long-term side effects. This machine learning web-based application was developed through a retrospective study employing physiological, clinical, and quality of life data available in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy) (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Specifically, multi-modal retrospective data has been retrieved from the Patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) using natural language processing (NLP) in a sample of 2.750 MBC patients (from 2010 to 2020). Methods/Design Main objectives Evaluating the effectiveness of the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application (TREAT - TREatment Adherence SupporT) in fostering adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a cohort of 100 Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients over a three-month period. Adherence is assessed by calculating the number of pills taken divided by the prescribed amount. Secondary Objectives Identify clinical factors (comorbidities, pain presence, tumor type, treatment type), psychological parameters (personality traits, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, sense of coherence, and risk perception), and QoL variables that serve as predictors for patients' adherence to OATs. These predictors are utilized to assess nonadherence to OATs among MBC patients and enhance the initial version of a machine learning model developed in the retrospective study (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Data for the secondary endpoints are collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 23-item Breast Cancer-specific Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-BR23), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

474,"Background
-----------------
Cardiac surgery is a complex procedure that requires the use of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to maintain the patient's circulation and oxygenation during the surgical procedure. During CPB, the patient's blood is circulated through a machine that provides oxygen and removes carbon dioxide. The CPB machine also allows the surgeon to perform the necessary surgical procedures on the heart. However, CPB can also cause damage to the patient's organs, including the heart, brain, and kidneys. This damage can lead to complications such as stroke, kidney failure, and heart attack.

The use of CPB is associated with a number of risks, including the risk of stroke, kidney failure, and heart attack. These risks are increased in patients who have pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and heart disease. In addition, the use of CPB can also lead to the development of blood clots, which can cause serious complications such as pulmonary embolism.

Despite the risks associated with CPB, it is still a necessary procedure in many cases. The benefits of CPB outweigh the risks in most cases, and it is the only way to perform certain types of heart surgery. However, there is still a need for further research to improve the safety and effectiveness of CPB.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of three different strategies for managing mean arterial pressure (MAP) during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The three strategies are:

1. Standard MAP: MAP values between 50-60 mmHg
2. High MAP: MAP values between 70-80 mmHg
3. Patient-tailored MAP: MAP values comparable to the patient's pre-operative MAP

The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the following outcomes between the three groups:

1. Serum lactate peak (Lmax) (mmol/l) detected during CPB
2. The area under the curve (AUC) of the serum lactate values measured during CPB
3. Number of cases with serum lactate peak > 3 mmol/l during CPB
4. Evaluation of intraoperative cerebral perfusion (through monitoring of NIRS)
5. Intraoperative pulmonary perfusion (through Pa/Fi ratio, paO2, paCO2 at ABG and VO2R and DO2 of CDI)
6. Evaluation of intraoperative and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (through the calculation of VISmax)
7. Postoperative and 30-day LVEF (%)
8. Evaluation of pulmonary injury (through the LIS)
9. Postoperative and 30-day Acute Kidney Injury (according to AKIN score)

485,"1.1.1.1 Achondroplasia is a genetic disorder that affects the growth of bones. It is caused by a mutation in the FGFR3 gene, which is responsible for the production of a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3). This protein is involved in the regulation of bone growth. In people with achondroplasia, the FGFR3 gene is mutated, which leads to the production of an abnormal form of the protein. This abnormal protein interferes with the normal growth of bones, resulting in short stature and other skeletal abnormalities. Achondroplasia is the most common form of dwarfism, affecting approximately 1 in 25,000 people. It is a lifelong condition that can cause a range of health problems, including spinal cord compression, sleep apnea, and obesity. There is currently no cure for achondroplasia, but treatment options are available to help manage the symptoms and improve quality of life. These include physical therapy, surgery, and medications to help with pain and other symptoms. Research is ongoing to develop new treatments for achondroplasia, including gene therapy and stem cell therapy. 1.1.1.2 The purpose of this study is to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and efficacy of TransCon CNP in children and adolescents with achondroplasia. TransCon CNP is a novel, long-acting formulation of CNP (C-type natriuretic peptide) that is designed to mimic the natural release of CNP from the heart. CNP is a hormone that is involved in the regulation of bone growth and has been shown to be effective in promoting bone growth in animal models of achondroplasia. In this study, participants will receive weekly subcutaneous injections of TransCon CNP for up to 10 years. The study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of TransCon CNP, as well as its efficacy in promoting bone growth and improving height in participants with achondroplasia. The study will also evaluate the long-term effects of TransCon CNP on other aspects of health, such as quality of life and physical function. The study will enroll approximately 100 participants aged 3-15 years with achondroplasia. Participants will be followed for up to 10 years, with regular assessments of safety, tolerability, and efficacy. The study will also include a genetic analysis of the FGFR3 gene to better understand the underlying causes of achondroplasia and to identify potential biomarkers of response to TransCon CNP. The results of this study will provide important information on the long-term safety and efficacy of TransCon CNP in children and adolescents with achondroplasia, and may lead to the development of new treatments for this condition."

Adult-type GCTs are typically slow growing and are often diagnosed at an early stage. However, adult-type GCTs can be aggressive and can recur after initial treatment. The standard of care for adult-type GCTs is surgery followed by chemotherapy. However, chemotherapy is not always effective and can have significant side effects. Therefore, there is a need for new and effective treatments for adult-type GCTs. 2. Hypothesis: Androgen receptor (AR) inhibition by darolutamide in combination with leuprolide acetate and exemestane is a promising treatment option for adult-type GCTs. 3. Aims: The primary aim of this study is to determine the objective response rate of darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane in recurrent adult-type GCTs of the ovary (AGCT). The secondary aims of this study are to determine duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival of darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane when used in recurrent adult-type GCTs of ovary (AGCT). The exploratory aim of this study is to determine biomarkers predictive of response to darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane. 4. Study design: This is a single-arm, open-label, phase II study. 5. Study population: Patients with recurrent adult-type GCTs of the ovary (AGCT) will be eligible for this study. 6. Interventions: Patients will receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) and darolutamide PO BID starting on days -14 to -7 prior to cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1) and then on days 1-28 of each cycle. Patients will receive leuprolide acetate IM on day 1 of each cycle. Cycles will repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 7. Study outcomes: The primary outcome of this study is objective response rate. The secondary outcomes of this study are duration of response, progression-free survival, and overall survival. The exploratory outcome of this study is biomarkers predictive of response to darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane. 8. Sample size: A total of 30 patients will be enrolled in this study. 9. Statistical analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize patient characteristics and treatment outcomes. Kaplan-Meier methods will be used to estimate median progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Logistic regression will be used to estimate the objective response rate. 10. Potential impact: This study has the potential to improve the treatment of adult-type GCTs of the ovary (AGCT). If darolutamide, leuprolide acetate, and exemestane are found to be effective in treating AGCT, this treatment regimen could become the standard of care for AGCT."

493,"This is an observational cohort study using MRI to measure gastrointestinal (GI) function, lung structure and function and liver endpoints in children with CF aged 6 to 11 years. The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study (NCT04618185) to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint. In total, participants will be asked to remain in the MRI scanner for approximately 30 minutes at a time. For comfort, participants will be able to watch multimedia programmes through the use of a specially adapted television while in the scanner. Participants will also be asked to complete validated gastrointestinal questionnaires throughout the study day and recall their GI symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and complete a 3 day food diary. The study will be split into two phases. The first will be a pilot phase where 3 children with CF aged 6 to 11 years and 3 healthy age and gender matched controls undergo MRI scanning. These scans will be assessed to determine whether the scan protocol can be completed by the participants and assess the quality of the images obtained. If successful, the trial will progress onto the main phase. In the main phase, the 12 additional children with CF will be recruited and undergo the above scanning protocol, prior to starting ETI. We will then ask participants to return for a repeat scans approximately 6 months after starting ETI."
494,"Hypospadias repair surgery is an invasive surgery that results in significant postoperative pain. pain alters the quality of life and satisfaction of the patients and results in manipulation of wounds, infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence leading to unfavorable surgical outcome . As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedtomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting. A vast majority of literature supports the efficacy of particulate steroids like methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions. Aim of the work and hypothesis: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of caudal methylprednisolone in pediatric patients. This randomized, double-blind, controlled bi-center study was designed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in caudal block for children undergoing hypospadias surgical repair using the duration of analgesia as the primary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that methylprednisolone will provide superior postoperative analgesia than dexamethasone when added to bupivacaine for caudal block."

| Experimental: Treatment Group<br>EVLP + HDF | Device: hemodiafiltration (HDF)<br>* Hemodiafiltration (HDF) is a variation of conventional HD. By the addition of a substitution solution, convection forces are significantly increased. This substitution solution is added to the blood and is completely removed again in the dialyzer. This increases the negative pressure on the dialysate side and the removal of toxins through convection. The substitution solution can be added in a pre-dilution (before the dialyzer) or post-dilution (after the dialyzer) manner. Pre-dilution is associated with longer run times, less filter clotting, but is also less effective in removing toxins. Post-dilution offers a better toxin clearance capacity, but is associated with an increased risk of filter clotting. Several studies have shown that HDF provides higher clearance rates for both small and middle molecule solutes. Moreover, effective cytokine removal has been shown in HDF both in acute and chronic renal disease patients.<br>* Other names: device: multiFiltrate Ci-Ca(R) (by Fresenius);Device: Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP)<br>* Lung transplantation has become a standard treatment for patients suffering from end-stage lung diseases. One of the major obstacles in the modern transplant era is the fact that the need for organs by far exceeds availability. This leads to growing waiting lists with mortality rates ranging between 10-30%.

496,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants. Retinopathy is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for retinopathy examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The examination success rate was defined as the ability to complete the retinopathy examination without disturbances caused by infant distress or movement. The study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed retinopathy examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated retinopathy examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensory stimulation during retinopathy examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population."

Basilar artery occlusion (BAO) is a rare but devastating type of stroke. The incidence of BAO is 1.5% to 2.0% of all ischemic strokes. The mortality rate of BAO is 50% to 70%, and the disability rate is 20% to 30%. The current standard treatment for BAO is endovascular recanalization. However, the success rate of endovascular recanalization is only 50% to 60%. The main reason for the low success rate is the difficulty of puncture and sheath insertion. The radial artery is a natural artery with a diameter of 2 to 3 mm, which is smaller than the femoral artery.

513,"The BUNDLE study is a prospective mixed-methods study focused on the early integration of community doula into prenatal care. The investigators will pursue the following aims using a multidisciplinary team of experts in health disparities, community engagement, qualitative research, maternal-fetal medicine, and doula support: Aim 1: Develop an integrated prenatal care model of medical providers and community doulas in Southeastern Wisconsin Approach: The investigators will conduct six focus groups with 30 Black/AA birthing people (currently pregnant or recently postpartum) and 30 prenatal healthcare providers (obstetricians, midwives, doulas, social workers, prenatal care coordinators, nurses, mental health providers, and obstetric unit leaders) to elicit feedback on models of doula/medical provider integration with the overarching aim of building trust and improving maternal health outcomes. Focus group findings will be reviewed with a community advisory panel (CAP) developed as part of the Community Partnership of the MCW U54 center, to gain the CAP's input on intervention development. Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of the integrated prenatal care model to standard prenatal care in improving healthcare engagement and trust and reducing adverse maternal outcomes Approach: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial conducted at Froedtert and MCW, the investigators will randomize 412 Black/AA pregnant people to BUNDLE or standard prenatal care. Primary outcome is healthcare engagement (starting prenatal care in 1st trimester, attending at least 70% of the recommended visits, attending the postpartum visit, and receipt of recommended vaccination during pregnancy). Secondary outcomes include medical mistrust measured by trust in provider scale, perceived discrimination, and frequencies of severe maternal morbidity as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Aim 3: Disseminate findings to scholarly and community-based forums and actively pursue opportunities for systems- and policy-level change Approach: The investigators will disseminate findings regularly in scholarly (conference, grand rounds) and community-based (listening session, town hall) forums. The investigators will leverage the existing partnerships with policymakers, healthcare organizations, and community leaders to implement strategies to sustain successful program outcomes through policy changes at the system and statewide level by advocating for doula coverage and healthcare system sustainability of the integrated prenatal care model.

-----------------
Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder that affects individuals of all ages and is a leading cause of disability worldwide. It is estimated that approximately 80% of the population will experience LBP at some point in their lives, and it is the leading cause of disability in individuals under the age of 45. LBP can be classified as acute, subacute, or chronic, depending on the duration of symptoms. Acute LBP is defined as pain that lasts for less than 6 weeks, subacute LBP is defined as pain that lasts for 6 to 12 weeks, and chronic LBP is defined as pain that lasts for more than 12 weeks. Chronic LBP is a significant public health problem, as it can lead to long-term disability and reduced quality of life.

The etiology of LBP is multifactorial and can be attributed to a variety of factors, including poor posture, muscle imbalances, and spinal misalignments. In addition, psychological factors such as stress and anxiety can also contribute to the development and persistence of LBP.

Massage therapy is a non-invasive, manual therapy that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of LBP. Massage therapy involves the manipulation of soft tissues, including muscles, tendons, and ligaments, to promote relaxation, reduce muscle tension, and improve circulation. There are several different types of massage therapy, including Swedish massage, deep tissue massage, and trigger point massage.

Swedish massage is a gentle form of massage therapy that involves long, flowing strokes to promote relaxation and reduce muscle tension. It is often used to treat individuals with chronic pain conditions, such as LBP.

Deep tissue massage is a more intense form of massage therapy that involves the application of deeper, more targeted pressure to specific areas of the body. It is often used to treat individuals with chronic pain conditions, such as LBP, and can be particularly effective in treating trigger points, which are areas of muscle tension that can cause pain and discomfort.

Trigger point massage is a type of massage therapy that involves the application of pressure to specific trigger points in the body. Trigger points are areas of muscle tension that can cause pain and discomfort, and trigger point massage can be particularly effective in treating these areas.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of connective tissue massage (CTM) and classical massage (CM) in reducing pain, improving functional status, and enhancing quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain (CNSLBP). The secondary objective is to compare the effectiveness of CTM and CM in improving lumbar mobility and reducing disability in patients with CNSLBP.

The study design adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for rigorous reporting.11 After obtaining consent and confirming the inclusion criteria, a convenience sample of 30 participants was equally and randomly divided into three groups: the CTM group (n=10), CM group (n=10), and control group (n=10). Randomization was carried out by an independent physical therapist, who was not involved in the assessment or treatment of the participants, 1 hour before the baseline measurements. The randomization process involved using opaque and sealed envelopes, each containing a group allocation number generated from a computer-generated random number table. Block randomization was employed to ensure an equal distribution of participants across the groups. All treatment sessions were administered by the same investigator (C.D) in the study group. The intervention duration was uniform across all groups: 4 consecutive weeks, with 3 sessions per week lasting 15-20 minutes per session. Outcome measurements were taken at the beginning and 4 weeks after the completion of the program. An independent physiotherapist, unaware of the research details and participant groupings, conducted the evaluations.

Study Population

516,"The purpose of this research study is to: · Determine the differing pressure lowering effects between OMNI canaloplasty alone versus when combined with HYDRUS microstent. Both surgical study devices are widely used by themselves in conjunction with cataract surgery. While many surgeons have begun combining the two procedures, this will be one of the first studies to randomize (assign by chance) one eye to OMNI canaloplasty alone and the other eye to OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS stent and report the results after one year. About 80 subjects aged 18 years and older will participate in this study. WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY? Your participation in this study will last approximately one year and will include approximately seven study visits to the study center and two visits to the surgery center. Screening: Before any study-related tests and procedures are performed, you will be asked to read and sign this consent document. The following screening tests and procedures will then be performed to determine if you qualify to take part in this study: Visual field OCT analysis of the nerve and cornea - your nerve and cornea will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) equipment. This is painless, non-invasive (it does not involve puncturing or cutting) and is similar to having photographs taken of your eye. You will be required to sit still during the brief scanning procedure (a few seconds) Slit lamp exam with gonioscopy - a close inspection of the front of the eye using a machine that magnifies the eye and provides a beam of light to light the structures of the eye Eye pressure test - measurement of the pressure inside the eye. The pressure in your eyes will be measured using an instrument known as a tonometer Visual acuity test - a test involving reading letters off a chart to determine how well you can see This study will use competitive enrollment. This means that when a target number of subjects begins the study, all further enrollment will be closed. Therefore, it is possible that you could be in the screening phase, ready to begin the study, and be discontinued without your consent if the target number of subjects has already begun the study. If you qualify to take part in this study and go on to receive the study treatment, then the following will happen: Washout Period: You will be asked to stop taking your eye drops to treat your glaucoma. This is called a washout period, during which the effects of these medications leave your body. Study Treatment: You will be randomly assigned by chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive either OMNI canaloplasty or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. You will have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving OMNI canaloplasty alone or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. This is a not a blinded study, which means that you, the study doctor, study staff and the sponsor will know the study treatment you are given. You will have the following study visits and undergo the following procedures: · Preoperative and postoperative care will be the same as a standard cataract surgery consisting of one day, one week, one month, six month and one year follow-up exams. The only difference for study subjects is they will be asked to stop all glaucoma drops one month prior to their pre-op exam and one year post-op exam. After Study Treatment: Glaucoma is a permanent and irreversible condition that requires lifelong monitoring with an eye care professional. Sometimes additional treatment is required. Your eye specialist will recommend follow-up care based on your personal findings."

519,"1. Background and rationale {6a} The management of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage is a common problem in gynecology. The recommendations of the Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care. The choice between the two is left to the discretion of the doctor and the patient. There are no clear recommendations as to the choice between hysteroscopy and aspiration. Within the teams, the choice is often made according to the habits and protocols of the service, according to the equipment available and the skills of the gynaecologists. Aim: The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound. The secondary objectives are: the comparison of the rate of complications of the two techniques, during and after surgery the comparison of the rate of recourse to a second line surgical management between the two arms, the comparison of the rate of synechiae diagnosed by hysterosonography between the two techniques at 6 weeks after surgery, the comparison of the time to conception in the two arms during the 2 years after surgery in the two arms the comparison of the fertility rate at 2 years after surgery in the two arms. 2. Objective and hypotheses {7} The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound.

Neck pain is one of the most common and painful musculoskeletal conditions. Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition. The symptoms of nonspecific neck pain are similar to those of whiplash associated disorders (WAD) grade I and II but there is no traumatic event involved. Nonspecific neck pain (NP) is defined as pain in the posterior and lateral aspect of the neck between the superior nuchal line and the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra with no signs or symptoms of major structural pathology and no or minor to major interference with activities of daily life as well as with the absence of neurological signs and specific pathologies. Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as cervical pain without a known pathological basis as the underlying cause of the complaints. Some symptoms are limited cervical spine mobility and neck muscles weakness, which may be often related to other problems, such as, vertebral, neck or shoulder impaired function, and mental and physical stress at work. The natural course of non-specific neck pain remains unclear. While it is often self-limiting within a few weeks of onset, it can severely limit daily functioning, induce substantial medical consumption and result in prolonged sick leave and disability leading chronic nonspecific neck pain if pain duration is more than three months. As a consequence, it places a heavy burden on individuals, employers and health care services. Nonspecific neck pain is defined in the European guidelines for the management of chronic nonspecific neck pain that is not attributable to a recognizable, specific pathology (e.g., infection, tumor, osteoporosis, fracture, structural deformity, and inflammatory diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis, radicular syndrome. Characteristic of chronic nonspecific neck pain are heavy pain, worsening with exertion and relieve with rest. In some cases the cause may be sprain or overstretch of a ligament or muscles. Nonspecific neck belongs to the group of musculoskeletal disorders, which include diverse conditions affecting muscles, bones, and/or joints of the limbs or the spine. As for most other musculoskeletal disorders, nonspecific neck pain is multifactorial. A variety of different types of exercise have been explored to treat chronic neck pain, including low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise, high intensity aerobic exercise, stretching exercise and muscular strength exercises and isometrics. However, the most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain is unknown reflecting its complexity and more research is require. The rationale of the study is to compare the effects of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy on pain, range of motion and functional disability in chronic nonspecific neck pain. The main purpose of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy is to release the cervical trigger points, improving end ranges and lengthening of muscle. MDT helps draw toxins out of the muscles and to the superficial veins to be removed by the body. This leads to decreased pain and tension in the tissues. The ultimate goal is to achieve pain free end ranges and flexibility of muscle in nonspecific neck pain patients.

The human brain is a complex organ that is responsible for a wide range of functions including memory, attention, and executive function. The brain is also responsible for our mood and well-being. The brain is made up of a number of different types of cells, including neurons and glial cells. Neurons are responsible for transmitting information throughout the brain, while glial cells provide support and protection for neurons. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of tissue, including grey matter and white matter. Grey matter is responsible for processing information, while white matter is responsible for transmitting information throughout the brain. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of chemicals, including neurotransmitters and hormones. Neurotransmitters are responsible for transmitting information between neurons, while hormones are responsible for transmitting information between different parts of the body. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of blood vessels, including arteries, veins, and capillaries. Arteries are responsible for carrying blood away from the heart, while veins are responsible for carrying blood back to the heart. Capillaries are responsible for carrying blood throughout the brain. The brain is also made up of a number of different types of fluid, including cerebrospinal fluid and interstitial fluid. Cerebrospinal fluid is responsible for protecting the brain and spinal cord, while interstitial fluid is responsible for providing nutrients and oxygen to the brain.

532,"The investigators will enroll 300 consecutive patients with asymptomatic disease. All patients will undergo a baseline clinical examination, with computed tomography or MRI to assess cerebral lesions, and health records will be collected. Clinical variables will be measured with standard procedures after overnight fasting. Patients with evidence of heart failure, valvular defects, malignant neoplasms, or secondary causes of hypertension will be excluded. Specimens of the portion of carotid bifurcation that showed maximum disease will be obtained from atherectomy and will be cut in two halves and frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in in 10% buffered formalin for subsequent analyses. Plaque specimens will be then used to assess the presence and the amount of volatile organic compounds and microplastics through pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To corroborate these findings, plaque specimens will be also observed with transmission electron microscopy to visually identify microplastics within the atheroma and obtain further evidence and structural insights. Plaques will be also analysed through immunohistochemistry, ELISAs, and Western Blot to quantify inflammatory, i.e. NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, NF-kB, and CD68, and plaque stability markers, i.e. MMP-9 and collagen, in order to explore whether the presence of microplastics is associated with a poorer plaque phenotype. The groups (composed post-hoc) of patients with polluted plaques vs non-polluted plaques will be compared for the expression of all these markers. After carotid endarterectomy, patients will be followed-up and monitored for the incidence of a composite outcome constituted by non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and all-cause mortality, which represent the main and the only hard endpoint of the study. Patients will be categorized (post-hoc) as having polluted plaques (having detectable levels of at least one pollutant) or non-polluted plaques. Cox regression analysis will be used to examine the association between the presence of microplastics and the incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and smoking. Among those with polluted plaques, the abundance of pollutants, i.e. the sum, will be used to categorize patients into terciles. Cox models, adjusted for the same variables, will be run to explore the relationship between the burden of microplastics and the outcome. P values < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant."

The prognosis of patients with liver metastases is poor, with a median survival of 12-24 months. Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with liver metastases. TARE is a local treatment that delivers high doses of radiation to the tumor while sparing the surrounding healthy liver tissue. The treatment is performed by injecting radioactive microspheres into the hepatic artery, which supplies blood to the liver. The microspheres are designed to lodge in the tumor vessels, delivering radiation directly to the tumor. TARE has been shown to be effective in controlling tumor growth and improving survival in patients with liver metastases. However, the optimal dose of radiation to deliver to the tumor while minimizing toxicity to the surrounding healthy liver tissue is not well established. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the tumor and the response to treatment, as well as the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the healthy liver tissue and the occurrence of toxicity. The study will also investigate the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the tumor and the occurrence of toxicity. The study will include patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer who are scheduled to undergo TARE. The patients will be divided into two groups based on the dose of radiation delivered to the tumor. The first group will receive a low dose of radiation (< 100 Gy), and the second group will receive a high dose of radiation (> 100 Gy). The patients will be followed for 12 months after treatment, and the response to treatment, as well as the occurrence of toxicity, will be assessed. The study will also investigate the relationship between the dose of radiation delivered to the healthy liver tissue and the occurrence of toxicity.

535,"The study aimed to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with POAF. The telemonitored group received interventions and telemonitoring through the platform, while the control group followed the standard institutional patient journey without any intervention or telemonitoring. The primary outcome measure was the rehospitalization rate, and secondary outcome measures included scheduled consultations, extra occurences, technological adherence, treatment adherence, and use of the mobile application by patients. The study utilized a parallel assignment model and a single-blind design. The results of the study indicated that the telemonitored group had a lower rehospitalization rate and a higher rate of scheduled consultations compared to the control group. The study also found that the telemonitored group had a higher rate of technological adherence and a lower rate of extra occurences compared to the control group. The study concluded that the assisted digital telemonitoring platform was effective in reducing rehospitalization rates and improving patient outcomes."

-----------------
Septate uterus is a common congenital anomaly of the uterus. It is defined as a uterus with a complete or incomplete septum. The incidence of septate uterus is 1-2% of the general population. The incidence of septate uterus is higher in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and subfertility. The septum may be complete or incomplete. The complete septum is a solid structure that extends from the fundus to the cervix. The incomplete septum is a thin membrane that extends from the fundus to the cervix. The incomplete septum is more common than the complete septum. The septum may be associated with other uterine anomalies such as bicornuate uterus, unicornuate uterus, and didelphic uterus.

562,"The study - interventional, nonpharmacological, using medical devices, nonprofit - is aimed at evaluating the potential effectiveness of a multimodal intervention for the treatment of unipolar depression. The intervention involves the use of a neuro-stimulation technique, the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS), combined with a psychotherapy intervention, metacognitive therapy (MetaCognitive Therapy, MCT). TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique involving the transcranial application of a low-amperage electric current at a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been demonstrated how such stimulation has a neuromodulating effect on synaptic plasticity, with efficacy in unipolar major depression. The technique also has a good safety, as it is not associated with major side effects. MCT is based on the metacognitive model, according to which psychopathological processes are consequent to a cognitive style characterized by repetitive forms of thinking (such as rumination) and maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and thought suppression. The MCT, through attention training techniques, detached mindfulness and behavioral interventions on metacognitions, has shown effectiveness in major depressive disorder comparable to that of psychotherapeutic interventions considered, within psychotherapies, to be first-line such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. The experimental design will be that of a randomized, double-blind study with three arms of treatment, each consisting of 8 sessions, involving the administration of 1) the neurostimulation intervention (tDCS), 2) of the psychotherapeutic intervention alone (MCT), 3) of both techniques in consecution (tDCS-MCT). This design is aimed at evaluating a potential additive/synergistic effect of the two interventions when combined. During the tDCS sessions, each lasting 20 minutes, the patient will apply the technique of attention training, aimed at further activating the region stimulated by neurostimulation, so as to so as to amplify the plasticity stimulated by tDCS, achieving a synergistic effect. To follow, a 40-minute MCT session will be carried out. The effectiveness of these interventions will be assessed by heteroadministered and self-administered at time zero, after treatment, at two follow-ups of 6 and 12 months. Before and after the treatment cycle (tDCS sessions and MCT sessions), a subgroup of patients will be explored, in the context of a pilot study, the TMS-EEG correlates of the change in symptomatology depression, which can be correlated with the different proposed therapeutic interventions."

-----------------
Celiac disease (CD) is a chronic autoimmune disease triggered by gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. The prevalence of CD in the general population is estimated to be 1% in the United States and Europe. The diagnosis of CD is based on a combination of clinical symptoms, serology, and histopathology. The gold standard for the diagnosis of CD is the detection of anti-tissue transglutaminase (anti-TG2) antibodies in the serum and the presence of villous atrophy in the small intestine. The diagnosis of CD is often delayed due to the lack of specific symptoms and the need for invasive procedures to obtain intestinal biopsies. The development of a rapid and accurate diagnostic test for CD would enable a real-time diagnosis of CD and improve patient outcomes.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid anti-TG2 test detected on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens compared to the reference standard (serology + histopathology). The secondary objective is to evaluate the concordance of EMA assay and rapid anti-TG2 test on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens with Culture-EMA results.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective, observational study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will include patients undergoing an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for suspected CD, eosinophilic esophagitis, autoimmune enteropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, gastritis, gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention will be the use of a rapid anti-TG2 test detected on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid anti-TG2 test detected on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens compared to the reference standard (serology + histopathology). The secondary outcome measure will be the concordance of EMA assay and rapid anti-TG2 test on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens with Culture-EMA results."
568,"Background
-----------------
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is transmitted through respiratory droplets and can cause a range of symptoms, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. While most people who contract COVID-19 experience mild symptoms and recover without any long-term effects, some individuals may develop a range of symptoms that persist for weeks or even months after the initial infection. This condition is known as post-COVID-19 syndrome, or long COVID.

Post-COVID-19 syndrome is a complex condition that can affect multiple systems in the body, including the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological, and musculoskeletal systems. Some of the most common symptoms of long COVID include fatigue, shortness of breath, brain fog, and sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances are a common symptom of long COVID, affecting up to 50% of patients. These sleep disturbances can take many forms, including insomnia, sleep apnea, and restless legs syndrome.

Insomnia is a sleep disorder characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or both. It is estimated that up to 30% of the general population experiences insomnia at some point in their lives, and this number is likely to be even higher among patients with long COVID. Insomnia can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, leading to fatigue, irritability, and difficulty concentrating. It can also increase the risk of other health problems, such as depression and anxiety.

Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of talk therapy that is commonly used to treat insomnia. CBT involves working with a therapist to identify and change negative thoughts and behaviors that contribute to sleep problems. CBT has been shown to be effective in treating insomnia in the general population, and there is growing evidence that it may also be effective in treating insomnia in patients with long COVID.

In this study, the researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in treating insomnia in nurses with post-COVID-19 syndrome. The study will involve a randomized controlled trial, in which participants will be randomly assigned to either receive CBT or to receive usual care. The researchers will measure the effectiveness of CBT by assessing changes in sleep quality, sleep efficiency, and insomnia severity before and after the intervention.

The study will also evaluate the impact of CBT on other symptoms of long COVID, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and brain fog. The researchers will also assess the impact of CBT on quality of life and mental health.

Overall, this study has the potential to provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of CBT in treating insomnia in patients with long COVID. If the study finds that CBT is effective in treating insomnia in this population, it could lead to the development of new treatment options for patients with long COVID.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) in treating insomnia in nurses with post-COVID-19 syndrome.

Design
-----------------
This is a randomized controlled trial.

Intervention
-----------------
Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive CBT or to receive usual care. The CBT intervention will involve six weekly sessions, each lasting approximately 60 minutes. The sessions will be conducted by a trained therapist and will involve a combination of cognitive and behavioral techniques. The CBT intervention will be based on the principles of cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is a well-established treatment for insomnia.

The CBT-I intervention will involve the following components:

1. Education about sleep and insomnia: The therapist will provide information about the normal sleep cycle and the factors that can contribute to insomnia.

2. Cognitive restructuring: The therapist will help participants identify and challenge negative thoughts and beliefs about sleep.

3. Stimulus control: The therapist will help participants establish a regular sleep schedule and avoid activities that can interfere with sleep, such as using electronic devices in bed.

4. Sleep restriction: The therapist will help participants gradually increase their sleep time by limiting the amount of time they spend in bed.

5. Relaxation techniques: The therapist will teach participants relaxation techniques, such as progressive muscle relaxation and guided imagery, to help them relax and fall asleep more easily.

6. Sleep hygiene: The therapist will help participants establish good sleep hygiene habits, such as avoiding caffeine and alcohol"

577,"Background: 

Kienbock's disease is a rare condition that affects the lunate bone in the wrist. It is caused by a lack of blood flow to the lunate, which can lead to the bone dying and collapsing. This can cause pain, stiffness, and loss of function in the wrist. 

There are several treatment options for Kienbock's disease, including rest, splinting, and surgery. Surgery is often recommended for patients who have severe pain or loss of function. 

One surgical option is to shorten the radius or capitate bone in the wrist. This can help to relieve pressure on the lunate bone and improve function. However, it is not clear which of these two options is more effective. 

Objectives: 

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of shortening the radius or capitate bone in the treatment of Kienbock's disease. 

Study Design: 

This is a prospective, randomized controlled trial. 

Participants: 

Participants will be adults with Kienbock's disease who are candidates for surgery. 

Interventions: 

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: 

Group 1: Radius shortening 

Group 2: Capitate shortening 

Outcome Measures: 

The primary outcome measure will be the modified Mayo wrist score, which is a validated measure of wrist function. 

Secondary outcome measures will include pain, range of motion, grip strength, and quality of life. 

Data Collection: 

Data will be collected at baseline, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after surgery. 

Analysis: 

The data will be analyzed using statistical methods appropriate for a randomized controlled trial. 

Discussion: 

This study will provide important information about the effectiveness of shortening the radius or capitate bone in the treatment of Kienbock's disease. The results of this study will help to guide clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes."
578,"1. Background and rationale {6a}
The incidence of pancreatic cancer (PC) is increasing worldwide, with an estimated 466,000 new cases and 458,000 deaths in 2018. PC is the 12th most common cancer and the 7th leading cause of cancer death. The 5-year survival rate is 9%, and the median survival time is 6 months. The majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, and only 20% of patients are eligible for curative resection. The main risk factors for PC are smoking, obesity, diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis. The prognosis of PC is poor, and the majority of patients die within 1 year of diagnosis. The main cause of death is metastatic disease, but local recurrence and postoperative complications are also common causes of death.
The main treatment for PC is surgery, but the majority of patients are not eligible for surgery due to advanced disease or comorbidities. For patients who are eligible for surgery, the perioperative period is associated with a high risk of complications, including postoperative infections, bleeding, and organ failure. The risk of complications is increased in patients with comorbidities, such as diabetes, obesity, and chronic pancreatitis.
The main goal of prehabilitation is to improve the patient's physical and mental condition before surgery, in order to reduce the risk of complications and improve the patient's quality of life. Prehabilitation can be divided into three main components: exercise training, nutritional intervention, and psychological support.
Exercise training is the most important component of prehabilitation, and it has been shown to improve the patient's physical condition, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the patient's quality of life. Exercise training can be divided into aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and flexibility exercise. Aerobic exercise is the most important type of exercise for prehabilitation, and it has been shown to improve the patient's cardiovascular function, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the patient's quality of life. Resistance exercise is the second most important type of exercise for prehabilitation, and it has been shown to improve the patient's muscle strength, reduce the risk of complications, and improve the patient's quality of life.

581,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a canine-assisted therapy program in youth residing in a residential treatment center. The study will use a longitudinal, within-person design with two parallel conditions. In one condition, youth receive a 6-week canine therapy intervention. The other condition consists of treatment as usual. The subject population are youth that are in a full-time residential treatment facility in Lawrence Hall. All studies activities take place in Lawrence Hall. Please note that per Lawrence Hall policy, youth are selected by Lawrence Hall staff to participate in the Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy program while in residence. A group of closely-matched youth will also be selected by Lawrence Hall staff to serve as the waitlist control (treatment-as-usual) group. The Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy intervention is a 1.25 hour structured curriculum that will occur weekly across a period of 6 weeks. The program will be delivered by the Canine Therapy Corps (CTCorps). Youth will work with CTC-affiliate staff, including trained dog-handler teams, a canine behavior expert, and a clinical supervisor to engage in a series of structured activities progress throughout the intervention. Week 1 is a meet-and-greet session where youth are introduced to all dog-handler teams participating in the program and will be asked to select a team to work with for the following sessions. Each youth is assigned their own dog-handler team. Weeks 2 cover activities regarding dog obedience, building from mastering basic commands which the dog already knows (such as sit, stay') to the introduction of new tricks that the dog has not yet learned. In Weeks 3, youth will continue to work on mastering the new tricks with their dog-handler team and will also begin dog agility training. The agility training session progress in terms of complexity of number and types of obstacles. Week 4 is for proofing all skills (obedience, trick, agility) learned in previous sessions. Week 5 continues proofing all skills and is discussion of the graduation structure and dress rehearsal, and Week 6 is a graduation ceremony where family and friends are invited to observe the progress each youth has made with their dog-handler team. In Weeks 1-5, the goals of each session are outlined at the beginning of the session and brief education is provided regarding the session goals. Weeks 2-5 also include a review of the skills/activities covered in prior weeks. At the end of sessions 1-5, youth are asked to reflect on what they did during the session, including discussion of what they did really well, what they wanted to work on further, and goals for the next session. Research staff will be present during all sessions to record fidelity measures. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale will be administered on-site by research staff at the beginning and end of each intervention session. Change in affect are primary and secondary outcome measures.

588,"Background and study aims
-----------------
Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a multidisciplinary programme of exercise, education and behaviour change that is recommended for all patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. PR improves exercise capacity, quality-of-life and provides vital education for condition management. PR is now recommended for all COPD patients (NICE guidelines NG115). A standard PR programme involves two, in-person, exercise classes per week over a period of 8 weeks after which the patient is discharged to self-care. While retaining some in-person contact, technology could increase access and automate delivery of education and exercise by overcoming shortages of skilled staff. New technology exists to allow the delivery of a hybrid PR programme which may be used to support a move to a remotely delivered service (with patients having the opportunity to attend in-person PR sessions during the programme if they need the motivation or support of an in-person session). This study will use the UKCA/CE Class I-approved and DTAC-certified Active+me REMOTE App (Aseptika Ltd www.activ8rlives.com). The Active+me App, accessible by patients on their smartphones with Bluetooth or connected medical monitors, includes remote tracking of adherence, symptoms and physiological parameters (where appropriate); live, online video exercise classes; pre-recorded classes; a paced walking programme; an educational programme delivered in bite-sized pieces; and personalised care plans for every patient. Generally, NICE guidance draws on randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to inform guidelines however RCTs are costly and time consuming for digital healthcare and this delays uptake and adoption by the NHS. New and innovative approaches to obtaining effectiveness evidence for digitally delivered healthcare are urgently needed and new approaches and solutions are being reviewed by NICE. This feasibility study will use a real-world study design drawing largely on routinely collected data to compare outcomes for patients recruited to a Hybrid PR Intervention with a propensity matched Control Group that has previously received Standard PR. Additional data will be collected from the Hybrid PR Group (via Active+me REMOTE / Trial Surveys) to provide supporting evidence relating to uptake, adherence, clinical outcomes (not routinely recorded in standard practice), and usability/acceptability of the Hybrid PR programme. Patients with chronic respiratory disease who are referred to the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme will be screened for eligibility to participate in the Hybrid PR Trial. Informed consent will obtained in eligible patients who wish to take part. Recruited participants will follow a hybrid PR programme (Intervention Group). The Control Group will be patients that have previously received a standard pulmonary rehabilitation programme and are matched on specified criteria including age, sex, measure of respiratory disability, index of multiple deprivation, exercise capacity and hospital vs community location. Following their informed consent the Hybrid PR Intervention Group will attend an onboarding session where a member of the clinical research team will i) download the Active+me REMOTE App onto patients' smartphone (or provide patients without a smartphone, one on which the App is preloaded), and ii) connect the patients' Active+me REMOTE account to the clinical team via a secure clinical portal. The clinician will also assign appropriate monitoring devices (e.g. BP monitor, Inhaler tracker, smart (weight) scale, pulse oximeter, peak flow monitor) to the participant. After saving the participant's details the patient's App dashboard will be displayed and (as required) the clinician will demonstrate exercise/ educational content of the App. Participants will have a preliminary in-person assessment with a member of the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Team (as part of routine care). The participant will then follow the 8-week Hybrid PR intervention involving two exercise classes per week. While this is an 8-week programme, this may be extended to up to 12 weeks for some patients (for example, if the patient is not able to attend 2 sessions per week). After completing the Hybrid PR programme, the participant will have a discharge assessment (as part of routine care). Demographic data from routine medical records and data on service location (i.e. hospital vs community setting) will be collected at baseline for the Hybrid PR Intervention and the Control Group. Data from routine medical records will be collected both at baseline and on completing the Hybrid/Standard PR programme. These data will include measures of exercise capacity; disease knowledge; lower limb function; health"

-----------------
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects approximately 1% of the population over the age of 60. The main motor symptoms of PD are bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. In addition, PD is associated with a wide range of non-motor symptoms, such as cognitive decline, depression, and sleep disturbances. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in PD is estimated to be between 20 and 80%. Cognitive impairment is associated with a higher risk of falls, a lower quality of life, and a higher risk of institutionalization. In addition, cognitive impairment is associated with a lower response to dopaminergic medication and a higher risk of developing dementia.

597,"Frostbite injury has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for as long as humans have experienced cold winters. When frostbite occurs, there are two primary mechanisms through which tissue damage occurs, though the main mechanism focused on here is systemic cooling. Frostbite is a multiphase process that starts with systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury, but it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities that have been used is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. At Regions Hospital, the main diagnostic method that has been used for over 20 years is conventional angiography. This clearly demonstrates the microvasculature of the tissues and allows the intra-arterial catheter directed sheaths to be placed to start thrombolytics, heparin, and vasodilators to treat the tissue ischemia. Other diagnostic modalities used elsewhere include Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT imaging, and indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography. All of these imaging modalities demonstrate the perfusion of the affected tissue but do not allow for directed delivery of thrombolytics. In institutions that use these imaging techniques, thrombolytics are typically delivered in an intravenous fashion rather than intra-arterial. ICG microangiography is a technology that has had rapidly expanding applications in recent decades. These have included retinal imaging, determining perfusion of colorectal anastomoses, biliary imaging, and assessing the blood supply of tissue flaps. It has recently been used in diagnosis of frostbite with good correlation with severe final amputation levels. It is easy to use, non-radiating, can be performed at the bedside, and cheaper than other imaging modalities. Given that every hospital has different diagnostic and treatment algorithms, these different imaging modalities have rarely been compared in the same patient. The current best metric is comparing the imaging modality with the amount of tissue that is amputated as demonstrated in prior studies cited here. This research application provides a unique opportunity to compare two imaging modalities head-to-head in the same patient and determine their concordance or discordance."

603,"1. Background of the study: American football is one of the contact sports with the highest risk in terms of exposure to repeated head impacts and the formation of neurodegenerative diseases that negatively affect the quality of life in the later stage of life. It has been reported that there are increases in the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers and that some other biomarkers (such as BDNF, zonulin, telomere length, etc.) that may be associated with these may be adversely affected in American football players. It is necessary to develop new approaches to determine the preventive factors against the risk of neurodegenerative diseases that may occur in the later years of life due to contact sports such as American football. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has antioxidant (vitamins, flavonoids, phytosterols, minerals, terpenes and phenols) and anti-inflammatory (oleic acid, polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids) properties that are thought to be effective in improving oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers. The MIND diet can also reduce intestinal permeability with its abundant fiber content (prebiotic effect). It has been reported that the supplementation of some nutrients (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, etc.) that have an important place in the composition of the MIND diet in this group of athletes has a positive effect on some of these biomarkers. However, the studies in the literature are limited, and there is no study involving the MIND diet in American football players. This study was planned considering that the MIND diet may have positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players, who are exposed to repetitive head impacts as a nature of this contact sport. 2. Objective of the study: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the MIND diet on oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players. 3. Study design: This study was planned as a randomized controlled trial. 4. Study population: American football players playing in the pro league will be included in this study. 5. Sample size: Accordingly, a total of 30 athletes, 15 in each group, with 95% confidence (1-α), 95% test power (1-β) and f=0.6 effect size; with 80% confidence (1-α), 80% test power (1-β) and f=0.6 effect size, a total of 20 athletes, 10 in each group, should be included. 6. Study duration: Since all teams will participate in the same number of competitions and the group matches will last approximately nine weeks, the follow-up time has been determined as nine weeks. 7. Study procedures: At the beginning of the study, a face-to-face questionnaire will be used to question the athletes' American football history and player positions, socio-demographics, general health and nutritional habits. Before the start of the study, a 7-day food consumption record will be taken from the athletes. MIND scores will be questioned before the study and every week till the end of the study according to the frequency of food consumption in the MIND composition scale. It will be used to assess participants' adherence to the MIND diet. Accordingly, the MIND diet components include ten food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, bean types, whole grains, seafood, poultry, olive oil, and wine) that are healthy for the brain. There are also five food groups (red meat, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets and fried / fast food / fast food) that are considered unhealthy. Frequencies of food consumption (daily, weekly, monthly) are questioned according to whether these 10 food groups specified in the template are preferred based on portion and meal or as a primary, and as a result, scoring is made as 0, 0.5 and 1 points for each food group. The highest score is 15 points. Because the MIND diet template does not have specific scores for diet adherence, below the median score (7.5) will be considered low adherence. According to the MIND diet composition scale, those with a MIND diet score of <7.5 points will be included in the study, while those with a score"

-----------------
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2% in the general population. It is characterized by a depressed mood and a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed. MDD is associated with a significant burden on individuals, families, and society. The economic burden of MDD is estimated to be $210.5 billion per year in the United States and $121.5 billion per year in Europe. The treatment of MDD typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy. However, despite the availability of effective treatments, many patients with MDD do not receive adequate treatment. One of the reasons for this is that patients with MDD often experience barriers to accessing care, such as stigma, lack of insurance coverage, and difficulty finding a provider. In addition, many patients with MDD do not adhere to their treatment plan, which can lead to poor outcomes.
Telemedicine is a promising approach for improving the care of patients with MDD. Telemedicine is the use of technology to provide healthcare services remotely. It has the potential to overcome many of the barriers to accessing care that patients with MDD face. Telemedicine can also help to improve adherence to treatment by providing patients with convenient and accessible care.
In this study, we will evaluate the effectiveness of a telemedicine intervention for patients with MDD who are receiving care in a hospital setting. The intervention will consist of a series of telemedicine sessions with a psychiatrist. The sessions will be conducted using a secure video conferencing platform. The sessions will be tailored to the needs of each patient and will focus on providing support and education about MDD. The primary outcome of the study will be the rate of remission of MDD at 6 months. Secondary outcomes will include the rate of remission at 12 months, the rate of relapse at 6 and 12 months, and the rate of hospitalization at 6 and 12 months. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the intervention.

629,"1. Background and rationale: Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common type of indolent lymphoma. The majority of patients with FL are treated with immunochemotherapy (IC) containing a monospecific anti-CD20 antibody (such as rituximab or obinutuzumab) and chemotherapy (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). The long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24 months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for progression of disease within 24 months), and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line treatment, and they are in need of improved treatment options. Mosunetuzumab is a new, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that has shown very high response rates and long response duration in B-cell lymphoma patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to standard salvage regimens. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients with POD24. The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients. 2. Objectives: The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24. The secondary objectives are to investigate safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab patients´ self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab resource usage related to mosunetuzumab 3. Interventions: Mosunetuzumab is administered SC as described below. Patients are followed for at least 2,5 years and a maximum of 5 years in the trial. Study-specific sampling of peripheral blood for exploratory research amounts to 330-380 mL (depending on the number of treatment cycles) collected over 3 years. Study-specific tumor samples for future research will be collected by fine needle aspiration before the start of treatment and after the third treatment cycle. Ethical considerations: Previous studies have shown that mosunetuzumab is highly effective and well tolerated in heavily treated B-cell lymphoma patients. The safety profile is favourable compared to standard immunochemotherapy. Mosunetuzumab can be safely administered to older patients with co-morbidities, and there is no upper age limit for participation in the trial. The potential beneficial effect of mosunetuzumab in a population of follicular lymphoma patients with POD24 outweighs the risk for rare and undiscovered serious adverse events. The total volume of blood samples is considered acceptable for patients in clinical trials. The extra tumor samples for research purposes will only be collected if deemed safe and not to cause unreasonable discomfort for the participating subject. The extra number of CT scans is 2-3 compared to standard practice and represents a minimal increase in radiation exposure. In total, the benefit to risk balance is deemed positive for this trial. 4. Study design: Phase II, one arm, open label clinical trial of subcutaneous mosunetuzumab mono-therapy 5. Study population: Patients with follicular lymphoma grade 1-3a with a current relapse or progression within 24 months of starting 1st line treatment or refractory to 1st line treatment (POD24), more specifically: Documented current relapse or progression of FL within 24 months of starting first line treatment containing a monospecific anti-CD20 antibody (such as rituximab or obinutuzumab with or without chemotherapy, small molecular inhibitors or immunomodulating agents such as lenalidomide).

-----------------
Delirium is a common complication of critical illness, affecting up to 80% of patients. Delirium is associated with increased mortality, longer hospital stays, and increased risk of long-term cognitive impairment. Older adults are at increased risk of delirium and cognitive impairment, and the prevalence of delirium increases with age. Driving is a complex task that requires cognitive and sensorimotor skills. Older adults are at risk for ICU-acquired cognitive decline discernible from clinical, biological, and imaging-related changes in the brain following delirium and critical illness. Similar to other forms of dementia, the combination of normal aging paired with cognitive deficits associated with critical illness survivorship places these older adults at high risk of automobile crashes. To address ICU-acquired cognitive decline, driving assessments to characterize risky driving behaviors are promising to guide driving rehabilitation and intervention development. Rigorous and reproducible driving safety assessment programs have demonstrated success in post-stroke and dementia contexts, established via in-vehicle and virtual modes. The investigators hypothesize that in-vehicle driving assessment and monitoring is a feasible and acceptable approach to assess and address ICU survivor driving safety. The investigators seek to implement novel in-vehicle cloud-data collection technology developed by the investigators' team. The investigators propose to pair neurocognitive assessments with in-vehicle kinematic driving data to conduct essential formative work to develop data-based insights into driving behaviors of older adults with ICU-acquired cognitive declines. The investigators aim to determine protocol feasibility and acceptability of neurocognitive assessments and in-vehicle sensor deployment (Aim 1). The investigators will enroll a cohort of older ICU survivors (n=24) with risk factors for ICU-acquired cognitive impairment to complete neurocognitive measures and participate in driving data collection via in-vehicle sensors over a 6-month post-hospital discharge period. Next, the investigators will evaluate the relationship between neurocognitive assessments and driving behavior and safety in older ICU survivors (Aim 2). Lastly, the investigators will conduct stakeholder advisory panels on the priorities and data presentation needs of driving assessments for older ICU survivors (Aim 3). The stakeholder advisory panel insights will provide scientific justification and protocol feasibility to evaluate recruitment, acceptability and attrition for future full-scale implementation. As the population of older drivers grows, almost doubling in size from 2012 to 2040 there is an immediate and critical need to address this impactful issue. This work is designed in response to the NIA Strategic Plan (Goal C-1-9 Safety of Older Drivers) to contribute to a critical gap in health promotion to develop an evidence-based, in- vehicle driving assessment system to provide actionable driving safety data and rehabilitation strategies tailored to ICU survivors, the participants' care partners and clinicians.

637,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and surgery is the preferred treatment method for primary resectable GIST. The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors. Existing studies have explored the drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection assisting patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to use TKI. Therefore, this one-arm prospective observational clinical study will assist some high-risk GIST patients who have been treated with imatinib for 3 years after surgery and have achieved disease control to adopt the treatment mode of drug holiday based on MRD detection, aiming to evaluate the value of MRD detection in monitoring postoperative recurrence of high-risk GIST, investigate the effect of drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection on disease recurrence and patient survival, and to explore whether it can delay the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations."

-----------------
Cardiac surgery is the most important treatment for serious coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease and other heart diseases. Its postoperative mortality and serious complications have also been widely concerned, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The persistent pulmonary hypertension and systemic vascular paralysis during the perioperative period are the main causes of early postoperative death and serious complications such as organ failure.
Catecholamine vasoactive drugs commonly used in cardiac surgery may aggravate the condition of pulmonary hypertension, while the use of drugs to reduce pulmonary hypertension, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may worsen the state of systemic vascular paralysis. Vasopressin and oxytocin are two effective components in pituitrin, and vasopressin is the main component that exerts strong vasoconstrictive effect.
Vasopressin binds to receptors distributed in vascular smooth muscle, pituitary and kidney, and exerts its effects by regulating adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel function, nitric oxide production and enhancing vascular response to catecholamine.In addition, oxytocin can also bind to the receptors distributed in the heart and vascular endothelium, and play a role by releasing atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide.Therefore, pituitrin can not only constrict systemic circulation vessels and increase systemic circulation pressure, reduce pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, but also protect the heart and kidney. Therefore, this study intends to explore whether pituitrin has an impact on the prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery, so as to provide reference for its clinical application.

-----------------
Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy, with an estimated 56,870 new cases and 2,220 deaths in the United States in 2019. Radioactive iodine therapy is a common treatment for thyroid cancer, and it is associated with a high rate of post-treatment nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). NLDO is a condition in which the nasolacrimal duct becomes blocked, leading to excessive tearing and eye irritation. It is a common complication of radioactive iodine therapy, with an estimated incidence of 20-40%. NLDO can be a significant source of discomfort for patients, and it can also lead to other complications, such as conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers.

Currently, there is no standard treatment for NLDO. Some patients may be able to manage their symptoms with over-the-counter eye drops or ointments, but others may require more aggressive treatment, such as surgery or dilation of the nasolacrimal duct. In some cases, NLDO may resolve on its own, but this can take several months or even years.

Artificial tears are a type of eye drop that is commonly used to treat dry eye syndrome. They are designed to lubricate the eyes and help to reduce symptoms of dryness, such as burning, itching, and redness. Artificial tears are available over-the-counter and do not require a prescription.

In this study, the investigators will evaluate the use of artificial tears to prevent NLDO in patients who are treated with radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer. The investigators hypothesize that the use of artificial tears will reduce the incidence of NLDO in these patients.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized, controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group, which will receive artificial tears, or the control group, which will not receive artificial tears.

Participants
-----------------
The study will enroll patients who are scheduled to receive radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer. Patients will be eligible for the study if they are 18 years of age or older and have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.

Intervention
-----------------
Participants in the experimental group will receive artificial tears to be administered in the 4 days immediately following radioactive iodine therapy. The schedule of administration will be as follows: Day 1 (day of radioactive iodine therapy): Every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for at least 4 hours or until bedtime at night Day 2: Once every 1 hour for 12 hours Day 3: Four times (approximately morning, lunch, dinner, and evening) Day 4: Two times (morning and evening)

Participants in the control group will not administer artificial tears in the 4 days immediately following radioactive iodine therapy.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of post-radiotherapy nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) in each experimental group as determined by tear duct irrigation by an ophthalmologist.

Secondary outcome measures will include the severity of NLDO symptoms, the duration of NLDO symptoms, and the need for additional treatment for NLDO.

The ACHIEVE (Advancing Community and Clinical Care for Childbirth-related Hypertension Through Implementation, Engagement, and Valuing Equity) Initiative is a multi-phase project that aims to improve care for pregnant people with severe hypertension. The first phase of the project was a formative study that included three rural Piedmont Health Services (PHS) clinics that serve mostly White and Latinx patients. The inpatient HTN bundle was adapted to fit their setting and re-named the Outpatient Hypertension (O-HTN) bundle. Additionally, a coalition was established to engage patients, clinic providers/staff, and the broader community to: (a) understand factors influencing maternal health including economic stability, education, health care access, and community context, (b) assess what makes it easier or harder to implement the O-HTN bundle in community outpatient clinic settings, (c) adapt the O-HTN bundle to fit those settings and populations, and (d) select and tailor changes to clinic practices using continuous cycles of learning, measuring and adapting to be the most effective and sustainable for the organization. Building on this formative work, the goal of the clinical trial is to determine the impact of three implementation strategies (training, coaching, facilitation) in 20 outpatient clinics in central North Carolina. Usual clinic care for severe hypertension will be compared to the care provided after a practice has 12 months of implementation support from the ACHIEVE Nurse Coordinator. ACHIEVE partners include healthcare leadership, clinic providers and staff, community-based organizations, and individuals with lived experience who will work together on this project. If the project succeeds in improving care, the ACHIEVE model will be shared across the state and nationally to support healthier birthing people and communities."

657,"Background
-----------------
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on global health, with millions of people infected and many experiencing long-term symptoms. One of the most common and debilitating long-term symptoms is cognitive impairment, which can significantly impact a person's quality of life. Cognitive impairment is characterized by difficulties with memory, attention, and executive function, and it can be a major barrier to returning to work or resuming normal activities.

The exact cause of cognitive impairment in long COVID is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to a combination of factors, including inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration. Inflammation is a key driver of cognitive impairment, as it can lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines that can damage neurons and disrupt normal brain function. Oxidative stress is another important factor, as it can lead to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that can damage neurons and contribute to cognitive decline. Neurodegeneration is also thought to play a role, as it can lead to the loss of neurons and the development of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease.

One potential treatment for cognitive impairment in long COVID is methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Methylprednisolone has been used to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including multiple sclerosis, stroke, and traumatic brain injury, and it has been shown to improve cognitive function in these conditions.

In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of methylprednisolone in patients with cognitive impairment in long COVID. We will enroll patients who have experienced cognitive impairment for at least three months after their initial COVID-19 infection. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either methylprednisolone or placebo for six weeks, followed by an additional six weeks of open-label methylprednisolone. The primary outcome measure will be change in cognitive function, as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test. Secondary outcome measures will include change in quality of life, fatigue, and mood. We will also evaluate the safety of methylprednisolone by monitoring for adverse events."

670,"1. Background and rationale: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is markedly increasing in prevalence amongst older adults. Older adults with MS present with poor health status and functioning, cognitive and ambulatory difficulty, dependence for activities of daily living, and reduced physical activity participation. The common approach for managing MS involves disease-modifying drugs, yet this first-line approach for medical management has little efficacy in older MS age groups (i.e., those 50+ years of age). Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for maintaining and/or restoring physical and cognitive health in older adults from the general population and younger adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. 2. Objectives: The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach (via telerehabilitation) with rigorous design for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based exercise intervention program in older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful aging with MS. 3. Study design: This study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with two parallel arms. 4. Study population: The study population will be older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. 5. Sample size: The sample size will be 40 participants (20 per group). 6.

-----------------
The incidence of cesarean section (CS) has increased significantly in the last 15 years. Various reasons account for the increase in CS, including an increase upon maternal request, changes in maternal demographics (e.g., increasing maternal age), changes in physician practice patterns, more conservative practice guidelines, and mounting legal pressures. Because of the gradually increasing rates of cesarean sections (CSs) over the last two decades, the number of hysterectomized patients with previous CSs has increased. In a recent review article, previously performed CSs were demonstrated to be an important risk factor for lower urinary tract injuries, and the recommendation that abdominal hysterectomy might be preferable for these patients was emphasized. TLH may be technically difficult in patients with previous CSs, due to surgical adhesions, and is associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications. Mobilization of the urinary bladder off of the cervix is an important step in total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and is always performed before dealing with the uterine pedicle. If the uterus is unscarred, bladder mobilization may not be technically difficult. However, if the uterus is scarred, there can be adhesions not only between the uterus and the bladder but also to the anterior abdominal wall, which can make dissection challenging. Studies of the effects of closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum during cesarean delivery on adhesion formation have concluded that insufficient data are available and that adequately powered and designed trials are needed. As regards the lateral approach, this space was first described by Dr. Shrish Sheth utilizing the utero-cervical broad ligament in post cesarean cases during vaginal hysterectomy. He described that the lateral area; the two leaves of broad ligament remains free and allows easy possibility for entry to dissect whether vaginally or abdominally.

Objectives
-----------------
The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of central and lateral urinary bladder dissection during total laparoscopic hysterectomy in cases with previous cesarean section.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a prospective randomized controlled study.

Study Population
-----------------
The study will be conducted on 100 patients with previous cesarean section who are scheduled for total laparoscopic hysterectomy.

Intervention
-----------------
Patients will be randomized into two groups. Group A (central group) will undergo central urinary bladder dissection. Group B (lateral group) will undergo lateral urinary bladder dissection.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is the rate of urinary bladder injury during dissection. The secondary outcome measures are operative time, amount of blood loss, and late urological complications.

-----------------
The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that reside in the gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome is involved in many aspects of human health and disease, including metabolism, immune function, and brain function. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome is also involved in the regulation of lipid metabolism. Lipid metabolism is the process by which the body breaks down fats and uses them for energy. The gut microbiome is thought to play a role in this process by producing short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are a type of fatty acid that is produced by the breakdown of dietary fiber. SCFAs are thought to have a number of health benefits, including improving gut health, reducing inflammation, and promoting weight loss.

The gut microbiome is also thought to play a role in the regulation of well-being. Well-being is a state of mental and physical health that is characterized by a sense of happiness and satisfaction with life. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome is involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety. The gut microbiome is thought to produce neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, which are involved in the regulation of mood and anxiety.

The gut microbiome is also thought to play a role in the regulation of sleep. Sleep is a state of rest and recovery that is essential for good health. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome is involved in the regulation of sleep by producing hormones that regulate the sleep-wake cycle."

685,"The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people with Parkinson's disease (PD) manage their physical activity and exercise participation with different levels of support from their communities and clinicians. We will evaluate exercise and physical activity every 3 months in a cohort of people with PD from two clinics in the Chicagoland area: Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest and University of Chicago Medical Center. During this study, we will evaluate differences in 12-month physical activity trajectories between groups enrolled during each of three conditions: (1A) standard care (condition 1, year 1), (1B) written exercise guidance (condition 2, year 2), and (1C) Consultative PT (condition 3, year 3). People with PD will be enrolled each year into an activity and exercise tracking study. Participants will be tracked using a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos) and commercial grade activity trackers. Research-grade actigraphy and patient reported outcome measures will be monitored every 3 months for the first year. All participants will be enrolled in an exercise and physical activity tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. The platform allows for synchronization of patients' activity data from their fitness tracker or smartwatch to the secure cloud-based platform. The platform can summarize steps per day, activity intensity, minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day based on target heart rate zones (including an ability for physical therapists to customize the target heart rate zone). At the 2 sites of care (Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital and University of Chicago), participants will be recruited based on contacting consecutive patients who meet the inclusion criteria based on scheduling and EMR screening prior to their visit with their neurologists. Contacting consecutive patients will ensure greater potential equity of enrolling participants rather than only patients engaged in support groups and exercise classes. However, after 3 months of recruitment, we will conduct a preliminary analysis of the numbers, recruitment rates, and characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, disease duration, education) of the enrolling participants compared to the demographics of each clinic as a whole. We will then determine if we should use targeted recruitment strategies to increase reach to specific groups or recruitment rates by doing one or more of the following: (1) sending measures through MyChart to potentially eligible patients targeting or oversampling for higher socioeconomic, race, or ethnicity diversity or (2) reaching out to local community exercise classes or support groups using emails to community advocates and flyers to increase sample size more rapidly. Consecutive patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be approached by a site study team member. The first contact may occur before or during a medical (physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner) visit. The electronic health record system will be used to screen participants for eligibility in the few weeks before their visit through an institutional review board-approved electronic data warehouse data waiver. Attempts will be made to contact potential participants before or during their appointments, with a research coordinator attempting contact at their visit if there is no response to early contacts. If time is limited during the patient's session, we will use patient portal communication and/or phone calls after their visits depending on the preferences of each site (which will be determined during the pre-implementation barrier assessment). Screening for eligibility will occur via a combination of data available in the EMR for existing patients and a quick screening questionnaire that can be done in person or over the phone. After identifying that the participant is interested and satisfies the inclusion criteria for the study, they will be sent an e-consent. Once consent is obtained, they will work with the study team to set a time for the baseline assessment period which will include ensuring the participant has their own -wrist-worn activity tracker and is able to get commercial grade activity tracker from the research team. At baseline and every 3-months throughout the 12-month (baseline, 3-months, 6-months, 9-months, 12-months) study, participants will complete online survey assessments including demographic questionnaires, habits and perceptions of physical activity and exercise, and healthcare and exercise resource utilization. Participants will, also, wear a research-grade physical activity monitor on a belt clip around their waist for 7-consecutive days at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months. In addition to research-grade physical activity monitoring, participants will be asked to a personal commercially available activity tracker daily which"

-----------------
Perioperative stroke is a significant complication after surgery. Unfortunately, covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline. Further, perioperative overt stroke is associated with an 8-fold increase in perioperative mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay, and decreased quality of life. For shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position, due to systemic hypotension and reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral desaturation events and impaired cerebral autoregulation can occur in up to 80% of patients. Most perioperative stroke in non-cardiac surgery is ischemic and is related to brain hypoperfusion. Importantly, brain hypoperfusion is potentially modifiable with simple measures such as increasing systemic blood pressure (BP) if brain ischemia is identified early enough. However, deliberate hypertension is not devoid of risk and there is currently no effective monitor that can detect brain hypoperfusion during surgery. Cerebral oxygenation has been used clinically as a measure of adequate brain perfusion during surgery. An early clinical trial at Western found that monitoring cerebral oxygenation was associated with fewer cases of major organ dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients. Despite this promising initial finding, current commercial cerebral oximeters have a number of limitations that prevent reliable perioperative neuromonitoring, including non-specificity due to signal contamination from extracerebral tissue, especially during administration of vasoconstrictors or hypothermia. In addition, current commercial cerebral oximeters only have two channels to monitor the frontal lobe regions (i.e., anterior cerebral artery territory). This monitoring strategy assumes that cerebral oxygenation is homogenous across different brain regions so that measurements from the frontal regions can be used clinically to represent the adequacy of global brain oxygenation. Such a limited spatial coverage may result in undetected stroke, despite the patients having apparently normal cerebral oxygenation in the frontal regions throughout surgery. The current research project employs multi-channel tr-fNIRS to address these limitations, with the goal of timely detection and prevention of ischemic brain injury. Multi-channel tr-fNIRS (time-resolved (tr) functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (tr-fNIRS)) is an emerging brain-imaging technology that was originally developed to explore changes in cerebral oxygenation generated by cortical neuronal activity during various cognitive tasks such as speech, sensory and motor functions, and emotion. This is because tr-fNIRS can measure such subtle cerebral oxygenation changes in milliseconds (up to 100 ms) that accompany neuro-activation such as finger-tapping. The investigators has built several tr-fNIRS devices and have the expertise of adapting the full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to perioperative neuromonitoring. Furthermore, tr-fNIRS operate by sending short (picosecond) pulses of light into the head and precisely measures the time of travel of each photon in the tissue. Since there is an equivalence between time and distance, photons that are detected right after the pulse have only probed the extracerebral layers (scalp and skull) while photons that are detected long after (1-2 ms) the pulse have travelled deep into the brain tissues. The investigators has recently shown that this approach reduces the signal contaminations of the extracerebral layers from 80% with current commercial NIRS devices to less than 8% with tr-fNIRS. In this study, the investigators will employ a state-of-the-art full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to monitor the entire brain, as opposed to only select regions (such as the limited capabilities of the current cerebral oximeters) in the perioperative setting. Together with in-house analysis algorithms, the full head coverage tr-fNIRS can detect specific brain regions at-risk of ischemic injury with a high degree of certainty because of greater spatial resolution (in cm) and less signal contamination from extracerebral tissue. All study participants will be recruited and consented adhering to the local ethics guidelines. For all study participants, the surgical and anesthetic management of the patients will be conducted in a standard fashion and will not be altered in this study. The exception is that tr-fNIRS will be used to monitor regional brain oxygenation from anest"

691,"1. Background of the study: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that affects women of reproductive age. It is a condition that causes physical and psychological symptoms in the last week of the menstrual cycle. The symptoms of PMS are very diverse and can be seen in many different areas. The most common symptoms are mood swings, irritability, anxiety, depression, fatigue, headache, breast tenderness, bloating, and abdominal pain. PMS can have a negative impact on a woman's quality of life, work performance, and relationships with others. It is estimated that up to 90% of women experience some form of PMS during their reproductive years. The exact cause of PMS is not known, but it is thought to be related to changes in hormone levels during the menstrual cycle. PMS can be treated with various methods, including lifestyle changes, medication, and counseling. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to treating PMS, and what works for one woman may not work for another. In this study, the researchers will investigate the effectiveness of a health promotion model-based education program in reducing the symptoms of PMS. The health promotion model is a framework that is used to promote healthy behaviors and improve health outcomes. It is based on the idea that health is a result of a complex interaction between individual, environmental, and behavioral factors. The health promotion model has been used successfully in a variety of settings, including schools, workplaces, and communities. The researchers will use a randomized controlled trial design to evaluate the effectiveness of the education program. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will receive the health promotion model-based education program, while the control group will receive standard care. The researchers will measure the effectiveness of the education program by comparing the symptoms of PMS between the two groups. The researchers will also measure the participants' knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to PMS. The researchers hope that this study will provide valuable information about the effectiveness of the health promotion model-based education program in reducing the symptoms of PMS. 2.

693,"Background
-----------------
The prevalence of common mental health problems (CMHPs) in prison populations is high. CMHPs are associated with re-offending and are therefore an important target for intervention. The prison period may provide opportunities for addressing CMHPs, but there may be important obstacles and barriers to the actual delivery of interventions, such as a lack of mental health care specialists in prisons due to staff shortages. Within the PROSPER study, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the brief, scalable Problem Management Plus (PM+) intervention in Dutch prisons. The PM+ intervention is designed to address CMHPs, is delivered by trained non-specialists, and will be specifically adapted for the prison setting.

Objective
-----------------
The primary objective of the PROSPER study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PM+ adapted for individuals imprisoned in Dutch prisons.

Study design
-----------------
This study entails a single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) (Study Phase 2) and a qualitative study to evaluate the process following the pilot RCT (Study Phase 3).

Study population
-----------------
Study Phase 2 - Dutch-speaking adults (18 years or older; N=60) who at the time of inclusion are imprisoned in a Dutch prison and have a remaining sentence length of at least 15 weeks and who report an elevated level of psychological distress (K10 >15).

Study Phase 3 - Participants (N= 20) will be from different stakeholder groups: the RCT participants, PM+ helpers, PM+ supervisors/trainers, and professionals. If permitted by RCT participants, family members, and friends are also invited.

Intervention (if applicable)
-----------------
Treatment group (n=30) - Participants in the treatment group will receive care-as-usual (CAU) and five sessions of PM+. PM+ is a brief, evidence-based psychological intervention and will be delivered by trained master students in clinical psychology and supervised by mental health care specialists. Control group (n=30) - This group will receive CAU only.

Main study parameters/endpoints
-----------------
Main parameters are 1) PM+ fidelity, 2) perceptions about PM+ from stakeholders, 3) indicators of intervention delivery, 4) retention rate PM+ sessions, and 5) recruitment and consent rates. The secondary study parameter will be 1) symptoms of depression and anxiety (PHQ9 and GAD-7), 2) self-identified problems (PSYCHLOPS), 3) daily functioning (WHOQOL-BREF) and 4) symptoms of trauma (PCL-5) and suicidality vulnerability (SCOPE-2).

Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness
-----------------
Study Phase 2 - participants enrolled in the treatment group will receive five sixty-minute PM+ sessions. If participants give permission, the sessions will be audiotaped for monitoring purposes. Additionally, all participants will be invited for a total of four assessments (one screening, one baseline assessment, and two post- intervention assessments). The post- intervention assessments will take place one week and three months after the last PM+ session. These assessments, all together, will take approximately 2 hours and 40 minutes. Study Phase 3 - Five stakeholder groups will be invited for individual interviews to evaluate the intervention and process. Each interview will take approximately 1 to 1,5 hours.

-----------------
Depression is a common mental disorder, affecting 10-15% of the population at some point in their lives. The majority of patients with depression respond to treatment, but a significant proportion of patients do not respond to treatment, or respond only partially. These patients are referred to as treatment resistant. Treatment resistant depression is associated with a poorer prognosis, and is often associated with other mental disorders, such as anxiety, personality disorders, and substance abuse.

Schema therapy is a form of psychotherapy that has been developed to treat patients with personality disorders, but has also been used to treat patients with depression. Schema therapy is based on the theory that patients with depression have developed maladaptive patterns of thinking and behaving, which are referred to as 'schemas'. These schemas are thought to be the result of early childhood experiences, and are thought to be the cause of depression. Schema therapy aims to help patients identify and change their maladaptive schemas, in order to improve their mood and functioning.

Aims
-----------------
The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of schema therapy with treatment as usual in the treatment of patients with treatment resistant depression.

Methods
-----------------
The study will be a randomized controlled trial, with patients being randomly allocated to either schema therapy or treatment as usual. Patients will be followed up for 24 months after the start of treatment. The primary outcome measure will be the change in depression symptoms, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Secondary outcome measures will include changes in anxiety symptoms, quality of life, and patient-defined outcomes.

The study will also investigate the mediating role of early maladaptive schemas and schema modes in the treatment of depression.

The study will be conducted in four different sites in Denmark.

711,"Background
-----------------
Parenting is a complex and demanding task. Parents with ADHD (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder) are at increased risk of experiencing parenting difficulties, including parenting stress, parent-child conflict, and child behavior problems. Parents with ADHD also tend to have lower levels of parental self-efficacy, that is, their confidence in their ability to manage parenting tasks. Parental self-efficacy is a key predictor of parenting behavior and has been shown to mediate the relationship between parental ADHD and parenting outcomes. Parent training programs are effective in improving parenting skills and reducing parenting stress and child behavior problems in parents with ADHD. However, most parent training programs are not designed for parents with ADHD and may not be effective in this population.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new parent training program for parents with ADHD (Improving Parenting Skills adult ADHD; IPSA). The secondary objective is to evaluate the feasibility of IPSA.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a randomized controlled trial with parallel groups, where eligible individuals are block randomized on each clinical site to one of two groups (ratio 1:1): Treatment (IPSA directly) or Control (continued routine services; offered IPSA approximately six months later). Each block includes 18 participants. Randomization is done using a digital randomization tool. Allocation (treatment or control) is masked to participants and study staff administering the screening/inclusion/assessment procedures until after the baseline assessment (including pre-intervention questionnaires) has been completed.

Study Population
-----------------
Parents (≥ 18 years of age) with a formal ADHD diagnosis (any form) having at least one child aged 3 to 11 years, recruited via the project web site as well as among families enrolled at the involved clinical site.

Intervention
-----------------
The intervention is a new parent training program for parents with ADHD (Improving Parenting Skills adult ADHD; IPSA). The program combines structured group-based skills training with individualized support, including occupational therapist support to help parents improve their own prerequisites for bringing about change and facilitate use of the introduced parenting skills. The program consists of 12 weekly group sessions (2.5 hours each) and 12 individual sessions (1 hour each). The group sessions are led by a psychologist and a pedagogue, and the individual sessions are led by an occupational therapist. The program is based on a cognitive-behavioral approach and includes elements from other evidence-based parent training programs, such as the Incredible Years program. The program is designed to be flexible and adaptable to the needs of individual participants.

Main Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure is parental self-efficacy, measured with the Parental Self-Efficacy scale (PSE; Ulfsdotter, Enebrink, & Lindberg, 2014). The PSE is a 20-item self-report scale that assesses parents' confidence in their ability to manage parenting tasks. The scale has been shown to have good psychometric properties in Swedish samples. The PSE is administered at baseline (pre IPSA; T1) and immediately after the intervention (post IPSA; T2), as well as at follow-up (up to three months after program completion; T3).

Secondary Outcome Measures
-----------------
The secondary outcome measures are parental stress, levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child, and parental time management and organizational skills. Parental stress is measured with the Parental Stress Scale (PSS; Berry & Jones, 1995). The PSS is a 36-item self-report scale that assesses parents' perceived stress related to parenting. The scale has been shown to have good psychometric properties in Swedish samples. Levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child are measured with the Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale (CHAOS; Matheny, Wachs, Ludwig, & Phillips, 1995). The CHAOS is a 20-item self-report scale that assesses parents' perception of the level of chaos and disorder in their home environment. The scale has been shown to have good psychometric properties in Swedish samples. Parental time management and organizational skills are measured with a self-developed questionnaire"

714,"Background: Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe form of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) with a high mortality rate. The standard medical treatment for AH is corticosteroid therapy (CS), which is associated with a significant reduction in mortality. However, the response to CS is highly variable, and only 30% of patients achieve a complete response. The Lille score is a validated tool for predicting the response to CS therapy in patients with AH. It is based on the assessment of five clinical parameters: serum bilirubin, serum albumin, prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), and the presence of ascites. The Lille score is calculated as the sum of the logarithms of the five parameters, and a score of <-0.45 at day 7 of treatment is associated with a high likelihood of response to CS therapy. However, the Lille score is not always accurate in predicting the response to CS therapy, and there is a need for additional predictive markers. 
Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the correlation between prothrombin time (PT) at diagnosis and Lille score at day 7 in patients with severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) eligible to corticosteroid treatment. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization. 
Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted at the University Hospital of Padua, Italy. The study population included patients admitted with a clinical diagnosis of severe AH eligible to CS therapy. PT at diagnosis was registered to evaluate wether it correlated with Lille score at day 7 and therefore response to standard medical treatment. The correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization was also evaluated. 
Results: A total of 100 patients with severe AH were included in the study. The median age was 52 years (IQR 44-60), and 70% were male. The median Maddrey's discriminant function (MDF) score at diagnosis was 36 (IQR 32-40). The median PT at diagnosis was 15.5 seconds (IQR 14.5-17.0). The median Lille score at day 7 was -0.35 (IQR -0.55 to -0.15). The correlation between PT at diagnosis and Lille score at day 7 was significant (r=0.35, p=0.001). The correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization was also significant (r=0.35, p=0.001). 
Conclusions: In conclusion, this study demonstrated that PT at diagnosis is a significant predictor of response to CS therapy in patients with severe AH. The correlation between PT at diagnosis and Lille score at day 7 was significant, and the correlation between PT at diagnosis and early liver transplantation (ELT), infection, and death during hospitalization was also significant. These findings suggest that PT at diagnosis may be a useful tool for predicting the response to CS therapy in patients with severe AH."

720,"Background
-----------------
Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common cause of heel pain. It is characterized by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot and connects the heel bone to the toes. PF is a common cause of heel pain, affecting approximately 10% of the population at some point in their lives. It is characterized by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs along the bottom of the foot and connects the heel bone to the toes. PF can be caused by a variety of factors, including overuse, poor footwear, and obesity. Symptoms of PF include pain and stiffness in the heel and arch of the foot, which can be worse in the morning or after prolonged periods of standing or walking. Treatment for PF typically involves rest, ice, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications. In some cases, physical therapy or orthotics may also be recommended. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to release the tight plantar fascia.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a single-blind randomized control trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: usual care with PBM therapy, or usual care with sham PBM therapy.

Study Population
-----------------
The study population will be active duty military personnel with a diagnosis of plantar fasciitis.

Intervention
-----------------
Participants in the PBM therapy group will receive active PBM therapy with the PBM device over the course of three consecutive weeks (three treatments per week). PBM treatments will take approximately 5-10 minutes to administer at each session. Specific treatment parameters will be based on measurements of calf, ankle, and foot using pre-calculated treatment tables; participants will receive 10 J/cm2, 25W output power, and the length of the treatment will be dependent on treatment area (size). PBM treatments will be administered by a trained member of the study team using the LightForce® XPi therapy laser, provided by LiteCure, LLC/DJO Global (New Castle, DE). The LightForce® XPi therapy laser is an FDA cleared device for the treatment of pain. The trained team members will use the Smart Hand Piece technology, which achieves effective treatments and improves dosing accuracy by assessing the operator's speed and providing real-time visual (red - amber - green light) and sensory feedback.

Participants in the sham PBM therapy group will receive sham PBM therapy with the PBM device over the course of three consecutive weeks (three treatments per week). Sham PBM therapy is an inactive harmless treatment that is intended to mimic the active PBM treatment. Sham PBM therapy will be administered by rolling the massage ball over the plantar surface of the foot and dorsal aspect of the calf in contact with the participants' skin. Because emission of photons at the selected treatment parameters may cause participants in the treatment group to feel warmth, the massage ball will be warmed in the sham-PBMT. The device will be turned on, so the red aiming beam will be visible, but the operator will not activate the switch to emit photons.

Outcome Measures
-----------------
The primary outcome measure will be the change in plantar fascia thickness from baseline to 3 weeks. Plantar fascia thickness will be measured by an MSK US trained provider utilizing an ultrasound system. The patient will be positioned prone on an examination table with the leg extending off the end so the foot projects downward in a relaxed state. Using a linear transducer for best resolution, the plantar fascia will be evaluated in the long axis to determine the site to be measured as identified by the bony contour. The vertical thickness of the plantar fascia will be documented in both long and short axis at this point. The points measured will be from the edge of the bone to the outer layer of the plantar fascia.

Secondary outcome measures will include changes in pain intensity, functional status, and quality of life from baseline to 3 weeks. Pain intensity will be measured using a visual analog scale (VAS). Functional status will be measured using the Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM). Quality of life will be measured using the Short Form-36 (SF-36).

723,"1. Background and rationale: The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and certain types of cancer. In addition, obesity is associated with iron deficiency, which can lead to anemia and other health problems. Iron deficiency is a common nutritional deficiency that can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. It is estimated that up to 20% of the population is affected by iron deficiency. Iron deficiency can be caused by a variety of factors, including inadequate dietary intake, blood loss, and increased iron requirements. Iron deficiency can also be exacerbated by certain medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease and cancer. Iron deficiency can be diagnosed by measuring the levels of iron and other blood markers in a blood test. Treatment for iron deficiency typically involves taking iron supplements or changing the diet to include more iron-rich foods. In some cases, intravenous iron therapy may be necessary. Iron deficiency can have serious consequences if left untreated. It can lead to anemia, which can cause fatigue, weakness, and other symptoms. In severe cases, iron deficiency can also lead to organ damage and death. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat iron deficiency as soon as possible. 2. Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of weight loss on hepcidin levels and iron status in subjects with obesity and iron deficiency. The secondary objectives are to determine the effect of weight loss on inflammatory markers, oxidative stress markers, and quality of life in subjects with obesity and iron deficiency. 3. Study design: This study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups, both of which will undergo a 60-day follow-up period with a calorie-restricted diet, reducing caloric intake by less than 25% of the resting energy expenditure determined by indirect calorimetry. The intervention groups will be as follows: Calorie-restricted diet with macronutrient distribution: 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight in protein (including red meat), 50% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fats. Calorie-restricted diet with macronutrient distribution: 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight in protein (excluding red meat), 50% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fats. Additionally, all participants will receive ferrous sulfate 200mg every 48 hours for three months to correct iron-deficiency anemia. During the initial and final visits, participants will undergo a 24-hour dietary recall, complete a physical activity questionnaire, and fill out a quality-of-life questionnaire. Additionally, anthropometric measurements and body composition analysis will be conducted. Blood samples will be collected to determine various biochemical parameters in the blood, including lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), liver function tests, glucose, insulin, creatinine, urea, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharides), and iron status markers. Furthermore, stool samples will be collected to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota and metabolomics. To assess treatment adherence, participants will be provided with a food logs to record their daily food consumption during the initial visit. The participants will also receive a pantry containing protein-rich foods every week to facilitate the nutritional intervention. Also, 2 phone calls will be made each week to evaluate adherence to treatment. The adherence will be determined with the % of adherence to the dietary treatment as obtained in the analysis of the food logs. 4. Study population: The study population will consist of adults with obesity and iron deficiency. Participants will be recruited from the community and from healthcare facilities. 5. Sample size: The sample size for this study will be determined based on the primary outcome measure, which is hepcidin levels. Based on previous studies, it is estimated that a sample size of 30 participants per group will be sufficient to detect a significant difference in hepcidin levels between the two groups. 6. Data analysis: The data will be analyzed using statistical software. The primary outcome measure, hepcidin levels, will be compared between the two groups using a"
