95,"The Scottish Stroke Improvement Programme identifies stroke as the most common cause of severe physical disability amongst Scottish adults. Hospital care for these patients accounts for 7% of all NHS beds and 5% of the entire NHS budget. The number of strokes across the UK is projected to increase by 60% between 2015 and 2035. Rehabilitation delivered by a multi-disciplinary team including Allied Health Professionals (occupational therapists [OT's], physiotherapists [PT's], and speech and language therapists [SLT's]) is known to improve functional recovery after stroke, particularly if it can be applied intensively and within enriched, stimulating environments. However, a large gap exists between the minimum recommendations for stroke rehabilitation (three hours of multidisciplinary therapy a day, at least 5 days out of 7) and what the NHS are currently able to provide, given the majority of in-patient stroke units are operating below the staffing levels recommended in national clinical guidelines, and are therefore challenged to provide the amount of therapy to facilitate optimum recovery for stroke patients. An analysis of data from the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme found, on average, patients who required specific therapy following stroke received around 14 minutes of PT, 13 minutes of OT, and 7 minutes of SLT per day of inpatient stay. Therefore, new and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity. Commercially available technology, such as robotics, adapted treadmills, virtual reality, and mobile digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors, have been shown to be a safe and feasible method of increasing rehabilitation intensity, under the prescription and supervision of therapy staff. Despite the potential offered by rehabilitation technology to help deliver evidence-based levels of practice intensity and automated feedback without additional labour costs, currently few technologies have been adopted into everyday rehabilitation. A well-established research group at the University of Strathclyde (UoS) Biomedical Engineering department have been developing and testing a technology-based, holistic model as a possible solution to the gap between clinical need and current provision.

The study aims to develop a novel biomarker for response and prognosis of HBV-related HCC patients undergoing RT. The investigators will use previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status. The investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns. The true value of this novel HBV chimera vh-DNA will be revealed. The results will also support the consolidative use of personalized vh-DNA for earlier evaluating treatment response after RT, for post-RT disease monitoring, and for differentiating clonality at recurrence to design future clinical trial on combinational treatment."

406,"The OptimizeD study is a randomized controlled trial that aims to determine whether different patients respond differentially to brief psychological treatment or a widely used generic SSRI and, if so, whether one can optimize outcomes in a cost-effective fashion for primary care patients with moderate to severe depression. The study has two specific aims and two exploratory aims: Specific Aim 1 (Clinical and Functional Outcomes): To evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a precision treatment rule (PTR) on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either psychotherapy based on behavioral activation called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) or antidepressant medication (fluoxetine). The study will use machine learning to develop the PTR, using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not. Specific Aim 2 (Cost-effectiveness Outcomes): To assess the costs of optimal vs. non-optimal treatments and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing relative costs and effectiveness between those who were randomly allocated to their optimal treatment with those who were randomly allocated to a non-optimal treatment, based on the PTR developed in Aim 1. The investigators hypothesize that optimizing will be more cost-effective than not. Exploratory Aim 1 (Mediators): To explore whether one can use the PTR to make our tests of mediation more precise. Patients who respond differentially to different treatments adhere to different causal mechanisms, and inclusion of the PTR in interaction terms with the purported mediators should facilitate the detection of moderated mediation among patients who show specificity of response. The investigators will also consider whether treatment-related factors (e.g., adherence, quality) act as mediators of the effects of each treatment on remission and recovery. This exploratory aim will offer insights into mechanisms of action for each treatment. Exploratory Aim 2 (Genetic Predictors): To explore whether polygenic risk scores and other biomarkers can enhance the prediction of both general and differential response to either treatment."

453,"The study aims to investigate the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks in visual prosthesis patients. The study will involve basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH) designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when using an external computer to directly specify pulse trains (e.g., send a 1 s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12 of an Argus II implant). Important parameters for safety include a) pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), b) charge density should be limited. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust to extremely high rates of stimulation and high current levels.

This is an observational cohort study using MRI to measure gastrointestinal (GI) function, lung structure and function and liver endpoints in children with CF aged 6 to 11 years. The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study (NCT04618185) to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint.

The study aims to develop a pharmacodynamic model for propofol in older adults. The model will use the pharmacokinetic parameters of the Eleveld model and new pharmacodynamic parameters derived from frontal EEG in a population older than 65 years. The hypothesis is that the Eleveld PKPD model, modified with this new pharmacodynamic parameter, will predict better the hypnotic effect of propofol than the original Eleveld PKPD model, in adult patients older than 65 years. The creation of a PKPD model of propofol for the population over 65 years of age would allow a better titration of this drug to avoid possible deleterious effects secondary to its under or overdosage. The study will measure the performance error, median absolute performance error, median prediction error, time of loss of response, time of burst-suppression, time of return of response, and time of return of response."

869,"This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of peer-mediated pivotal response training (PRT) in improving socialization experiences for children with language impairment who are isolated from the classroom social network. The study uses an randomized controlled trial design with 12 classrooms assigned to the treatment condition and 13 to the control condition. Within each classroom, the focal participants are children isolated from their classroom social network with low pragmatic language skills. The primary approach to treatment for focal children is described here. Specifically, focal children in classrooms randomized to the treatment condition receive peer-mediated pivotal response training (PRT) per procedures detailed by Brock et al.. PRT procedures are facilitated by a classroom facilitator-a classroom teacher or teaching assistant-who receives ongoing training and support from research staff. First, investigators provide a one-on-one 1-h training session for each facilitator that focuses on how to identify, initially train, and then support peers on a day-to-day basis during center time. Second, investigators partner with the facilitator to identify two peers who (a) demonstrate good social skills; (b) respond well to adult directions; (c) have consistent attendance; and (d) do not have a history of negative interactions with the target student. The facilitator explicitly identifies the focal child (buddy) and asks the children to use three strategies to play with the buddy during center time: (a) offer your buddy some play options; (b) show and talk about how to play with your buddy; (c) compliment your buddy; and (d) show your buddy how to take turns. At each training session the facilitator describes one strategy, provides examples, and has peers practice the strategy through role play. After trainings, the facilitator provides ongoing support during center time to implement the strategies over 12 weeks during months 3-6 of the 9 months of study participation. The study measures the preschool language screener 5 (PLS-5) and developmental pragmatic profile (DPP) at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months. The study also measures teacher-child rating scale (TCRS), peer incoming talk, peer outgoing talk, and peer interactions at baseline, 3 months, and 9 months."

The study aims to measure non-invasively, easily and reliably the variations of cerebral perfusion in patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors during controlled variations performed during routine care to adjust the blood pressure level within the recommended safety standards during general anesthesia. The setting of the optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) level will be achieved within the ranges of values commonly used, taking into account the patient's cardiovascular comorbidities. The main objective is to identify a significant linear relationship between the percentage change in mean velocity (Vm) and the percentage change in the 95% spectral frequency front (SEF95) during the MAP change. Cerebral perfusion and cerebral O2 adequacy will be compared and assessed by continuous and simultaneous measurements of cerebral blood flow by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral O2 adequacy by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a brain function parameter by intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) - frontal EEG. The classification of patients in the cardiovascular risk group will be determined in addition to their history and treatment by an arterial stiffness parameter (pulse wave velocity) measured non-invasively before and during the protocol by MESI mTablet automatic digital sphygmomanometer (MESI ltd, Slovenia). The objective for a given patient is to look for a possible threshold value of pressure that could impact the blood flow velocity (Doppler) and possibly the EEG and cerebral oximetry.

The Critical Time Intervention-Peer Support (CTI-PS) is a 9-month intervention delivered by Community Mental Health Workers (CMHWs) and Peer Support Workers (PSWs) to individuals with psychotic disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaffective disorder who have been discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in the month prior to recruitment. The intervention has two broad objectives: 1) to collaborate with participants to develop durable connections to support systems, including both formal and informal supports, and 2) to provide practical and emotional support, helping the individual to overcome a critical period of transition during which they can feel especially vulnerable. The work of CTI-PS will focus on areas identified as crucial for strengthening the individual's continuum of services and forming enduring links with their community supports. The phases of CTI are Initiation, Try-Out, and Transfer of Care. The PSW-CMHW will collaborate with the participants to identify barriers to their recovery and develop a sustainable plan to engage in and use community supports and resources during and after CTI. They will also use their knowledge to increase participants' autonomy, strengthen their connection to health services, and expand their support networks. The role of CTI workers is specifically designed to avoid becoming the primary source of care for the individual. The study aims to measure the effectiveness of the CTI-PS model for individuals with serious mental illness discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Portugal. The primary outcome measures are health-related quality of life, assessed by the WHO Quality of Life Scale - Brief Version (WHOQOL-BREF), and unmet needs, assessed by the Camberwell Assessment of Need (CAN).
