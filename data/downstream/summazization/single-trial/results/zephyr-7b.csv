Study Overview

Detailed Description
-----------------
Chronic pain (CP), defined as pain lasting more than 3 months, is a substantial healthcare challenge. Prevalence rates of CP are between 11% and 40% (Dahlhamer et al., 2018; Fayaz et al., 2016). CP prevalence increases with age, is greater among females, and among people with lower socioeconomic status (Tsang et al., 2008; Pergolizzi et al., 2013). CP affects relationships and self-esteem, and is associated with higher divorce and suicide rates, and an increased risk of substance abuse (Tang et al., 2016; Fitzcharles et al., 2021), psychopathology (Katz et al., 2015) and risk of medication overuse (Westergaard et al., 2015). The causes of CP are still poorly understood. Recently, the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP, 2017) has proposed that three subtypes of CP may be differentiated based on unique causal mechanisms: nociceptive, neuropathic, and nociplastic. Nociplastic Pain (NP) is a new descriptor of CP and includes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. NP should be viewed as an overarching term that can be applied to a diverse range of clinical conditions that share common neurophysiological mechanisms, involving various organ systems (Galli, 2023). Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020; Fitzcharles et al., 2021). NP is usually accompanied by other central nervous system-associated symptoms with a close link with clinical psychological factors: general symptoms (e.g., fatigue and cognitive problems), temperamental characteristics (e.g., hypersensitivity to environmental stimuli) and psychological symptoms (e.g., anxiety/depression) (Fitzcharles et al., 2021). Many emotional states, such as depression and anxiety, and emotional processes, such as emotional awareness and regulation, may influence the presence and severity of NP (Aaron et al., 2020; Lumley et al., 2021), opening to the importance of a psychological assessment for diagnosis and psychological interventions. The concept of NP opens a new framework for understanding the co-occurrence of different chronic disorders and the role of related psychological factors. Comorbid chronic disorders may be the expression of shared pathophysiological mechanisms, with etiological and psychological features differentiating them by pure forms of the same disease. The comorbid association of migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia, and the well-known link with clinical psychological factors (e.g., early traumatic events, anxiety and depression, alexithymia, dissociation, etc.) is quite established (Bergeron et al., 2020; Fitzcharles et al., 2021). However, these chronic pain disorders have been usually studied as separate diseases. On the one hand, this research project wants to observe the common basis of these chronic pain disorders, which can be traced back to central sensitization mechanisms, the influence of early adverse events, and other psychological factors, and on the other hand it wants to observe the psychosocial peculiarities of each assessed condition (fibromyalgia, migraine, and vulvodynia) for tailored treatment purposes. CHRONIC MIGRAINE (CM) Migraine affects  15% of the general population globally and is typically characterized by recurring, often highly disabling attacks of severe headache, nausea, vomiting, super- sensitivity to light and sound, and other variable physical, mental, and psychological signs and symptoms, lasting for 4-72 h (Ferrari et al., 2022). Migraine is listed by The Global Burden of Disease Study as the third most disabling disease worldwide (Vos et al., 2012). Most patients have episodic migraine, although some patients develop CM (the presence of ≥15 headache days per month). The 1- year prevalence of migraine is 8-15% worldwide, but is highly dependent on age, sex, and migraine subtype (Ferrari et al., 2015). Migraine is 40-60% determined by genetic factors and for the remainder by non- genetic risk- modulating and trigger factors. Although a progressive increase of the attack frequency can occur spontaneously, it is often aggravated and/or induced by overuse of acute headache medications and/or caffeine. Risk factors for migraine progression toward CM include high headache frequency, high headache-related disability, obesity, allodynia, anxiety, and depression (Ferrari et al., 2022). Comorbid migraine and anxiety/depression are common in the general population, but the mechanism(s) supporting the comorbidity are still unknown. Overall, there seems to be a bidirectional relationship between migraine and depression, and a shared pathophysiological mechanism has been recently outlined (Karsan & Goadsby, 2021). Indeed, in cohort studies, the risk of incident migraine in persons with existing major depression was threefold higher than in persons without depression, and incident major depression in persons with pre- existing migraine was more than fivefold higher than in persons without migraine history (Modgill et al., 2011). Comorbid anxiety/depression increases the risk of migraine chronification (Guidetti et al., 1998; Tietjen et al., 2007). However, there is no evidence that treating depression or anxiety mitigates migraine (Ferrari et al., 2022). Other psychological factors have been linked to migraine over time, as the case of alexithymia (Galli et al., 2017, Bottiroli et al., 2018), traumatic events (Bottiroli et al., 2019; Stensland et al., 2013), early episodes of maltreatment (Tietjen et al., 2016), personality characteristics (Bottiroli et al., 2016; 2021; Galli et al., 2019). FIBROMYALGIA (FM) FM is a chronic syndrome characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain associated with fatigue, nonrestorative sleep, and cognitive deficits (Wolfe et al., 2016) with high incidence among women (Branco et al., 2010). The prevalence of CP comorbidities among FM patients was also high ranging from 39% to 76% (with headache and irritable bowel syndrome that were the most prevalent). Although a central sensitization phenomenon seems to play a central role in FM (Arnold et al., 2016), the etiopathology of FM remains unknown (Thieme et al., 2017). For these reasons, researchers have proposed a biopsychosocial model of interacting variables that can activate and exacerbate FM symptoms (Sommer et al., 2012). FM patients experience excessive levels of psychological distress: 20-80% experience anxiety and 13-64% experience depression (Galvez-Sánchez et al., 2019). A recent systematic review on comorbidities in FM (Kleykamp et al., 2021) found that the most prevalent comorbidity across all studies reviewed was depression/major depressive disorder with over half of the patients included having this diagnosis in their lifetime. Another interesting personality construct involved in FM is 'distressed' personality (van Middendorp et al., 2016). Moreover, nearly one-third of FM patients had current or lifetime bipolar disorder, panic disorder, or post-traumatic stress disorder. Specifically, among environmental factors, stressful life events have been considered (Nakamura et al., 2014). Trauma and major life stress are unlikely to cause FM per se. In genetically susceptible persons, it is likely that early trauma and prolonged stress in adulthood will influence brain modulatory circuitry of both pain and emotions (Crofford, 2007; Schweinhardt et al., 2008) that could explain the increased pain responses and symptoms of patients with FM. Traumatic events have been shown to influence pain severity as well (Bote et al., 2013). Several theoretical models have suggested that some personality characteristics lead to a worse response to stressors and adjustment to diseases in people with CP, such as FM (Naylor et al., 2017; Galvez-Sánchez et al., 2019). A minority of studies have focused on the detection of personality disorders associated with FM (Attademo & Bernardini, 2018). In general, previous studies found a high prevalence of avoidance (41.4%), obsessive-compulsive (33.1%) and borderline personality disorder (5.2-27.4%) in FM (Thieme et al., 2004; Uguz et al., 2010; Gumà-Uriel et al., 2016). In recent years, many studies on FM have reported a high prevalence of alexithymia (15-20%) (Di Tella et al., 2017; Marchi et al., 2019; Atzeni et al., 2019). VULVODYNIA Vulvodynia is a condition that occurs in 8-10% of women of all ages (Arnold et al., 2007; Harlow et al., 2014) and is characterized by localized pain in the vulva, either spontaneous or upon touch, and can occur during sexual and/or non-sexual situations (Bergeron et al., 2020). Vulvodynia has a negative effect on the quality of life of women and their partners and imposes a profound personal and social economic burden. The diagnosis is established through a careful history and pelvic examination, including the cotton swab test, based on persistent vulvar pain lasting more than 3 months without an identifiable cause and with several potential associated factors. These include musculoskeletal and neurological factors, comorbid pain syndromes (such as fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, and irritable bowel syndrome) and psychosocial factors (Reed et al., 2012; Wesselmann et al., 2014; Bergeron et al., 2020). Current literature suggests that the onset and maintenance of vulvodynia likely involves a complex interplay of peripheral and central pain mechanisms, pelvic floor muscle and autonomic dysfunction, anxiety, depression, and adverse childhood events, as well as cognitive-affective, behavioral, and interpersonal factors (Bergeron et al., 2020). Vulvodynia has traditionally been conceptualized in a dualistic manner, arising from either physical factors or psychological and sexual difficulties, although research contrary to this concept and other hypotheses suggest that these two perspectives should be combined. Therefore, future studies should move in this direction, seeking to identify specific pathophysiological mechanisms within the framework of a biopsychosocial model. Indeed, a more recent theorization has focused on an integrated model that considers the interdependence of biopsychosocial factors in vulvodynia and associated disorders, in which medical and psychosocial mechanisms are considered to contribute to the onset, chronicization and exacerbation of pain and associated difficulties (Bergeron et al., 2011). The neurophysiology of vulvodynia is multifaceted. It is characterized by both peripheral and central sensory abnormalities (Wesselmann et al., 2014; Pukall et al., 2016). Furthermore, increased sensitivity to different sensory modalities at extragenital sites has been demonstrated in women with vulvodynia (Giesecke et al., 2004; Foster et al., 2005; Sutton et al., 2015), suggesting central sensitization. This central sensitization could explain the observation of overlapping chronic pain conditions in women with vulvodynia, which need further investigation to be better understood. PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS ASSOCIATED TO NP As the investigators have already pointed out separately for the three pathological conditions (chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia), there is evidence that factors such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may contribute significantly to the genesis of these disorders through a process of central sensitization of pain pathways. Central sensitization (CS) is defined as increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input according to the IASP - International Association for the Study of Pain (Arendt-Nielsen et al., 2018). A sensitized nervous system has been considered one of the most important mechanisms involved in NP (Cohen, 2022). CS plays a role in fibromyalgia, in which alteration of central nociceptive processing occurs and pain can be worsened by psychological factors (Sluka & Clauw, 2016). In migraine, CS may contribute to acute allodynia and headache chronification (De Tommaso & Sciruicchio, 2016). Furthermore, in migraine CS may play a role in trigeminal nerve activation and cortical spreading depression (De Tommaso & Sciruicchio, 2016). It has been suggested that migraine may be considered as a brain state of altered excitability and a disorder of sensory processing (Goadsby et al., 2017), encompassing additional symptoms as fatigue and mood disorders (Karsan & Goadsby, 2021). Structural and functional MRI studies in women with provoked vulvar or distant/extra- genital pain have supported a role of central sensitization and dysregulation of endogenous pain modulatory systems in the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020). In the process of central sensitization, psychological factors such as traumatic events in childhood, the development of specific personality expressions (traits), and the use of different forms of defense mechanisms also play a role. No study to our knowledge has yet tried to identify specific clusters of psychological factors (personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences) capable of characterizing or differentiating between the different pathologies expressed by a NP. In addition to this, the study of psychosocial factors associated with the experience of such pathologies or possible emerging clusters such as depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention tailored to the person. Aims To highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific to the onset and maintenance for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). Specifically, the observation of possible clusters will be made based on variables such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences. The hypothesis is that specific psychological factors (clusters of high number of early traumatic events, high levels of central sensitization, and specific traits and defense mechanisms) characterize FM, CM, and VU groups compared to controls.

Study Overview

Detailed Description
-----------------
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by insulin deficiency. T1DM is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. In the 10th Diabetes Atlas (2021) data of the International Diabetes Association (IDF), it is stated that the population of children aged 19 and under is 2.61 billion in the world, approximately 1.2 million of these children have T1DM, and there are approximately 150 thousand new children diagnosed with T1DM every year in the world. In the same report, it was stated that there are approximately 26 thousand children aged 19 and under with T1DM in Turkey. T1DM, whose treatment and management is complex, causes both children and their parents to encounter many problems. These problems cause deterioration in quality of life and perceived well-being in children with T1DM. The problems experienced in this direction, adaptation problems and decreased quality of life lead to deterioration of metabolic control in children with T1DM. Children with T1DM who cannot adapt to their disease may have acute and chronic complications that lead to deterioration of metabolic control. One of the most important complications seen in children with T1DM is osteopenia, which tends to increase gradually. Proper nutrition, physical activity, insulin therapy and follow-up of complications have an important place in preventing complications that may develop in children with T1DM, ensuring metabolic control and increasing their quality of life. Exercise in T1DM; reducing the need for insulin and increasing its effect, providing blood glucose control, increasing muscle strength, providing weight control, increasing body fat and muscle mass, increasing body fluid ratio, increasing bone mineralization, positively affecting the cardiovascular system, reducing blood fats, increasing self-conditioning, It provides many benefits such as increasing confidence and reducing stress. Despite the numerous benefits of exercise, studies have shown that children with T1DM do not exercise regularly and do not want to do traditional (walking, running, cycling, swimming, etc.) exercises. In this direction, exercise that requires continuity in diabetes management can be made dynamic for children with T1DM by using different approaches. For this reason, it is thought that structured exercise with augmented reality glasses (AR) that can respond to the reactions of the child with T1DM will be more dynamic and will prevent macrovascular complications such as osteopenia and increase the quality of life in children with T1DM by providing metabolic control.

Input Text: The Effect of Virtual Reality on Preoperative Anxiety Before Abdominal Surgery

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Questions to be Answered in the Study The questions expected to be answered in the study to be conducted to evaluate the effect of acupressure application on the anxiety level in the preoperative period in patients who will undergo abdominal surgery; What is the frequency of anxiety before abdominal surgery? What is the effect of virtual reality on anxiety management before abdominal surgery? Variables of the Research Preoperative anxiety scale/level Data Collection Tools Patient Information Form, VAS-A and a smart wristband with stress level measurement feature will be used to collect data. Form-1.Patient Information Form: It is a form consisting of sociodemographic questions created by the researchers. Form-2. Visual Anxiety Scale (VAS-A): The Numerical Anxiety Severity Scale consists of a horizontal line that begins with the expression 0 or no anxiety and ends with the expression 100 or severe anxiety. The patient is asked to choose the number that best describes the pain, between 0 and 100, by showing the scale. The result of the scale was evaluated over the arithmetic mean (Carr et al 2005; Kindler et al 2000). Smart Wristband: A smart wristband with photoplethysmography (PPG) feature that detects and reports stress-related changes will be used. After assessing whether the data fit the normal distribution with the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, if the data fit the normal distribution, parametric tests (Single Sample t-Test, One- and Multi-Way Analysis of Variance, Spearman's Correlation Analysis); if the data do not fit the normal distribution, non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskall Wallis Test, Friedman Test, Pearson's Correlation Analysis) will be used. Mean, standard deviation and percentage distribution methods will be used in the descriptive analysis of the data. The power of the sample will be calculated with the post hoc analysis to be made. The universe of the research; Between 01.03.2023 and 01.12.2023, all patients who will undergo abdominal surgery in the Trakya University Health Research Center General Surgery Clinic will form. The sample of the research; The sample will consist of individuals who meet the selection criteria and volunteer to participate in the research. Sample of the Study: Mosso et al. (2009) in the study titled Virtual reality on mobile phones to reduce anxiety in outpatient surgery in which the anxiety levels of patients who used virtual reality in the preoperative period were evaluated using VAS-A. Accordingly, the effect size was calculated as d=0.920. In the calculation of the sample size, using the G-Power (G-Power 3.1.9.7, Kiel, Germany) program, effect size d=0.920, margin of error=0.05, power (1-β err probe)=0.95, 32 patients were included in each group. needed was determined. Using this number; For the initiative group; 32 patients For the control group; 32 patients For the placebo group; The total number of patients to be sampled was planned to be 96, 32 patients.

Input Text: Determination of Compliance to Mediterranean Diet, Impacts on Walking and Quality of Life in Multiple Sclerosis

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Clinical studies examining the effects of various dietary patterns on MS are ongoing, and evidence is still lacking regarding the use of any specific dietary therapy for individuals with MS. In general, individuals living in high-income western countries where the disease is more common; They lead a sedentary life, are less exposed to sunlight, and are fed a high-energy diet rich in animal-derived saturated fats and refined sugar. The Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model that is universally thought to improve health, and it is known that the Mediterranean diet has beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.The major difference between the Mediterranean diet and the Western-style diet is the source and amount of dietary fat and carbohydrates. The Mediterranean diet is rich in foods containing monounsaturated fat (especially omega-3), antioxidant vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, C, E, folic acid, selenium, zinc, calcium), which are thought to have positive effects on the prevention and course of MS. Preferring vegetable oils instead of animal fats in Mediterranean type diet, preferring fish instead of red meat consumption, preferring low-fat / fat-free milk and dairy products, limiting the intake of simple sugar and refined carbohydrates, increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in pulp and antioxidants. It is thought that this type of nutrition may positively affect the course and treatment of immune diseases by reducing inflammation. Although there is no effective clinical evidence for the application of nutritional support as complementary therapy in MS patients, it is known that patients often use various nutritional supplements to reduce symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. It is also important to determine the frequency of current nutritional support use in order to prevent unconscious use of nutritional support in the group. Because the most common symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, individuals with MS are often less physically active than age-matched adults All these negativities result in decreased functional activities, loss of mobility and balance problems. Walking and, in a broader sense, mobility are functions that are frequently affected in MS and have a high negative impact on quality of life. Gait problems are not uncommon in MS, and it is reported that a significant portion of individuals in this group are adversely affected by their daily living activities. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters.

Input Text: Use of Continuous Glucose Monitoring Devices Among People Living With Type 1 Diabetes in South Africa

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
3 Study Design As this study is a PrCT the study aspects will be embedded in the normal clinical care delivery of diabetes care in the selected clinics (see section 3.2, Scientific Rational for Selection of Study Design). Introducing only 1 additional clinic visit and 1 additional qualitative visit for study related procedures. The primary outcome measure, HbA1c, will be assessed through the HbA1c testing that is already used in these clinics. It is important to note that the type of HbA1c test (i.e.: laboratory-based vs point-of-care) per participant must remain constant during the study, this is because of variability of performance between various HbA1c testing platforms. 3.1 General Design This is a three-arm pragmatic randomized control study. The expected duration of study participants involvement in the study is 15 months, this consists of 9 months of intervention with a follow up visit 6 months post the last interventional study visit. There will be 6 total study visits for all participants. Arm 1 is those participants randomized to use of CGM in a continuous fashion; CGM use for the duration of 9 months. Arm 2 is those participants randomized to intermittent use of CGM; CGM use for 4 time points consisting of 2 weeks of CGM use each, for the duration of 9 months. Arm 3 is those participants randomized to standard of care; regular use of self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) for the duration of 9 months. For all participants the first study visit will consist of: Enrolment including ICF, Baseline surveys including demographics, the Glucose Monitoring Satisfaction Survey (GMSS-T1D), HRQOL surveys, and diabetes distress score survey. Randomized assignment to study arm, Blood draw for HbA1c testing (if not already done in the previous 1 month). Those participants randomized to Arm 1 and Arm 2 will receive an education session on the CGM, be provided with the CGM, and be guided how to self-apply the CGM during enrolment visit. During all Study Follow Up visits participants will have blood drawn for HbA1c testing, complete a brief survey to capture any hospitalizations and/or hypoglycaemic events related to diabetes complications that occurred between study visits. Additionally, during Study Follow up visit C participants will complete the Glucose Monitoring Satisfaction Survey (GMSS-T1D), diabetes distress score survey, and an acceptability survey. During Study Follow up visit D, participants will complete the HRQOL surveys and diabetes distress score survey. During Study Follow up visit E participants will complete the Glucose Monitoring Satisfaction Survey (GMSS-T1D), diabetes distress score survey, and HRQOL surveys. Detailed explanation of the study visits per arm are outlined below by arm in section 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3 Qualitative methods used across all arms will consist of focus group discussions (FGDs) among the participants and caregivers of participants. Approximately 15 participants above the age of 18 years old will be selected from each arm (n=45, 3 FGD in total) and approximately 15 participants age range of 11 to 17 years old will be selected from each arm (n=45, 3 FGD in total) to participate in arm specific FGD to take place 30 to 35 weeks after study enrolment started. These FGDs will focus on understanding participant perceptions towards their current glucose monitoring devices and quality of life. To capture the perspectives of care givers of children and adolescents living with T1 diabetes 15 caregivers will be selected from each arm (n=45, 3 FGD in total) to participate in arm specific FGDs to take place 30 to 35 weeks after study enrolment started. These FGDs will focus on understanding care giver perspectives towards their minor's glucose monitoring devices and quality of life from the perspective of the care giver as well as their perceptions towards the quality of life for their minor. Qualitative methods will also be used to gather perceptions from the healthcare providers regarding their perceptions surrounding the feasibility and acceptability of use of CGMs in their settings. This will consist of a semi-structured interviews (SSI) of selected HCW (n=10 total) to be conducted after week 36 after study enrolment started. 3.1.1 Arm 1 Continuous use of CGM For those in Arm 1 there will be 6 study visits for all participants. There will be an additional visit for a FGD among a subset of participants. Enrolment visit: For those randomized to Arm 1 they will receive an education session on the CGM, be provided with the CGM, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing (where this is standard of care) and be guided how to self-apply the CGM during enrolment visit. Study Follow up A: The second study visit will take place 1 week after the enrolment visit. During this second visit the participant will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the first week. Participants in Arm 1 will be provided with 6 additional CGMs to continually use the CGM devices until their third study visit (Study Follow up B) to take place 12 weeks after enrolment. Study Follow up B: At the third study visit participants will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the period of time in between second study visit and current, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing, and the participant will be provided with 6 additional CGMS such that they continually use the CGM devices until their fourth study visit (Study Follow up C) to take place at 24 weeks after enrolment. Study Follow up C: At the fourth study visit participants will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the period of time in between third study visit and current, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing, and the participant will be provided with 6 additional CGMS such that the continually use the CGM devices until their fifth study visit (Study Follow up D) to take place at 36 weeks after enrolment. Study Follow up D: At the fifth study visit participants will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the period in between fourth study visit and current, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing and the participant will be provided with 1 additional CGM to use for the week following Study follow up C. Study Follow up E: At the sixth and final study visit which takes place at 58 weeks after enrolment study participants will see the clinician and blood will be drawn for HbA1c. 3.1.2 Arm 2 Intermittent use of CGM For those in Arm 2 there will be 6 study visits for all participants. There will be an additional visit for a FGD among a subset of participants. Enrolment visit: For those randomized to Arm 2 they will receive an education session on the CGM, be provided with the CGM, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing, and be guided how to self-apply the CGM during enrolment visit. Study Follow up A: The second study visit will take place 1 week after the enrolment visit. During this second visit the participant will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the first week. During Study follow up A participants in Arm 2 will be provided 1 CGM to use starting 1 week before their third study visit (Study Follow up B) to take place at 12 weeks after enrolment. Study Follow up B: At the third study visit participants will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the preceding week before Study follow up A, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing, and the participant will be provided with 1 additional CGM such that the participant uses the CGM for the week directly following Study follow up A and 1 week before their fourth study visit (Study Follow up C) to take place at 24 weeks after enrolment. Study Follow up C: At the fourth study visit participants will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the preceding week before Study follow up B, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing, and the participant will be provided with 1 additional CGM such that the participant uses the CGM for the week directly following Study follow up A, and 1 week before their fifth study visit (Study Follow up D) to take place 36 weeks after enrolment. Study Follow up D: At the fifth study visit participants will see the clinician and review the CGM data from the week preceding Study Follow up D, blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing and the participant will be provided with 1 additional CGM to use for the week following Study follow up D. Study Follow up E: At the sixth and final study visit which takes place at 58 weeks after enrolment study participants will see the clinicals and blood will be drawn for HbA1c. 3.1.3 Arm 3 Standard of Care For those in Arm 3 there will be 6 study visits for all participants. There will be an additional visit for a FGD among a subset of participants. Participants will follow the standard of care at each clinic. Enrolment visit: Those participants randomized to Arm 3 will undergo blood drawn for HbA1c testing. Study Follow up A: The second visit will take place 1 week after the enrolment visit. Participants will see their clinician at the enrolment visit as per SoC Study Follow up B: The third study visit will take place at 12 weeks after enrolment, participants will see the clinician as per SoC. Blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing. Study Follow up C: The fourth study visit will take place at 24 weeks after enrolment. participants will see the clinician as per SoC. Blood will be drawn for HbA1c testing. Study Follow up D: The fifth study visit will take place at the end of 35 weeks after enrolment. Participants will see the clinician as per SoC. Blood will be drawn for HbA1c. Study Follow up E: The sixth and final study visit will take place at 58 weeks after enrolment. participants will see the clinician as per SoC. Blood will be drawn for HbA1c. After completion of study participation, those in Arm 3 will be offered 1 CGM to use such that they can experience CGM use. Those participants who accept the CGM will be provided with an education session on CGM use before application. 3.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design As this study intendeds to generate evidence to inform policy and decision makers on the potential benefits of use of CGM in South Africa a pragmatic, rather than an explanatory, randomized control study design was selected [9]. A PrCT design was selected as the study aims to understand the impact of CGM use in as close to real world settings as possible. A classically designed randomized control trial with overly strict study criteria and processes may lead results that are not directly translatable to real world experience, while a classical RCT may have strong internal validity often RCTs are criticized for a lack of external validity, therefore a PrCT design was selected to balance internal and external validity [12]. A PrCT design may provide more realistic effect size estimates and enhance translation of research findings into clinical practice.

Unlike traditional finger prick self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG), CGM devices provide continuous and real-time glucose readings throughout the day and night. CGM systems consist of a small sensor that is inserted under the skin to measure glucose levels in the interstitial fluid, a transmitter that sends the glucose data to a receiver or smartphone, which shows the glucose readings. The sensor measures glucose levels automatically at regular intervals, eliminating the need for frequent finger pricks. CGM devices can track glucose trends, identify high or low glucose levels, and provide alerts for hypo- or hyperglycemia. This can help individuals make more informed decisions regarding their diabetes management, such as adjusting insulin doses, dietary choices, or physical activity levels.<br>* Other names: Freestyle Libre Abbott;|

Summary: 

This clinical trial is a single-arm study investigating the effectiveness of fractionated stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SBRT) with a focal boost on the dominant lesion (DIL) in patients with intermediate or high-risk localized prostate cancer. The study aims to evaluate biochemical progression-free survival and local control at 3 and 12 months, respectively. The study also assesses acute and late urinary and rectal treatment-related adverse events using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v5.0 scale, as well as patient-reported outcomes and quality of life using the EPIC-26 short form. The study is open to male participants aged 18 years and above with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate, intermediate or high-risk disease, and visible DIL on mpMRI. The study excludes participants with previous surgery at the prostate level, unresolved prostatitis, or distant metastases. The intervention consists of SBRT delivered to a dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy to the entire prostate (including seminal vesicles) using volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), with a simultaneous integrated focal boost (SIB) up to 50 Gy in 5 sessions to the mpMRI identified DIL. Daily image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) with cone beam CT and intrafraction gold-seeds fiducial tracking is also employed."
