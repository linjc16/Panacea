The primary outcomes will include pain intensity, disability, perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting, and the global perceived effect. Secondary outcomes will include a post-intervention questionnaire. The study will provide evidence-based practice for reducing LBP and musculoskeletal discomfort in young people."
995,"A clinical trial is being conducted to evaluate the performance and safety of tocopherol acetate (vitamin E) administered vaginally in pre-peri and postmenopausal women. The trial aims to assess the effects of tocopherol on the acidity of vaginal secretions, vaginal mucosa dryness, mucosal integrity, mucosa pallor, quantity of vaginal discharge, whiff test results, lactobacillus grade, microbiological evaluation, and adverse events. The study will be conducted over a period of 14 days, and various measures will be taken to evaluate the outcomes."
996,"This clinical trial aims to investigate the hematocrit to hemoglobin ratio and red blood cell distribution width in patients with polycythemia vera and secondary erythrocytosis. The study will collect data on clinical manifestations, history of thrombosis, and various investigations including complete blood picture, serum uric acid, JAK2V617F mutation status, and bone marrow aspiration and biopsy. Patients with secondary erythrocytosis will be included as controls. The primary outcome measures include the hematocrit to hemoglobin ratio and red blood cell distribution width in both groups. The study will be conducted from December 2022 to September 2023."
997,"This clinical trial aims to determine the effect of perfusion index (PI) measurement on emergency triage classification in patients with dyspnea. Adult patients presenting with dyspnea had their PI values measured using the Masimo Radical-7 device at admission, one hour after admission, and two hours after admission. The study compares the PI and oxygen saturation measurements obtained from finger probes, and evaluates their superiority in determining emergency triage classification. The study design is a single group assignment with no masking. The primary outcome measures include the use of PI for determining triage status at different time frames after admission. The study keywords include dyspnea, emergency, perfusion index, and triage."
998,"This clinical trial, titled ""Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) in Palliative Care,"" aims to investigate the effects of LSD on various aspects of palliative care, including pain, anxiety, depression, demoralization, psychological distress, quality of life, caregiver burden, fear of death, and existential distress. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, active-placebo controlled Phase II trial. Participants must be at least 25 years old and have a life expectancy between 12 weeks and 2 years. They will receive either LSD or an active placebo and will be assessed using various questionnaires and measurements to evaluate outcomes such as changes in state anxiety, pain levels, opioid use, spiritual well-being, demoralization, and quality of life. Adverse events and vital signs will also be monitored throughout the study."
999,"The clinical trial is titled ""Teaching by Texting to Promote Health Behaviours in Pregnancy"" and focuses on pregnant individuals. The study aims to compare the effects of SmartMom text messaging intervention with control text messaging intervention on various outcomes related to pregnancy. The participants will be assigned to either the SmartMom messaging group or the control messaging group. The primary outcome measures include changes in weight during pregnancy and attendance at prenatal care visits. Secondary outcome measures include changes in health knowledge, health literacy, fear of childbirth, depression, anxiety, changes in substance use, rates of planned vaginal birth after cesarean, rates of exclusive breastfeeding, rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and incremental costs per incidence of suboptimal weight gain and inadequate prenatal care avoided. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with parallel assignment and has an open-label design. The participants will receive text messages either with evidence-based information to promote healthy behaviors during pregnancy (SmartMom group) or with general information about pregnancy (control group). The study will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of text messaging interventions in promoting health behaviors during pregnancy."
