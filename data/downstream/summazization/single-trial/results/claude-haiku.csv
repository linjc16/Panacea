0,"The study aims to identify specific psychological clusters of variables, including personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences, that characterize and differentiate chronic migraine (CM), fibromyalgia (FM), and vulvodynia (VU) compared to healthy controls. 

The study will assess these psychological factors using self-report questionnaires in four groups: women diagnosed with CM, FM, VU, and healthy controls. The primary outcome measures include the Central Sensitivity Index, Traumatic Experiences Index, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, and environmental sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include psychological symptoms, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and genital/pelvic pain.

The hypothesis is that specific psychological factor clusters, such as high levels of early traumatic events, central sensitization, and particular personality traits and defense mechanisms, will characterize the CM, FM, and VU groups compared to controls. The study aims to identify these unique psychological profiles for each chronic pain condition to inform tailored clinical interventions."
1,"This clinical trial aimed to compare the pressure ulcer prevention effects of two different mattresses used in bedridden patients. The study involved two groups: Group I received a massage mattress with a cube/block system, while Group II received a standard viscoelastic pressure sore prevention mattress. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients without pressure ulcers, assessed over a 4-week period. Patients were randomized to the two groups, and the study was designed as a triple-blind trial. The inclusion criteria were a low risk rating on the Braden Scale, voluntary informed consent, absence of pressure sores upon admission, and a BMI not exceeding 30.00. Patients were excluded if their bed was changed within 10 days of inclusion or if they were discharged or died during the study."

12,"This study aims to investigate the effects of acute and chronic stress on Pavlovian to Instrumental Transfer (PIT) and its neural correlates in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and healthy controls. The study has three main experiments:

Experiment 1: Assesses the behavioral and neural effects of acute and chronic stress on general PIT using monetary and alcohol-related cues in AUD and healthy controls. It hypothesizes that stress will increase PIT effects with monetary cues and decrease inhibitory effects with alcohol cues, with neural correlates in the amygdala and ventral striatum. It also tests if PIT effects after stress predict subsequent alcohol intake.

Experiment 2: Examines the relationship between interference costs during PIT and cognitive control abilities (interference control, response inhibition) in AUD, daily smokers, non-daily smokers, and non-smokers. It hypothesizes that interference costs during PIT will be associated with interference costs on Stroop and Simon tasks, and that the interference PIT effect will be more pronounced in the AUD and smoker groups.

Experiment 3: Utilizes a newly developed full PIT paradigm with primary"
