0,"The study aims to identify specific psychological clusters of variables, including personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences, that characterize and differentiate chronic migraine (CM), fibromyalgia (FM), and vulvodynia (VU) compared to healthy controls. 

The study will assess these psychological factors using self-report questionnaires in four groups: women diagnosed with CM, FM, VU, and healthy controls. The primary outcome measures include the Central Sensitivity Index, Traumatic Experiences Index, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, and environmental sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include psychological symptoms, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and genital/pelvic pain.

The study includes women who have had a first fresh or frozen embryo transfer followed by pregnancy failure, and have at least two embryos eligible for transfer or freezing during their first IVF attempt.

The participants are randomly assigned to one of two groups: the experimental group receives a blank culture transfer (up to 0.1 ml of gassed embryo culture medium injected into the uterine cavity) two to three days before the transfer of the thawed embryo, while the sham comparator group receives a sham transfer (an empty catheter) during the same timeframe.

The primary outcome measure is the clinically progressive pregnancy rate between the two groups, assessed at 12 weeks of amenorrhea. Secondary outcome measures include the occurrence of pregnancy, biochemical pregnancy, clinical pregnancy, early miscarriage, and live birth, as well as the differential cost-result ratio and total estimated expenditure for the two care strategies."
982,"This study aims to construct a database of prognostic risk factors and quality of life for patients with primary solid malignant cancers receiving immunotherapy for the first time, based on a questionnaire survey. It is a multicenter, observational, and controlled cohort study that will collect baseline information before treatment and follow-up information after treatment from solid tumor patients receiving immunotherapy for the first time. The study will analyze the risk factors affecting the efficacy and prognosis of immunotherapy, as well as the impact of immunotherapy on patients' health status. The primary outcome measure is progression-free survival (PFS), and the secondary outcomes include overall survival (OS) and the results of various questionnaires (PHQ-9, etc.). The study is expected to provide high-level evidence-based medical evidence to guide the selection of immunotherapy regimens, the prevention and management of adverse reactions, and the improvement of survival prognosis for these patients."
983,"The study aims to examine the effect of acupressure on back pain in the late postpartum period after cesarean section. It is a randomized controlled experimental study involving 70 participants (35 in the acupressure group and 35 in the control group) who have had a cesarean section, experience back pain, and are in the late postpartum period (1st and 4th weeks). The primary outcome measure is the visual analog scale (VAS) for assessing back pain before and after the acupressure application in the acupressure group. The secondary outcome measure is the VAS for assessing back pain before and after the late postpartum period (1st and 4th weeks) in both the acupressure and control groups. The study hypothesizes that acupressure application in the late postpartum period after cesarean section will reduce the level of back pain."
