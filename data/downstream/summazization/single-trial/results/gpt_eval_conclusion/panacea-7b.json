        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators have already pointed out separately for the three pathological conditions (chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia) that there is evidence that factors such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may contribute significantly to the genesis of these disorders through a process of central sensitization of pain pathways. Central sensitization (CS) is defined as increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input according to the IASP - International Association for the Study of Pain (Arendt-Nielsen et al., 2018). A sensitized nervous system has been considered one of the most important mechanisms involved in NP (Cohen, 2022). CS plays a role in fibromyalgia, in which alteration of central nociceptive processing occurs and pain can be worsened by psychological factors (Sluka & Clauw, 2016). In migraine, CS may contribute to acute allodynia and headache chronification (De Tommaso & Sciruicchio, 2016). Furthermore, in migraine CS may play a role in trigeminal nerve activation and cortical spreading depression (De Tommaso & Sciruicchio, 2016). It has been suggested that migraine may be considered as a brain state of altered excitability and a disorder of sensory processing (Goadsby et al., 2017), encompassing additional symptoms as fatigue and mood disorders (Karsan & Goadsby, 2021). Structural and functional MRI studies in women with provoked vulvar or distant/extra- genital pain have supported a role of central sensitization and dysregulation of endogenous pain modulatory systems in the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020). In the process of central sensitization, psychological factors such as traumatic events in childhood, the development of specific personality expressions (traits), and the use of different forms of defense mechanisms also play a role. No study to our knowledge has yet tried to identify specific clusters of psychological factors (personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences) capable of characterizing or differentiating between the different pathologies expressed by a NP. In addition to this, the study of psychosocial factors associated with the experience of such pathologies or possible emerging clusters such as depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention tailored to the person.",

        "summary": "Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation, demyelination and axon damage. Affecting approximately 2.5 million individuals around the world and seen mostly in young adults, MS can cause different levels of disability in functional activities, cause limitations in social and professional life, and impair quality of life. Multiple sclerosis is thought to be an autoimmune disease that develops on the basis of genetic predisposition and environmental factors. Nutritional habits and physical activity are important environmental factors. These can be effective in the course of MS and change the quality of life. Compatibility of nutrition with the Mediterranean diet and providing adequate physical activity may be beneficial in increasing physical and mental well-being in general, and therefore the quality of life of the person.\nIn our country, there is not enough information about the ongoing nutritional habits and physical activity levels of MS patients in their daily lives, and quality of life studies are limited. Our limited knowledge on these issues narrows the possibility of movement in an area that can be corrected in MS patients and thus have a positive impact on their quality of life. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model that is universally thought to improve health, and it is known that the Mediterranean diet has beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. The major difference between the Mediterranean diet and the Western-style diet is the source and amount of dietary fat and carbohydrates. The Mediterranean diet is rich in foods containing monounsaturated fat (especially omega-3), antioxidant vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, C, E, folic acid, selenium, zinc, calcium), which are thought to have positive effects on the prevention and course of MS. Preferring vegetable oils instead of animal fats in Mediterranean type diet, preferring fish instead of red meat consumption, preferring low-fat / fat-free milk and dairy products, limiting the intake of simple sugar and refined carbohydrates, increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in pulp and antioxidants. It is thought that this type of nutrition may positively affect the course and treatment of immune diseases by reducing inflammation. Although there is no effective clinical evidence for the application of nutritional support as complementary therapy in MS patients, it is known that patients often use various nutritional supplements to reduce symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. It is also important to determine the frequency of current nutritional support use in order to prevent unconscious use of nutritional support in the group. Because the most common symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, individuals with MS are often less physically active than age-matched adults All these negativities result in decreased functional activities, loss of mobility and balance problems. Walking and, in a broader sense, mobility are functions that are frequently affected in MS and have a high negative impact on quality of life. Gait problems are not uncommon in MS, and it is reported that a significant portion of individuals in this group are adversely affected by their daily living activities. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters.",

The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks CGA exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations. The control group will be weaned according to the unit's or medical team's practices.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple myeloma (MM) is a chronic malignancy with no current cure. Previously dependent on myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation to induce prolonged remission, recent advances in targeted therapies are enhancing overall survival and extending the duration between treatments. Monoclonal antibodies, including CD38-directed monoclonal antibodies, combination immunotherapies, and T-cell therapies are among the many promising agents for treating relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM. This improvement in treatment outcomes is accompanied by significant risk for toxicities such a neutropenia and subsequent infections which themselves can be life-threatening. Several studies indicate a high symptom burden and poor health-related quality of life for individuals with multiple myeloma, with most of what is known from clinical trials of highly selective populations or qualitative studies conducted outside of the US among mostly white patients. These factors, coupled with the rapidly changing multiple myeloma treatment landscape, limits the generalizability to wider population as well as an understanding of MM's impact across the disease course. A more complete investigation of the symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among patients with multiple myeloma is urgently needed to provide a comprehensive view of the ways in which multiple myeloma and its treatments affects individuals' lives. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of symptom monitoring and digital life coaching (DLC) to inform a more complete understanding of the impact of multiple myeloma on symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among a diverse U.S.-based, contemporary sample. The benefits of routine symptom monitoring have been demonstrated in recent studies, where overall survival increased among cancer patients who routinely monitored their symptoms. As the science related to symptom monitoring continues to evolve, exploring interventions to support both the assessment of and interventions related to disease and treatment-related sequelae it is important to identify how symptoms can best be monitored and managed. Studies to date have explored how symptom monitoring can be conducted for patients in the ambulatory setting, where patients do not receive around the clock assessment and management as they would in the hospital setting. In this context, digital or eHealth technologies are increasingly emerging as ways to promote health behaviors, and to monitor individuals with chronic health states, including cancer. An integrative review of 28 articles specifically evaluating eHealth interventions for patients with cancer identified 16 unique eHealth interventions, largely centered around educational support and decision aids. Telehealth counseling and navigation was found to be effective in supporting psychosocial needs in a small study (n=20) of underserved (defined by the authors as those who were primarily unemployed and uninsured) breast cancer patients. In a study of 1371 cancer patients, 71% reported using a mobile phone daily and 93% reported having internet access from home, of which 68% reported daily internet use, suggesting that internet-based technologies may be purposeful in the sharing of information with and coordination of care for cancer patients. Despite literature indicating its potential efficacy, few interventional studies have been published that evaluate digital health coaching and its relationship with self-efficacy and symptom management, specifically in R/R MM patients. As such, there is a gap in the literature on how digital health coaching might be used to support patients during cancer treatment and into survivorship. Pack Health, LLC is an independent, patient engagement company that was established in 2014 with the mission of helping patients access the right care for their condition and develop the self-management skills to achieve better health and overall well-being. Pack Health offers a symptom management program involving both interpersonal interactions as well as e-modules for patients diagnosed with cancer to better manage pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety and navigate their care more effectively through digital health coaching and tools. A recent pilot study at UCSF conducted in collaboration with Pack Health examined the impact of digital life coaching (DLC) on symptom outcomes for individuals with MM undergoing upfront stem cell transplantation. Outcomes suggest the efficacy of a coaching program for engagement up to day +100 post-transplant, with 73% (n=11) DLC engagement and 94% PRO completion. A randomized study of DLC versus usual care in individuals with MM undergoing upfront stem cell transplantation is underway. However, patients with R/R MM (where the disease has come back after prior lines of therapy such as transplantation) may have unique needs",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nInflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation. The most common types of IBD are Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The most important environmental factor is the gut microbiota, which is the community of microorganisms that live in the intestines. The gut microbiota is important for maintaining a healthy gut, but in IBD patients, the gut microbiota is often altered and this is associated with increased inflammation.\nIn addition to the gut microbiota, dietary factors are also important in the development and progression of IBD. Patients with IBD often have a low intake of dietary fiber, which is a type of carbohydrate that is not digested by the body. Dietary fiber is important for maintaining a healthy gut, as it is fermented by the gut microbiota and produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which have anti-inflammatory properties. However, patients with IBD often have a low intake of dietary fiber, which may contribute to the development and progression of IBD.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a 4-week intervention with a dried vegetable fiber (WholeFiberTM) on inflammation, fecal gut microbiota and metabolites, IBD-complaints and Quality of Life (QoL) in patients with CD and UC.

        "summary": "In intensive care unit, dyspnea, the distressing and fearful awareness of breathing, is frequent and harmful. To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients.

This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost.

Compared to general sepsis population, sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) has a higher mortality, up to 68.6%.\nThe aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI), which can be calculated from conventional laboratory indicators, has long been used in the evaluation of liver damage and fibrosis in patients with hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. AST is a sensitive indicator of early liver function impairment. Additionally, PLT also plays a crucial role in sepsis-induced MODS through regulating inflammation, maintaining tissue integrity, and defending against infection.

They were randomised using a closed envelope technique, opened by the physician performing the block. 54 patients were included in the study, divided into two groups of 27 patients as esp block (group 1) and control group (group 2), both groups underwent standard general anaesthesia. The blocks were performed in the operating theatre at the end of the operation, before the patient woke up. The patients were unaware that the block was being performed on them. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device was given to both groups by another doctor blinded to the group, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores assessed for 24 hours. Standard monitoring (peripheral oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring) was performed. Anaesthesia induction was achieved with 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium, and anaesthesia maintenance with 2% sevoflurane, 4 lt/min 50%/50% oxygen/nitrogen mixture. Both groups received 1 g IV paracetamol towards the end of surgery. The patients were extubated after 2 mg/kg of sugammadex and were transferred to the recovery room. The first group underwent sacral espb at the end of surgery. The lumbosacral region was sterilised with povidine iodine and then draped with the patient in prone position. The linear ultrasound probe was placed in the midline on the spinous process of the 5th lumbar vertebra after the sterile covering had been applied. After observation of the sacrum, the level of the 2nd median crest was determined and the ultrasound probe was moved 1.5-2 cm laterally and the 2nd intermediate crest and the erector spinae muscle between the two were observed. 22 G 50 mm needle was advanced from caudal to cranial direction to the sacral crest using in-plane technique, after confirming the needle position with 1-2 ml saline, 0.25% bupivacaine 20 ml was administered, local anaesthesia was observed to spread cauda-cranially separating the erector spinae muscle from the sacral crest, the same procedure was performed on the opposite side.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as taught muscle bands, trigger points (TPs), and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker).",

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

For example, a teacher might use a specific gesture or word to help a child feel more confident before a test. (2) Reframing: This technique involves helping a child see a situation or problem differently. For example, a teacher might help a child reframe a difficult math problem as a fun challenge.

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of cSDH is not well understood, and there is no consensus on the optimal management of this condition. The investigators hypothesize that spreading depolarization (SD) is a key pathophysiologic mechanism in cSDH. SD is a phenomenon in which a wave of depolarization spreads across the cortex, leading to a loss of consciousness and seizures. SD has been implicated in the pathophysiology of other neurologic conditions, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. The investigators propose to perform subdural ECoG monitoring in patients undergoing surgical evacuation of cSDH to assess for the presence or absence of SD. The investigators will also perform long-term follow-up testing to assess for neurologic deficits and recovery. The investigators hypothesize that the presence of SD will be associated with worse neurologic outcomes and that the detection of SD will guide the management of cSDH.",

Ocrelizumab, a humanized anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, has shown remarkable efficacy in Phase III trials on the inflammatory component of the disease, reducing the annualized relapse rate by 46% and the rate of new T2 lesions by 80% compared with interferon-\u03b2 1a.\nThe use of anti-CD20 agents, including ocrelizumab, is associated with an infectious risk that increases with duration of exposure, part of which is due to the development of hypo-gammaglobulinemia in relation to cumulative dose.\nSeveral reports suggest a persistent effect of anti-CD20 drugs in MS, with no resumption of inflammatory activity after discontinuation:\nDuring the development of ocrelizumab, at the end of phase 2, after having received 3 or 4 semi-annual cycles of ocrelizumab, a safety period with a therapeutic window of 18 months was planned, before re-administration in the extension study. During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

The risk of lymph node metastasis is dependent on several histopathological characteristics of the tumor. The overall risk of lymph node metastases is less than 20 % in patients with early colon cancer. This indicates that the majority of patients with early colon cancer have no benefit of additional resection besides local tumor excision. The alternative to resecting a larger part of the bowel is to make more focused surgery only resecting a small part of the bowel part through a combination of laparoscopic and endoscopic techniques.

Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity. Unlike standard MRI, the aMRI approach uses new ways of analyzing MRI images that provides information about tumor cell metabolic activity.

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO.

For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. Instead, families are more likely to be labeled as difficult if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians' recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment, and healthcare institutional contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism. Our research group began to address this need with 'African American Community Speaks', a proof-of-concept prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illnesses. The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US. Thus, we propose to adapt our prototype program to urban-dwelling Southern and Northern older AA adults using our established platform of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in two geographically diverse regions: Birmingham, Alabama, and the Bronx, New York. To create the new training program called 'Caring for Older African Americans', our team of experts in CBPR, medical sociology, and clinical trials will work with local Community Advisory Boards to: 1. Conduct a comparative ethnographic study of urban dwelling AAs in the North and South to describe AA community values and preferences related to EoL care; 2. Adaptation of our prior community-developed training program by integrating community-developed storytelling videos for empathizing with experiences of racism in EoL care, guidelines for culturally concordant EoL care delivery, and adapting an existing implicit bias management program to goals of care communication; and 3. Conduct a cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize training times to 1 of 4 start dates using a stepped wedge design to accommodate the training of all clinicians and to mitigate the effect of secular trends. Patients' personal experience of racism will be measured using the discrimination subscale of the Group Based Mistrust Scale. The primary outcome will be patient/family's perception of therapeutic alliance using The Human Connection Scale. Secondary outcomes will be family-reported goal-concordant care, and clinicians' knowledge of cultural values, awareness of implicit bias, and confidence to change practice. This innovative effort will be the first training program that: 1. addresses culturally concordant care, systemic racism, and implicit bias management, the three key elements in enhancing the provision of equitable care; and 2. is designed and implemented in full partnership with two distinct AA communities in the South and the North of the US.",

However, patients with HPV+ Head and Neck cancers are treated according to the same referential as HPV- Head and Neck cancers. There is therefore a real need for studies identifying predictive markers in order to be able to offer patients a more effective suitable and less invasive treatment. This is the context of this research project.\n\nOfficial Title: Assessment of Genomic Alterations and Profiles of Expression in HPV+ Versus HPV Head and Neck Cancers\n\nConditions: Head and Neck Cancer\n\nIntervention / Treatment:\n- Genetic: PCR - Immunohistochemistry - Immunolabelling\n\nParticipation Criteria:\n=================\nEligibility Criteria:\n-----------------\nInclusion Criteria: Patient with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma or the oral cavity histologically proven.

        "summary": "We spend a third of our life at work. Psychosocial risks (PSR) are a major issue in occupational health 1. Approaching the different dimensions of PSR calls on a dozen essential components: workload, autonomy, social support, burnout, anxiety, efforts made, rewards, work addiction, investment, etc. a specific questionnaire which usually contains 20 to 30 questions, so that having an overall view of PSR using the current reference questionnaires (Karasek, Siegrist, etc.) represents a total of more than 300 questions. The response time is thus incompatible with current medical practice (passage in the waiting room before the occupational health medical examination) and leads to a majority of non-responses during anonymous questionnaires on the Internet. On the other hand, these validated questionnaires were carried out by different people and are very heterogeneous between them, including in their formulation, so that the respondents have the impression of disorganization and anarchy. There is therefore a need for short, quick and uniform questionnaires. EVAs offer the incredible advantage of meeting these criteria: speed, uniformity, precision. From a data analysis point of view, EVAs also have the advantage of offering a continuous quantitative response, allowing the use of all statistical approaches. If some questionnaires have already been validated in the form of EVA, such as the EVA stress versus the  Perceived Stress Scale  questionnaire (PSS), the EVA workload and EVA autonomy at work versus the Karasek questionnaire, the other reference questionnaires are not yet validated in EVA (burnout, anxiety, efforts / rewards, work addiction, etc.).",

At present, laparoscopic surgery has become the classic operation of colorectal cancer surgery compared with the traditional open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) refer to the clinical abnormal changes in the lungs after surgery, These include lung infections (pneumonia), atelectasis, pleural effusion, bronchospasm, acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%. The reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications. Numerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for more than 40 years to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of the positive physiological effects of prone positioning on transpulmonary pressure, lung compression and ventilation perfusion ratio, it has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. Currently, the mechanisms of prone position training are decreased lung compression in the gravity dependant zone,homogenisation of transpulmonary pressure, improvement of ventilation/perfusion ratio, and reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) or patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). By placing the patient in the prone position, the lungs compression due to its own weight is reduced via a gravitational-dependent redistribution of fluids. In addition, the weight of the mediastinum is supported by the sternum, the stiffer part of the chest. At the same time, the diaphragm is displaced caudally, decreasing compression of the posterior-caudal lung parenchyma. Finally, in a triangular-shaped lung, more parenchyma is included in the dorsal half than in the ventral one resulting in a more aerated lung in prone positioning. So, the purpose of this study is to observe whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The protocol design is in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. All potentially eligible participants will be asked to give written informed consent before they are enrolled in this study. This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial guided by the standard of good clinical practice (GCP), and eligible participants are divided into two groups: group PPT and group C, and primary assess the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.",

The \u03b2-glucan is identified as a main component of BLEX 404. Not only with therapeutic potential on several types of cancer, BLEX 404 has also shown the potential to improve hematopoiesis, granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) production, and the cytotoxicity activity of immune cells in recent animal studies. Its antitumor effect on tumor-bearing mice is exerted by enhancing the immune system through activation of macrophages, T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells.\nThe activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as macrophages, dendritic cells (DCs) via BLEX 404 administration is in response to secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12). BLEX 404 has been found to enhance the activity of immunocompetent cells such as helper T cells, cytotoxic T cells, and NK cells either by i.p injection or oral intake, therefore, it stimulates innate and adaptive immunity. BLEX 404 enhances hematopoiesis by increasing mouse bone marrow cell and human cord blood cell differentiation into granulocytes-macrophages (GMs), granulopoiesis and mobilization of granulocytes, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF production. One related phase I healthy human trial by treating with Maitake D-fraction was examined in Italy.

Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments. The goal of geriatric rehabilitation has been defined as to assist [older people] to manage personal activities of daily living without the assistance of another person. If this is not possible, the goal is to minimize the need for external assistance through the use of adaptive techniques and equipment. Thereby focussing on the amelioration of dependency in activities of daily living. However, we are still in the dark about the amount of functional recovery of geriatric post-COVID-19 patients. We do know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious.

At least 6 weeks after randomisation, patients will receive the COVID-19 vaccination (=baseline visit). After 28 days patients will be invited for a study visit for blood withdrawal. Part 2 (optional) - Herpes zoster vaccination (+56 days) Patients that opted to participate in this part of the study will continue their randomised treatment for the next 56 days. During this period patients will receive 2 herpes zoster vaccinations with an interval of 28 days between each vaccination. At 28 days after the second vaccination patients will be invited for the last study visit for blood withdrawal. After completion of the study (either 28 days after COVID-19 vaccination or 28 days after the last herpes zoster vaccination) patients will be offered the option to continue everolimus instead of MMF/MPA as part of shared clinical decision making.",

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

These easy-to-use systems have shown very promising results compared with high-definition (HD) white light. Indeed, data from the first meta-analysis of 5 randomized controlled trials (4354 patients) confirmed a significantly higher ADD in the CADe group than in the HD group (36.6% vs. 25.2%; 95% CI], 1.27-1.62; P < 0.01; I2 Z 42%) 10. The CAD EYE system (Fujifilm) is a CADe device supporting both detection (sensitivity > 95%) and characterization of colonic polyps in real time.\nTo date, artificial intelligence has never been evaluated for CRC screening in patients followed up for LS. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in this specific population. To this end, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, non-inferiority trial comparing CAD EYE with CE in patients with LS.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators conducted a prospective observational study at nine children's hospitals that are members of the Western Pediatric Surgery Research Consortium. IRB approval was obtained from each site with waiver of consent for enrollment. Enrollment took place between 2020-2022. Inclusion criteria were children 1-20 years diagnosed with an ASBO by an attending pediatric surgeon and underwent a trial of nonoperative management (NOM) on hospital admission. The use of an enteral contrast protocol was at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Exclusion criteria included peritonitis, suspicion of incarcerated or internal hernia, active intra-abdominal malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, <4 weeks since the most recent abdominal operation, pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, or known contrast allergy. If the attending surgeon made the decision to take a child directly to the operating room (OR) with no attempt at NOM, these children were excluded. Children under one year of age were excluded as the rate of successful NOM is lower in this age group. Site details and Contrast Protocols At the start of the study, four of the nine sites had a contrast protocol in place for ASBO diagnosis and management. During the course of the study, contrast protocols were developed and implemented at each of the five additional sites. At study initiation, three sites used contrast routinely, one used it selectively and 5 did not use contrast. At study conclusion, five sites used contrast routinely and four used it selectively. Contrast agent, volume of contrast, and contrast dilution were not standardized across sites due to the differences in hospital specific formularies; otherwise, the protocol was standardized across sites. Diatrizoate meglumine (osmolality of 1940 mOsm/kg) was used preferentially at eight sites and Ioversol (702 mOms/kg) at one site. Patients received 30-200ml (based on age or weight depending on site) of enteral contrast followed by X-rays at 8-12 hours and 24 hours after contrast administration. Patients were included in the contrast arm if enteral contrast, administered as part of an abdominal CT scan, was followed with subsequent x-rays to assess for progression of contrast to the colon. Failure (complete bowel obstruction) was defined as failure of contrast having not reached the colon by 24 hours after oral administration at which point operative intervention was recommended. The decision to operate was at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Sample Size Calculation The study was powered to detect a 15% difference in operative rate between the contrast and no contrast groups based on the adult literature. To detect this difference with 80% power, the investigators aimed to enroll 314 patients. Data Collection and Outcomes Study data were collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software tool hosted at the University of Colorado. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. The surgical inpatient census was monitored daily by study personnel at each site for patients with ASBO. Once identified, data were collected based on a review of the electronic medical record at each site 30 days following hospital discharge. Data collected included patient demographics, medical and surgical history, clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and imaging, management approach including type, volume, dilution of any contrast agent used. Complications specific to the contrast administration including allergic reaction, aspiration of contrast, cardiac arrhythmia, and renal failure were recorded. Details of the hospital course including length of stay, need for operation, indications for operation, and subsequent postoperative course and complications were also included. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were summarized for continuous variables with medians and interquartile ranges, and for categorical variables with frequencies and percentages. Group differences were tested via t-test or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and Chi-Squared test or Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables. Comparisons were made between those who received contrast and those who did not. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between contrast and need for operation adjusting for age, body mass index for age z-score (or weight for height z-score for patients under 24 months of age per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards), volume of contrast administered, and number of previous laparotomies (< 3 v. \u22653).

Subject-reported consumption of the Study IP, Combustible cigarettes, and other TNPs will be assessed (including, but not limited to, ENDS, smokeless tobacco, and other combustible tobacco products). The study includes pre-screening, a screening and enrollment visit (SEV), a baseline assessment period (BAP), an observational actual use period (AUP), and a close out period (COP). Following the recruitment period, the study duration per enrolled subject will be approximately eight (8) weeks. Following the administration of a Baseline Assessment Questionnaire (BAQ) at the SEV, use of Combustible Cigarettes and other TNP will be self-reported using an eDiary during the 1-week BAP. At SEV, subjects will be asked to indicate their likelihood to use each Study IP flavor variant across the three study arms. Subjects who indicate an interest in using at least one of the two flavors per arm for all three arms will be enrolled into the study and randomized into one of the three arms prior to completion of BAQ. The Study IP evaluated in this study will include the Power Unit and 12 cartridge variants (six flavor variants in two nicotine concentrations, 1.5% and 5%). In each arm, four variants (two flavor variants in two nicotine concentrations) will be available for choice. Subjects will be first dispensed the power unit and preferred Study IP variants (i.e., specific flavor and nicotine concentrations) available within their assigned study arm during SV1 and a handout MM will be given to the subjects to take home at SV1. Starting at SV1, enrolled subjects will be able to select Study IP for use during the AUP from the Study IP available in their assigned study arm. Subjects will be instructed not to use ENDS other than the Study IP provided by the study site for the duration of the AUP in the ICF. However, if subjects report other ENDS use in the eDiary, this will not lead to study discontinuation. Subjects can use the Study IP and other TNP including Combustible Cigarettes ad libitum during the AUP and will self-report product use on a daily basis via an eDiary over the 6-week AUP.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBronchiectasis are defined as irreversible dilatation of the bronchial tree. Patients with bronchiectasis suffer of chronic cough and sputum production, and are predisposed to recurrent airway infections. Many systemic diseases can cause bronchiectasis: cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiencies (PID) and idiopathic bronchiectasis (IB) represent a significant proportion of patients with bronchiectasis starting in early age. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. The improvement in FEV1 after inhalation of bronchodilators can be attributed to bronchodilation or improved mucociliary clearance. It can be speculated that for some of the bronchiectasis patients, hyper-reactive airways or asthma can contribute to the reversible pattern. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to ATS/ERS statement, the proper way to determine BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered a positive BDR. While in most scenarios it is reasonable to assume that the change in FEV1 measured after the waiting time can be attributed solely to the affect of bronchodilators, this is not necessarily the case in bronchiectasis. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives are to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma and use of inhaled steroids.",

        "summary": "Delivery of intensive rehabilitation plays an important part within stroke care and has the potential to affect rates of recovery and optimise outcomes as part of a wider multidisciplinary approach. New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised. Data will be obtained through a range of measures to monitor safety (incidence and types of adverse events), adherence (sessions/time attended, movement repetitions) and through interviews with participants, their family/carers, and staff to understand user acceptability.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe Scottish Stroke Improvement Programme identifies stroke as the most common cause of severe physical disability amongst Scottish adults. Hospital care for these patients accounts for 7% of all NHS beds and 5% of the entire NHS budget. Furthermore, the number of strokes across the UK is projected to increase by 60% between 2015 and 2035. Rehabilitation delivered by a multi-disciplinary team including Allied Health Professionals (occupational therapists [OT's], physiotherapists [PT's], and speech and language therapists [SLT's]) is known to improve functional recovery after stroke, particularly if it can be applied intensively and within enriched, stimulating environments. It is widely accepted that greater intensity, or dose, of rehabilitation improves outcomes and leads to greater and faster improvement of activities after stroke. However, a large gap exists between the minimum recommendations for stroke rehabilitation (three hours of multidisciplinary therapy a day, at least 5 days out of 7) and what the NHS are currently able to provide, given the majority of in-patient stroke units are operating below the staffing levels recommended in national clinical guidelines, and are therefore challenged to provide the amount of therapy to facilitate optimum recovery for stroke patients. An analysis of data from the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme found, on average, patients who required specific therapy following stroke received around 14 minutes of PT, 13 minutes of OT, and 7 minutes of SLT per day of inpatient stay. Therefore, new and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity. Commercially available technology, such as robotics, adapted treadmills, virtual reality, and mobile digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors, have been shown to be a safe and feasible method of increasing rehabilitation intensity, under the prescription and supervision of therapy staff. It can be used to enhance usual therapy and can allow stroke patients to work on physical, cognitive, visual, and communication goals, without one-to-one or 'hands on' treatment from a therapist. Despite the potential offered by rehabilitation technology to help deliver evidence-based levels of practice intensity and automated feedback without additional labour costs, currently few technologies have been adopted into everyday rehabilitation. A well-established research group at the University of Strathclyde (UoS) Biomedical Engineering department have been developing and testing a technology-based, holistic model as a possible solution to the gap between clinical need and current provision. The technology enriched rehabilitation model has been tested under controlled conditions with chronic stroke survivors (at least one year post stroke) and shown to be feasible. While this model presents a potential method of scaling up rehabilitation delivery, and has been successfully deployed and tested for feasibility with chronic stroke, it not yet been evaluated for acute and sub-acute stroke patients or tested for clinical acceptability. This specific population has greater potential for recovery as the brain is more receptive to recovery through structural changes to neural pathways (neuroplasticity), therefore delivering higher intensity rehabilitation is therefore more critical at this phase of rehabilitation. Recently, an NHSL occupational therapy advanced practitioner has been seconded into a research post within the UoS Biomedical Engineering department. This has created greater opportunity for collaboration between the research team at UoS and NHS Lanarkshire, to test this technology delivered rehabilitation model within an acute stroke unit where the impact of enhanced rehabilitation is likely to be greater. The Director of Hospital Services at University Hospital Wishaw (UHW) has expressed support for a technology enriched stroke rehabilitation model to be tested within the stroke unit on site and has provided a large room within the ward that can be made available for equipment (loaned from the University of Strathclyde and UK manufacturer Innerva) to be housed and used by patients under supervision from NHS staff. Funding has been secured for research assistant time from the UoS in order to support the introduction of the technology and to complete data collection. Participants will be supported to use the rehabilitation technology by trained NHS staff. This is a mixed methods feasibility study in line with Medical Research Council recommendations for development of a complex intervention.The methodology of the study is as follows; Inpatients on the stroke unit, with a diagnosis of stroke, at University Hospital Wishaw, Scotland, will be assessed for eligibility by the NHS multidisciplinary team using the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis, and the development of effective treatments is urgently needed. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have been shown to have comprehensive and powerful immunomodulatory and regenerative functions, and they can combat cell death associated with the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, ARDS, and pulmonary hypertension, and promote cell regeneration. Exosomes are one of the key paracrine effectors secreted by MSCs and are considered attractive candidates for alternative MSC therapy due to their biocompatibility similar to parent cells and their ability to maintain healing properties. Under physiological and pathological conditions, exosomes play a key role in intercellular communication by transporting various biomolecules such as miRNA and proteins to target cells. Unlike apoptotic bodies and microvesicles derived from the cell surface, exosomes are produced through the endocytic pathway and load cytoplasmic content of the parent cell. Therefore, they are mini versions of parent cells, mimicking some of their physiological characteristics. Compared to cell counterparts, the non-toxicity, low immunogenicity, high stability, ease of storage, and potential for mass production as ready-made products are several advantages of exosomes, which have led to their expansion in clinical applications as new therapeutic alternatives. In addition, the natural function of exosomes allows them to deliver their membrane and cytoplasmic bioactive components from parent cells to target cells through membrane fusion. Furthermore, biocompatibility is another characteristic. Due to their origin from biological sources and inherent targeting ability, exosomes have been used as carriers of drug components in preclinical studies. In this study, we propose to use umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes to treat moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 patients. The study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 patients through a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind clinical trial.",

Clinical bedside tests will be available as in routine practice in the ED (e.g., ecg, blood gas results). A physician certified in the dyspnea protocol will then perform POCUS and deliver the findings to the initial physician assessing the patients. Hereafter, the initial physician documents the estimated likelihood of the above diagnosis being provided the ultrasound findings. The estimated likelihoods (before and after POCUS) will be dichotomised and compared to the discharge diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the diagnostic accuracy before and after adding POCUS will be calculated.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPostoperative radiotherapy is widely practiced and highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer, the most common cancer in women. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial randomizing R&R vs. standard-of-care management in patients with radiotherapy in DIBH for left breast cancer. The investigators primary endpoint will assess heart dose (Dmax), and secondary endpoints include longitudinal anxiety and quality of life assessment and clinic workflow efficiency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a validated patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced-technology-based cardiac dose reduction, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors.",

Changes in plasma microRNAs will be analysed to establish non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia. Participants without pre-existing CVD or diabetes aged 18-70 years old will be included if they have hyperlipidaemia (plasma triglyceride level between 1.7 - 4.5mmol/l) not on any lipid-lowering treatment or on a stable lipid-lowering treatment (last six months) but still have confirmation of high triglycerides within the range required for study. 114 participants will be randomized into two groups (57/group) to receive either fenugreek seeds or control tea, respectively. Treatment allocations will be placed into sealed envelopes and this will be opened at the baseline study visit with the participant. Fenugreek seeds will be delivered at a dose of 5g/day, drunk as a tea (2.5g/per tea bag), p.o. twice a day at a 12-hour interval) for 8 weeks (56 days). The tea bags will be brewed in a cup (200ml) of boiled hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. This will be self-administered by the subjects, twice a day at a 12-hour interval. The rationale for choosing the dose and intervention time course were based on the previous studies where metabolic effects have been detected. Literature reports from 12 human studies on diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects gave doses of fenugreek seed ranging from 1 to 100g/day, with the median treatment dose being 6.3g/day, to the participants; the intervention time course ranged from 1 week to 3 years, with the median treatment time being 60 days. The dose and duration in this study was therefore designed as being similar to these studies where metabolic effects have been detected, and also, where participant burden will not be too onerous, at a dose of 5g/day, twice a day at a 12-hour interval for 8 weeks (56 days). For the control group, a control black tea (2.5g/bag), self-administered by the subjects, twice in a day at a 12-hour interval. Black tea is a type of fermented tea that has been found to possess much less cardioprotective and lipid profile improving effect compared to green tea due to the different manufacture process. Consumption of black tea has been found not associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease in the United Kingdom. Recruitment will be via outpatient hyperlipidaemia clinics, primary care and advertisements. Study visits will take place at the Centre for Public Health at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks and will involve the collection of demographic information, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and fasting blood samples.",

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

There is significant interest in using a multi-modal approach to LCS, incorporating biomarkers obtained from minimally-invasive samples alongside LDCT to improve ability to recognise clinically-significant lung cancers at an early stage.\nThe Targeted Lung Health Check (TLHC) programme is an NHS programme with the aim of using LDCT screening in appropriately high-risk individuals to improve early diagnosis and survival in lung cancer. The North Central London TLHC programme started in December 2022.\nThe purpose of the ALPINE study is to develop a platform to allow collection of minimally-invasive samples from participants undergoing screening within the North Central London TLHC programme. The use of such biomarkers in the diagnosis of lung cancer is a rapidly developing field and novel techniques and technologies are continuously under development. The ALPINE study will generate a cohort with matched biosamples, CT scans and clinical data which will be uniquely well placed to serve to develop or validate biomarkers in lung cancer screening and risk prediction.",

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes and results in high mortality. However, the epidemiology and treatment strategy for ARDS may have changed significantly due to the accumulation of a large body of knowledge, following the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) of which the primary manifestation is ARDS. To improve the quality of ICU care that patients receive after admission to the ICU, a variety of academic societies, including the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, are currently developing evidence-based guidelines and consensus guidelines and statements regarding ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, ICU diary. The ABCDEF bundle, nutritional therapy, and ICU diary have been developed and are being promoted for implementation in hospitals around the world. The implementation of evidence-based ICU care is strongly recommended, especially for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who frequently require ventilators to maintain their lives, because their patient outcomes are worse than those who were admitted to ICU with other causes.\nHowever, there is still little evidence on how the quality of ICU care (compliance rate) correlates with patient prognosis and outcomes, and there are currently no clear goals or indicators for the ICU care we should develop.\nThis study aims to investigate the epidemiology and treatments given to the patients and evaluate the implementation of evidence-based ICU care and its association with the outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to the ICU. The contents of mechanical ventilation settings, respiratory conditions, and the evidence-based ICU care, such as analgesia, sedation, rehabilitation, and nutrition, given to the patients will be collected in a daily basis.\nAim 1: Epidemiology Aim 2: Treatments Aim 3: Evidence-based ICU care Aim 4: ARDS related Post Intensive Care Syndrome",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes with bilateral lung infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT imaging. 10% of all ICU admissions are ARDS patients, and the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus has dramatically increased the number of ARDS patients in ICUs across the world. The international epidemiological study (2016) reported a mortality rate of 35-46% for ARDS, and this is very high mortality compared to other ICU diseases. Furthermore, ARDS survivors present with many functional impairments, including physical, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunction (Post Intensive Care Syndrome, PICS), and their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of Life (QOL) are impaired and many other functional impairments have been pointed out. Their inability to get their original life has attracted significant research attention and become a significantly important research topic. Many patients who are unable to return to work due to functional disability require nursing care, and there is concern about the increased burden on the patient, the family supporting the patient, and the social economy. Therefore, the development of effective strategies for patients with ARDS that take into account not only mortality but also functional prognosis is strongly needed. Recent studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume and airway pressure control), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, noninvasive mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have improved outcomes, including mortality, in patients with ARDS. However, the mortality of patients with ARDS is still as high as 40%. In addition, the complete reintegration ratio of patients with ARDS after 1 year of hospital discharge reported in 2003 was only 50%, and recent reports have shown little progress in this aspect. Strategies to improve outcomes (mortality and functional prognosis) of ARDS patients by improving not only treatment but also the quality of ICU care have become a hot topic in recent years. The previous paper showed that excessive sedation and absolute bed rest for the purpose of ventilation control and rest during intubation in ARDS patients correlated with delirium, prolonged duration of ventilation, and even increased mortality. Therefore, attempts have been explored to improve outcomes for ARDS patients by systematically providing sedation, analgesia, rehabilitation, spontaneous breathing and awaking tests, and delirium management during ICU admission. These attempts, known as the ABCDEF bundle, have been actively recommended by a number of academic societies to be introduced in ICUs as an attempt to improve outcomes of patients with ARDS and promote their reintegration into society. (ABCDEF bundle: A (Assess, prevent, and manage pain), B (Both spontaneous awakening trials (SAT) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT)), C (Choice of analgesia and sedation), D (Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage), E (Early mobility and exercise), F (Family engagement and empowerment)), and even ICU care such as nutritional therapy and ICU diaries have been shown to improve outcomes for ICU patients, including ARDS, and are strongly recommended. (In this study, this ICU care is referred to as evidence-based ICU care.) On the other hand, our research team has reported that the overall implementation rate of these evidence-based ICU care, ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, and ICU diaries in ICU patients is quite low, and the rate is significantly lower in mechanically ventilated patients. The reason for the low implementation rates is thought to be that the ventilator is a major barrier. Although many articles have proposed evidence-based ICU care, there is little evidence as to which of these should be prioritized and which should be combined to maximize patient outcomes. The reason for this may be that there is a lack of evidence on which of these should be prioritized and which should be combined to maximize patient outcomes. Implementation of evidence-based ICU care requires many resources and effort, and it is difficult to implement all of them simultaneously. Therefore, the purpose of this international multicenter study is to investigate the current epidemiology and treatment strategy given to the patients with ARDS after the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus, clarify the actual implementation of ICU care for ARDS patients who require ventilators at high frequency, and evaluate how the implementation of evidence-based ICU care is associated with patient outcomes.

Interestingly, although the incidence of indolent (latent) PCa is very similar throughout the globe, there is a remarkable global age-adjusted incidence variation (up to 40-fold difference between highest and lowest incidences). Epidemiological data suggest that aging in men is associated with neoplastic processes in the prostate but only a subset of men will develop a true malignancy potentially affecting their life-span or quality of life. Genetic factors have a significant effect on PCa risk, but very likely life-style (e.g. diet and physical activity) affect PCa risk as well, but the mechanisms mediating protective or harmful effects of life-style remain unclear. Gut microbiota, i.e. the collection of microbes colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, is acknowledged to play significant role in many metabolic pathways and pathogenic processes in the human body. Although there is some evidence suggesting that gut microbiota affects therapy responses (especially androgen deprivation) in PCa, it \u0301s potential role in prostate carcinogenesis is not well documented. Our previous studies suggest that gut microbiota composition is different in men with and without PCa and that changes in steroid hormone synthesis may be one mechanism how gut microbiota affects PCa risk.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the effect of prostate medication (5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and LHRH antagonists) on gut microbiota composition and metabolic characteristics in men with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa).

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

After this initial 6-month period, thalidomide was introduced into the treatment regimen. Thalidomide was administered orally at bedtime, with an initial dosage of 2-5 mg/kg. An incremental dosing approach was employed for thalidomide, with individuals who exhibited an insufficient response to lower doses having their dosage increased to a maximum of 5 mg/kg. Additionally, aspirin was prescribed at a daily dosage of 2-4 mg/kg to mitigate the risk of thrombosis. Blood transfusions were administered under specific conditions throughout the study. Transfusions were initiated if the Hb levels dropped below 7 g/dL or if patients exhibited symptoms or instability, regardless of their Hb levels. Patients who were undergoing iron chelation therapy (utilizing deferasirox, deferiprone, and/or deferoxamine) while on HU monotherapy continued this regimen throughout the combination therapy phase. Throughout combination therapy, various assessments were conducted and documented, including blood transfusion events and comprehensive blood count evaluations, carried out at baseline, as well as during the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year follow-up periods. Concurrently, safety parameters, such as urea and creatinine levels, liver function tests, and measurements of liver and spleen size, were consistently monitored and recorded. Outcome: Good responders were characterized as individuals who were previously reliant on blood transfusions while on hydroxyurea therapy but became transfusion-independent after the initiation of hydroxyurea and thalidomide combination therapy. Furthermore, patients who were already free from transfusions while on hydroxyurea therapy and demonstrated an increase in Hb levels exceeding 1 g/dL upon combination therapy were also classified as good responders. Responders were defined as patients who, while receiving blood transfusions during hydroxyurea therapy, exhibited a substantial reduction of at least 50% in the volume of PRC transfusions over a span of 6 months after the onset of combination therapy. Non-responders encompassed patients who were not reliant on transfusions during hydroxyurea therapy but did not display any significant enhancement in Hb levels following the commencement of combination therapy.

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated. We propose a phase I clinical trial to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a weekly infusion of WJ-MSC administered as GvHD prophylaxis and as a support for a faster hematological reconstitution after haplo-identical allo-SCT.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults. Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.\n\nOfficial Title\n-----------------\nA Rapid Diagnostic of Risk in Hospitalized Patients With COVID-19, Sepsis, and Other High-Risk Conditions to Improve Outcomes and Critical Resource Allocation Using Machine Learning\n\nConditions\n-----------------\nSepsis, Septicemia, Respiratory Failure, Hemodynamic Instability, COVID-19, Cardiac Arrest, Clinical Deterioration\n\nIntervention / Treatment\n-----------------\n* Device: eCARTv5 clinical deterioration monitoring\n* Other: Standard of care control\n\n\nParticipation Criteria\n=================\nEligibility Criteria\n-----------------\n18 years old Admitted to an eCART-monitored medical-surgical unit (scoring location) Exclusion Criteria: Younger than 18 years old Not admitted to an eCART-monitored medical surgical unit (scoring location)\n\nAges Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nMinimum Age: 18 Years\n\nSexes Eligible for Study\n-----------------\nAll\n\nAccepts Healthy Volunteers\n-----------------\nNo\n\nStudy Plan\n=================\nHow is the study designed?\n-----------------\n\nDesign Details\n\nPrimary Purpose: Prevention\nAllocation: Non-Randomized\nIntervention Model: Parallel Assignment\nInterventional Model Description: This a parallel study with an intervention group of medical-surgical patients where the tool will be used by providers, and a control group wherein the tool will run silently in the background.

STUDY AIM\nPrimary objective: Compare the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin injected at the depth of 2mm vs 4mm for the improvement of glabellar lines\nSecondary objective: Determine any adverse effects of onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin injected at the depth of 2mm vs 4mm\nRATIONALE FOR THE PROJECT:\nAlthough the use of BoTN for treatment of glabellar lines has long been established as safe and effective, the optimal depth of injection has not been established. Our project hopes to establish the optimal depth of injection for onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin for maximal improvement of glabellar lines with minimal adverse effects",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBotulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a safe and effective treatment for numerous conditions in neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and urology. In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the procerus was located at a depth of 3.8 \u00b1 0.7 mm at the glabella and 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 mm at the sellion while the intercanthal vein was located 3.0 \u00b1 0.6 mm below the skin's surface superior to the sellion. Careful consideration of depth of injection and facial anatomy must be taken to avoid bruising and intravascular injection of BoTN. Additionally, in a cadaveric study looking at depth of corrugator supercilii of 32 Korean hemifaces using 3D scanning, Lee et al. found that the corrugator supercilii muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 +/-1.4 mm medially and 6.6 +/-1.4mm laterally and recommended BoTN injections at the depth of 4mm. However, no in vivo studies have been performed to validate this as the optimal depth of injection. In a split face study evaluating the depth of botulinum injection into the corrugator supercilii muscle no difference in brow height between injecting periosteally versus in superficial dermis. The investigators previously studied the ability of botulinum toxin to diffuse in crow's feet through laser pores into the target muscle. (8) In our randomized study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of BoTN for the treatment of glabellar lines when injected at a depth of 2mm (superficial dermis) versus 4mm (intramuscularly). The investigators hypothesize that no difference exists between the two depths as the 150kD botulinum toxin molecules can easily diffuse to the target at the muscle. If this is validated, patients can be treated with more superficial depths, which will result in less pain and bruising.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBipolar disorder is a chronic illness characterised by periods of illness and recovery, which can cause significant psychosocial impairment and disability. It affects more than 1% of the world population regardless of demographic characteristics such as ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status and is one of the leading causes of global disability. Bipolar disorder can cause serious cognitive and functional impairments and maintaining life with this disorder involves some difficulties for the individual. Functional impairments such as deterioration in family relationships, problems in work life and incompatibilities in social relationships negatively affect both the well-being and quality of life of the individual. Many individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder have functional disorders that can cause low quality of life. Quality of life is recognised as an important outcome measure for the effectiveness of treatment of mental disorders. Compared to healthy individuals, the quality of life of patients with bipolar disorder is significantly impaired in both the euthymic and symptomatic periods. The ability to cope with difficulties is assumed to be a protective factor for quality of life. However, individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are exposed to more stressful events due to their illness and experience coping problems, including in the euthymic period. For these reasons, developing coping skills is among the targets in the treatment process of bipolar disorder. The stress coping strategies of these individuals may even affect the risk of suicide. Bipolar disorder is a serious illness that causes increased mortality, including death by suicide. Approximately 10-20% of these individuals end their lives and approximately one third of these individuals attempt suicide at least once. Patients with bipolar disorder and previous suicide attempts have a worse quality of life. One of the most important factors associated with suicide and morbidity in bipolar disorder is impulsivity. Impulsivity, which can be defined as a predisposition to unplanned reactions to internal and external stimuli regardless of negative consequences and the absence of behavioural inhibition, is one of the clinical features of bipolar disorder. Although it is more common during manic episode, it can also be found in other mood phases. Bipolar disorder is characterised by high impulsivity even during recovery periods. Increased impulsivity is not only associated with suicide attempts but may also lead to functional impairment. Impulsive behaviours may cause long-term negative consequences in bipolar disorder that may affect quality of life. In the literature, it has been revealed that high impulsivity is associated with poor quality of life. In the light of this information, this study aimed to determine the predictive effects of impulsivity and coping skills on quality of life in patients with bipolar disorder. METHOD Sample The descriptive study is planned to be conducted in Ad\u0131yaman Besni State Hospital between October 2023-February 2024. The population of the study will consist of individuals who applied to the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Ad\u0131yaman Besni State Hospital on the dates of the study, who received outpatient treatment with the diagnosis of bipolar according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 and who were in the euthymic period according to the doctor's control. G* Power programme was used to calculate the sample size. The confidence interval \u03b1=0.05, the power of the test (1-\u03b2) 0.95, the effect size dz= 0.5 were calculated as a total of 54 people (presented in the appendix). The data will be collected by researcher Kubra Tohumcu through face-to-face interview technique. The patients constituting the sample of the study will be directed to the researcher by the outpatient clinic doctor. The data were planned to be collected by applying the Personal Information Form, Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale, Barratt Impulsivity Scale -11 Short Form and Coping Attitudes Evaluation Scale prepared by the researchers. Individual Information Form: This form, organised by the researchers, included 17 questions to determine the demographic information of the participants. Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale: Developed in 2010 by Michalak and Murray, the Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by G\u00fcm\u00fc\u015f et al.

        "summary": "Dentists have recently preferred to use composite materials and restorative techniques that allow the use of simplified clinical protocols in order to reduce the time the patient spends in the dentist's chair and minimize technical sensitivity. Color selection in the clinic is a very sensitive process and is affected by environmental factors and operator-related variables. This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. In recent years, monochromatic universal composites have been developed that are supposed to be compatible with all Vita Classic Scale shades from A1 to D4. Manufacturers report that single-color universal composites can be applied to teeth of all colors without using the layering technique using different color composites.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) and World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria.",

        "summary": "Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",

        "summary": "Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a major public health threat in China. At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients. The implementation of the project is expected to reduce the burden of HBV infection in China and contribute to the goal of global elimination of hepatitis B and C by 2030 (WHO 2030).",

The study will be conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in a small number of patients. In the second phase, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in a larger number of patients.\nThe combination therapy consists of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), anti-PD-1 antibody, and pegylated interferon (Peg-IFN\u03b1). NAs are commonly used to suppress HBV replication. Anti-PD-1 antibody is a new type of immunotherapy that can enhance the immune response against HBV. Peg-IFN\u03b1 is a type of interferon that can stimulate the immune system to fight against HBV.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the combination therapy can achieve a higher rate of sustained HBsAg loss compared to NAs alone. Sustained HBsAg loss is defined as HBsAg loss for at least 6 months after the end of treatment.

Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and follow-through. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. An archer pushes the bow with an extended arm, which is statically held in the direction of the target, while the other arm exerts a dynamic pulling of the bowstring from the beginning of the drawing phase, until the release is dynamically executed. The release phase must be well balanced and highly reproducible to achieve commendable results in a competition. The bowstring is released when an audible impulse is received from a device called clicker that is used as a draw length check. Each arrow can be drawn to an exact distance and a standard release can be obtained using the device. The clicker is reputed to improve the archer's score and used by all target archers. The archer should react to the clicker as quickly as possible.

Binge eating may increase the risk for the development of metabolic syndrome and binge-eating-disorder (BED), which is associated with severe obesity. Though several effective treatments for binge eating exist, Black women have not fared well. Not only has their inclusion in treatment trials been limited, but when participating, they are more likely to drop out, and/or lose less weight, compared to their White counterparts. Furthermore, treatment for binge eating is often not available in primary care and community-based settings places where Black women are more likely to receive treatment for their eating and weight-related concerns. Currently, there is scant intervention research to treat binge eating in Black women. With the highest rates of obesity (57%) nationally, Black women are in need of culturally-relevant treatments for binge eating and weight gain prevention. Given the established relationship between frequent binge eating and subsequent weight gain, addressing binge eating among Black women with obesity is imperative.",

Moreover, there is no information on the dose of nitrate required for performance enhancing effects during resistance exercise which limits its widespread use to enhance performance.

The investigators will also investigate the dose-response effect of beetroot juice on resistance exercise performance by providing a low, moderate, and high nitrate dose of concentrated beetroot juice. The results of this study will improve understanding of whether beetroot juice influences resistance exercise performance and will provide insight on whether different doses of beetroot juice influence the efficacy of nitrate supplementation on resistance exercise performance.

The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period.

This result led to the approval of pembrolizumab for first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS \u2265 50%, which nevertheless represents only 22% of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Early identification of biomarkers for patients unlikely to benefit from first-line pembrolizumab is therefore a crucial step in selecting suitable candidates. Furthermore, in cancer, genomic alterations in NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 result in constitutive activation of NRF2-dependent gene transcription, which promotes cellular resistance to oxidative stress, xenobiotic efflux, proliferation and metabolic reprogramming. Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 are found in 3.5-15% and 12-17% of NSCLC patients respectively.

However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.\nMethods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.\nDiscussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",

About 30% of patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction display signs of electrical dyssynchrony on ECG, usually left bundle branch block (LBBB), which is associated with a worse prognosis. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) reduce mortality for patients with dyssynchronic heart failure, defined as ejection fraction (EF) = or < 35% and LBBB. About 1/3 of the patients that fit CRT criteria will not respond to CRT. Which patients that will turn out to be non-responders cannot be anticipated beforehand.\nWe have started a clinical study to collect blood samples, heart tissue and clinical data from heart failure patients eligible for CRT and a control group of heart failure patients on medical therapy. Patients will be assessed before CRT implantation or early after initiation of medical treatment, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months.\nBlood samples and tissue will be analysed in the search for (i) biomarkers to separate CRT responders from non-responders and (ii) mechanisms behind the remodelling observed in CRT and with medical therapy.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHeart failure is a common disease with a poor prognosis. The heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body. The heart muscle is weakened and the heart is enlarged. The heart muscle is also not able to contract properly. The electrical signals that control the heart muscle are not properly transmitted. This is called dyssynchrony. Dyssynchrony is accompanied by cardiac remodeling with dilatation of the left chamber. Whether dilatation is an effect or a cause of dyssynchrony is unclear and likely different for different patients. Cardiac resynchronization therapy, CRT, is a pacemaker with an extra electrode that will stimulate the right and left ventricle simultaneously, resulting in resynchronization. We have started a clinical study to collect blood samples, heart tissue and clinical data (echocardiography, ECG, medical records) from heart failure patients eligible for CRT and a control group of heart failure patients on medical therapy. Patients will be assessed before CRT implantation or early after initiation of medical treatment, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A subset of the patients in the CRT group will also also be subjected to a heart biopsy before CRT implantation and at 3 months. At each time point all patients will be assessed with echocardiography, ECG and blood sampling. The blood samples will be analyzed regarding proteins and exosomal miRNA. The heart tissue will be frozen and analyzed regarding proteins, RNA and contractility. Endothelial function is also known to play a crucial role in heart failure and will be evaluated at inclusion, 3 and 12 months using EndoPAT.

The investigators hypothesize that nudges to patients and alerts to nurses will improve patient-level PRO completion and clinician-level PRO engagement.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nRoutine PRO monitoring is an evidence-based practice that improves patient outcomes. Patients with cancer commonly experience symptoms which go unrecognized by clinical teams up to half of the time. PROs are a powerful tool to bridge this gap, amplifying the patient experience and improving communication between patients and clinicians. A seminal clinical trial was conducted in which weekly PRO symptom assessments with care team alerts led to reduced care utilization, improved quality of life, and lengthened overall survival among patients receiving active treatment for advanced solid tumors. Subsequent randomized trials have corroborated the quality of life and survival advantages of PRO monitoring in other cancer populations and practice settings. Real-world adherence to PRO monitoring is lower than in seminal clinical trials, with potential racial/ethnic disparities. Multilevel barriers to PRO implementation exist at the patient, clinician, practice, and system levels. While patient adherence to PRO monitoring in seminal trials ranged from 70 to 90 percent, real-world adherence is much lower and more variable. Our preliminary research demonstrates that in a large, multi-site rollout of PRO monitoring, mean patient-level adherence was less than 50 percent. Moreover, compared to non-Hispanic White patients, Black and Hispanic patients were 9% and 4% less likely to complete PRO questionnaires, respectively, but more likely to report more severe symptoms. These results highlight that historically marginalized subgroups may benefit less from current methods of PRO administration, potentially reinforcing existing disparities in symptom management if not remediated. This will be the first study to apply behavioral economic strategies to align clinicians and patients in achieving sustained patient-level PRO adherence, and addresses limitations of current PRO approaches. Current approaches to PRO collection are limited by: (1) suboptimal clinician engagement, (2) encounter-based assessments which preclude longitudinal monitoring of PROs outside of the clinic, and (3) insufficient automated effectors actively linking reported symptoms with clinical response. This proposal addresses these limitations by employing behavioral strategies directly targeting clinician engagement, utilizing novel electronic remote monitoring methods to maximize real-time PRO capture, and linking these with pathway-driven automated effectors.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Prognostic awareness among patients with life-limiting diseases has been shown to be associated with less depression, better quality of care and earlier referral to palliative care. Moreover, accurate understanding of their illness may support patients to make informed decisions about their future in alignment with their preferences, values or needs. Supportive care in cancer is the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. This includes management of physical and psychological symptoms and side effects. Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) is a relatively new initiative implementing early supportive care in patients with advanced cancer. Although studies have shown that a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer remain unaware that their disease is not curable, research regarding prognostic awareness in patients referred to Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) services is still scarce. A deeper knowledge of the factors and patient characteristics associated with prognostic awareness is an important first step to develop interventions to improve prognostic communication and thereby to facilitate delivery of high-quality ESC. General aim: The ESC team at University College London Hospital is embedded within the oncology outpatient service, providing specialist symptom control and Advanced Care Planning to patients with advanced cancer. The primary aim of this study is to better understand the prognostic awareness of patients referred to the ESC service. A secondary aim is to evaluate the relationship between patients' prognostic awareness and levels of psychological distress, quality of life, trust in medical professionals and perceived quality of care. Patient population: Consecutive adult patients with advanced cancer referred to the ESC service will be eligible to participate. Patients unable to complete questionnaires due to cognitive impairment such as dementia will be excluded. Patients who have already been referred to community palliative care services will also be excluded. Methods: This will be a cross-sectional prospective study. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by members of the ESC team and will be informed about the study. Interested patients will then discuss the study with the research team and will be invited to participate. After informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete a questionnaire which will cover their level of prognostic awareness, psychological symptoms, and quality of life). The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire can be completed online via RedCap. Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is the level of patients' prognostic awareness, which will be assessed by the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire. This questionnaire has previously been successfully used in research to assess patients' information preferences, perceptions about their prognosis and the goals of therapy and communication preferences about end-of-life care. Secondary endpoints will be (a) patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information assessed through the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire (b) symptoms of depression evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), (c) symptoms of anxiety evaluated through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), (d) quality of life and (d) patients' trust in their medical team and (e) other aspects of perceived quality of care, rated on a visual analogue scale (NRS) from 0-10. Sample size and statistics: The investigators will conduct univariable and multivariable regression analyses to evaluate associations between sociodemographic or clinical variables and outcomes. The investigators aim to include 100 patients. This will give us at least 10 degrees of freedom to assess association of potential risk factors with outcome and to evaluate confounders in a multivariable analysis. Discussion: This will be the first prospective study to assess prognostic awareness among cancer patients referred to ESC services in a British setting. Identifying covariates for prognostic unawareness and psychological burden among patients with advanced cancer will inform the future development of strategies to improve care and communication with this patient group.",

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended.

One potential way to address this challenge is to offer community-based services for individuals who are high-utilizers of expensive emergency and inpatient psychiatric services. Due to the decentralized nature of California governance, responsibility for mental health services falls primarily to the individual counties. The County of Santa Clara, CA invests significantly in community-based services as well as 24-hour care settings.

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination.

The nature of this scarring in humans has been subject to limited study and generally only by indirect means such as cardiac MRI scans or measuring the voltage of the tissues. During cardiothoracic surgery, tissue from the left atrium is removed as a part of the procedure. This tissue is normally disposed of, but we would propose to consent patients to collect it to allow it to be analysed. Such analysis would examine the composition of the tissue, including the pattern of scarring, to allow us to gain a greater insight into the mechanisms of AF.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the UK, affecting over 1 million people. It is associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk of stroke and a 3-fold increase in the risk of death. The risk of stroke is related to the presence of a clot in the left atrial appendage (LAA), which is a small pouch of the left atrium. The LAA is the most common site of stroke in patients with AF. The current treatment for stroke prevention in patients with AF is anticoagulation with warfarin or newer anticoagulants. However, these treatments are associated with a risk of bleeding. Surgical exclusion of the LAA is a well-recognised part of routine surgical practice for patients with AF. During cardiac surgery, a randomised trial has shown that surgical exclusion of the LAA is associated with a 2.2% reduction in ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism. Therefore, surgical exclusion of the LAA, which in the latter study was most commonly achieved by excision, is a well-recognised part of routine surgical practice for patients with AF. During lung resections for malignancies, irrespective of a history of AF, along with the part of the lung being resected, the pulmonary vein and surrounding portion of the left atrium are also removed. These operations therefore provide tissue which is known to be of great importance in promoting and sustaining AF, but which is normally discarded. In the current study proposal, we will obtain this tissue and analyse it histologically. In the first instance, as a pilot study of up to 10 patients to assess the feasibility of such an analysis. This sample size is informed by our previous basic science studies of cardiac and lung fibrosis and will inform the design of a future full study. We aim to obtain samples from patients in sinus rhythm (thoracic surgical patients) and varying durations of AF (all surgical cases) to encompass tissues with different degrees of fibrosis.

In all cases, the patients would be undergoing surgery where the tissue being studied in the protocol would normally be removed.

Today, organ transplantation procedures are carried out successfully in many centers in our country. Liver transplantation has become the most effective treatment method for acute and chronic liver failure due to different reasons. The life expectancy of individuals with advanced liver disease, which was limited to months before liver transplantation, was extended with liver transplantation and the quality of life was improved with this treatment method. However, since most of the organ transplants are made from genetically different donors, tissue compatibility between the donor and the recipient remains a problem. Therefore, the recipient's immune response to donor graft antigens should be considered. In recent years, the application of advanced surgery and new immunosuppressive approaches has made it possible to successfully transplant almost any vital organ or tissue.

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent. We propose that rintatolimod/durvalumab-combination therapy is feasible and may induce synergistic anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.",

        "summary": "The potential benefits of exercise for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and pain have been well documented in the scientific literature. Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Currently, there are still few studies that have evaluated the effects of flavonoids on the development and evolution of DOMS in humans.",

The study will consist of two experimental groups, made up of healthy individuals, who will perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol, as follows: 1) control group that will receive placebo supplementation (corn starch tablets at a concentration of 750 mg); and 2) intervention group that will receive supplementation with diosmin (tablets at a concentration of 750 mg). Treatment of study participants will occur orally, and everyone will ingest identical opaque capsules containing placebo or diosmin with water. The treatment protocol will be applied before the start (pre-treatment) of the intense dynamic exercise sessions, once a day, during the two days before, and on the day (immediately before) the execution of the exercise protocol. Each experimental group will consist of approximately 20 participants. The project is approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) for Human Beings/Brazil Platform(protocol number 64025122.2.0000.0108). The selected participants will be informed about the objectives and methodology of the study and when there is agreement with the proposed design, the agreement to voluntarily participate in the study will be registered by means of an Informed Consent Form. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed (concentric and eccentric contractions) for the study will follow the following approach: participants will perform a standardized muscle injury protocol that will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until fatigue of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45\u00b0 angle. Each The participant will have their load previously defined through the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) test, and 70% of the defined weight will be used during the intense dynamic exercise protocol. During each action, the load will be resisted with the legs placed on the leg-press supporter from full knee extension to the 90\u00b0 knee flexion angle, lasting approximately 3-5 seconds. Between each series, participants will be able to take a 1-minute rest period. The intense dynamic exercise protocol that will be carried out by all participants will be supervised by the project manager and/or collaborators duly trained for such assessments. Participants' clinical signs will be monitored frequently during the activities and in case of discomfort, the activity will be stopped immediately. Analyzes of clinical and blood parameters will be carried out before the start (baseline) and after the end of the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol (24 and 48 hours) aiming to investigate the possible effects of diosmin on DOMS and related pathological events.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground/rational: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood disability with a prevalence of 2.11 per 1000 live births in high income countries. CP enfolds a group of developmental disorders of movement and posture, attributed to non-progressive disturbances which occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. An advanced treatment option for individuals with severe CP is Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) treatment. This treatment can be considered when other options, such as oral medication, are insufficient or cause side effects. Previous studies have shown mostly low level evidence for the effect of ITB on spasticity in children with spastic CP. For children with dyskinetic CP, The Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC previously conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial, which provides evidence for the effect of ITB on attaining personal treatment goals after three months of ITB treatment. It was furthermore found that after one year of ITB treatment, personal treatment goals were at least partially achieved in 97% of children and adolescents. Not all children show similar response to ITB: some benefit more than others in attaining treatment goals. The investigators previous research on the effect of ITB in children with dyskinetic CP, found that a higher level of dystonia prior to ITB and reduction of pain during ITB were associated, for a small part, with attainment of treatment goals. Sample size was not sufficient to look at specific factors associated with specific types of treatment goals. For example, goals on the level of personal care could be influenced by other factors than goals related to sitting or transfers. Long-term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with spastic and dyskinetic CP have not yet been described in literature. Furthermore, knowing which factors influence outcome on the long term, preferably related to specific types of treatment goals, can be used to inform and select children and adolescents with CP better before initiating ITB. In order to accomplish these goals prospectively, real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals. The overall aim of the register is to provide personalized, value-based care for children with CP. In the Netherlands CP register, a follow-up registration program is combined with treatment registration. Prospective data collection in the treatment registration will allow us to implement standardised assessment protocols in the two academic medical centres in the Netherlands where baclofen pump implantations are performed, the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC) in Amsterdam and Maastricht UMC (MUMC)in Maastricht. Objectives: The primary research question of this study is: 1. What is the short- (3 months), medium- (1 year) and long-term (2 years) effect of ITB in children with CP on personal treatment goals? Secondary objectives are: What is the association between the effect on personal treatment goals and on spasticity and/or dystonia? Which factors are associated with treatment success of ITB in children with CP? Study design A prospective observational study will be conducted in Amsterdam UMC and the MUMC using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. It is anticipated that in these centres 15 to 20 pumps will be implanted in children and adolescents annually. Over the total study period of 4,5 years, we aim to include a total of 67 to 90 children. The Medical Ethics Review Committee (MEC) of the Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center (IRB00002991) has stated that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) does not apply to the study and that further official approval by the MEC is waived.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nFibercolonoscopy, as a terminal examination method for lower digestive tract diseases, often brings different degrees of pain and discomfort, tension and anxiety to patients. Therefore, at present, intravenous anesthesia is often used in clinical practice to reduce discomfort, and intravenous propofol combined with fentanyl is the most widely used in clinical practice. But intravenous general anesthesia can lead to hemodynamic fluctuations and an increase in anesthesiation-related complications such as longer stays in the hospital after surgery. Complications related to sedation and analgesia have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Studies have shown that most of the adverse events in endoscopy are related to the sedation and analgesia drugs used. With the successful application of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in the field of postoperative analgesia, this technique has also been used in the sedation and analgesia of gastroenteroscopy in recent years. Propofol has the characteristics of quick action, short time of action and rapid recovery, so it is very suitable for the anesthesia and sedation of painless abortion and painless gastroenteroscopy. Remifentanil, as an opioid \u03bc receptor agonist, is easily hydrolyzed rapidly by non-specific esterases in plasma and tissues due to the ester bond contained in its chemical structure. Therefore, it has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics such as rapid intravenous injection, small volume of distribution, rapid clearance after drug withdrawal, no accumulation, metabolism is not affected by liver and kidney function, and has been widely used in various surgeries in recent years, especially in the anesthesia of short surgeries.\nThe purpose of this study is to compare the sedation and analgesia effects of propofol and remifentanil mixed solution and intravenous combined anesthesia in fiber colonoscopy.\nThe study is a prospective, randomized, controlled study. The subjects are 100 patients who need fiber colonoscopy. The patients are divided into two groups: the controlled analgesia/sedation group and the intravenous combined anesthesia group. The controlled analgesia/sedation group is given a mixture of propofol and remifentanil, and the intravenous combined anesthesia group is given intravenous fentanyl, midazolam and propofol. The sedation and analgesia effects of the two groups are compared.",

Therefore, we want to run a pilot study to test specific psychotherapeutic interventions for patients with psychosis on acute psychiatric wards.\nThe method of Motivational Interviewing is a well-known and established interviewing technique, which originally comes from the treatment of addictive disorders. In our study, it is used to strengthen the therapeutic alliance between patient and practitioner already in the acute phase of the disease, to increase adherence, and thus to achieve the overall goal of better integrating patients with pronounced positive symptoms into treatment.

        "summary": "Chromosomal instability (CIN) refers to ongoing chromosome segregation errors throughout consecutive cell divisions. CIN is a hallmark of human cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis, metastasis, and therapeutic resistance. Analyzing CIN of the DNA extracted from cast-off cells in bile samples seems a promising method for diagnosing, monitoring, and predicting the prognosis of biliary tract carcinoma patients. CIN can be assessed using experimental techniques such as bulk DNA sequencing, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), or conventional karyotyping. However, these techniques are either time-consuming or non-specific. The investigators here intend to study whether a new method named Bile Ultrasensitive Chromosomal Aneuploidy Detection (BileCAD), which is based on low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, can be used to analyze CIN and microbial infection analysis thus help diagnosing and treating biliary tract carcinoma patients.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBiliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis. The early clinical symptoms lack specificity, and they are often found in late stage with poor prognosis. CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially way to detect CIN in the cast-off cells from the bile samples for diagnosing and monitoring biliary tract carcinoma patients. BileCAD is a new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from bile, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of biliary tract carcinoma patients. The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing bile samples from gallbladder cancers and cholangiocarcinoma patients and control groups that without any tumor in the Bile duct and gallbladder or other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of BileCAD test for diagnosing biliary tract carcinoma to other modalities, such as pathological diagnosis.

        "summary": "Schizophrenia represents a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, with this burden disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings. We will address the following aims: 1) evaluate whether the use of the mindLAMP digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness of task-shared community-based psychosocial rehabilitation (COPSI) for individuals with schizophrenia, and 2) determine whether the addition of mindLAMP to the delivery of the COPSI program has an impact on implementation metrics when compared to delivery of COPSI alone.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSchizophrenia is one of the leading causes of disability due to mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as India, with this burden disproportionately impacting lower income individuals who primarily access health care services through publicly run facilities. In 2017, it was estimated that there were over 3.5 million people in India living with schizophrenia, with an increasing prevalence of schizophrenia observed from 1990 to 2017 as the population ages and disease burden shifts to chronic conditions experienced in adulthood. Importantly, the burden of disability due to schizophrenia is often underestimated as many epidemiological studies do not adequately account for the added burden of chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes that disproportionately impact individuals living with schizophrenia. Globally, the dramatically reduced life expectancy observed among individuals living with schizophrenia is largely due to preventable and treatable medical conditions. Recent epidemiological studies in India have further observed a mortality rate among individuals living with schizophrenia that is twice the rate observed in the general population, with calls for greater efforts to address this significant health disparity. In addition to recognizing the need to address the alarming care gap, where in India it is estimated that upwards of 75% of individuals living with schizophrenia do not have access to essential mental health care, urgent attention is also needed towards responding to the medical and physical health needs of this vulnerable patient population. Psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness and integration of task shared delivery of the evidence-based COPSI (Community care for People with Schizophrenia in India) program in primary care. We will build on important preliminary work led by project collaborators to support our aims to evaluate whether a novel digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness (Aim 1) and the integration (Aim 2) of an evidence-based psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India.",

For this purpose, our study showed that these patients had globular physical examination screening and postoperative 2-6. it aims to prevent postoperative urinary retention by applying hot and cold Decontamination to the bladders of patients who cannot urinate spontaneously between hours.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nOrthopedic surgery is a surgical treatment method based on the correction of the functions of bones, November muscles, tendons, and ligaments in the body. Arthroplasty (hip, knee, shoulder), arthroscopy (meniscopathy, rotator cuff rupture), limb fractures, structural (hallux vagus, hallux rigidities, carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger), and developmental (hip dysplasia) dysfunctions are the interventions in which the orthopedic surgical procedure is performed. In orthopedic surgeries, the need for surgical treatment increases every day as a result of degeneration in the musculoskeletal system with a decrease in mobilization due to advancing age, November illness, trauma, or technological developments. In the United States, 30% of major surgical interventions involve orthopedic surgeries performed on elderly individuals); in Turkey, it is reported that 33.5% of orthopedic surgeries are performed due to trauma, and about 48% are performed on the lower extremities. Orthopedic surgeries are practices that risk serious complications, as with any treatment option. Complications such as nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension, and postoperative urinary retention (PUR), especially due to spinal anesthesia, may be observed in patients receiving treatment due to orthopedic surgery. While the prevalence of PUR in orthopedic surgeries is 6-40% in the literature, it is stated that this rate is higher (6-60%) after spinal anesthesia. Due to PUR after orthopedic surgery, there is an increase in hospital stay times, susceptibility to infection, deterioration in the quality of life, and associated cost increases. Postoperative urinary retention is a complication that manifests symptoms with problems such as suprapubic pain, bladder spasm, and/or inability to urinate after surgical treatment. The etiology of PUR includes factors caused by the patient (advanced age, male gender, anatomical problems, comorbidity, neural transmission disorders), due to the surgical process (failure to empty the bladder during the preoperative period, surgery lasts longer than 2 hours, emergency surgery, opioid-NSAID-atropine use, amount of fluid taken) and due to anesthesia (epidural/spinal anesthesia). 2-6 of the postoperative period. it gives symptoms as a result of the absence of the first urine decrement between hours. As a result, serious problems such as increased urinary pressure and acute kidney injury and/or dysfunction due to bladder distension occur in patients. Management of PUR can be achieved by using physical examination (globe monitoring), bladder catheterization, and ultrasonographic (USG) methods to diagnose these problems at an early stage. Field health professionals, who have an important place in the conduct of health services, offer the greatest contribution to the surgical treatment process with their understanding of quality health care. In particular, nurses who are actively involved in the perioperative process are the professional staff with the greatest responsibility for positively managing health care. Nurses help to ensure the patient's comfort as soon as possible by providing multidisciplinary cooperation in the management of complications that develop during this process. For this purpose, nurses need to carry out the necessary practices and precautions against the risk of developing PUR, which is one of the postoperative complications. In the recently published Nursing Regulation, the nurses' authority to manage PUR is clearly stated as interventions to be implemented by a nursing decision as A nurse can decide independently or jointly with a physician to insert and remove a urinary catheter if she cannot eliminate urinary retention with the interventions she can apply, Hot-cold application intervention definition is clearly stated. Therefore, nurses evaluate the patient by reviewing the existing risk factors of the patient and surgical process during the perioperative period, providing emotional support for surgical stress, questioning perioperative fluid intake, informing the patient about the consumption of caffeine-containing drinks and plenty of water, monitor urine postoperatively, prefer non-invasive methods (listening to water sound, relaxation, bladder massage, mobilization, hot-cold application, ko mot/duck/sliders) primarily in case of PURE development, and invasive methods as a last resort (urinary catheterization, ensuring the necessary cooperation with the physician for interventional applications is one of the important responsibilities in",

However, a direct comparative analysis between Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization is conspicuously absent, prompting this study to unveil potential distinctions in their impact on shoulder pain, range of motion, and functional mobility. The research design involves the random allocation of participants into two groups: Group A, receiving Gong's mobilization, and Group B, undergoing Kaltenborn's mobilization. This allocation will be done through a lottery method, ensuring a fair and unbiased selection process. Participants in both groups will also receive routine physical therapy, including 15 minutes of electrical muscle stimulation with heat therapy. This approach, supported by existing literature, aims to create a standardized baseline for assessing the additional impact of mobilization techniques.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. HBV-related HCC is the most common type of HCC in Asia and Africa. Radiotherapy (RT) is a standard treatment for HCC patients with intermediate-stage disease. However, the residual tumors and early recurrence/metastasis after RT compromise the patient survival. Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCerebral palsy (CP) is primarily a neuromotor disorder that affects the development of movement, muscle tone and posture. The underlying pathophysiology is an injury to the developing brain in the prenatal through neonatal period. Although the initial neuro pathologic lesion is non-progressive, children with cerebral palsy may develop a range of secondary conditions over time that will variably affect their functional abilities. The prevalence of CP varies between 1.5 to more than 4 cases per 1,000 live births worldwide. The motor impairments associated with CP can range from mild to severe, affecting different muscle groups and leading to difficulties in activities of daily living and participation in social and recreational activities. Children with CP often experience motor impairments that affect their gross motor function, leading to limitations in activities and participation. These motor impairments can also have a negative impact on bone health, resulting in reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of skeletal complications. Gross motor function refers to the ability to perform coordinated movements using large muscle groups, such as walking, running, and jumping. It is a key aspect of physical ability and independence in daily activities for children with CP. Previous research has shown that gross motor function is closely associated with bone health in this population. However, further investigation is needed to explore the specific nature of this correlation and its implications for intervention strategies. Gross motor function is commonly assessed using standardized tools such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical, psychological, and social well-being. In the context of cerebral palsy, understanding the impact of gross motor function on quality of life is crucial for comprehensive care and intervention planning. Children with CP may face limitations in mobility, participation in activities, and social interactions, which can significantly affect their overall quality of life. Exploring the relationship between gross motor function and quality of life can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the holistic well-being of children with CP. The quality of life in children with CP is not only influenced by their motor function but also by their overall health and well-being. Bone health plays a crucial role in maintaining the physical abilities and independence of individuals, as well as their overall quality of life. Impaired bone health in children with CP can lead to limitations in mobility, increased pain, and reduced participation in activities, which can have a significant impact on their overall well-being. Bone mineral density, on the other hand, is an important measure of bone strength and overall skeletal health. Children with CP often exhibit lower BMD compared to typically developing peers due to factors such as reduced weight-bearing activities, muscle weakness, altered biomechanics, limited mobility, and hormonal imbalances. This reduced BMD increases their susceptibility to fractures and skeletal deformities, further impacting their functional abilities and quality of life.",

        "summary": "Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroid patients have a thyroid hormone deficiency characterized by a shortage of thyroid hormone (TH) in the circulation and at the organ level and are normally treated with a synthetic form of thyroid hormone (L-T4 or levothyroxine). Thyroxine (T4) is a prohormone, produced by the thyroid gland and converted into the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. A minor percentage (20%) of circulating T3 is directly produced by the thyroid gland. Although L-T4 treatment accounts for all patients with hypothyroidism, the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism differs. Most patients suffer from primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), which is an auto-immune disorder, but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease are commonly seen. Currently, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are measured in serum to monitor the treatment efficacy of L-T4. TSH is produced by the pituitary to stimulate the production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland and due to the negative feedback loop considered as a good reflection of thyroid hormone status. Target concentrations of TSH and fT4 differ depending on the cause of hypothyroidism. In patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, TSH concentrations are measured to monitor treatment and TSH levels within the reference intervals are pursued. TSH is measured to monitor treatment in patients with hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma as well, although a suppressed TSH is warranted in this group. The extent of TSH suppression is determined based on the type and stage of the carcinoma. In patients who are hypothyroid due to therapy of Graves' disease, other target values apply. Patients who are just diagnosed with Graves' disease start with thyroid suppressive therapy together with thyroid hormone supplementation (L-T4) and show a prolonged suppressed TSH; therefore, fT4 is initially used to monitor therapy. TSH is used to monitor treatment again when TSH starts to normalize. Nevertheless, TSH shall always be slightly suppressed due to the TSH receptor antibodies produced during Graves' disease, which means fT4 concentration is still taken into account during follow-up. Finally, it is not possible to monitor treatment by using TSH concentrations in patients with central hypothyroidism, which means fT4 concentrations are leading in this group. In conclusion, TSH cannot always be used to assess thyroid function in which cases fT4 is assessed as well. It is known that patients using L-T4 can show a combination of fT4 values above the upper reference limit and non-suppressed or only slightly suppressed TSH levels. The most likely explanation for this is twofold. First, thyroid hormones are supplemented by L-T4, which only replaces T4, whereas the production of the active thyroid hormone T3 by the thyroid gland is lacking and the patients depend on peripheral conversion of T4. Literature showed that these patients need a higher L-T4 dosage to obtain a normal, or even somewhat lower, concentration of T3. TSH is regulated by changes in T3 rather than T4, clarifying the lack of pituitary feedback to increased fT4 concentrations if fT3 concentrations are not increased simultaneously. Second, previous studies showed that fT4 levels peak two until four hours after L-T4 intake and gradually decline until the next dosage is taken. Sometimes, this peak increases above the upper limit of the reference interval. This pattern is not seen for TSH levels. Looking at aforementioned outcomes, it seems that fT4 levels are higher in patients using L-T4 compared to healthy controls, thus not reflecting thyroid hormone status adequately. In clinical practice, the largest group of hypothyroid patients are monitored by measuring TSH as mentioned above. Therefore, these high fT4 levels will only rarely cause problems. However, these high fT4 levels can have treatment consequences in patient groups wherein therapy is monitored via fT4 levels (e.g. central hypothyroidism), which could lead to unwarranted dose adjustments (leading to a too low dose of L-T4).",

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.",

Specifically, we will test the effects of an expressive writing (EW) intervention. The basic paradigm asks participants to write for 20 minutes on four separate occasions about a trauma or stressor. Initial work conducted with undergraduate samples showed benefit of EW. Since then, EW studies have been conducted across a variety of populations including persons coping with chronic illness. Benefits have ranged from better lung function among asthmatics to fewer physical symptoms among women with breast cancer.

Patients will be excluded if they are <18 years old, have a history of prior chest surgeries, coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, and have a history of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Patients will also be excluded if they are chronically anticoagulated, are on antiplatelet medications or have ever had an adverse reaction to IV TXA. All patients who are being scheduled to undergo bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction will be recruited to participate in the study. Patients will be consented to participate in the preoperative visit. Experimental Group: Patients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Postoperative care will be standard and based on established UCSF guidelines. Control Group: Patients in the control group will not receive any TXA intraoperatively and will undergo a traditional GAM. Tranexamic Acid is available as a sterile, single-dose. This 1g vial is readily available in the anesthesia cart in the operating room. Immediately following induction, the anesthesia team will administer 1g of TXA intravenously. After obtaining hemostasis and irrigating as per standard practice, anesthesia shall not use any other hemostatic agents. Post-procedure, each patient will be provided with standard postoperative instructions which will include a chart to record daily drain outputs for the right and left sides. At subsequent postoperative visits, drain output will be assessed at each clinic visit to determine timing for removal. The total drain output will be measured by the patient and later logged into our chart for later analysis. Drains will be removed per standard practice at our institution which is when they have produced < 30cc/day for at least 3 days. At each clinic visit, the investigators will assess for clinical signs of hematoma and seroma, and objectively measure aggregate drain output. Demographic data, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes such as hematoma, seroma, drain output, wound complications, surgical site infections, and thromboembolic events will be recorded and analyzed. These outcomes will be evaluated in the immediate 3-month postoperative period, with a 1-year follow-up review of patient charts. The primary outcomes will include the presence of hematoma, seroma, and drain output, and time to drain removal, while the secondary outcomes will consist of thromboembolic events and wound complications. Patients will be managed for hematoma and seroma as per standard procedure, whether with ultrasound, clinic aspiration, IR drain placement, or return to the operating room as deemed necessary by the senior surgeon.",

        "summary": "Persistent smell loss that can include diminished or distorted smell function is a common symptom of long COVID syndrome. There are limited treatment options for long COVID-related smell loss. This study aims to determine the efficacy of two at-home treatments, smell training and non-invasive trigeminal nerve stimulation. This study requires participants to conduct daily at-home treatment sessions, attend three in-person study visits at the MUSC Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, and complete electronic questionnaires over the 12-week trial, and again at the six-month timepoint. Participants in this trial may benefit directly with an improvement in sense of smell. However, participation may also help society more generally, as this study will provide new information about long COVID-related smell loss and its treatment.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSudden smell loss (SL), a hallmark feature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-coV-2/COVID), frequently persists well past the initial recovery; rates of unresolved anosmia (total loss) are 21%, with unresolved hyposmia (reduced smell) or parosmia (distorted smell) higher at nearly 50%. SL is now recognized as a core symptom of long COVID (LC), which also includes other impairments in mood, cognition, and sleep. Given that SL itself can negatively impact many of the same problems being recognized in the symptomatology of LC, it is likely that SL is both a symptom of LC and a contributing factor that worsens other LC symptoms. As such, successful treatment of SL could also help to improve these other LC symptoms. Smell/olfactory training (ST) is currently being studied as a treatment for COVID-related SL. Classic ST requires twice daily practice of sniffing odorants over the course of 3 months to regenerate olfactory neurons, engage smell-related cognitive functions, and retrain the brain to smell. ST is promising as a stand-alone treatment. However, its limitations include the burden of many months of daily practice that often leads to sub-optimal compliance and dropout. The current study aims to determine whether the benefits of ST can be accelerated and enhanced by using a novel, adjunct neuromodulatory intervention to conventional ST. Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) is a non-invasive, pain-free, method of neuromodulation that delivers low levels of electrical stimulation to the trigeminal circuit, having potential to enhance smell function through activation of the highly connected olfactory-intranasal trigeminal brain circuits. Prior work demonstrated TNS-enhanced psychophysical detection of odorants. Yet the effects of TNS are extensive, i.e. improved executive functioning (e.g. attention), sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness, as well as therapeutic efficacy across a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, TNS-as an adjunct to ST-may not only improve overall efficacy and speed of recovery of SL, but may help to treat some of the other symptoms of LC that ST, and improvement in smell function, may not fully resolve. This randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of ST and combination TNS and ST in adults with COVID-related SL will use a 3- group design: Group 1) Active ST (N=60), Group 2) Placebo ST (PBO, N=60), and Group 3) Active TNS plus Active ST (N=60). Our primary objectives are to 1) determine the efficacy of ST versus potential natural gains in function, 2) determine the TNS-enhanced effects of ST on SL, and 3) determine whether TNS+ST is more efficacious than ST in treating the other symptoms of LC.",

        "summary": "The proposed project seeks to achieve four objectives that will, collectively, evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP-1) -a model for a home visitation and case management program for parents who used substances during pregnancy. First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families. With a strong backing by state agencies and community partners, the evaluation of PCAP-1 will contribute to a knowledge gap in the field for in-home program models serving a highly vulnerable population with high rates of child welfare involvement and use of foster care.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP) in preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. PCAP is a three-year, intensive case management intervention for pregnant and postpartum individuals who have used substances during their current or most recent pregnancy. PCAP provides mothers with a case manager with whom they meet biweekly, in the home or in other community settings. Case managers coach mothers in setting their own goals and taking steps to achieve them, provide practical assistance, serve as role models, and offer emotional support and encouragement. They connect mothers to community resources and recovery supports tailored to the participant's needs and goals. On average, case managers carry a caseload of 16 mothers/families, receive at least biweekly individual clinical supervision by a master's-level clinician, biweekly group supervision, and individual consultation with their supervisor whenever needed. Case managers work with the mother and the child with prenatal substance exposure and other family members in support of the participant's goals and recovery. This project seeks to evaluate a one-year version of PCAP (PCAP-1), aligned with the time frame of the FFPSA federal matching funds for prevention programs with evidence of effectiveness for purposes of prevention of the need for foster care and promotion of reunification. The specific objectives of this project are to: Establish causal evidence of effectiveness of PCAP-1 in preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification Establish causal evidence of the effectiveness of PCAP-1 in achieving other key goals: (a) Parent achieves and stays in recovery, (b) Parent accesses comprehensive services to meet needs to achieve and maintain a healthy family life, and (c) Subsequent substance-exposed pregnancies are prevented. Estimate cost savings associated with PCAP-1 from the perspective of the agency administering a state's child welfare system. Lay the groundwork to be rated by relevant federal registries according to strength of the program's evidence of effectiveness for purposes of sustainability, spread, and replication. In 2021, PCAP and a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the benefits of the program was implemented in Oklahoma. Two Oklahoma sites began enrolling clients in late 2022. Each site will enroll 100 participants, randomly assigned to the experimental groups: treatment and control (services as usual). The project proposed herein will complement the ongoing RCT but offers the important additional benefit of adapting and extending PCAP to a third study site and evaluating a one-year version of PCAP. This adaptation is important because client and case manager mindsets and priorities may be very different when faced with a one-year time frame rather than a three-year time frame. Furthermore, a one-year version of PCAP is more consistent with the Adoption and Safe Families Act timelines for permanency hearings to start to establish the permanency plan for a child in foster care. Using the recruitment strategies described above, 40 eligible people will be recruited into PCAP-1 at a third PCAP site. The one-year intervention will take place over the three-year project period, with enrollment into PCAP-1 occurring on a rolling basis over the first two years of this study. Two case managers will each be assigned 20 PCAP-1 participants over the study period to avoid the n=1 confounding problem. This quasi-experimental design incorporates a control group to compare one-year outcomes with the PCAP-1 participants. The approximately 40 people making up the control group will come from the original PCAP study. As such, all control group participants are placed in that group based on random assignment in the original, ongoing trial, while all new referrals for PCAP-1 will receive PCAP-1 services. The control group will complete the same surveys, and at the same time period, as the PCAP-1 participants for direct comparisons between groups. This will involve adding a new data collection period for current control participants in the original trial. Although the control group is enrolled in a three-year study, their experiences during the first year likely suffice as a suitable control group for the proposed study, particularly as recruitment strategies and study eligibility are the same in both studies. The control group will be matched with the PCAP-1 treatment group based on characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The long- and short-form Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and the investigator-created Self-Administered Survey (SAS) will capture outcome data about individuals in both the PCAP-1 and control groups.

        "summary": "Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is well-recognized to be extremely distressing and stressful for the patient and family. As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAutism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 54 children in the United States. Autism is characterized by social communication deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Autism is a lifelong disorder that affects the individual's ability to function in daily life. The prevalence of autism is higher in Hispanic/Latino children than in non-Hispanic/Latino children. Hispanic/Latino children are also less likely to receive early intervention services, which can result in poorer outcomes, decreased quality of life, and increased parental and financial stress. Many autism interventions were developed and tested with only White participants, assuming they could be transferable to minority populations. However, research has found that this is not the case and that interventions that are not adapted to an individual's culture and ethnicity do not work as well and are not used as frequently. In this project, we compare two methods of stakeholder engagement, Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG), to determine which is better at getting input on the facilitators and barriers to access therapy for autistic children. We focus on Hispanics and Latinos as this is the largest minority group in the US, with one of the fastest-growing groups of autistic children. Our long-term objective is to improve the functional skills and health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and their families by improving access to an occupational therapy intervention designed to improve daily living skills, socialization, and quality of life. Occupational therapy using Ayres Sensory Integration (OT/ASI) is the only evidence-based intervention that addresses the sensory symptoms in autism. We will use input from these engagement sessions to adapt two versions of the OT/ASI manual: one using DT data and the other using FG data. Outcomes are evaluated following each step. Following the completion of this project, the planned outputs of the study are data on the most effective minority stakeholder engagement method and a culturally adapted OT/ASI manual for Hispanic and Latino autistic children for clinicians and researchers. This information can support future researchers who are engaging Hispanic/Latino individuals or other minority groups in research. Methods: A randomized mixed methods design is used to evaluate stakeholder engagement methods. Phase one will compare two stakeholder engagement methods (Design Thinking -DT, and Focus Group - FG) and evaluate stakeholder engagement based on the PCORI areas of stakeholder engagement which are operationalized in the Stakeholder-Centric Engagement Evaluation and qualitative data. Phase two utilizes data from phase one to culturally adapt the intervention (two separate intervention protocols will be adapted - one based on FG data and another based on DT data as described below), and obtain stakeholder input on acceptability and feasibility for the Hispanic/Latino autistic population. This provides a second way to measure the effectiveness of each stakeholder engagement method as we will have data to indicate which method (DT or FG) resulted in the highest-rated protocol. The data provided by this study will be used as a basis for a later comparative effectiveness study that will study the culturally adapted protocol's outcomes. All sessions will be held in Spanish and/or English based on the groups' preferences. Since our intent is to hear the voices of Hispanic/Latino stakeholders, it seems valuable to hold focus groups in Spanish when the participants are Spanish as first language speakers (hereafter referred to as Spanish-first) with audio recordings and later transcription into English for analysis. To accommodate those who prefer English, we will make every effort to group these participants together. When, and if, the Spanish-first groups include participants who prefer English, we will have a Spanish to English translator available. In other words, we will be respectful of each participant's language to optimize their comfort in the engagement sessions. This project addresses an urgent need to engage stakeholders as part of the research process from conceptualization to dissemination and the need for culturally sensitive evidence-based interventions for Hispanic/Latino autistic children. This project is being developed by a skilled and experienced team of investigators.",

Due to the chemical structure of postbiotics and metabiotics, it is found that they have many health benefits; in particular, they have a local effect on certain tissues of the intestinal epithelium, and influence on many other organs and tissues. It is postbiotics metabolites and metabiotic structural cell fragments that create the appearance of a therapeutic effect of probiotics, which, in turn, limits the risk of introducing living microorganisms into a weakened immune defence. It should also be pointed out that postbiotics and metabiotics are more stable and have a longer shelf-life. The practical use of probiotics and the study of the mechanism of their action made lately to find that a certain level of biological activity is preserved by dead probiotic cells and even their lysates, which are the natural mixes of metabiotic and postbiotic substances; a biological activity which is strongly oriented toward gut health and immune system regulation.

For social evaluation, individuals' education level, profession and job status will be asked. Questions that are important for the research are included in the socio-demographic evaluation. For this study, individuals will be asked about their shoe choice, average number of steps per day, average standing time per day, presence of hallux valgus, and presence of hallux valgus in the family. Additionally, the foot will be evaluated and the presence of pes planus will be examined. It is a scale developed by Garrow to classify hallux valgus deformity. It deals with hallux valgus deformity at 4 levels; none (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4). The classification is evaluated by comparing 4 different photographs containing the hallux valgus deformity between individuals with the deformity. A universal standard goniometer will be used to measure the hallux valgus angle. To measure the hallux valgus angle, the pivot part of the goniometer is placed in the 1st Metatarsophalangeal joint. One arm of the goniometer is placed parallel to the 1st Metatarsal bone and the other arm is parallel to the proximal phalanx, the angle between them is measured and the hallux valgus angle is found. Hallux valgus angle is classified as normal (<15\u00b0), mild (15-20\u00b0), moderate (20\u00b0-40\u00b0) and severe (>40\u00b0). Foot function index is a widely used form that can be filled out by the person himself, developed to measure the effects of foot pathologies on pain, disability and activity limitation. Foot function index is used in research on children, adults and older adults to determine the effectiveness of treatment for various foot and ankle problems such as congenital, acute and chronic diseases and injuries, as well as after surgical interventions or orthosis use. Foot function index; It consists of 23 items with 3 subgroups: pain, disability and activity limitation. While the nine-item pain subscale measures the level of foot pain in various situations, the 9-item disability subscale determines the degree of difficulty in performing various functional activities due to foot problems. With the activity limitation subscale, which includes five items, activity limitations due to foot problems are evaluated.Foot function index is a widely used form that can be filled out by the person himself, developed to measure the effects of foot pathologies on pain, disability and activity limitation.

        "summary": "Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) is the most common congenital malformation, with about one in 500 children born with CL/P in Sweden, corresponding to approximately 175 births annually. Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea. Thus, selecting the patients who benefit most from speech-improving surgery is therefore of great importance.\nThe aim with the current study is evaluation of speech function through patient- and parent-response outcome measurements following surgical treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with isolated or combined cleft palate.",

        "summary": "Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide, with more than 400,000 hysterectomies performed annually in the United States. As a consequence, even uncommon complications can affect large numbers of patients. Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGambling addiction has often been conceptualized as the result of reward processing dysfunction in the brain, particularly in the striatum, a key structure of the reward system. Although a number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. The investigators will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. The investigators will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers.",

        "summary": "Laparoscopy has become an indispensable part of modern surgery. Vision is an important and defining element of laparoscopy and significantly affects the outcome of an operation in regard to time, mistakes and precision. Several new imaging systems have become available for laparoscopic surgery, including three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD), and two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high-resolution (4K) monitors. In experimental and clinical settings, several studies have been published in recent years suggesting that 3D systems present a number of potential benefits for surgeons and patients compared to the conventional 2D systems. The 3D HD system significantly reduces operation time and blood loss, and additionally shortens hospital stay. However, the performance of 3D systems against the new, ultra-high-definition 4K systems is barely known and highly controversial. There is a paucity of studies comparing these two imaging systems in clinical settings. The goal of this clinical trial is to compare 2D 4K versus 3D HD imaging systems in a complex bariatric surgery, more precisely a gastric bypass operation. The investigators aim to investigate the hypothesis stating that the use of the 3D HD system yields a significant improvement in operating time compared to a 2D 4K system in bariatric laparoscopic surgery. Furthermore, in order to give a comprehensive overview of the comparison of 2D 4K and 3D HD laparoscopy in a clinical setting, the investigators will assess the workload of the surgeon as well as the intraoperative and postoperative complications including the hospitalization time.",

It may be due to impaired insulin secretion, resistance to peripheral actions of insulin, or both . Chronic hyperglycemia in synergy with the other metabolic aberrations in patients with diabetes mellitus can cause damage to various organ systems, leading to the development of disabling and life-threatening health complications, most prominent of which are microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular complications leading to a 2-fold to 4-fold increased risk of cardiovascular diseases Mg2+ deficiency is usually identified by the measurement of serum Mg2+ concentration. Hypomagnesemia is defined by a serum Mg2+ concentration < 0.75 mmol/L, but a deficiency due to low dietary intake in otherwise healthy people is uncommon. Although overt signs of clinical Mg2+ deficiency are not routinely recognized in the healthy population, relatively low Mg2+ intake and/or Mg2+ status have been shown to be associated with chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, T2DM, osteoporosis, pulmonary disease, depression, migraine headaches, inflammation, and cancer",

Doxorubicin is in a class of medications called anthracyclines. Doxorubicin damages the cell's DNA and may kill cancer cells. It also blocks a certain enzyme needed for cell division and DNA repair. Liposomal doxorubicin is a form of the anticancer drug doxorubicin that is contained inside very tiny, fat-like particles. Liposomal doxorubicin may have fewer side effects and work better than other forms of the drug. Peposertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also enhance the activity of chemo- and radiotherapy. There is some pre-clinical evidence in animal models that combining peposertib with liposomal doxorubicin can shrink or stabilize certain types of cancer for longer than either drug alone, but it is not known if this will happen in people. Combination therapy with liposomal doxorubicin and peposertib may be effective in patients with advanced sarcoma.",

The Investigators conducted a health records review at two large urban EDs in Ottawa, and found that 29.6% of patients with cellulitis are admitted to hospital. In a separate study, The investigators found that the mean cost of care to hospitalize cellulitis patients for IV antibiotics was $10,145 CDN.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Non-purulent cellulitis is a bacterial skin and soft tissue infection of the subcutaneous tissue. Group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), beta-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria causing non-purulent cellulitis. Patients typically present to the emergency department (ED) with pain, redness, swelling and induration (skin hardening due to inflammation) of the affected skin. A minority of patients may have fever or tachycardia. The diagnosis of cellulitis is clinical. Once the diagnosis is made, antibiotic treatment is initiated. The emergency physician must select the appropriate agent, oral versus intravenous (IV) route, dose, frequency and duration. Rationale: For ED adult patients with cellulitis, how does high-dose (1000 mg) cephalexin compare with standard-dose (500 mg) cephalexin with respect to antibiotic treatment failure, adverse events and health service utilization (i.e., need for IV antibiotics, unscheduled return ED visits and hospitalization)? Hypotheses: Treatment with high-dose cephalexin will lead to lower rates of oral antibiotic treatment failure than using standard-dose cephalexin. Methods: Study Design & Setting: The investigators will conduct a multicentre, parallel-arm double-blind, individually randomized trial comparing high-dose (1000 mg) cephalexin to standard-dose (500 mg) cephalexin to treat ED adult patients with cellulitis. This is a superiority trial. The trial will be conducted at 8 Canadian EDs. A total sample size of 446 patients (223 per group) will be required. Study Population: Inclusion Criteria: The Investigators will include adults (age \u226518 years) diagnosed with non-purulent cellulitis and determined by the treating emergency physician to be eligible for outpatient oral antibiotics. Trial Intervention: The study interventions are two accepted doses of oral cephalexin. The interventions will begin following randomization. High-dose cephalexin: Patients randomized to this arm will receive a seven-day medication package of cephalexin 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets per dose) to be taken four times daily. A duration of seven days was selected as this was the most common prescription duration in a survey of Canadian emergency physicians.32 The antibiotic pills will be provided in a dosette organized by dose and day. Standard-dose cephalexin: Patients randomized to this arm will receive a seven-day medication package of cephalexin 500 mg (one 500 mg tablet and one placebo tablet per dose) to be taken four times daily. Blinding: Both cephalexin and placebo will be encased in identical capsules, prepared and packaged independently by an external pharmacy. The patients, treating physician and research team (including outcome adjudicators) will be blinded. Primary Outcome: Oral Antibiotic Treatment Failure: The primary outcome is outpatient oral antibiotic treatment failure, defined as a change in antibiotic (change in class of oral antibiotic or step up to IV therapy) within 7 days due to worsening infection. Secondary Outcomes: Clinical cure, defined as absence of treatment failure criteria, evaluated at day 8 and 30 Clinical response, defined as a reduction in lesion size \u226520% compared to baseline, evaluated at the day 3 and day 8 follow-up assessments Unplanned visits to a healthcare provider (ED, family doctor) within 30 days Unplanned hospitalization within 30 days. Adverse events will be classified as serious or other and will be assessed at day 30 follow up. Serious adverse events will include anaphylaxis to study medication, development of Clostridium difficile colitis or unexpected deaths related to the infection or treatment. Other adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and rash. Antibiotic intolerance, defined as change in treatment due to adverse events.

The selection of subjects with indication for osseointegrated implant placement will be based on a previous oral and radiological examination by means of a periapical radiograph and a panoramic radiograph and/or Cone Beam Computed Tomography , together with the completion of a clinical questionnaire. For implant placement, a linear incision of the edentulous ridge and an intrasulcular incision of the adjacent teeth will be made using a #15 scalpel blade and a #3 Bard Parker scalpel handle. Once this is done, a full-thickness flap will be raised and the alveolar ridge will be reamed, following the manufacturer's indications, to place a titanium implant (Phibo\u00ae Aurea Evolution) of adequate dimensions in the control group or a zirconia implant (Z system\u00ae) in the test group, checking that there is an adequate insertion torque of 30Ncm or more and a cover screw will be placed. Once the implant is in place, simple stitches with supramid monofilament 4/0 suture (Proclinic\u00ae) will be placed until the wound is closed.

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSmartphones are the technological devices of our age that are constantly developing and their use is becoming more widespread every day. Nowadays, many transactions from shopping to banking activities, playing mobile games and taking photos can be done easily with smart phones. Smart phones, which make positive contributions to daily life, attract great attention by individuals of all age groups, especially young people. According to Newzoo's report, the number of smartphone users, which was 3.5 billion in 2020, is expected to reach 4.1 billion in 2023. Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing fast access in transactions, ease of use and sometimes a status indicator, can pose a risk for addiction when used uncontrolled. Smartphone addiction, although not yet clearly defined; It can manifest itself with symptoms such as constantly checking the phone, feeling restless when staying away, withdrawing, mood changes, not being able to control the duration of use, disruption in daily life due to problematic use, constant desire to use and pleasure from use. According to the behavioral approach, if a person takes pleasure from a behavior or avoids negative emotions with this behavior, this situation turns into a habit in the individual. Uncontrollable and frequently repetitive habits carry a risk for addiction. Smartphone addiction, in addition to being a behavioral disorder, can cause many physical, social and psychological problems. Problematic use of the smartphone; decrease in sleep duration and quality, height, wrist, thumb and shoulder pain , dry eye syndrome, and eye fatigue, decreased physical activity, as well as depression, social phobia, loneliness, and decreased academic performance can bring along many psychological and social problems. It can be said that poor sleep quality is one of the primary problems that may occur in the problematic use of the smartphone, and it negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Especially at night and in the pre-sleep period, the use of smartphones adversely affects sleep quality as it causes arousal due to the blue light it emits, shortens the sleep duration and disrupts the circadian rhythm. A study stated that exposure to blue light 1 hour before sleep reduces the duration of deep sleep and causes sleep quality to deteriorate. Another study stated that leaving smartphones out of the bedroom improved sleep quality. It is stated that poor sleep quality negatively affects the individual physically and psychologically, causes performance losses and increases the risk of accidents. In studies conducted with students, it was stated that poor sleep quality negatively affects academic performance, while good sleep quality increases academic performance. A study conducted with adolescents stated that poor sleep quality was associated with low self-esteem and increased levels of anxiety and depression. Nurses, who serve almost all of the society, have an important role in defining risky health behaviors and planning and implementing appropriate interventions for behavior change. For this reason, nurses need to make an effort to find the most appropriate behavior change approaches for the individual. Today, the Transtheoretic Model (TTM) is widely used to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which aims at the initiative suitable for the change phase of the individual, is used as a guide that facilitates behavior change. TTM is a cognitive-behavioral model that accepts that any behavioral change in an individual does not happen all at once, but that behavior change includes different stages and processes. The model, which was first used in smoking cessation programs, was later used in many areas such as exercise, sun protection, reducing the amount of excess fat in the diet, weight control, condom use, supporting mammography screening, widespread drug use, coping with stress and quitting substance abuse. Traditional behaviorist approaches; In this model, change focuses on helping individuals willingly make behavioral change and understanding the change process. In other words, it does not classify individuals only according to whether they can perform a certain behavior, but also according to the stages passed in the behavior change process. While TTM creates a roadmap in change, there are also approaches that contribute to and accelerate this change and support the individual who thinks about change. One of these approaches, which is used more frequently in addicted individuals, is the motivational interview method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and can be an effective communication technique for nurses in providing behavior change. Motivational interviewing as defined by Miller; It is a client-centered interview form in which suggestions are made to provide behavior change by helping individuals discover and solve their problems.

The treatment of rosacea is based on the severity of the disease and the presence of specific symptoms. The first-line treatment is topical therapy with metronidazole or azelaic acid. In more severe cases, oral antibiotics are used. Laser therapy is also used in the treatment of rosacea, especially for the reduction of erythema and telangiectasia. The most commonly used laser is the potassium-titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, which emits a wavelength of 532 nm and is absorbed by hemoglobin and melanin. The KTP laser is effective in reducing erythema and telangiectasia, but it does not have a significant effect on papules and pustules. Ivermectin is a drug that is used in the treatment of parasitic infections, but it has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties.

There is a substantial risk of fetal deterioration resulting in (iatrogenic) preterm birth or even intrauterine demise of one, or both fetuses.

The current diagnostic classification system based on three different umbilical artery flow patterns has no increasing scale of severity and the observed flow patterns may be volatile in nature. This hinders optimal diagnostic management and complicates outcome prediction as the survival outcome differs per umbilical artery flow type.

Extensive histological placental examinations will shine a light on microscopic abnormalities which can increase our knowledge of the pathophysiology. Examining neurodevelopment of sFGR twins at two years of age will additionally be of great value for our understanding of the impact of sFGR and contribute to adequate patient counselling.

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk.

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nDepression is the leading mental health contributor to the Global Burden of Disease. The World Health Organization's mhGAP initiative advocates the use of brief psychological therapies such as behavioral activation or antidepressant medications as first-line options for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in primary care settings, but not all patients will fully remit on either treatment. It is likely that different patients will respond to different treatments, but the optimal treatment for each individual remains unknown (and which patients are unlikely to respond to either treatment and should be referred to specialist care). Enhancing our ability to determine the optimal intervention for a particular patient has the potential to enhance the overall effectiveness of mental health care delivery in a more cost-efficient manner. This is a critical gap in knowledge in the treatment of depression across clinical settings globally. The main objective of the OptimizeD study is to determine whether different patients respond differentially to brief psychological treatment or a widely used generic SSRI and, if so, whether one can optimize outcomes in a cost-effective fashion for primary care patients with moderate to severe depression. The study has two specific aims and two exploratory aims: Specific Aim 1 (Clinical and Functional Outcomes): To evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a precision treatment rule (PTR) on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either psychotherapy based on behavioral activation called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) or antidepressant medication (fluoxetine). The study will use machine learning to develop the PTR, using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not. Specific Aim 2 (Cost-effectiveness Outcomes): To assess the costs of optimal vs. non-optimal treatments and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing relative costs and effectiveness between those who were randomly allocated to their optimal treatment with those who were randomly allocated to a non-optimal treatment, based on the PTR developed in Aim 1. The investigators hypothesize that optimizing will be more cost-effective than not. Exploratory Aim 1 (Mediators): To explore whether one can use the PTR to make our tests of mediation more precise. Patients who respond differentially to different treatments adhere to different causal mechanisms, and inclusion of the PTR in interaction terms with the purported mediators should facilitate the detection of moderated mediation among patients who show specificity of response. The investigators will also consider whether treatment-related factors (e.g., adherence, quality) act as mediators of the effects of each treatment on remission and recovery. This exploratory aim will offer insights into mechanisms of action for each treatment.

Aside from traditional risk factors collection and related biological assessments, risk establishment is based on calcium score, a simple non-injected and very little irradiating scanner which measures coronary calcifications, stigmata of healed atheroma plaques and, as a rule, non-evolving. Calcium score, which is interpreted according to age, sex and ethnicity, therefore makes it possible to assign a percentile within the distribution of all the patients and to classify patients in: Group I: absence of atheromatous plaques: Score 0 Group II: patients generating few plaques (low risk): calcium score above zero and classifying the patient below the 40th percentile of a similar population; Group III: patients generating moderate plaques (intermediate risk) with a calcium score classifying the patient equal or above the 40th percentile and less than the 65th percentile; Group IV: patients generating a lot of plaques (high risk): calcium score classifying the patient equal or above the 65th percentile. These are more likely to be patients who will come from the cardiology / check-up sector because of a higher probability of symptoms or of already being treated for primary prevention. Study assumptions are: apart from any hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis, the instability of a plaque can lead to symptomatic but transient micro-thrombotic phenomena which are spontaneously (or under the effect of an anti-aggregation/anticoagulation) resorbable. Regardless of this plaque fate (most frequently scarring, with calcifications, or much more rarely inaugural acute coronary syndrome and therefore infarction), it is a major coronary event which must switch the patient from primary prevention to secondary prevention. On painful thoracic syndromes that are sufficiently suggestive to require immediately to rule out an acute coronary syndrome or secondarily myocardial ischemia (angina), identifying a rapid progression of the coronary involvement (on the basis of calcium score) or the direct demonstration of plaque instability (by 18F-Na coupled with a CT scan) is a major cardiovascular prevention endpoint. In patients consulting for this clinical presentation, determining the frequency of those with rapid coronary evolution and/or instability of coronary plaque(s) represents a fundamental preliminary epidemiological study to modify prevention approach of primary coronary artery disease. The evaluation by non-invasive coronary imaging of secondary prevention treatment impact on these same patients initially diagnosed as rapidly progressive and/or unstable would make it possible to consolidate this strategy if it proves to be effective on the basis of plaque images and clinical follow-up (in terms of events).",

        "summary": "In a society with increased life expectancy, the economic, social and personal burden of dementia increases. Dementia is often caused by a combination of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired brain clearance is suggested to be closely related to dementia development, as waste products (e.g. amyloid beta) accumulate in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most common neurovascular disease that even contributes to about 45% of dementia pathophysiology in patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are the key brain MRI manifestation of cerebral SVD. There is evidence that the currently known and MRI-visible WMH are landmarks of an already progressed stage of the underlying pathology. The pathophysiology of WMH has been attributed to multiple underlying mechanisms, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, different anatomical locations and different types of WMH are related to different underlying pathological changes. Using ultra-high field 7T MR imaging techniques WMH lesions can be detected with a higher sensitivity and resolution than on 3T MRI. The hypothesis is that different pathological mechanisms of cerebral SVD lead to variations in WMH shape. Moreover, the brain clearance ('glymphatic') system of the brain appears to be tightly connected to dementia pathology. Thus, novel markers of glymphatic activity could aid to describe and understand the pathology.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe overall aim is to study how different pathological mechanisms in cerebral SVD influence WMH shape. Primary objective: To study the association of a more complex WMH shape with abnormalities in small vessel morphology. Secondary objectives: To study the association between WMH shape and cognition/other cerebral small vessel disease markers. To study the association of novel MRI markers of glymphatics with cerebral SVD markers and cognition. Study design: Cross-sectional study that will be conducted at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). Patients will be included from the memory/geriatric clinic that are over 65 years of age. The study contains 3T and 7T MRI scans, as well as neuropsychological assessments. The data will be analyzed by performing association analysis. Study population: Patients of the memory/geriatric clinic that are over 65 years of age. Main study parameter/endpoint: In order to postulate underlying mechanisms related to WMH shape variations the investigators will study the association between a more complex WMH shape and structural and functional markers of cerebral SVD (such as lacunes and microbleeds). WMH shape is assessed as follows: Convexity, solidity, concavity index, and fractal dimension are calculated for periventricular/confluent WMH. A lower convexity and solidity, and higher concavity index and fractal dimension indicate a more irregular shape of periventricular/confluent WMH. For deep WMH, fractal dimension and eccentricity are determined. A higher eccentricity and fractal dimension indicate a more complex shape of deep WMH. Other study parameters: The investigators want to investigate WMH shape parameters and the association with cognition (mini-mental state exam, clinical dementia rating and cognitive domain scores). Another endpoint is to investigate if different WMH phenotypes can be identified (by machine learning models). Moreover, the association between SVD markers/cognition and novel glymphatics markers (such as size of perivascular spaces, CSF mobility and 4th ventricle CSF flow dynamics) will be investigated. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The participants will not directly benefit from the results of the study. However, their contribution to the study will add important information about the pathophysiology of the cerebrovascular pathology that contributes to dementia. Therefore, it is not possible to study the research question in a different population group. The ultra-high field 7T MRI system is widely used in a research setting and since its first introduction in the 1990s no serious adverse events have been reported. Important temporary side-effects are vertigo, nausea and involuntary eye motion due to forces on ion currents in the semicircular loops. As all MRI scans are performed within a maximum of 60 minutes and without any contrast agents, the participant burden is seen as a non-substantial burden.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe power of music to raise the spirits and to heal the soul should not be underestimated. There is growing recognition of the significance of music as a complementary treatment in palliative care, which is reflected in the growing body of scientific literature on the subject and in the popularly of music therapy among palliative care patients themselves. Palliative care describes the holistic approach in the treatment of patients with advanced or incurable diseases, such as terminal cancer. In addition to conventional medical and nursing care, critical psychological, social and spiritual support is provided in palliative care. To this end, an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, psycho-oncologists, chaplains and music therapists is involved. Music therapy is defined as the systematic use of music within a therapeutic relationship which aims at restoring, maintaining and furthering emotional, physical and mental health. The aim of music therapy in palliative care, in contrast, is to relieve symptoms of distress and improve quality of life among patients in the advanced stages of oncological disease. In Germany, national oncological guidelines currently recommend music therapy as a treatment option to alleviate anxiety and existential fear. Music therapy encompasses both active and receptive techniques. Active techniques involve the patient in the production of music, such that they sing or play a musical instrument, possibly making planned gifts of songs to loved ones or for memorial services, whereas receptive techniques guide the patient in listening to music, both prerecorded as well as performed for them live. In cancer patients, the focus is placed primarily on music-assisted relaxation, generation of imagery, songs and improvisation. This heterogeneity of approach studied in the literature on music therapy precludes an understanding of precisely what aspects of music therapy are most beneficial. Despite a diversity of approach, findings are promising, which in itself may be an indication as to whether the whole of music therapy is perhaps greater than the sum of its parts. To practice music therapy according to the standards of evidence-based medicine, it is necessary to specify the intervention performed as well as the musical instrument(s) used. Moderators such as individual patient preferences and experience with music also may play an appreciable role; however, these are rarely systematically investigated. Music therapy is conventionally administered by a trained music therapist and individual therapy sessions typically last 20 minutes. Training backgrounds of therapists vary, whereby in the United States a bachelor's degree in music therapy is the minimum requirement and board certification must follow in order for professional practice. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of music therapy in palliative care patients. An emerging body of scientific literature in this clinical population suggests that music therapy may alleviate physical pain as well as psychological, social and emotional suffering. Spiritual needs may particularly benefit from music therapy. Furthermore, a meta-analysis could show significant positive effects of music therapy on psychological well-being, physical symptoms and overall quality of life. Music therapy may favour various routine overarching themes in palliative care as well, such as pain management, relaxation, joy, hope, intensified spirituality and improved quality of life and may reduce anxiety and depression. Music therapy may outperform verbal exercises in inducing relaxation and reducing fatigue but not pain. Despite the generally promising findings suggesting a benefit to psychological well-being assessed by subjective methods (e.g., visual analog scales, questionnaires, etc.) there is scant evidence derived from experiments utilizing objective outcome measures (e.g., autonomic response, etc.) with rigorous study design to support the efficacy of music therapy. Findings derived from autonomic data suggest a benefit of music therapy characterized by increased parasympathetic tone accompanying improved subjective ratings of relaxation. Boosted high-frequency heart rate (HR) oscillations coincided with subjective relaxation score from visual analog scale after music therapy. In addition, blood volume pulse amplitude (BVP-A) was increased from baseline to post-therapy, indicating heightened vascular dilation due to greater parasympathetic activation, although just below the threshold of statistical significance (p = 0.07). In another analysis in the same sample, during music therapy higher levels of parasympathetically-mediated HR variability (HRV) were observed. Resting HR and blood pressure (BP) were reduced, whereas relaxation, comfort and happiness were increased. Increases in distal body temperature was observed in a sample of individuals undergoing chemotherapy. Anxiety related to chemotherapy was reduced by music therapy in this sample. The present study seeks to assess differences in feasibility and acceptability of music therapy played live and listening to a recording thereof at the palliative care ward of the University Hospital Zurich.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Two landmark trials have led to the FDA approval of two different CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell (CAR19) products in the United States for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (RR) large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy: tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah\u2122) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta \u00ae). In the ZUMA-1 registration trial for axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), 42% of the 101 treated patients achieved a complete response (CR), and with a median follow up of 15 months, the projected 1year progression free survival (PFS) was 70%. In a recent updated analysis, the CR rate was 58% with about 40% of patients having durable remissions at 2 years of follow up. Similar results were seen in the JULIET registrational trial for tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) with an overall response rate (ORR) of 52%, and a CR rate of 40% in the 93 patients evaluable for response; with a median follow up of 14 months, the estimated 12-months relapse-free survival was 65% (79% among patients with a CR). Tisagenlecleucel is also approved for the treatment of acute B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to the age of 25 years. Unfortunately, in both trials patients with known HIV infection were excluded. Therefore, no safety or efficacy data for treatment with CAR19 in PLWH exists, and access for PLWH in the US to this potentially curative treatment has been limited. This has to be contrasted with the fact that malignancies, and specifically lymphomas, remain a major contributor to early mortality in PLWH. With a lifetime risk of cancer ranging between 24-40%, the leading cause of death in PLWH in economically developed countries is cancer, and the most common cancer in PLWH in the US remains Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). While early during the HIV epidemic, outcomes for PLWH and aggressive B-cell lymphomas were significantly worse compared to immunocompetent patients, this is no longer the case for the majority of PLWH, owing mainly to effective antiretroviral therapies leading to better tolerance of myelosuppressive chemotherapy and a consequent paradigm shift in aggressive therapies for HIV-associated lymphoma. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that PLWH have been able to safely tolerate aggressive high-dose chemotherapy, as well as autologous and even allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.\n\nObjectives: The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy of CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy in PLWH with B-cell lymphoid malignancies.\n\nEligibility: Patients with a history of HIV infection who received CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma, or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma between August 30, 2017 and August 31, 2021 will be eligible for this study.\n\nDesign: This is an observational study. Patients will be followed for 12 months after CAR19 therapy.\n\nOutcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the rate of toxicities related to CAR19 therapy. Secondary outcome measures include the change in CD4 count, absolute lymphocyte count, HIV viral load, overall response, and complete remission.",

Patients will undergo a mandatory, study-specific core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour or metastasis before commencing their next line of therapy. The research sample will be run on Pear Bio's test whilst the patient receives therapy as per their physician's choice. This study will not use Pear Bio's tool to inform the choice of treatment, with the treating oncologist being blinded to the test results. Treatment response data will be collected at multiple timepoints to conduct analyses on the study's secondary and tertiary objectives. Fresh tissue resections that arrive at Pear Bio's lab will undergo processing, cell culture and various drug dosing and omics assays (depending on extracted cell numbers). Tumour samples will be processed using a cell isolation kit to retrieve a viable single-cell suspension. A minimum of 100,000 cells (10,000 viable cells per chip) will be used for staining with live and dead cell-tracking dyes. In parallel, blood vials will be processed for PBMCs and further effector cell extraction (flow cytometry, Dynabeads, etc). The remaining cells will be used for sequencing (DNA/RNA), fixed for immunofluorescence characterisation of biomarkers/receptor status or used for further omics assays (if cell numbers allow). This may include tumour mutational burden and microsatellite instability testing. The stained cells will be cultured in a biomimetic hydrogel within Pear Bio's organ-on-a-chip to provide a physiological 3D environment for drug dosing experiments. Using a microfluidic device, samples in each chip will be exposed to approved therapies (either as monotherapy or combination therapies, as outlined below) over multiple days. In parallel, PBMCs will be extracted from whole blood, characterised and sorted via flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic beads selection. Cells of interest (e.g. CD8+ T cells) will be used for culture in Pear Bio's chips jointly with cells isolated from the matched tumour sample. To test immunotherapies, tumour cells will be co-cultured with immune cells in a modified organ-on-a-chip architecture. Chips receiving immunotherapies may be tested for tumour mutational burden and/or microsatellite instability. Confocal microscopy will be conducted daily to collect 3D image data of the cells and track their position and behaviour over time. At the end of the assay, the 3D cell cultures will be fixed for further 3D immunofluorescence analyses or used for embedding, sectioning and assessment of spatial transcriptomics. For targeted therapies, RNAseq, IF and other omics data will be integrated to confirm drug MoA and identify other potential therapeutic targets. Concurrently, 3D image data is processed through a computer vision pipeline to measure functional metrics of the ex vivo 3D cell cultures, including cell viability, cell culture width and cell migration, both at a bulk tumour level and at a single-cell resolution. For immunotherapies, additional metrics such as immune cell infiltration and immune cell killing will be recorded. A patient report is then generated to outline an individual patient sample's response to each therapy tested.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIn recent years, immune-based therapies have revolutionized the field of oncology by significantly improving survival of cancer patients. Despite sustained responses, only 20% to 40% of cancer patients respond. It has become clear that the immunosuppressive environment induced by tumor through cellular and/or soluble pathways critically contribute to hinder efficient antitumor immunity. The inhibition of these immunosuppressive networks thus represents an essential prerequisite for the improvement of responses to anticancer immunotherapies. Several immune cell populations have been identified as key actors of tumor-induced immunosuppression, among which are myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). However, in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the prognostic role of these cells, the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive functions, their non-immunological protumoral functions and their role in dampening the efficacy of immunotherapies in clinical practice are less characterized. The aim of this project is to better characterize the non immunologic functions of MDSC.

However, common genetic mutations are known for both diseases.\nThe aim of the study is to provide a scientific basis for molecular genetic NBS for cystinosis and primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Specifically, the study will investigate whether the inclusion of these diseases into general NBS should be recommended. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis.\nThe screening laboratory Hannover, Germany is involved in the project. Hospitals that send their dry blood spot cards for routine NBS to Hannover are offered participation in the project.\nParents who want to participate receive an additional information sheet. A parent and the attending physician sign the information sheet as documentation of informed consent, which allows data transfer and patient referral to a specialist in case of a positive result. Molecular genetic screening in the pilot project is performed from the same dry blood spot card used for routine NBS.\nIn both diseases, testing is performed for 2 known mutations: In cystinosis for the 2 mutations most common in Germany, and in PH for the most common mutation in infantile hyperoxaluria (PH1) and in Europe (PH3).\nNormal findings are not communicated to the parents, which may contact the laboratory to ask for them. Parents of newborns with two mutations in the cystinosis gene are immediately informed about the disease by a physician. Further diagnostics to confirm the disease are organized close to home.\nIn contrast, parents of newborns with only one mutation in one of the two hyperoxaluria genes are informed.

The study population includes newborns whose parents wish to participate in the pilot project and have provided written informed consent. Parent information and consent Before screening is performed, the newborn's parents are comprehensively informed about the possibility of screening for the various diseases by the physician responsible for NBS (gynecologist, pediatrician). An additional information and consent sheet for cystinosis and PH screening is inserted into the information brochure already available for regular NBS. Consent must be documented with the signature of at least one parent and the signature of the informing physician on the consent form. The consent form for the pilot project also includes consent for the transfer of contact data and findings to a specialized center in the event of an abnormal screening result. The laboratory must receive the consent form for the project prior to analysis. Sampling The molecular genetic screening is performed using the same dried blood spot card as the routine NBS. In general, for all invalid results (i.e., if the control reaction fails) as well as all abnormal results (Cystinosis: homozygous or heterozygous for the 57-kb deletion and/or c.18_21delGACT, p.T7Ffs*7 ; PH1, c.508G>A, PH3, C700+5G>T, homozygous and/or heterozygous) the test will be internally repeated for confirmation using the existing blood sample. Measurements and methods A real-time quadruplex PCR is performed for the four mutations described above. Cystinosis: Detection is carried out by detection of the binding or by melting analysis of fluorescence-labeled probes. In samples with a positive result due to heterozygosity mutations, the exons of the cystinosin gene (CTNS) are sequenced using next generation sequencing (NBS) in an amplicon-based method. This ensures that only the desired exons and no other DNA areas are examined. DNA already extracted for real-time multiplex PCR can be used for NBS. With NEBNext Direct Genotyping Solution all analyzable areas of CTNS gene are covered (partial overlapping), which preserve a completely sequence information of all exons and specific introns. Therefore, the DNA will be enzymatically fragmented and then ligated with illuminable adaptors. The adaptors contain individual indices. Afterwards the biotin beads will be used for the target enrichment. They will be augmented with streptavidin beads. Afterwards off-target sequences will be removed, and the libraries will be amplified by PCR. The actual sequencing is carried out using a device from Illumina (MiniSeq). The sequences are evaluated using a software that performs an automatic comparison with a reference sequence, thereby detecting mutations. PH: The detection will be done through heat analysis with fluorescent tagged leads. In case of positive results (also due to heterozygotic constellations) a clarification is planned in collaboration with the German hyperoxaluria center. Therefore, spot urine will be tested for oxalate and further parameters in the glyoxylate metabolism. Examination results Cystinosis: If the most frequent mutations of CTNS are detected as homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, the cystinosis screening is considered positive. Using next-generation sequencing, an additional 175 mutations recorded in the literature will be detected. In all other cases, even those involving heterozygous status, cystinosis screening is normal. PH: The hyperoxaluria screening is positive, if PH1 (AGXT-Gen:c508G>A) and/or PH3 (HOGA-gene: c.700+5G>T) is homozygote detected. In heterozygote genetic carrier with positive screening, a subsequent urine test performed in the Wisplinghoff laboratory in Cologne (K\u00f6ln) will clarify the finding. Detection rate, false positive and false negative results An overall detection rate of above 95% is assumed for both diseases. False negative screening results are unlikely.

Seroma is the retention of clear fluid in the cavity of the body such as a surgical wound. Typical clinical presentation is fluid oozing from the wound. Hematoma is the retention of bloody fluid in the cavity of the body such as a surgical wound. It can be infected which is possible to prevent by stop bleeding intraoperatively and evaluate surgical wound every day. Wound dehiscence is partial or total separation of previously approximated wound edges, due to failure of proper wound healing.

        "summary": "Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation is one of the most common genetic mutations associated with tumor development in various human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that KRAS mutations are present in approximately 70% of pancreatic cancer patients, 35% of colorectal cancer patients, 20% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and 15% of cervical cancer patients. Patients with KRAS mutations generally have a shorter overall survival and increased resistance to treatment compared to wild-type tumors. KRAS mutations have been known for decades, but they have been considered undruggable as effective therapies targeting them were lacking.\nPreclinical studies focusing on colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have suggested that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit a stronger response to EGFR signaling and activation of multiple RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) than non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. As a result, they show poorer responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors, leading to the development of initial and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition. Based on this hypothesis, a phase 1-2 clinical trial, known as the KRYSTAL-1 study, was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study demonstrated that the objective response rate was 19% with adagrasib monotherapy and 46% with the combination of adagrasib and cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor), indicating that the addition of an EGFR inhibitor can overcome resistance. Building on this hypothesis, a phase 3 trial is currently underway for KRAS G12C inhibition plus EGFR blockade in metastatic colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04793958, NCT05198934).\nIn this study, the aim is to investigate the efficacy of sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) plus panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, who have failed standard treatments.",

Different biomaterials have been developed to overcome these limitations as a possible alternative to autogenous graft. However, despite its potential, there is a lack of studies evaluating its use in treating this type of condition. Thus, this study aims to assess from a clinical and esthetics point of view and patient-centered outcomes, the use of a new collagen matrix (Geistlich Fibro-Gide\u00ae) associated with CAF for the management of single combined defects. For such purpose, 50 patients with single RT1 gingival recessions associated with NCCL will be enrolled and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: control group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap for root coverage (PR+CAF) and test group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap associated with volume stable collagen matrix (PR+CAF+VCMX). The two groups will be compared regarding the clinical parameters, among which bleeding on probing (BOP), biofilm accumulation (IP), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession reduction (RecRed), and the percentage of combined defect coverage (%CDC). Patient-reported outcomes such as post-surgery pain and discomfort, time to recover, the decrease of dentin hypersensitive, and aesthetics will be gathered. A professional assessment will be carried out regarding the aesthetic parameters. All these evaluations will be performed at the baseline and three and six months postoperatively.",

        "summary": "People with limb loss receiving inpatient rehabilitation are at greater risk for depression and anxiety, social isolation, and generally have poorer quality of life. To proactively address the mental health needs of this population, St. John's Rehab recruited two psychiatrists to provide mental health support to their inpatient population groups. Because there are limits to mental health resources and because group therapy facilitates patients learning from each other, the investigators plan to test an innovative psychological group therapy program designed for limb loss inpatients to address mental health challenges, and to better prepare them to integrate back into the community. Our designed psychosocial group therapy is led by a psychiatrist and an occupational therapist who create a structured process for inpatients to discuss their challenges and identify coping strategies that will help them transition back into the community. The investigators will recruit 130 inpatients with limb loss, with 65 taking part in a weekly psychosocial group therapy program and 65 receiving treatment as usual. The investigators will evaluate if anxiety and depression significantly decreases in our treatment group compared to those who received treatment as usual. The findings of this work will provide needed evidence for the clinical feasibility and utility of a rehabilitation inpatient group therapy program, which can serve as a useful model for other limb loss sites across Canada.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators will conduct a pragmatic trial with a weekly supportive-expressive group therapy (SEGT) intervention for inpatients with limb loss, at a free-standing rehabilitation hospital in Toronto, Canada. This is pragmatic research trial that has stemmed from our feasibility trial involving therapy SEGT for dysvascular lower extremity amputation (LEA) inpatients. Pragmatic trials stand in contrast to randomized controlled trials (RCT's), which instead examine causal relationships and are characterized by rigorous designs, featuring randomization, blinding and allocation concealment, to eliminate bias. Despite yielding results with high internal validity and statistical credibility, RCT's are not always generalizable to real life practice. Perhaps to address this, pragmatic trials are growing in popularity. Pragmatic trials aim to test interventions in routine clinical settings to maximize applicability and generalizability as well as to determine whether an intervention works under real life conditions. As a complement to our previous feasibility trial, the goal of this work is to understand the effectiveness of SEGT upon mental health outcomes among individuals with limb loss. Hence, the objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic trial using a SEGT intervention for addressing anxiety and depression for inpatients with limb loss. This two-arm pragmatic trial will evaluate if SEGT leads to better mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety) for inpatients with limb loss compared to those patients who receive treatment as usual (TAU). Over a 2 year period, 130 inpatients will be recruited for this trial, with 65 being assigned to the SEGT arm and 65 to a TAU condition who receive standard care only (which may include an individual psychiatric consultation). The proposed intervention is based on the evidence-based supportive-expressive (SEGT) approach and was designed by an interprofessional team from psychiatry, social work, physiatry and occupational therapy, along with patient advisors. The SEGT approach fosters mutual support, promotes openness and emotional expression. It has been shown to yield improvements in anxiety, psychosocial functioning, health literacy, and social support in breast cancer survivors. This SEGT approach has been modified, in both content and process, to specifically address the needs of limb loss inpatients. SEGT will be delivered and co-facilitated by either a psychiatrist and/or two allied healthcare professionals supervised by a psychiatrist on a rolling basis - which means it will be offered once a week, and participants may join the sessions at any time as the sessions will follow a similar framework over a six-modules. As infection control protocols allow, inpatient participants will participate in a large room setting at St. John's Rehab seated at least six feet apart and masked, with staff facilitators. SEGT groups will be capped to having 8 participants per session. If the pandemic conditions do not enable us to have an in-person group event, the investigators will explore delivering the intervention via Zoom onsite at St. John's Rehab (delivered by tablets), where patients can log in private rooms across St. John's Rehab to participate. The six sessions are based on a current inpatient psychosocial group therapy program being offered to their inpatients, and will be adapted by our investigation team (PI: Dr. Steinberg - Psychiatrist), and is based on a program being run at West Park Healthcare Centre for their limb loss patients. The sessions will involve facilitated discussion by two allied healthcare professionals or one psychiatrist and an allied healthcare professional, and will focus on guided discussions on coping with limb loss, managing sequelae associated with limb loss (e.g., pain), goal setting and strategies for community living. Based on participant interest, the investigators may also suggest exercises related to mindfulness and relaxation (e.g., breathing exercises, etc.). All activities are not physically strenuous and can be done sitting or standing (depending on participant preference and ability), and combine information sharing by the group facilitator as well as creating opportunities for group dialogue. It is hoped that SEGT will influence coping self-efficacy (a belief in one's ability to cope with post-traumatic stress demands, and affects various aspects of human functioning through four processes: cognitive, motivational, affective and environmental selection.). Self-efficacy is a modifiable construct, and is tied to positive outcomes (less pain, improved quality of life). Hence, in theory, if our patients develop higher levels of coping self-efficacy, they will be better equipped in preparing themselves for hospital discharge, will enhance their self-care and ability to correct maladapt",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nIschemic stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, despite major advancements in reperfusion therapies. While neuroimaging modalities have expanded patient eligibility for reperfusion therapies by estimating ischemic core and salvageable tissue, their assessments are mostly single-timed. Currently available clinical algorithms lack the capacity to continuously track the dynamic evolution of how the primary core progresses to a final infarct, which, however, is a major determinant of functional outcome. Monitoring infarct trajectories could support therapeutic decision-making in patients with large-vessel occlusion stroke and unveil determinants of stroke progression, aiding in patient selection for trials evaluating cytoprotection11 and targeting clinically ineffective reperfusion.12 Previously studied blood-based biomarkers such as Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL),13 neuron-specific enolase (NSE),14 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),15,16 and S 100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B)17 either failed to capture the extent of brain injury within the acute phase of stroke or lack specificity. Plasma levels of brain-derived tau (BD-tau) were recently found to show high value for monitoring brain injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke: In 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome.18 While informing on the relation of BD-tau with imaging-based metrics of brain injury, this large cross-sectional study was restricted to BD-tau assessments upon admission (median time from onset: 4.4 hours) and at day 2 (median time from onset: 22.7 hours) and could not inform on key characteristics of the evolution of plasma BD-tau, including when exactly it starts to rise, how long it continues to rise, and how it is determined by infarct characteristics as well as comorbidities. That knowledge would be of great value to determine the responsiveness of plasma BD-tau to brain injury after onset and to evaluate whether BD-tau plateaus at different time points after onset indicating no further infarct progression. PROMISE-BD-100 will thus assess BD-tau levels every hour from admission to 48 hours from stroke onset in patients that present with the clinical diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke due to a large- or medium-vessel occlusion within 9 hours from symptom onset.",

        "summary": "Visual impairment is one of the ten most prevalent causes of disability and poses extraordinary challenges to individuals in our society that relies heavily on sight. Living with acquired blindness not only lowers the quality of life of these individuals, but also strains society's limited resources for assistance, care and rehabilitation. However, to date, there is no effective treatment for man patients who are visually handicapped as a result of degeneration or damage to the inner layers of the retina, the optic nerve or the visual pathways. Therefore, there are compelling reasons to pursue the development of a cortical visual prosthesis capable of restoring some useful sight in these profoundly blind patients.\nHowever, the quality of current prosthetic vision is still rudimentary. A major outstanding challenge is translating electrode stimulation into a code that the brain can understand. Interactions between the device electronics and the retinal neurophysiology lead to distortions that can severely limit the quality of the generated visual experience. Rather than aiming to one day restore natural vision (which may remain elusive until the neural code of vision is fully understood), one might be better off thinking about how to create practical and useful artificial vision now.\nThe goal of this work is to address fundamental questions that will allow the development of a Smart Bionic Eye, a device that relies on AI-powered scene understanding to augment the visual scene (similar to the Microsoft HoloLens), tailored to specific real-world tasks that are known to diminish the quality of life of people who are blind (e.g., face recognition, outdoor navigation, reading, self-care).",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators will perform basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH) designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. These experiments will follow standard procedures for collecting behavioral data, and involve simple perceptual tasks (e.g., signal detection, object recognition) and behavioral tasks (e.g., walking towards a goal location). The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when using an external computer to directly specify pulse trains (e.g., for Argus II, a 1s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12). These direct pulse trains are then sent to the VPU. This VPU contains software that makes sure that these pulse trains are within FDA-approved safety limits. For example, these pulses must be charge-balanced (equal anodic/cathodic charge) and must have a charge density below 35 microCoulombs/cm2. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. Sometimes the investigators will directly send pulses to the VPU by directly specifying pulse trains (e.g., send a 1 s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microAmps to Electrode 12 of an Argus II implant). Important parameters for safety include a) pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), b) charge density should be limited. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust to extremely high rates of stimulation and high current levels. However, high frequency pulse trains or high amplitude pulse trains can produce discomfort in patients (analogous to going from a dark movie theatre to sunlight) due to inducing large-scale neuronal firing. The investigators will normally be focusing on pulse-train frequencies/amplitudes that are in the normal range used by the patient when using their device. If the investigators use parameters that might be expected to produce a more intense neural response (and therefore have the potential to cause discomfort), they will always introduce them in a step-wise function (e.g. gradually increasing amplitude) while checking that the sensation is not 'uncomfortably bright', and the investigators will immediately decrease the intensity of stimulation if patients report that the sensation approaches discomfort. The PI has experience in this approach and will train all personnel on these protocols. In response to the stimulation/image on the monitor, subjects will be asked to either make a perceptual judgment or perform a simple behavioral task. Examples include detecting a stimulus ('did you see a light on that trial'), reporting size by drawing on a touch screen, or walking to a target location. Both patient response and reaction time will be recorded. In some cases, the investigators will also collect data measuring subjects' eye position. This is a noninvasive procedure that will be carried out using standard eye-tracking equipment via an infra-red camera that tracks the position of the subjects' pupil. Only measurements like eye position or eye blinks will be recorded, so these data do not contain identifiable information. Subjects are encouraged to take breaks as often as needed (they may",

Secondary objectives are: (a) to examine the potential impacts of the proposed intervention on the health and well-being of subjects' family members (e.g., children); (b) to determine the diabetes risk of the subjects over a 3-year follow-up period; (c) to explore potential economic impacts of the proposed intervention (e.g., healthcare expenditures); (d) to study the importance of gut microbiota and epigenetic factors in relation to changes in glucose metabolism, and (e) to ascertain the safety of the proposed intervention. The study is a 1-year randomized controlled trial with three years of follow-up. The primary outcomes involved the incidence of Type 2 diabetes confirmed by a 2-hr 75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) over a 4-year period. Secondary outcomes are (1) incidence of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance; (b) changes in cardiometabolic variables (e.g., body weight, HbA1c, insulin, blood lipids, blood pressures) in the women; (c) changes in women's body composition; (d) changes in women's mental well-being (e.g., defined by BDI-II, STAI, WHO-5, PSS-4); (e) changes in the health and wellbeing of their children, and (f) a composite of major adverse events (MAE) comprising fatal and non-fatal events associated with Type 2 diabetes. Eligible women will be randomized at baseline to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (Control) for 1 year. Group 1 (Intervention) consists of several virtual coaching sessions about healthy lifestyle delivered by a conversational agent (chatbot) embedded in the LvL UP App within 24 weeks (weeks 2 to 26) to complete three levels of health literacy. Additionally, individuals will receive an Oura ring at baseline, as well as the HAPPY App Follow-up Period Upon completion of the one-year RCT period, both groups will be followed-up for 3 years. During the follow-up visits, body measurements, OGTT, bio-sampling, and data collection will be conducted. Both groups will be assessed at baseline, week 26, 1 year visit, 2-year visit (follow-up 1), 3-year visit (follow-up 2), and 4-year visit (follow-up 3)",

The study aims to determine the effectiveness of using intra-arterial melphalan, a chemotherapy drug, to reduce tumor thickness, allowing for subsequent radiation therapy using a Ru-106 plaque.\nThe main questions this trial seeks to answer are:\nCan intra-arterial melphalan effectively reduce the thickness of large uveal melanomas?\nIs the combination of intra-arterial melphalan and brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment option for these tumors?\nParticipants enrolled in the trial have clinically diagnosed choroidal melanoma with tumor thickness equal to or greater than 8.00 mm. They will undergo a procedure where the chemotherapy drug is injected directly into the blood vessels that supply the tumor. After a few weeks, they will receive the radiation treatment using a small device placed on the eye. Throughout the trial, participants will have different tests to monitor the tumor and their vision, such as ultrasound scans, pictures of the inside of the eye, and a test called electroretinography (ERG) to check the function of the retina. These tests will be done at the start of the trial and at 1, 3, and 6 months later to track the progress of the treatment.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChoroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, thus being the focus of extensive research. The primary treatment goals of this disease consist in controlling local disease, reducing the risk of distant metastases, and avoiding enucleation whenever possible. Plaque brachytherapy is currently the standard treatment for small and medium-sized uveal melanomas. In clinical practice, ruthenium (Ru-106) or iodine (I-125) are the most commonly employed radioisotopes. Ruthenium is the most utilized radioisotope in Europe and South America due to its availability and good clinical outcomes. It is currently the only available option in Brazil's public health system (SUS). However, its use for large tumors (greater than 10 mm in thickness and/or 22 mm in diameter) is limited by the inability of delivering an adequate therapeutic dose of radiation without causing further damage to the surrounding retinal tissue. For this reason, researchers in medical physics have been investigating new treatment options in the last decades, including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radiosurgery (gamma knife or linear accelerator), and proton beam therapy. Although gamma knife radiosurgery and proton beam therapy are effective treatments with reliable tumor control rates, they are associated with poor visual outcomes, inadequate globe retention, and their use is reportedly limited in public health systems of low- or middle-income countries. EBRT carries potential side effects related to a broader radiation field, with an increased risk for complications in ocular and periocular structures, such as eyelids, sclera, lens, and retina. Finally, enucleation is an effective management for very large tumors, but it is usually a last resource. Considering the above-mentioned treatment limitations for large choroidal melanomas, our group explored an alternative approach using intra-arterial melphalan for tumor chemoreduction, aiming to reduce thickness and allow subsequent brachytherapy using a Ru-106 plaque. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan has been used to treat multiple cancers, including liver metastases from uveal and skin melanomas, but it has never been described as a primary tumor treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated a reasonable safety profile of the therapy when used for the treatment of other tumors. This is a phase I clinical trial that assesses the safety profile of chemoreduction with intra-arterial melphalan, followed by ruthenium brachytherapy, performed in patients that would otherwise need enucleation due to tumor size.",

        "summary": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have long been linked to mental health problems in adulthood. In the case of cancer, no study has considered that such an anteriority could make patients more vulnerable emotionally, even though the presence of reactionary disorders such as stress, anxiety or depression are characteristic of such a pathology. Activated during periods of stress and therefore during the illness, even the attachment system is mobilized and must be considered to allow more understanding of the illness experience. The attachment style can be seen here as an individual dimension that plays a role in the emotional regulation and resilience of patients. It is also particularly solicited during the remission phase, a complex and singular period of cancer disease that confronts patients with an ambivalence of hope and fear. The fear of recurrence is a concern that the cancer may return or progress in the same organ or in another part of the body. This is a determining factor in the occurrence of anxiety-depressive disorders. Finally, several studies have shown a strong association between depression/anxiety and Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) after treatment, especially during the remission phase.\nACEs leave physiological and epigenetic impact that can nowadays be easily evaluated, thus providing additional evidence between adversity, physiological and epigenetic vulnerability and the ability to adapt to life's challenges such as cancer. Life history changes are mediated by changes in cellular mechanisms affecting genome expression. It is currently widely demonstrated that ACEs increases epigenetic modifications.\nThe interest of this project is therefore to highlight the psychological consequences related to the occurrence of cancer in the developmental history (in terms of adversities) of patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, taking into account the patients' previous attachments, resilience, fear of recurrence and perceived fatigue in order to consider their interactions and their effects on their psychological health and ultimately on their quality of life.",

Non-pharmacologic epilepsy treatments, such as specialized diets like the low glycemic diet or the modified Atkins diet, are not well studied in pregnant people with epilepsy but have proven to be effective in reducing seizures in the non-pregnant population. Dietary influence on seizure control is likely multifactorial, and recent studies have shown that one mechanism of action is to cause changes in the gut microbiome and alter neuroactive downstream bacterial metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (Olson et al., 2018). The low glycemic index (LGI) diet is one of the most flexible dietary therapies for epilepsy, and it appears to be safe in pregnancy with positive health outcomes for both the mother and baby (Walsh et al., 2012). Unfortunately, little is known about the effectiveness and mechanism of the LGI diet in pregnant patients with epilepsy.

Primary surgical resection is feasible in about 10-15% of patients with an early-stage disease.

The introduction of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy has improved prognosis after surgery.\nIn the management of patients with PDAC, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is less certain. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of having no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor (R0 resection). In the The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC-5) study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS).\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer.

These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells. In the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesize that EUS-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMetastatic breast cancer (MBC) represents an incurable condition wherein pharmacological interventions are directed towards deferring disease progression and alleviating symptoms, thereby extending survival rates and preserving the quality of life (QoL) and psychological well-being. Clinical advancements in anticancer treatments have notably augmented survival rates among MBC patients. However, accruing evidence reported that adherence to medications is a critical issue in the disease trajectory of breast cancer patients, particularly in the context of oral anticancer treatments (OATs). Emerging evidence indicates that patients with advanced cancer, such as those with MBC, often exhibit significant levels of nonadherence. MBC patients encounter various barriers to the daily management of OATs, including emotional and physical distress associated with side effects, dosage variations, treatment interruptions, and a lack of disease-related knowledge. Prediction models for adherence have been previously developed and tested across diverse scenarios and diseases. Evidence suggested that leveraging of the machine learning models in clinical practice enables the provision of personalized predictions on medication adherence for individual patients, thereby supporting adherence and facilitating targeted interventions. Even so, existing studies have yet to systematically address medication adherence among MBC patients by designing and implementing a decision support system (DSS) that integrates risk predictive models alongside educational and training tools. The current protocol aims to assess the efficacy of the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application (TREAT - TREatment Adherence SupporT), and a machine learning web-based application in promoting adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a sample of MBC patients. This protocol is part of a project titled Enhancing Therapy Adherence Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients (Tracking Number 65080791). The overarching goal of this project is to develop a predictive model of nonadherence, an associated DSS, and guidelines to enhance patient engagement and therapy adherence among MBC patients. The web-based DSS was developed in the first year of the Pfizer Project (65080791) using a patient-centric approach and comprises four sections: i) Metastatic Breast Cancer; ii) Adherence to Cancer Therapies; iii) Promoting Adherence; iv) My Adherence Diary. Moreover, a machine learning web-based application was designed to focus on predicting patients' risk factors for adherence to anticancer treatment, specifically considering physical status, comorbid conditions, and short- and long-term side effects. This machine learning web-based application was developed through a retrospective study employing physiological, clinical, and quality of life data available in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy) (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Specifically, multi-modal retrospective data has been retrieved from the Patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) using natural language processing (NLP) in a sample of 2.750 MBC patients (from 2010 to 2020). Methods/Design Main objectives Evaluating the effectiveness of the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application (TREAT - TREatment Adherence SupporT) in fostering adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a cohort of 100 Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients over a three-month period. Adherence is assessed by calculating the number of pills taken divided by the prescribed amount. Secondary Objectives Identify clinical factors (comorbidities, pain presence, tumor type, treatment type), psychological parameters (personality traits, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, sense of coherence, and risk perception), and QoL variables that serve as predictors for patients' adherence to OATs. These predictors are utilized to assess nonadherence to OATs among MBC patients and enhance the initial version of a machine learning model developed in the retrospective study (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Data for the secondary endpoints are collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 23-item Breast Cancer-specific Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-BR23), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

As inheritance of early studies, a value of 50-60 mmHg has been historically accepted as the gold standard MAP. However, in the last decades, the CPB management has remarkably changed, thanks to the evolution of technology and the availability of new biomaterials. Therefore, as already highlighted by the latest European Guidelines, the current management of CPB can no longer refer to those pioneering studies. To date, only few single-centre studies have compared different strategies of MAP management during CPB, but with contradictory findings and without achieving a real consensus. Therefore, what should be the ideal strategy of MAP management during CPB is still on debate. This trial will be the first multicentre, randomized, controlled study to compare three different strategies of MAP management during the CPB.\nMethods: We described herein the methodology of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing three different approaches to MAP targeting during CPB in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery: the historically accepted standard MAP (50-60 mmHg), the high MAP (70-80 mmHg) and the patient-tailored MAP (comparable to the patient's preoperative MAP). It is the aim of the study to find the most suitable management in order to obtain the most adequate perfusion of end-organs during cardiac surgery. For this purpose, the primary endpoint will be the peak of serum lactate (Lmax) released during CPB, as index of tissue hypoxia. The secondary outcomes will include all the intraoperative parameters of tissues oxygenation and major post-operative complications related to organ malperfusion.\nDiscussion: This trial will assess the best strategy to target the MAP during CPB to further improve the outcomes of cardiac surgery.",

        "summary": "Alcohol use is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions (see ICD-10) and in France, alcohol is the first cause of hospitalization. Binge drinking (BD) has emerged as a major public health issue among student populations and is associated with negative consequences and social, cognitive and brain alterations. More than half of French university students have reported BD in the past month and are at increased risk of several alcohol-related consequences such as memory and sleep impairments, and reduced quality of life. BD is also a major risk factor in the development of alcohol addiction, with individual and environmental factors playing a role that is still poorly understood. Moreover, most students and young adults are reluctant to seek interventions when it is provided by health care professionals (only 4-5%) and have poor insight with regard to their alcohol use patterns / habits. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing effective prevention and intervention programs to reduce alcohol drinking in students. Recent studies have demonstrated that new types of technology-delivered interventions are promising tools for addressing unhealthy alcohol use. For example, an uncontrolled trial pilot study using a smartphone application-delivered intervention produced a reduction in both number of drinks per week and BD from baseline to 3-month follow-up. A recent review also showed significant outcomes of a mobile health intervention for self-control of unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators hypothesize that a timeline follow-back and personalized feedback based on the use of a mobile application can reduce excessive alcohol intake at 3-months.

This experimental study aims to develop an internet-based self-help money management program that improve financial self-efficacy and its associated adverse outcomes among adult population with severe mental illness. Its efficacy will be compared with the wait-list control group. We hypothesized that (1) participants who received a money management program will improve financial self-efficacy after the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls; (2) participants from the money management program will have better financial well-being after the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls. The online money management program course will consist of 4 weekly modules, incorporating the key components of money management and the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO), including the concept of money management, money management skill, and risk of financial exploitation. Each module will consist of the main component presented in video format, quiz, and homework. Materials will be presented interactively to facilitate engagement.",

        "summary": "The goal of this clinical trial is to test the effectiveness of START (Startle Adjuvant Rehabilitation Therapy) in improving arm function after a stroke. The main questions it aims to answer are 1) Does startle rehabilitation therapy improve functional arm performance after training on a specific task and 2) Can training benefits, if any, be seen in other untrained tasks? Researchers will enroll participants across a wide range of upper extremity impairments post-stroke. Participants will be enrolled in three consecutive days of in-person training on an upper extremity task followed by a single-day follow-up session one month after training is completed. Each training session will last for approximately 3 hours per day. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; 1) Arm training with START and 2) Arm training without START. Study participants and assessors will be blinded to the type of training received. Before the training, participants will be clinically assessed to determine impairment level. During training, participants will be asked to perform; 1) a simulated feed task which involves transferring kidney beans using a spoon from one cup (start position) to another cup (end position) in front of them OR 2) A functional reaching task where participants will maintain a tool (spoon) in their hand while extending their arm forward towards an end position based on the severity of arm impairment as determined by the clinical assessment. Researchers will compare the % change in trained task scores, muscle activity, and arm movement outcome measures at three-time points; baseline on day 1, at the end of training on day 3, and one month after training.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators propose to 1) perform a rigorous randomized controlled trial during tasks of functional significance (Aim 1), and 2) assess the capacity of START training to generalize to untrained tasks (Aim 2). Aim 1: Evaluate the capacity of START to enhance training outcomes in individuals with stroke (iwS). The objective of this aim is to demonstrate that START can enhance tasks of clinical and functional significance like those performed during therapy. The investigators propose a randomized, single-blind, parallel, controlled trial evaluating the impact of START on training outcomes of a functional reaching task in iwS. Hypothesis 1: The rate of learning and retention will be larger during training with START compared to control (training without START). Aim 2: Evaluate the generalizability of START training to untrained tasks. To be viable as an adjuvant clinical tool to enhance activities of daily living, training benefits attributable to START must translate beyond the specific tasks trained during therapy. The investigators propose to evaluate skill transference using sorting and dressing tasks. Hypothesis 2: Training with START will show higher skill transfer (e.g. time to complete sorting/dressing task) compared to training without START. SIGNIFICANCE & IMPACT Imagine the transformative impact of an inexpensive tool that could be implemented not only in well-funded, metropolitan hospitals but also in small, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged hospitals enhancing recovery for iwS regardless of disability severity, socioeconomic status, or location. Every year, $43,000,000,000 is paid for care and therapy of the 7,000,000 stroke survivors living in the US but six months post-stroke 65% of patients cannot use their impaired hand during activities of daily living (e.g. feeding, toileting) and 63.5% of stroke survivors will never achieve a total Fugl-Meyer score greater than 90/226 - i.e. severe disability. These statistics are worse for individuals with low SES. A recent, 2018 study demonstrated that patients from low SES backgrounds received less in-patient and out-patient care and were discharged more quickly leading to higher levels of disability and mortality. If successful, this study will revolutionize treatment for stroke survivors because START is non-invasive, inexpensive, and mobile making it accessible to rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. START's application is a loud, acoustic stimulus timed with planned motor activity and can be administered via headphones. Unlike many new rehabilitation devices/techniques, START represents an extremely safe intervention (the application is a loud sound well beneath OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) regulations with no reported adverse reactions since its discovery. Thus, clinical staff training and safety protocols are minimal further decreasing application costs. Finally, it is mobile and easily packaged, so it can be administered via the increasing number of telemedicine programs designed for rural populations. Finally, START allows severe stroke survivors to participate in and benefit from therapy. The benefits of START are not contained to severe stroke survivors (e.g. improvement of hand extension in mildly disabled patients) but the capacity of START to work in severe patients significantly increases the potential of this tool to assist patients across all levels of disability.",

More recently, endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) has shown benefits in terms of respiratory function, exercise capacity and quality of life, but the mechanisms of these improvements are poorly understood.

PRRT is a type of radiation therapy for which a radioactive chemical is linked to a peptide (small protein) that targets cancer cells. When this radioactive peptide is injected into the body, it binds to a specific receptor found on some cancer cells. The radioactive peptide builds up in these cells and helps kill the cancer cells without harming normal cells. In this trial 177Lu-DOTATATE is used for PRRT. 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT may increase the length of time until worsening of the midgut NET compared to the usual approach. Everolimus is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is also a type of angiogenesis inhibitor. Everolimus works by stopping cancer cells from reproducing and by decreasing blood supply to the cancer cells.

Surgery for early stage rectal cancer can be either a radical surgery (RS) or a local excision (LE).\nA radical surgery removes the rectum including the tumor and the lymph nodes through which it spreads, improving survival but with a possible impact in the patients quality of life (QoL). A local excision only removes the tumor and a safety margin of healthy rectum. This has the potential to avoid the possible complications and QoL decrease. However there are some complications after a LE and also poor prognostic factors inherent to the tumor biology that can lead the surgical team to perform a RS after LE with worse outcomes. These are impossible to know before the procedure.\nThe goal of this registry is to determine the frequency of these poor prognostic biological factors and complications in patients undergoing LE for early rectal cancer.\nThe main question it aims to answer are:\n\u2022 How frequently does LE allow for rectum preservation?\nParticipants will undergo LE for early rectal cancer when it is considered the best treatment by their surgeons according to their expertise and protocols.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Researchers want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, adding nivolumab to chemotherapy has on patients with newly diagnosed NPC. In addition, they want to find out if children with NPC may be treated with less radiation therapy and whether this decreases the side effects of therapy.",

This has led to it being licensed for use in the UK in 2022 and is now being prescribed in this age group. There is little information in trials however that shows the effect KaftrioTM (ETI) has on the gut or liver in this age group.\nPrevious studies in the GIFT-CF series (NCT 03566550, NCT04006873 and NCT04618185) has found differences in the functioning of the gut between adults with CF and healthy controls but it is not known whether these differences are present in those aged 6 to 11 years.\nThis study is a significant amendment of the GIFT-CF3 protocol (NCT04618185) that aims to measure gut function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with CF before and after starting ETI. This study also aims to opportunistically measure lung function and structure using MRI and explore how the liver can be measured using MRI in this age group.\nThe study is split into 2 stages. The first is a pilot stage using the modified GIFT-CF protocol recruiting 3 children with CF before starting ETI and 3 healthy volunteers. This is to determine we are able to successfully perform these scans in these age groups. If successful, the second stage will recruit a further 12 children with CF before they start ETI. This will take our cohort up to 15 children with CF. This cohort will then be rescanned 6 months after starting ETI using the same scan protocol.",

The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study (NCT04618185) to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint. In total, participants will be asked to remain in the MRI scanner for approximately 30 minutes at a time. For comfort, participants will be able to watch multimedia programmes through the use of a specially adapted television while in the scanner. Participants will also be asked to complete validated gastrointestinal questionnaires throughout the study day and recall their GI symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and complete a 3 day food diary. The study will be split into two phases. The first will be a pilot phase where 3 children with CF aged 6 to 11 years and 3 healthy age and gender matched controls undergo MRI scanning. These scans will be assessed to determine whether the scan protocol can be completed by the participants and assess the quality of the images obtained. If successful, the trial will progress onto the main phase. In the main phase, the 12 additional children with CF will be recruited and undergo the above scanning protocol, prior to starting ETI.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHypospadias repair surgery is an invasive surgery that results in significant postoperative pain. pain alters the quality of life and satisfaction of the patients and results in manipulation of wounds, infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence leading to unfavorable surgical outcome . As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedtomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting. A vast majority of literature supports the efficacy of particulate steroids like methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions. Aim of the work and hypothesis: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of caudal methylprednisolone in pediatric patients.

Therefore, finding effective interventions for ROP examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in ROP examination on premature infants. Retinopathy is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for ROP examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the ROP examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The examination success rate was defined as the ability to complete the ROP examination without disturbances caused by infant distress or movement. The study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed ROP examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated ROP examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensory stimulation during ROP examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population.",

Some epidemiological studies report that infants experience an average of 7.5-14 painful procedures per day per infant during the first 14 days of their hospitalization.\nThe most significant problem encountered in understanding pain in infants is the lack of verbal expression of pain. Newborns express their pain with nonverbal behavioral expressions. Therefore, any pain assessment is based on the ability to recognize the pain symptoms of others. The pain experienced may cause physiological imbalances and abnormalities in brain development and stress response in infants in the short and long term. It can negatively affect family-infant communication, as well as cause emotional and psychosomatic problems later in life.\nToday, music therapy has positive effects on reducing stress, reducing pain, oxygen saturation level, and peak heart rate values in providing individualized developmental care of the infant in neonatal intensive care units. Heart sound, babies hear the mother's heart sound the most during the intrauterine period in the womb. Therefore, when babies hear the sound, they are familiar with in the womb, they will feel safe and a sense of relaxation will occur in the baby. Several studies have proven that playing heartbeat sounds to newborn babies can positively affect their physiological indicators, feeding, length of hospital stay and pain outcomes. The current literature shows that the presence of rhythmic sound can positively affect the neurobehavioral development of the infant and reduce pain. Rhythmic sounds have healing/positive effects on newborns; listening to white noise reduces preterms' pain scores, stabilizes vital signs, and plays an active role in preterms' sleep-wake period.\nIn line with all this information, this study was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study in order to determine the effects of music played during heel spear application, white noise and heart sound in infants.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nKnee surgeries are associated with severe postoperative pain. Improper pain management affects patients' psychological status with prolongation of hospital stay time and rehabilitation period, with the possibility of progression of the acute pain to chronic pain (McCartney CJ, Nelligan K., 2014). Many Pain management options following these surgeries are available: non-opioid analgesics, opioids and regional anesthesia techniques (epidural and peripheral nerve block). Multi-modal analgesia is considered the best option for pain management in knee surgeries. As non-opioid analgesics alone are not effective enough while opioids alone are associated with many risk factors: nausea, vomiting, decrease intestinal motility and respiratory depression with possibility of addiction (Goode VM, Morgan B, et al, 2019). Regarding the functional anatomy of the nerve supply to knee joint: The knee is innervated by genicular branches from the nerve to vastus medialis, saphenous nerve, sciatic nerve and the posterior division of obturator nerve. The skin around the knee is supplied by the cutaneous branches from the femoral nerve and the saphenous nerve (Ritesh Roy, Gaurav Agarwal, et al, 2018). The widespread use of ultrasound to advance peripheral nerve block techniques over the past decade has led to enormous growth in the utilization and efficiency of regional anesthesia (Cozowicz, Crispiana & Poeran, et al, 2015). The adductor canal block (ACB) is an interfascial plane block performed in the middle third of the medial side of the thigh. The adductor canal bounded anteriorly by the sartorius muscle, posteriorly and medially by the adductor longus and magnus muscles, and laterally by the vastus medialis muscle. It contains the femoral vein and artery, the saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus medialis, both are sensory branches of the femoral nerve. In some individuals, the obturator sensory branch (also a femoral nerve branch) can be affected by local anesthetic infiltration into this area. It can be noted that this block affect sensory branches and avoid blocking the majority of motor branches. The block is most commonly performed using ultrasound guidance (Thiayagarajan MK, Kumar SV,et al 2019). Ultrasound guided 4-in-1 block technique: a new single injection technique described by Roy R, Agarwal G, et al, 2018 for the combined 4 nerves (saphenous nerve, obturator nerve, nerve to vastus medialis and sciatic nerve) with a single injection point is located at the adductor hiatus where descending genicular artery branches from superficial femoral artery. Bupivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic (max. dose 2.5 mg/kg). Symptoms contributed to local anesthetic toxicity include tinnitus, perioral tingling, visual disturbances and dizziness (Shafiei FT, McAllister RK, Lopez J, 2022)",

It has a social function, but above all, a functionnal one. An optimized reconstruction of this area after the burn allow the patient to recover the best possible function and increase his chances of returning to professional activity and daily life. Advances in burn treatment, such as improved resuscitation management, rapid excision of burns, skin grafting, regular dressings, and improved metabolic support, have reduced the morbidity and mortality of severe burns. However, significant challenges remain.\nThe hand is the most frequently involved area in burns and is affected in 90% of severe burns. Hand burns requiring releasing incisions are circular, deep burns and represent a significant functional challenge. In the acute setting, current treatment options must prevent complications associated with disruption of the skin's protective function. In the longer term, these treatments should allow the regeneration of fully functional skin. However, some sequelae may persist in the form of sensory deficits, residual pain, retractile scars hindering function in this highly mobile area, or even aesthetic sequelae.\nThe aim of our study was to perform a descriptive analysis of the aesthetic and functional sequelae related to hand burns that required acute realeasing incisions using objective and subjective tools available in the medical records (demographic, clinical and follow-up data in the context of routine care).

        "summary": "More than 70% of chronic illnesses can be prevented or reversed with a whole-food, plant-based diet (WFPBD). This dietary pattern is also more sustainable for our planetary health. The majority of physicians receive fewer than 20 hours of nutrition education during the entire course of their medical training. Although many physicians are aware of the importance of diet on their well-being, they face significant barriers in following a healthy diet. Because physicians' own habits strongly influence patient health habits, the investigators theorize that physicians who eat a WFPBD themselves will be much more likely to successfully counsel their patients on nutrition and recommend a WFPBD.\nThe most effective methods that can be successfully used to encourage busy physicians to adopt a WFPBD have not yet been identified. Given the increasing rates of diet-related chronic illnesses, if proven effective, this study may offer a new scalable approach to encourage physicians, and ultimately their patients, to adopt a WFPBD.\nThe aims of this study are to:\nAssess the impact of a multimodal 6-week educational program on WFPBD on a) change in physicians' diet type and quality, b) change in mindset about WFPBD, and c) stage of change based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change (Figure 1), compared to the delayed-intervention (control group) from baseline to week 6.\nAssess the impact of the 6-week educational program on the development of skills and knowledge required to a) adopt a WFPBD and b) counsel patients on the same.",

Still, there are some complex approaches needed to be converted to TFA. There has been no difference in total operation duration and fluoroscopy time between TRA and TFA, but the TRA group had higher radiation dose and shorter hospital stays than the TFA group.

Detailed information about the study was verbally provided to participants, and written informed consent was obtained. The study adhered to the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration. The study design adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for rigorous reporting.\n                A convenience sample of 30 participants was equally and randomly divided into three groups: the CTM group (n=10), CM group (n=10), and control group (n=10). Randomization was carried out by an independent physical therapist, who was not involved in the assessment or treatment of the participants, 1 hour before the baseline measurements. The randomization process involved using opaque and sealed envelopes, each containing a group allocation number generated from a computer-generated random number table. Block randomization was employed to ensure an equal distribution of participants across the groups. All treatment sessions were administered by the same investigator (C.D) in the study group. The intervention duration was uniform across all groups: 4 consecutive weeks, with 3 sessions per week lasting 15-20 minutes per session. Outcome measurements were taken at the beginning and 4 weeks after the completion of the program. An independent physiotherapist, unaware of the research details and participant groupings, conducted the evaluations.\n                The results of the study showed that both connective tissue massage and classical massage were effective in reducing pain, improving functional status and quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of these outcomes.\n                In conclusion, both connective tissue massage and classical massage can be used as effective treatment options for patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.",

Eligible patients will have mild to moderate glaucoma and be candidates for cataract surgery. The trial will look at the eye pressure before and one year after cataract surgery in patients. One eye in each patient will have cataract surgery with canaloplasty using OMNI. The patients other eye will have cataract surgery with canaloplasty and a HYDRUS stent. The trial will look at the differences in eye pressure and if patients are able to need fewer eye pressure lowering drops after surgery.\nStudy participants will undergo preop testing of pressure, vision, slit lamp exam, ocular coherence tomography (OCT) of the nerve fiber layer (NFL) analysis, and visual field prior to cataract surgery with MIGS. One day, one week, one month, 6 month, and 1 year exams will be performed to check pressure, vision, slit lamp exam, and number of necessary eye pressure medications in each eye.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe purpose of this research study is to: \u00b7 Determine the differing pressure lowering effects between OMNI canaloplasty alone versus when combined with HYDRUS microstent. Both surgical study devices are widely used by themselves in conjunction with cataract surgery. While many surgeons have begun combining the two procedures, this will be one of the first studies to randomize (assign by chance) one eye to OMNI canaloplasty alone and the other eye to OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS stent and report the results after one year. About 80 subjects aged 18 years and older will participate in this study. WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY? Your participation in this study will last approximately one year and will include approximately seven study visits to the study center and two visits to the surgery center. Screening: Before any study-related tests and procedures are performed, you will be asked to read and sign this consent document. The following screening tests and procedures will then be performed to determine if you qualify to take part in this study: Visual field OCT analysis of the nerve and cornea - your nerve and cornea will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) equipment. This is painless, non-invasive (it does not involve puncturing or cutting) and is similar to having photographs taken of your eye. You will be required to sit still during the brief scanning procedure (a few seconds) Slit lamp exam with gonioscopy - a close inspection of the front of the eye using a machine that magnifies the eye and provides a beam of light to light the structures of the eye Eye pressure test - measurement of the pressure inside the eye. The pressure in your eyes will be measured using an instrument known as a tonometer Visual acuity test - a test involving reading letters off a chart to determine how well you can see This study will use competitive enrollment. This means that when a target number of subjects begins the study, all further enrollment will be closed. Therefore, it is possible that you could be in the screening phase, ready to begin the study, and be discontinued without your consent if the target number of subjects has already begun the study. If you qualify to take part in this study and go on to receive the study treatment, then the following will happen: Washout Period: You will be asked to stop taking your eye drops to treat your glaucoma. This is called a washout period, during which the effects of these medications leave your body. Study Treatment: You will be randomly assigned by chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive either OMNI canaloplasty or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. You will have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving OMNI canaloplasty alone or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. This is a not a blinded study, which means that you, the study doctor, study staff and the sponsor will know the study treatment you are given. You will have the following study visits and undergo the following procedures: \u00b7 Preoperative and postoperative care will be the same as a standard cataract surgery consisting of one day, one week, one month, six month and one year follow-up exams. The only difference for study subjects is they will be asked to stop all glaucoma drops one month prior to their pre-op exam and one year post-op exam. After Study Treatment: Glaucoma is a permanent and irreversible condition that requires lifelong monitoring with an eye care professional. Sometimes additional treatment is required. Your eye specialist will recommend follow-up care based on your personal findings.",

The study was designed as a multicenter, prospective, open-label, randomized, comparative, controlled, parallel-arm study evaluating the efficacy and safety in patients with a specific disease. The study population consisted of 110 patients (55 patients in each group) with elevated intraocular pressure induced by primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), males and females in the age bracket of 18 to 75 years conforming to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients randomized: 110 Dropouts: 0 Per protocol population: 110 Safety population: 110 The efficacy was established based on analysis of the parameters as follows: Primary endpoint Mean IOP change from baseline. Secondary endpoints IOP reduction rate to the target level of \u2264 18 mm Hg. IOP reduction rate greater than 20%. IOP reduction rate greater than 30%. Safety evaluation Incidence of other adverse events to a greater or lesser extent linked to the test or reference product, including those evaluated from laboratory test findings. Treatment safety will be assessed from recording adverse events via analysis of complaints and symptoms, evaluation, and interpretation of the findings of instrumental monitoring (biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, IOP measures, perimetry) and laboratory tests. Given that the test product may cause miosis resulting in transient visual acuity reduced, the contribution of the visual acuity parameter 'Vis' is not taken into account when assessing the treatment success. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Statsoft Statistica Professional 13 and Microsoft Excel 2016 software. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate the normality of distribution of quantitative attributes. Parametric tests were used for testing statistical hypotheses for parameters with the normal distribution, whereas nonparametric tests were used for parameters with the variance of the distribution. Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for comparing the study groups in terms of quantitative attributes. The comparison of intragroup parameters before and after treatment was performed using the dependent samples t-test or the Wilcoxon test. The intragroup comparisons were also performed using nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA (the Friedman test). Qualitative attributes were analyzed using Pearson's \u03c72 test or Fisher's exact test (if the attribute incidence rate in at least one subgroup was \u2264 5). Statistically significant are differences with p-values < 0.05.

For this reason, there is a need for applications that will attract the attention and interest of patients or direct them, but that will not create commitment to the hospital. In this sense, it has been reported that breathing exercises to be applied through virtual reality glasses will attract the attention and interest of the patient, increase their motivation and make breathing exercises more regular. Therefore, this study was planned to determine the effect of breathing exercises applied with virtual reality glasses on dyspnea, anxiety and quality of life in COPD patients.",

        "summary": "Delirium is one of the most common complications after cardiac surgery and occurs with an incidence of 3 - 70%.\nBoth predisposing factors (age, diabetes, severity of cardiac disease, atrial fibrillation) and precipitating factors (type of surgery, duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and surgery, ventilator time in ICU, highest temperature in intensive care (ICU)) are difficult to influence. Post-operative delirium is a devastating complication, leading to longer ICU and hospital stay, increased incidence of discharge to nursing facility and poorer long-term cognitive outcome.\nDespite the impact this complication has on individuals, their families and healthcare resources, little is known about the causes and potential preventative measures.\nIt is thought that systemic inflammation compromising the integrity of the blood brain barrier is an important contributing factor. Recent data suggests that antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid (TXA) might be able to lessen the inflammation of the nervous system caused by surgery and CPB through the inhibition of plasmin production, thereby stabilising the blood brain barrier. Worldwide, the use of TXA has become standard of care in cardiac surgery and other types of surgery with a high risk of bleeding. It has been shown to reduce bleeding by 25% and significantly reduce the rate of transfusion in cardiac and noncardiac surgery.\nAt Royal Papworth hospital it is routine practice to administer 2g of TXA before commencing CPB irrespective of patients' body weight. We are hypothesising that there is a weight-based effect of TXA on neurological outcomes after cardiac surgery, showing a signal that a higher dose per kg bodyweight will lead to less delirium measured with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS). We intend to analyse 4 years' worth of patient data (05/2018 - 08/2022)\u037e the necessary information is routinely collected on using the hospital anaesthetic and ICU record.",

The frequency of neck pain as found to be 84% which is exceptionally high and these are the majority of the individuals with neck pain that present to physiotherapy. In many cases, various factors contribute to the development of non-specific neck pain. These might include physical strain at work, such as working on something above you or sitting at a desk without moving enough. Emotional stress, like worries and anxiety about family or work, often plays an important role. It is thought that in some cases the cause may be an over-stretch (sprain) of a ligament or muscle. In other cases the cause may be a minor problem with a disc between two spinal bones (vertebrae), or a minor problem with a small facet joint between two vertebrae. Objective of this study will be to compare the effects of myofascial decompression and positional release therapies on pain, range of motion and functional disability in chronic nonspecific neck pain.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nNeck pain is one of the most common and painful musculoskeletal conditions. Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition. The symptoms of nonspecific neck pain are similar to those of whiplash associated disorders (WAD) grade I and II but there is no traumatic event involved. Nonspecific neck pain (NP) is defined as pain in the posterior and lateral aspect of the neck between the superior nuchal line and the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra with no signs or symptoms of major structural pathology and no or minor to major interference with activities of daily life as well as with the absence of neurological signs and specific pathologies. Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as cervical pain without a known pathological basis as the underlying cause of the complaints. Some symptoms are limited cervical spine mobility and neck muscles weakness, which may be often related to other problems, such as, vertebral, neck or shoulder impaired function, and mental and physical stress at work. The natural course of non-specific neck pain remains unclear. While it is often self-limiting within a few weeks of onset, it can severely limit daily functioning, induce substantial medical consumption and result in prolonged sick leave and disability leading chronic nonspecific neck pain if pain duration is more than three months. As a consequence, it places a heavy burden on individuals, employers and health care services. Nonspecific neck belongs to the group of musculoskeletal disorders, which include diverse conditions affecting muscles, bones, and/or joints of the limbs or the spine. As for most other musculoskeletal disorders, nonspecific neck pain is multifactorial. A variety of different types of exercise have been explored to treat chronic nonspecific neck pain, including low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise, high intensity aerobic exercise, stretching exercise and muscular strength exercises and isometrics. However, the most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain is unknown reflecting its complexity and more research is require. The rationale of the study is to compare the effects of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy on pain, range of motion and functional disability in chronic nonspecific neck pain. The main purpose of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy is to release the cervical trigger points, improving end ranges and lengthening of muscle. MDT helps draw toxins out of the muscles and to the superficial veins to be removed by the body. This leads to decreased pain and tension in the tissues. The ultimate goal is to achieve pain free end ranges and flexibility of muscle in nonspecific neck pain patients.",

        "summary": "Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction Surgery (NOSES), which involves obtaining specimens from the abdominal cavity without any incisions, has attracted much attention in recent years, and it has been widely popularized in the treatment of rectal cancer because of its postoperative non-incision, advantages of less trauma, quicker recovery, and postoperative aesthetics. Anastomotic fistula is a serious complication of rectal cancer surgery. For patients at high risk of anastomotic fistula, prophylactic ileostomy is often performed intraoperatively to divert feces and protect the anastomosis. For such patients, rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma (NOSES with specimen extraction via stoma) is usually performed, borrowing a prophylactic stoma incision to retrieve the specimen, and also realizing the absence of additional abdominal incision. However, this procedure is prone to stoma infection and has a high complication rate (20-40%), which limits the popularization of NOSES surgery and is an urgent clinical problem. Our center has proposed a new stoma closure method (Dumpling Suture Method), which reduces the size of the incision by folding the suture to achieve the effect of hiding the skin incision and reduce stoma infection. In our previous study, 17 cases of the new procedure were completed in our center, and 25 patients with stoma closure by the traditional method were included in the same period for control purposes. After six months of follow-up, we found that the dumpling suture method significantly reduced the incidence of stoma complications compared with the traditional suture method (5.8% vs. 36%), and no additional adverse effects were observed. This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical study planned to recruit 66 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the trial and control groups. The primary endpoint is stoma complication rate at 30 days postoperatively. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dumpling suture method  compared with the traditional stoma suture in reducing postoperative stoma complications through a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial, which is of great significance for the improvement of the rectal NOSES procedure and the reduction of the incidence of stoma complications.",

A recent meta-analysis found that, on average, 31% of patients with PD-MCI converted to PDD within seven years; however, 24% of patients with PD-MCI reverted back to normal cognitive function. Consequently, the false positive rate for predicting PDD among patients with PD-MCI is high, and better predictive markers to define patients at high risk for PDD development are urgently needed. Therefore, a combination of different markers, including clinical, genetic, and other biomarker data, are proposed to increase ability to predict cognitive worsening and dementia. Based on data of the first follow-up of this cohort results indicated that presence of both mild cognitive instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) impairment and PD-MCI dramatically increases the risk for PDD (PubMed ID: 36240089).

        "summary": "Specific language and learning disorders (SLLD) affect around 5-10% of school-aged children, or 1-2 child(ren) per class. SLLDs correspond to the impairment of a specific cognitive function and are divided into 5 categories: dyslexia, dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (DSM-5). In recent years, real progress has been made in their clinical diagnosis and management, thanks to a better description of these disorders in the DSM-5 and the advent of rehabilitative treatments (neuropsychology, speech therapy, occupational therapy, orthoptics, etc.). SLLD can occur in a sporadic or familial context (sibling involvement, a symptomatic parent, other relatives who may mimic dominant inheritance with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance).\nIt has long been suspected that SLLD is secondary to multifactorial inheritance, with a combination of frequent genetic variations and environmental factors. In France, in the absence of an obvious syndromic diagnosis, the current strategy is to prescribe array CGH, combined in girls with a search for fragile X syndrome (in boys, this syndrome leads to systematic intellectual disability, which does not justify its study in SLLD). A few genes have been described as being specifically involved in a small proportion of SLLD, most often with de novo variations or inherited from a symptomatic parent. There are no distinctive clinical features to guide targeted sequencing of these genes. Moreover, our recent experience shows that genes implicated in intellectual disability may also be involved in SLLD. Very few studies have been published in the literature evaluating the value of exome sequencing in SLLD. Only two studies have been identified, involving 10 and 43 patients with specific SLLD.\nIn view of the roll-out of the French Genomic Medicine Plan (PFMG 2025), it is important to set up a study aimed at assessing the value of genome-wide sequencing in the etiological work-up for SLLD.\nParticipation in the study consists of:\nan inclusion visit, where an additional blood sample will be taken during the baseline work-up\na results visit (4 months after the inclusion visit)\nOptional qualitative study: semi-structured interview 1 year after the inclusion visit proposed to 20 patients or families with a positive result and to 10 patients with a negative result.",

We are aiming to develop a five-days small group-based lifestyle modification program on weight loss that would be appropriate in the general practice and outpatient setting facilities. A structured 5-day lifestyle modification program led by endocrinologists-diabetologists together with a nutritionist, a psychologist, and a kinesiologist is aiming to educate on lifestyle modification necessary to lose weight.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe program involves coherent groups of motivated participants in smaller groups of 7-10 persons. Participants are adults with body mass index (BMI) in the range of overweight or obese and are motivated to change their lifestyle. During the five days of the program held outside the medical facility positive interaction and mutual support of the participants develop in the group together with education and an informal approach, along with practical workshops on nutrition, daily physical activity and psychological support, patients receive practical recommendations for life. Follow-up continues in the form of short additional educational lectures, support, and body weight measurement after one month, three months, six months and after a year. Participants are encouraged to stay in contact between the meetings using the same instant messaging platform in a form of a closed group, and a leader of the program is sending inspirational messages and advice regularly. Initially, after 3 and 6 months a metabolic parameter evaluation is performed (fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile) as well as blood pressure is measured. Individual anthropometric measurements of the participants are carried out on the first day of the program and continued at every visit. The parameters taken are body height (cm), body mass (kg), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm), BMI (kg/m2), the proportion of fat tissue (%) and muscle tissue (%), basal metabolism (kcal) and visceral adipose tissue. On the first day of the program, an initial questionnaire is filled out exploring sociodemographic and health data, data on eating habits, physical activity and psychological. Education During the 5-day participants have lectures explaining in a simple short interactive lecture a different topic related to obesity followed by discussion. Topics explain concerns about obesity as a disease, the background of obesity, metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of obesity, nonverbal communication and obesity, the plateau phenomenon and the epidemiology of obesity. Nutrition The program helps participants to make healthier food choices by acquiring knowledge of nutrition basics and meal planning. During the program, the participants learn how to prepare easy and healthy meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack, read food labels and measure portion sizes with their hands. Physical activity Participants wear accelerometers before the beginning of the program. During the program, they are going to have daily 10' physical exercises (exercise and explanations) in a form of a complex of exercises designed for all adults, especially for the working population. The set of exercises consists of stretching and mobility exercises that are performed with light, moderate movements and can be performed without hindrance in everyday work clothes. They are going to be educated on how and how much to be physically active and how to choose the appropriate physical activity and activity intensity. Psychological support Daily support involves behavioural change that is working on goal setting and recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of changing behaviour. Nex workshop works on recognizing the difference between emotional hunger and physical hunger, identifying personal triggers, and finding alternatives to emotional eating. Participants identify the key distortions in the negative thoughts of dieters that prevent them from reaching and maintaining their desired weight and learn how to correct these distortions. Also, they learn what it means to have a positive or negative body image, how body image affects mental and physical health, and what we can do to improve our body image. Evaluation At the end of each lecture/interactive workshop, participants fill out an evaluation questionnaire. At the end of the education, on the 5th day of education, the participants fille out the final questionnaire (outcome evaluation).",

In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks was 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand.

The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. Thanks to the increasing frequency of preterm birth in recent years and scientific and technological advances in neonatology, life expectancy is extended up to the 23rd week of gestation. However, this increased the incidence of retinopathy. Therefore, it is of great importance for neotologists, pediatricians and nurses who care for preterms to know the pathophysiology, staging, risk factors and principles of appropriate care for them in reducing the incidence, possible complications and mortality rates of ROP. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. These physiological changes observed after the examination continue for 24 hours. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce pain.

In the literature review; In a study evaluating the effectiveness of sucrose combination with non-nutritive sucking, they reported that pain was moderately reduced and more studies are needed. In another study (2015), it was concluded that topical anesthesia and oral dextrose were not effective in reducing pain in both groups. In a study comparing the effectiveness of breast milk and sucrose, it is recommended to use breast milk because of the rapid recovery of the baby after the ROP examination. In the comparison of the position, which is another non-pharmacological method, with the routine practice in the study conducted in 2019; It has been concluded that the frock position is more effective in relieving pain. In another study, it was stated that the mother's voice as music therapy also showed an analgesic effect and accelerated the recovery after the ROP examination. In the light of this information, when we look at the literature, no specific study was found in which a rain stick and The Happiest Baby music were used to reduce pain and increase the comfort level during the ROP examination.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSleep is one of the basic physiological needs of man and is necessary for the normal functioning of the body. Sleep disorders can impair cognitive function, decision-making ability, exercise capacity, and immune system. Sleep disorders, which may occur in the perioperative period as short-term or long-term, affect many patients. Studies have shown that approximately 8.8-79.1% of patients experience perioperative sleep disorders, and this situation can continue for a long time after surgery. According to animal and human studies, anesthetic agents may cause sleep disturbances in the postoperative period. Anesthetics can disrupt the normal sleep-wake cycle and thus cause sleep insufficiency and poor sleep quality. Since postoperative pain and emotional changes will also cause sleep disturbances, the view that general anesthesia impairs postoperative sleep quality has not yet been proven. Pain is the most important risk factor for sleep disturbance in the perioperative period. There is a very serious interaction between pain and sleep. Pain can exacerbate sleep disorders. At the same time, sleep disorders can make the pain worse. Perioperative pain accompanies physical discomfort and is very common, especially in osteoarthritis patients. The goals of total hip arthroplasty (TKA) include relief of these pains and improvement of physical function. Different types of surgery have varying effects on sleep quality. Patients report that they experience more sleep disruption due to pain after orthopedic surgery. Depending on the greater trauma caused by major surgery, the sleep quality of the patients may be worse. The elderly and female gender are more likely to experience sleep disorders. Environmental factors and healthcare practices in the hospital may contribute to sleep disorders. Postoperative environment change, inadequate beds, noise and lights in the ward, medical staff, night treatment and nursing controls, machine noises, postoperative diets and warnings from the urinary catheter are additional factors that affect patients' sleep. Evaluation of sleep disorders is mainly based on clinical symptoms (difficulty falling asleep, early awakening, night terrors, nightmares or abnormal behavior during the sleep period) and auxiliary objective scales. Subjective sleep quality assessment mainly scales: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale (PIRS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Athens Insomnia Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS). It is in the form. The most commonly used assessment in clinical studies is the PSQI. PSQI has high reliability and validity, but evaluates over a one-month period. The PIRS_20 scale, which is a self-assessment survey, is a scale created by the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and evaluates the participants' sleep quality in the last week. It generally consists of a questionnaire with a total of twenty items, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disorders. Scoring ranges from 0 to 60. A score of 20 and above indicates poor sleep quality, while as the score increases, sleep quality deteriorates. As another assessment of sleep quality, the ISI is a self-rating scale that measures insomnia symptoms and consequences. Substances include difficulties in initiating sleep and maintaining sleep; It is designed to assess satisfaction with current sleep patterns, disruption in daily life, cognitive impairments, and the degree of anxiety or worry caused by sleep disturbance. The severity of insomnia is also determined by the total score of these items. Additionally, ESS is used to evaluate the tendency to sleep during the day. Sleep disorders can negatively impact patient recovery, contributing to higher rates of postoperative complications such as neurological and cardiovascular morbidity and delayed postoperative recovery. They are also risk factors for the development of delirium. Despite posing a significant threat to public health, sleep disorders remain poorly understood, underdiagnosed, and poorly managed, especially in perioperative patients. The potential negative consequences of sleep disorders indicate that more attention should be paid to this issue. Risk factors that increase sleep problems include postoperative pain, depression, anxiety, and physical disabilities. Sleep problems experienced the night before surgery may affect postoperative pain due to various other factors. has an even more significant effect. Sleep quality assessment is not a part of the pre-anaesthesia routine evaluation of patients and adequate attention is not paid to perioperative management. The type of anesthesia is also one of the factors on sleep quality. It is known that the anesthesia process (",

It is a degenerative joint disease affecting 15%-40% of people more than 40 years of age. The term osteoarthritis was authored in 1886 by the English doctor, John Kent Spender. Clinical assessment to recognize OA from RA and other comparable conditions turned out to be broadly acknowledged by the main decade of the twentieth century enormous because of the endeavors set forward by Archibald E. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition that causes other joint tissues to lose gross cartilage and to experience morphological damage. Pathological changes seen in knee osteoarthritis joints include progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage, thickening of the subchondral bone, formation of osteophytes, variable degrees of inflammation of the synovium, degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee and hypertrophy of the joint capsule. Biomechanical factor that is assumed to contribute to the etiology of OA is laxity of knee joint, which is described as the rotation or displacement of femur from tibia. One research found that Varus-valgus laxity in patients with unaltered knees and unilateral OA is wider than in stable healthy participants, indicating knee joint laxity may be disease predisposing. the progress of the lateral and medial knee OA, as defined by narrowing of joint space and a degradation of physical activity, was found to have been linked with lower limb valgus-Varus alignment. The main focus in OA management is on promoting self-management, reducing pain, optimize function, and modifying the disease process and its effects. The primary treatment for OA knee conservatively is physiotherapy which includes strength training, modalities, knee bracing, resistance training and Kinesiotaping. Resistance exercise can reduce knee pain severity and leg strength in participants with symptomatic knee OA.

Long COVID can affects any type of patient and has polymorphic and fluctuating symptoms over time.\nThe Reunion Island is a French overseas department located in the Indian Ocean accounting more than 860,000 inhabitants. It has recorded since March 11, 2020, nearly 491,825 cases of COVID-19 and 961 deaths of hospitalized patients. Reunion's population is multi-ethnic and younger than the metropolitan France's one. It also has a higher prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, two serious form factors of COVID-19. This specific context makes this island a particular study site for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Long COVID.\nIn addition, some studies have confirmed the involvement of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) in the symptomatology of Long COVID and demonstrated that patients with a Long COVID present a dysfunction of their ANS which is objectified by a reduced Heart Rate Variability (HRV). The regulation of heart rate by the ANS is strongly favored by respiration. A regular slow and deep breathing training helps to adjust the baroreflex, which connect heart rate, breathing and blood pressure.

        "summary": "Ibrutinib, the first BTK inhibitor (BTKI) to be approved, improves progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) over alternative therapies in relapsed/refractory and treatment-naive chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Ibrutinib has also been found to be effective in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma. However, ibrutinib treatment is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), with an estimated 2-year AF rate of 16% in patients treated with ibrutinib during a median follow-up of 28 months. In most studies, AF was identified by reports as a treatment-related adverse event, and systematic screening for AF was not performed. As AF is often paroxysmal, the more intensive the screening, the higher the incidence. In a prospective cohort study of 53 patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL, patients were monitored by pulse palpation and ECG every 3 months. The cumulative incidence rate of ibrutinib-associated AF was 23% at 12 months and 38% at 2 years. The management of ibrutinib-associated AF is challenging due to difficulties in balancing the benefits of anticoagulation to mitigate the risk of stroke and the bleeding risk associated with ibrutinib. AF is a frequent reason for discontinuation of ibrutinib therapy, and can result in significant morbidity.\nIn addition to this arrhythmogenic effect, ibrutinib is also significantly associated with the onset or worsening of arterial hypertension. Finally, an increased risk of serious ventricular rhythm disorders has also been suggested by pharmacovigilance databases, but not yet confirmed by prospective clinical studies.\nThe study proposes a comprehensive cardiovascular approach, at baseline and during follow-up of patients on Ibrutinib, using innovative markers to anticipate patients most at risk of developing these cardiovascular effects, but also to detect them as early as possible in order to avoid the complications they may generate.",

The study is interventional, nonpharmacological, using medical devices, nonprofit. The intervention involves the use of a neuro-stimulation technique, the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS), combined with a psychotherapy intervention, metacognitive therapy (MetaCognitive Therapy, MCT). TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique involving the transcranial application of a low-amperage electric current at a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been demonstrated how such stimulation has a neuromodulating effect on synaptic plasticity, with efficacy in unipolar major depression. The technique also has a good safety, as it is not associated with major side effects. MCT is based on the metacognitive model, according to which psychopathological processes are consequent to a cognitive style characterized by repetitive forms of thinking (such as rumination) and maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and thought suppression. The MCT, through attention training techniques, detached mindfulness and behavioral interventions on metacognitions, has shown effectiveness in major depressive disorder comparable to that of psychotherapeutic interventions considered, within psychotherapies, to be first-line such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. The experimental design will be that of a randomized, double-blind study with three arms of treatment, each consisting of 8 sessions, involving the administration of 1) the neurostimulation intervention (tDCS), 2) of the psychotherapeutic intervention alone (MCT), 3) of both techniques in consecution (tDCS-MCT). This design is aimed at evaluating a potential additive/synergistic effect of the two interventions when combined. During the tDCS sessions, each lasting 20 minutes, the patient will apply the technique of attention training, aimed at further activating the region stimulated by neurostimulation, so as to so as to amplify the plasticity stimulated by tDCS, achieving a synergistic effect. To follow, a 40-minute MCT session will be carried out. The effectiveness of these interventions will be assessed by heteroadministered and self-administered at time zero, after treatment, at two follow-ups of 6 and 12 months.

The incidence of lower back pain among workers is approximately 13%. Out of which, CRLBP is responsible for 11%. In the lumbosacral region, radicular pain has an occurrence rate of 10 % to 25%. Key interventions by physical therapists involve pain relieving modalities, stretching, muscle conditioning, lumbar traction, and awareness about correct postures that lead to useful exercises. As the reason behind the radicular low back pain is the spinal nerve compression due to the spinal canal impingement, the lumbar traction lightens the pain through vertebral separation producing decompression on the pressed nerve. Radicular low back pain shows diverse symptoms, it can be self-limiting, staying only for a short interval with no aftereffects, or can be a key concern behind long-term disability and work loss. The narrative on the effectiveness of vertical traction as a component of physical therapy modalities is contradictory. Despite the fact that lumbar traction has been preferred over other methods for the treatment of lumbar disk disorders, it is usually not advised in the treatment of acute low back pain because of the efficiency of more active treatment options.

Although medication can assist nurses to improve these symptoms simultaneously in a short period of time, they are at risk of overuse of benzodiazepine hypnotics. Previous research supports the usefulness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) as self-management strategies in adults with insomnia, anxiety, depression, and pain. However, their effects on post COVID-19 condition have not been researched, and no previous head-to-head study compared the effects on these two approaches on insomnia and neuropsychiatric symptoms.\nAim: To investigate the effects of CBT-I on insomnia, anxiety, depression, and pain in nurses with post COVID-19 condition.\nMethods: In this two-arm, parallel randomized controlled trial, 100 participants will be 1:1 randomly assigned to one of two groups (CBT-I and control). The intervention phase will last 6 weeks, followed by a three-month follow-up. Primary outcomes are insomnia severity and sleep quality, whereas anxiety, depression, pain, and health-related quality of life are secondary outcomes. These variables will be assessed before and after the intervention, and at 1, 2, and 3 months after the end of the intervention.

The main questions it aims to answer are:\nIs the patient decision aid acceptable to both patients and physicians? Does the patient decision aid lead to more effective shared decision-making than standard care among patients with atrial fibrillation who are considering stroke prevention therapy? Participants with a recent diagnosis of atrial fibrillation will be enrolled before an upcoming specialist physician visit. Researchers will compare a pre-visit intervention consisting of standard educational materials plus use of the patient decision aid to educational materials alone to see if using the decision aid results in improved shared decision making during the clinic visit.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAtrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 1-2% of the population. It is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of stroke, accounting for 15-20% of the 50,000 strokes suffered by Canadians each year. The annual stroke risk in untreated patients is 4.5%, but varies 10-fold based on risk factors captured in clinical prediction tools. Given that oral anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk by 65%, the majority of AF-associated strokes are potentially preventable. All current Canadian and international AF guidelines strongly recommend use of clinical prediction rules to assess stroke risk, and anticoagulation of high-risk patients. However, population-based studies continue to document significant rates of risk-discordant stroke prevention therapy. Addressing this care gap is a major knowledge translation challenge. Patient decision aids are knowledge translation tools that can facilitate a process of shared decision-making to improve patient knowledge and decision quality. These tools have the potential to improve both initial therapy selection and adherence, ultimately reducing the risks of AF-associated stroke and unnecessary bleeding. We have developed and performed initial user testing for a new, web-based decision aid, called Risk Assessment and Personal preferences to Improve Decisions for Atrial Fibrillation (RAPID AFib). The tool has 3 sequential functions: (1) it estimates an individual's risk for stroke and for bleeding using published risk scores; (2) it allows them to interactively compare OACs to select one or more therapies that best matches their risk profile and individual preferences ; and (3) it summarizes the risk information and their selected therapy to facilitate discussion with their physician in a Summary Report. This study represents the next step in this program of research, by performing a formal evaluation of the performance of this tool in a real-world clinical setting. Primary Objective: To conduct a pilot study to establish the acceptability of the RAPID AFib tool and its impact on the process of shared decision-making for stroke prevention therapy in patients with recent onset AF Hypothesis: The RAPID Afib decision aid will be acceptable for both patients and clinicians, and will lead to more effective shared decision-making than standard care among patients with AF who are considering OAC. Methods: Study Design: Prospective, randomized pilot study. Study procedures: Clinic staff will screen referred patients, then the research team will approach them to confirm eligibility, request informed consent for participation, and collect baseline demographic and clinical data. Consenting patients will be randomized 1:1 using a web-based application linked to the study database to receive the study intervention or control. Randomization will be stratified by clinic site. All patients will be invited to review an evidence-based website providing information about AF and its management. Intervention group: Patients randomized to the RAPID AFib intervention will be sent a link to the decision aid website and asked to complete the decision aid before their upcoming visit. They will also be asked to bring the Summary Report to their upcoming clinic visit. A copy of the Summary Report will be added to the patient chart for clinician review. Control group: Patients randomized to the control group will attend their clinic visit as scheduled, with no further direction from the study team.

        "summary": "The project aims at implementing a more pro-active surveillance of potential transmission of influenza viruses to humans (zoonotic transmission). Clinical surveillance of influenza in humans and avian species is well organized and has been operating for decades, but currently there is no pro-active systematic surveillance of potential transmission of animal (avian or swine) influenza viruses to humans, only follow-up of people showing clinical symptoms. People working with potentially infected animals have the highest risk. Moreover, they can represent the first steps in a pandemic: if the virus adapts to humans, infected workers could potentially spread the virus to other people.\nCurrently, highly pathogenic clade2.3.4.4b H5 avian influenza viruses are continuously circulating in wild birds in Belgium and the number of introduction in poultry farms has raised, increasing the contact opportunities with high viral concentrations. Several reports of suspected human infection have been made by different countries. In addition, the virus was detected in sick non-human mammals. The large circulation in wild birds thus represents an increase risk of spill-over to mammalian species, including humans, (by contact directly with wild birds, or via outbreaks in poultry). This increased opportunity for accidental spillover to new host species increases the chances for the avian virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.\nLikewise, there have also been an increased number of human cases of swine influenza reported by several European countries. A pro-active surveillance aiming at also detecting asymptomatic infections would allow an early detection of transmission that could help to prevent a new pandemic.\nAs a piloting approach during this specific project, some dedicated sentinel networks among at-risk workers will be initiated: people in poultry farms involved with the management of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza; people working at bird (or more generally wild life) rehabilitation centres or poultry farms; veterinarians working in pig farms/slaughterhouses.",

Week 1 is a meet-and-greet session where youth are introduced to all dog-handler teams participating in the program and will be asked to select a team to work with for the following sessions. Each youth is assigned their own dog-handler team. Weeks 2 cover activities regarding dog obedience, building from mastering basic commands which the dog already knows (such as sit, stay') to the introduction of new tricks that the dog has not yet learned. In Weeks 3, youth will continue to work on mastering the new tricks with their dog-handler team and will also begin dog agility training. The agility training session progress in terms of complexity of number and types of obstacles. Week 4 is for proofing all skills (obedience, trick, agility) learned in previous sessions.

        "summary": "Pes planus is a foot deformity characterized by a low medial longitudinal arch. It is more common in young adults. With low arch, tension occurs in the plantar fascia. Fascia and soft tissue loading may lead to different musculoskeletal problems such as plantar fasciitis, medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral disorders and back pain. In addition, pes planus can affect individuals' activities of daily living, productivity in occupational settings, and injury risk and performance in sports.\nTreatment of pes planus includes strengthening, stretching, taping and orthotics for the foot muscles. Among these applications, strengthening of the foot core muscles is one of the most common and effective methods. By strengthening the foot core muscles, it is aimed to reduce the effect of the kinetic chain. Pes planus is a postural deformity that affects the kinetic and fascial chain, but the treatment program is usually planned regionally. With fascial continuity and fascial conduction, the tension on the plantar fascia in pes planus affects the gastro-soleus, peroneus longus and brevis, hamstring muscles, iliotibial band and thoracolumbar fascia. Stretching of the plantar fascia, which is included in current treatment programs, has only a local effect and thus cannot prevent fascial chain involvement. Myofascial release, one of the methods used to reduce the tension in the fascia, has been used frequently in recent years. Myofascial release is performed with methods such as manual, foam roller and instrument assisted release. Foam roller (cylinder foam) is a practical myofascial release method that can be self-applied by the individual.\nIn addition to strengthening the intrinsic muscles of the foot in individuals with pes planus, it has been reported that fascial chain involvement should also be taken into consideration due to the tension in the plantar fascia with low arch. This study was planned to investigate the effect of myofascial release methods on lower extremity performance in addition to foot core exercises used effectively in the treatment of pes planus.",

Additional genetic factors beyond the resolution of karyotyping are not well studied. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has brought genetic testing to new frontiers, expanding the scope of detectable genomic variants. Moreover, its significant reduction in costs over the years has facilitated the implementation of genetic diagnostic testing. Our customized shallow read-depth genome sequencing analytical pipeline, namely low-pass genome sequencing (GS), enables efficient and cost-effective detection of genome-wide copy-number variants (CNVs, >50 kb) and low-level chromosomal mosaicisms (as low as 10%). Furthermore, the roles of cryptic structural rearrangements, absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) were less understood in current studies. Various versions of sequencing platforms targeting at different variants were already established and validated in the Prenatal Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, including FetalSeq, ChromoSeq, and 30xWGS. Human endometrial and decidual tissues, containing a myriad of immune and inflammatory populations, are immunologically dynamic. In the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, T-cells are the most abundant leukocyte population in the endometrium, but they decrease to 20% of all stromal leukocytes during early pregnancy. Macrophages are also present in endometrial tissues during all phases of the menstrual cycle, but are most abundant in late secretory endometrium and in decidual tissues during early normal pregnancy. The most abundant population (70%) of stromal leukocytes observed in late secretory endometrium and in the decidua during early normal pregnancy are large granular lymphocytes (LGL) bearing the unique phenotype: CD56++, CD16-, CD57-, CD2\u00b1, CD38\u00b1, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-. Increased mean numbers of CD56+ cells have been reported in secretory endometrium of women with recurrent miscarriages. The hypothesis that the balance between T-cell subsets (i.e. CD4+ and CD8+ cells) plays a role in maintaining successful pregnancy is controversial. Some studies have reported no difference between the proportions of T-cell subsets in either secretory endometrium or first trimester decidua from women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss compared with normal controls; while others have described a shift towards a higher ratio of CD8+ T-cells in endometrial biopsies from women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. The activation status of T-cell populations may provide another indicator of cellular immunity potentially involved in pregnancy loss. The IL-2 receptor has been reported to be absent on T-cells in normal first trimester decidual tissues using immunohistochemical techniques; however, using flow cytometry, CD3+CD25+ activated T-cells have been identified in decidual tissue. CD69 is another early activation marker expressed on the surface of T-cells. A proportion of T-cells constitutively expresses this marker throughout the menstrual cycle and in normal early pregnancy. Approximately 60% of spontaneous abortions are attributable to numerically abnormal chromosomes in the developing conceptus, yet limited data to date addressing immunological phenomena in the decidua of miscarried women has compared their data relative to well-defined chromosomal abnormalities belonging to conceptuses. This is important since the chromosome abnormality trisomy 16, which occurs in 2",

Duodenoscopes used for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in order to treat different biliary and pancreatic disorders, have been recently linked to infections transmission following the procedures. Given their reusability and their complex design of the tip with a moving metallic component, named the elevator, these instruments must be reprocessed through high level disinfection (HLD) in order to prevent the spread of nosocomial infections. Even strict adherence to all HLD procedures results in a residual level of potentially infectious microbes. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postmarket surveillance communication reported duodenoscope culture results demonstrating contamination rates of up to 3.6% for low and moderate-concern organisms and up to 5.4% for high-concern organisms in reprocessed conventional duodenoscopes. As a consequence, at least 20 outbreaks of duodenoscope-transmitted multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) infections occurred between 2012 and 2015, despite reported compliance with duodenoscope reprocessing guidelines. The increasing concern that currents practices of reprocessing reusable duodenoscopes is insufficient, has led the FDA to released recommendation suggesting to develope a newly designed duodenoscopes. On one hand, a way is to generate duodenoscope with disposable components, such as a one-use end cap, which can be removed and allow access to the components of the elevator and other areas of the duodenoscope for reprocessing.

At the moment, there are long waiting times for pulmonary rehabilitation in the NHS.\nSome patients may prefer more pulmonary rehabilitation based in their own home. This might be because they find it difficult to travel to classes. Some would like to do more home pulmonary rehabilitation in between supervised classes or continue pulmonary rehabilitation after the 8-week supervised programme. The blending between supervised classes and home pulmonary rehabilitation is known as HYBRID PULMONARY REHABILITATION.

CMC osteoarthritis of the thumb is one of the most common degenerative conditions of the hand in 11% of men and 33% of women (Gillis et al., 2011). Patients with CMC arthritis may experience pain, decreased range of motion, loss of grip and pinch strength, often limiting participation in activities of daily living (Bertozzi et al., 2014). In 1979, two physicians identified a variation of a tendinous connection in the wrist between the tip of the index finger and the tip of the thumb known as the Linburg-Comstock variation (LCV) (Linburg & Comstock, 1979). The prevalence of the LCV varies respectively from 13-66% in both males and females (Eri\u0107 et al., 2019). A physical examination of patients with LCV reveals concurrent flexion of the flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger and flexor pollicis longus. The study aims to gain more insight into patients diagnosed with CMC arthritis through clinical examination for LCV to consider an association of the diagnoses.\nCurrently, there is no evidence surrounding patients with symptomatic CMC arthritis and LCV.

        "summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe motor and non-motor symptoms, including upper limb dysfunction. Due to the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, PD patients experience difficulties with motor learning and more specifically with the consolidation of motor memory. Recent work showed that intensive writing training improved writing skills in PD. Although consolidation effects were present, difficulties with retention were also still apparent. Besides impacting writing, manual dexterity deficits in PD can also affect the use of touchscreens. Researchers from our lab demonstrated that impairments were most pronounced in multi-direction sliding motions, indicating the need for training of these motor skills. Our lab demonstrated the classic difficulties with retention in PD after one session of training of a swipe and slide pattern on a tablet (SSP-task) as single task (ST), although immediate gains were demonstrated. Therefore, in this study the investigators will examine whether a two-week home-based training program of a tablet-based SSP-training program will lead to immediate and consolidated improvements that are retained in time. This program will combine ST and dual task (DT) training to provide variation during the training period, but also to increase the cognitive challenge during learning, thereby stimulation consolidation of learning. The primary aim of this study consists of investigating the learning effects after two weeks of targeted touchscreen training. Secondary, the investigators will examine whether these effects will also be retained after four weeks without practice and whether targeted training results in consolidated improvements, in terms of automaticity and transfer towards an untrained task. Given the objective recording of compliance to the training protocol, the investigators will explore the association between compliance rates and learning effects.",

Both ST and DT conditions will be offered in a random order and feedback will be provided by means of knowledge of performance to enhance motivation and retention, as proved successful in previous work. The objective of this study is to examine the effects of this innovative training program immediately after two weeks of targeted training as the primary outcome in a randomized controlled trial (RCT). To resemble daily life as much as possible, all test and training sessions will be carried out in the ON-phase of the medication-cycle, i.e., approximately 1 hour after last medication intake. The effect of a 2-week home-based training program with a 4-week follow-up will be examined by including 36 PD patients, who will be randomized (strata: age, H&Y stage) in the experimental or control group. Sample size was based on the pilot study using the SSP-task showing an average movement time of 7.4s \u00b1 3.43 in PD for sequence swiping at baseline in ST. Based on literature, the researchers assumed an improvement of 20.2% following training at retention. For the control group, the researchers expect a deterioration in performance of 5.6% after a period without training based on the changes observed in the control groups of recent studies investigating manual dexterity parameters over time. Using an \u03b1 = 0.05 and \u03b2 = 0.20, a sample size was calculated for repeated measures ANOVA analysis with a within-between factor interaction design (within: pre - post - retention; between: experimental group - control group). Consequently, total sample size was estimated at 30 participants. Taking a 20% dropout rate into account, this resulted in a total of 18 participants in each group. The experimental group will train the SSP task for a duration of two weeks, whereas the control group will not receive any intervention. On day 1 (T0), all participants will undergo an extensive screening session, including motor and non-motor screening. Testing can be performed at the subject's home or in our laboratory according to patients' preference. The average slide duration (in ms) and the accuracy (as the number of correctly formed patterns in %) on the SSP-task will be recorded as the main digitised outcomes, objectively recorded via the tablet. In addition to evaluating the immediate effects of touchscreen training, the investigators will also test retention effects after four weeks without training as a secondary outcome. Further, consolidation of learning will be assessed using secondary outcomes such as the SSP-test in ST and DT conditions to assess automaticity of learning, the mobile phone task to test transfer of learning (MPT, typing a predefined telephone number on a smartphone). As tertiary outcomes, specific questionnaires to capture motor and cognitive performance will be administered. Following the baseline session, the experimental group will receive 10 training sessions of the SSP-training (5 days/week, 10 min/session) over a period of two weeks. The training is home-based and unsupervised but is extensively explained by an expert trainer. The control group does not receive training. Both immediately after training (T1) and after a four-week retention period (T2), touchscreen motor skills will be re-assessed at home. The most appropriate linear mixed models will be used to analyse SSP performance, with group (intervention - control) as between-subject factor and time (baseline - post - retention) as within-subject factor. LEDD and other confounders will be included as covariates. PD is a highly heterogeneous disorders, not only affecting motor but also cognitive functions. In fact, up to 80% of patients develops dementia over the disease course. Previous studies have identified global cognitive function as important determinants of training success. Therefore, cognitive function will be assessed extensively during the baseline session to investigate the association with training responsiveness. A global cognitive screen will consist of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Moreover, 2 specific tests will be used to assess each cognitive subdomain. Attention and working memory will be assessed using a digit and visual span forward and backward. The trail making test and alternating names test will be used for executive function.

As a result, Regions Hospital has the best opportunity to study this disease process and improve outcomes for frostbite patients. The diagnostic methods for severe frostbite injury vary from institution to institution and there is no standard practice. Commonly utilized methods include conventional angiography, Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT studies, Indocyanine Green microangiography, and doppler studies. The proposed pilot study aims to directly compare conventional angiography imaging to ICG microangiography in adult patients with severe frostbite. Severe frostbite is defined as 4th degree: frostbite resulting in vascular occlusion and tissue ischemia. Both imaging modalities have been used for the diagnosis and monitoring of severe frostbite injury but there has never been a study directly comparing these two imaging modalities.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nFrostbite injury has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for as long as humans have experienced cold winters. When frostbite occurs, there are two primary mechanisms through which tissue damage occurs, though the main mechanism focused on here is systemic cooling. Frostbite is a multiphase process that starts with systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury, but it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities that have been used is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. At Regions Hospital, the main diagnostic method that has been used for over 20 years is conventional angiography. This clearly demonstrates the microvasculature of the tissues and allows the intra-arterial catheter directed sheaths to be placed to start thrombolytics, heparin, and vasodilators to treat the tissue ischemia. Other diagnostic modalities used elsewhere include Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT imaging, and indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography. All of these imaging modalities demonstrate the perfusion of the affected tissue but do not allow for directed delivery of thrombolytics. In institutions that use these imaging techniques, thrombolytics are typically delivered in an intravenous fashion rather than intra-arterial. ICG microangiography is a technology that has had rapidly expanding applications in recent decades. These have included retinal imaging, determining perfusion of colorectal anastomoses, biliary imaging, and assessing the blood supply of tissue flaps. It has recently been used in diagnosis of frostbite with good correlation with severe final amputation levels. It is easy to use, non-radiating, can be performed at the bedside, and cheaper than other imaging modalities. Given that every hospital has different diagnostic and treatment algorithms, these different imaging modalities have rarely been compared in the same patient. The current best metric is comparing the imaging modality with the amount of tissue that is amputated as demonstrated in prior studies cited here. This research application provides a unique opportunity to compare two imaging modalities head-to-head in the same patient and determine their concordance or discordance.",

The incidence rate of PFPS among athletes is 25 percent, which is higher than that of general population. PFPS is caused by repetitive stress and aggravated in athletes by cycling and running. These symptoms are caused by structural or biomechanical changes of the joint, which becomes exacerbated by activities such as going up and down stairs, sit for a prolonged period, squatting or kneeling, resulting in increased compressive forces in the joint patellofemoral. It is characterized by defused pain in front of knee. Other signs also present are the patellar crepitus, swelling, and joint blockage despite being deemed a multifactorial condition with no single cure, PFPS is commonly attributed to muscular dysfunction, for which conservative rehabilitation is the treatment of choice.

In addition, oxidative stress and inflammation can also increase in athletes during the American football season. This study was planned with the thought that the MIND diet, which is beneficial for brain health with its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, may have positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players.\nThe goal of this clinical trial is to examine the effects of the MIND diet on oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players.

The MIND diet can also reduce intestinal permeability with its abundant fiber content (prebiotic effect). It has been reported that the supplementation of some nutrients (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, etc.) that have an important place in the composition of the MIND diet in this group of athletes has a positive effect on some of these biomarkers. However, the studies in the literature are limited, and there is no study involving the MIND diet in American football players. This study was planned considering that the MIND diet may have positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players, who are exposed to repetitive head impacts as a nature of this contact sport. American football players playing in the pro league will be included in this study. The sample size was calculated using the G*Power V. 3.1.9.6 program. This study will include two groups and two measurements. Accordingly, a total of 30 athletes, 15 in each group, with 95% confidence (1-\u03b1), 95% test power (1-\u03b2) and f=0.6 effect size; with 80% confidence (1-\u03b1), 80% test power (1-\u03b2) and f=0.6 effect size, a total of 20 athletes, 10 in each group, should be included. At the beginning of the research, a face-to-face questionnaire will be used to question the athletes' American football history and player positions, socio-demographics, general health and nutritional habits. Before the start of the study, a 7-day food consumption record will be taken from the athletes. MIND scores will be questioned before the study and every week till the end of the study according to the frequency of food consumption in the MIND composition scale. It will be used to assess participants' adherence to the MIND diet. Accordingly, the MIND diet components include ten food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, bean types, whole grains, seafood, poultry, olive oil, and wine) that are healthy for the brain. There are also five food groups (red meat, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets and fried / fast food / fast food) that are considered unhealthy. Frequencies of food consumption (daily, weekly, monthly) are questioned according to whether these 10 food groups specified in the template are preferred based on portion and meal or as a primary, and as a result, scoring is made as 0, 0.5 and 1 points for each food group. The highest score is 15 points. Because the MIND diet template does not have specific scores for diet adherence, below the median score (7.5) will be considered low adherence. According to the MIND diet composition scale, those with a MIND diet score of <7.5 points will be included in the study, while those with a score of \u22657.5 will be excluded from the study. At the beginning of the study, body composition measurements (anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis) will be taken from the athletes along with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index scale scores, diet inflammatory index, and the World Health Organization quality of life scale-short form. Oxidative stress, inflammation, neurodegenerative risk and other associated biomarkers will be analyzed in blood samples. Athletes will be randomized into two groups; MIND diet and control group. The players in the control group will sustain their habitual nutrition, while the current nutrition of the players in the MIND diet group will be adapted to the MIND diet according to the food groups in the MIND diet components and their consumption frequencies.

In this context, joint fluid aspiration (JFA) is indicated to document a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) or to bring to light arguments for implant failure. Nevertheless, opinions differ on its indication for microbiological identification. Some teams perform it systematically when faced with a prosthesis dysfunction. Others, only in the presence of suggestive signs of PJI. Finally, others never perform it.\nBased on clinical, radiological and biological (CRP) signs, at the preoperative stage and before JFA, we classify our patients into 3 groups: supposedly septic (chronic joint infection), supposedly aseptic (implant failure) or intermediate (Unknown). This last group, often encountered in consultation, poses a diagnosis problem more than the others.\nIn our experience, JFA is an essential diagnosis tool in these 3 groups of patients. It helps to choose the surgical strategy. In addition, the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid as the alpha defensin, the leucocyte esterase and the CRP could provide an additional argument to investigate the infectious origin or not, in particular in difficult cases.\nIn summary, the disagreement on the usefulness of JFA in case of PJI suspicion and any other prosthetic dysfunction, the lack of data on large prospective studies and our questioning about the contribution of JFA in the aseptic and intermediate group of patients, motivated us to set up this study to evaluate the interest of the JFA for the preoperative diagnosis, as well as that of the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid.",

It is the main cause of morbidity and disability in the world with, among other things, an increase in cardio-metabolic risk and a reduction in life expectancy, regardless of suicide risk. MDD is the most expensive medical condition: 10-20 billion \u20ac/year in France. This cost is mainly attributable to the functional consequences of the disease, highlighting the medico-economic challenge represented by the optimization of the organization of care.\nIn France, more than 80% of MDD patients are enrolled in non-psychiatric care pathways, mainly primary care or MSO hospital care (medicine, surgery, obstetrics). Unfortunately, less than half of patients benefit from treatment at an appropriate dosage or duration, thus exposing them to the risks of relapse, recurrence and chronic evolution. It is necessary to optimize this management, in particular by improving secondary prevention, which consists of maintaining treatment in the months following symptomatic remission.\nSeveral support programs (monitoring with assessment of symptomatology) have shown their effectiveness on depressive symptomatology with a favorable medico-economic report, in particular by allowing maintenance of antidepressant treatment. None of these studies have been conducted on French care pathways.\nInvestigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine management (added to usual care) in non-psychiatric care pathways on the evolution of depressive symptomatology for MDD patients. Investigators hypothesize that telemedicine monitoring downstream of MSO hospitalization will increase the response rate to antidepressants at 6 months and reduce the costs attributed to depressive symptoms compared to usual care, in particular by optimizing secondary prevention strategies by maintaining treatment.\nThe main objective of the research is to assess the efficacy of telemedicine monitoring on depressive symptoms and treatments, added to the out-of-hospital downstream care pathways for patients initially hospitalized in MSO (medicine-surgery-obstetrics), compared to usual care.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men significantly increases with age and is estimated to impact over 80% of men 70 to 80 years of age. HoLEP is one of many treatments for BPH and associated lower urinary tract symptoms. Compared to other minimally invasive surgical techniques for treatment of BPH, HoLEP has been found to have superior outcomes and is a prostate size-independent procedure with excellent durability, high efficacy, and low complications rates. However, transient stress urinary incontinence (SUI) following HoLEP may last for several months after surgery and can lead to diminished patient quality of life during the recovery period. Measures to prevent or reduce post-operative SUI following HoLEP, including PFPT, may improve patient outcomes. SUI is also commonly documented after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. The mechanism for incontinence in both RP and HoLEP is thought to at least partially be related to temporary weakness of the external urinary sphincter, which is part of the pelvic floor musculature. While it is unclear if post-operative PFPT alone reduces SUI for patients who have undergone RP, there is evidence that PFPT started pre-operatively and continued post-operatively can decrease SUI following RP. The utilization of pre-operative PFPT for patients undergoing HoLEP to reduce post-operative SUI is currently not well documented. To date, only one study has demonstrated evidence that PFPT prior to HoLEP may improve continence at 3 months. However, the study included patients with a BMI significantly lower than average in the United States, utilized an unclear PFPT program, and had a relatively small median prostate size ( 60 mL), which is important as studies have shown that prostate size can affect post-operative incontinence. We propose a prospective randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of standardized pre-operative PFPT in reducing SUI and improving patient QoL following HoLEP.

In Crohn's disease (CD), bacterial translocation could increase the disproportionate inflammatory response already present and contribute to disease progression by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune-cell infiltration in the mesentery. Several mechanisms may promote bacterial translocation, such as bacterial overgrowth, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier and alterations in the immune system.\nIleocecal surgical resection is required in some patients with complicated or refractory CD. Unfortunately, post-surgical disease recurrence happens in up to 40% of cases, probably defining a subgroup of CD patients with a particular aggressive form of the disease. The complete microbiome (in gastrointestinal and extraintestinal sites) in CD patients that develop early post-surgical recurrence, as well as the association to innate immunity alterations, has not yet been studied.\nThe primary aim of the study is to explore the bacterial microbiome of CD patients and its association with early post-surgical recurrence and clinical or genetic variables related to innate immunity.

The main question the trial aims to answer is if mosunetuzumab works better than standard treatments in this sub-group of patients. Patients will receive mosunetuzumab as injections in the abdominal subcutaneous fat once a week for the three first doses, then every third week 7 times. If all signs of disease are gone as evaluated by PET-CT images, the treatment is stopped. If signs of disease remain on PET-CT images, the patients can receive treatment every third week for up to a total of one year. After the end of treatment, patients are followed two years in the trial for signs of progression or relapse.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Standard first line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma and symptomatic disease is immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The most commonly used treatment regimens are rituximab plus bendamustin or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), rituximab plus lenalidomide or rituximab monotherapy. The long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24 months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for progression of disease within 24 months), and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line treatment, and they are in need of improved treatment options. Mosunetuzumab is a new, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that has shown very high response rates and long response duration in B-cell lymphoma patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to standard salvage regimens. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients with POD24. The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients. Objectives: The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24. The secondary objectives are to investigate safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab patients\u00b4 self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab resource usage related to mosunetuzumab Interventions: Mosunetuzumab is administered SC as described below. Patients are followed for at least 2,5 years and a maximum of 5 years in the trial. Study-specific sampling of peripheral blood for exploratory research amounts to 330-380 mL (depending on the number of treatment cycles) collected over 3 years. Study-specific tumor samples for future research will be collected by fine needle aspiration before the start of treatment and after the third treatment cycle. Ethical considerations: Previous studies have shown that mosunetuzumab is highly effective and well tolerated in heavily treated B-cell lymphoma patients. The safety profile is favourable compared to standard immunochemotherapy. Mosunetuzumab can be safely administered to older patients with co-morbidities, and there is no upper age limit for participation in the trial. The potential beneficial effect of mosunetuzumab in a population of follicular lymphoma patients with POD24 outweighs the risk for rare and undiscovered serious adverse events. The total volume of blood samples is considered acceptable for patients in clinical trials. The extra tumor samples for research purposes will only be collected if deemed safe and not to cause unreasonable discomfort for the participating subject. The extra number of CT scans is 2-3 compared to standard practice and represents a minimal increase in radiation exposure. In total, the benefit to risk balance is deemed positive for this trial.",

The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors.

Its postoperative mortality and serious complications have also been widely concerned, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The persistent pulmonary hypertension and systemic vascular paralysis during the perioperative period are the main causes of early postoperative death and serious complications such as organ failure.\nCatecholamine vasoactive drugs commonly used in cardiac surgery may aggravate the condition of pulmonary hypertension, while the use of drugs to reduce pulmonary hypertension, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may worsen the state of systemic vascular paralysis. Vasopressin and oxytocin are two effective components in pituitrin, and vasopressin is the main component that exerts strong vasoconstrictive effect.\nVasopressin binds to receptors distributed in vascular smooth muscle, pituitary and kidney, and exerts its effects by regulating adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel function, nitric oxide production and enhancing vascular response to catecholamine.\nIn addition, oxytocin can also bind to the receptors distributed in the heart and vascular endothelium, and play a role by releasing atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide.\nTherefore, pituitrin can not only constrict systemic circulation vessels and increase systemic circulation pressure, reduce pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, but also protect the heart and kidney.

        "summary": "Children with medical complexity (CMC) often have trouble breathing at night and need to use a breathing machine. This breathing machine is called noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV). The use of NiPPV has been shown to improve quality of life and survival in children. Before it is used, NiPPV must first be tested to see what the correct 'machine settings' are for each child. This is usually done in the sleep laboratory at the hospital during a one-night stay. However, sleep studies in the hospital are disruptive and hard for CMC and their families because of the new environment and limited access to the equipment, supplies, comfort items and the routine their child has at home. Patients and families would prefer to start NiPPV at home but there needs to be more research on this to make sure it is possible and safe. This study will evaluate a new model of care to start NiPPV in the home. CMC aged 5-17 years old and starting NiPPV will be assigned at random, like a coin toss, to start NiPPV in the home or to start NiPPV in the sleep laboratory.

Starting NiPPV at home has the potential to improve the use of NiPPV (ie early adherence predicts long-term use) resulting in both medical benefits as well as improved quality of life for CMC and their families.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChildren with medical complexity (CMC) are increasingly prescribed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) for chronic respiratory failure. In our clinical experience, patients and families would prefer NiPPV initiation in the home environment but this is not standard of care. This proposal will evaluate the feasibility and safety of an innovative model of care for NiPPV initiation in the home environment utilizing remote telemonitoring compared to usual care which is in-hospital polysomnography (PSG) laboratory-based initiation. The incidence of CMC requiring NiPPV is exponentially growing. NiPPV effectively corrects abnormal gas exchange, improves sleep quality, and reduces symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. The use of NiPPV has been associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To ensure effectiveness, NiPPV must be used for all periods of sleep and settings must be individually-titrated. Unfortunately, poor adherence results in many CMC being undertreated for chronic respiratory failure. Successful NiPPV initiation is critical because early negative experiences are commonly reported barriers to adherence6 and early usage predicts longer term use. Standard of care is the initiation and titration of NiPPV during a one-night in-hospital PSG. A PSG is challenging for CMC and families due to their medical fragility and lasting effects of travel and a disrupted routine, the significant amount of equipment and supplies that must be brought to the study as well as the financial implications and additional psychosocial stress for caregivers. In addition, negative experiences with NiPPV may be exacerbated by introduction of the therapy in an unfamiliar PSG laboratory with burdensome monitoring. Furthermore, a one-night PSG provides limited sleep data that may not be representative of dynamic and variable sleeping patterns that occur in the comfort of one's home. Recent technological advances in remote NiPPV monitoring coupled with a shift to virtual care models has enabled a patient and family centered opportunity to bypass the PSG laboratory and initiate NiPPV at home. Remote NiPPV monitoring extends data collection beyond discrete health care encounters and provides real-time data on adherence and efficacy that can be wirelessly transmitted to facilitate setting adjustment by clinicians. Home NiPPV initiation is increasingly being requested by patients and caregivers. The potential benefits of this innovative care model include increasing patient and family empowerment, improving the delivery of high quality patient-centred care at home, and optimizing NiPPV use. Although there is growing data in the adult population to support home NiPPV initiation via telemonitoring, this cannot be simply extrapolated to CMC. There are key differences in the etiology and manifestation of chronic respiratory failure in CMC compared to adults. Furthermore, family caregivers play an important role in NiPPV acceptance and adherence. Canadian guidelines acknowledge the lack of evidence for the setting in which NiPPV is initiated. Home NiPPV initiation in CMC is a novel model of care that may result in large health system impacts, but requires a feasibility study before embarking on a large-scale trial.",

Effective antibiotic and surgical treatments have been developed for these infections but they are still able to develop into life-threatening diseases such as meningitis and sepsis. The direct cause of acute head and neck infections is often unknown but it has been suggested that they are due to a disturbance of the normal bacterial growing in the mouth or are from dental origin.\nThe most common microorganisms identified from these infections in published studies are a group of bacteria known as viridans group streptococci (VGS). There are over 30 individual species of bacteria in the viridans group and VGS are difficult to identify to the level of a single species because of their variability. There is a lack of species identification within the hospital setting and this project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the microorganisms causing acute head and neck infections, focusing on identification of individual species of VGS bacteria.\nThe investigators will analyse bacterial DNA to determine which species have been identified and will also look at patient data and clinical outcomes (eg. length of hospital stay) to determine if the species causing the infection has any effect on patients.",

        "summary": "This clinical trial tests whether atorvastatin prevents metastasis of resected high-risk stage IIA melanoma.The vast majority of melanomas are diagnosed at an early, localized stage. However, approximately 10-15% of these localized melanomas will eventually metastasize, despite appropriate local treatment. Once metastasis occurs, median survival is less than two years. Melanomas at high risk of metastasis can be identified by gene expression profiling. The investigators aim to treat these high risk melanomas to prevent future metastasis. Statin drugs, like atorvastatin, have been used to treat high cholesterol for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events, but not for preventing melanoma metastasis. Statins could prevent melanoma metastasis through decreasing tumor cell migration, decreasing tumor cell adhesion, and increasing immune system response. Statins are also efficient inhibitors of new lymphatic vessels formation. Since tumor lymphatic vessels serve as highways to lymph nodes and may suppress immune system responses, statins may block a critical step towards melanoma metastasis. Using atorvastatin may have the potential to prevent metastasis and improve outcomes in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.",

In the initial phase of ACHIEVE, the study team partnered with three rural Piedmont Health Services (PHS) clinics that serve mostly White and Latinx patients. The inpatient HTN bundle was adapted to fit their setting and re-named the Outpatient Hypertension (O-HTN) bundle. Additionally, a coalition was established to engage patients, clinic providers/staff, and the broader community to: (a) understand factors influencing maternal health including economic stability, education, health care access, and community context, (b) assess what makes it easier or harder to implement the O-HTN bundle in community outpatient clinic settings, (c) adapt the O-HTN bundle to fit those settings and populations, and (d) select and tailor changes to clinic practices using continuous cycles of learning, measuring and adapting to be the most effective and sustainable for the organization. Building on this formative work, the goal of the clinical trial is to determine the impact of three implementation strategies (training, coaching, facilitation) in 20 outpatient clinics in central North Carolina.

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. Some solid tumor cells have an L1CAM protein on their surface, and T cells can be modified with a receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), to help recognize this protein and kill these tumor cells. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers.

Older adults with MS present with poor health status and functioning, cognitive and ambulatory difficulty, dependence for activities of daily living, and reduced physical activity participation. The common approach for managing MS involves disease-modifying drugs, yet this first-line approach for medical management has little efficacy in older MS age groups (i.e., those 50+ years of age). Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for maintaining and/or restoring physical and cognitive health in older adults from the general population and younger adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. The current study proposes a remotely-delivered exercise training program for improving cognition and mobility among older adults with MS. The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach (via telerehabilitation) with rigorous design for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based exercise intervention program in older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful aging with MS.",

        "summary": "Extracorporeal blood purification is a supportive therapy in the management of patients with sepsis or vasoplegic shock. The pathophysiology of sepsis is based on an inappropriate host response to infection. Certain medical devices with higher adsorption capacity make it possible to limit this inappropriate response and could thus improve the hemodynamics of patients in septic or vasoplegic shock. The preliminary experience of the investigators from clinical data of vasopressor withdrawal in pediatric patients treated with oXiris shows a 50% reduction in the vasopressor score, Vaso Inotropic Score (VIS), for 40% of patients within 24 hours following the start of treatment. Similar results were found in adult patients treated for severe COVID-19 or vasoplegic shock by the other centers participating in the study.\nCytokine purification is an important physiological effect of purification membranes. However, this may not fully explain the rapid hemodynamic improvement of patients treated with an oXiris membrane.\nThe role of angiotensin metabolites (Ang 1-5, 1-7, 1-9) in the systemic vascular tone of patients has been recently discussed. The administration of angiotensin 2 in vasoplegic shock in adults helps correct hypotension. In the group of patients with increased renin, this treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality. Indeed, increased renin associated with dysfunction of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) leads to an accumulation of Angiotensin 1 which degrades to Ang 1-7.\nThe hypothesis f the investigators is that the concentration of Ang 1 and Ang 1-7 is elevated in cases of vasoplegic shock and that the clearance of these vasodilator peptides by blood purification is associated with clinical improvement.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThis is a pilot study, non-interventional research involving the human subjects, category 3, aimed at measuring the clinical and biological the clinical and biological effects of using the oXiris hemofiltration hemofiltration membrane. As part of the treatment: oXiris membrane hemofiltration with Prismaflex system, Phoxylium or H\u00e9mosol B0 dialysis solution, upper or lower dialysis catheter. Anticoagulation with heparin, citrate or none in case of severe haemostasis disorders. Treatment volume of 35 ml/kg/h maximum. For research purposes: collection of additional blood tubes (2 x 5mL heparinized tube) added to the usual samples, at the following times: Baseline (before starting treatment), under hemofiltration at 24h +/- 6h of treatment and at 72 hours +/- 12 hours. These samples will be analyzed by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) by Attoquant diagnostics\u00ae, a laboratory specialized in analyses of the Renin-Angiotensin system. The angiotensins assayed are Angiotensin I, II, III and IV, as well as the intermediate peptides (1-5, 1-7, 1-9, 2-10, 2-7 and 3-7) and regulatory enzymes (renin, angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin 2-converting enzyme and neprilysin). Angiotensin metabolites have a very short half-life. Their depends on enzyme activity and degradation by circulating proteases. Two techniques are used to determine circulating concentration rapid treatment with protease inhibitors or the equilibrium technique. For the equilibrium technique, samples are incubated again to restore metabolite concentration prior to analysis. The samples at 3 time points (Baseline, H24 and H72) are analyzed using the equilibrium. The H24 sample will also be analyzed with a protease inhibitor pre-treatment. Patients will be monitored for 3 months (90-day mortality) using data collected collected in the course of care. Data from medical records and biological analyses will be entered into an eCRF. Data management will be carried out throughout the study, to enable baseline freezing and statistical analysis as early as possible after the end of the last patient's follow-up.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nHysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed gynecological operations. It is carried out because of a variety of indications, such as presence of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, myoma uteri, adenomyosis and adnexal mass. Hysterectomy can be performed using abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic or robotic methods. According to the results from a study performed in the United States, the incidence rates for hysterectomies using abdominal, vaginal and laparoscopic methods are 66%, 22% and 12%, respectively. There is still no consensus on which of these approaches is the optimum surgical method for hysterectomy. Abdominal hysterectomy is the most frequently performed approach, but current clinical practice mandates that, when appropriate, the surgical method should be vaginal rather than abdominal, since the former is associated with better outcomes and lower complication rates. Moreover, when vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible or not indicated, the surgical method should be laparoscopic, because total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) provides a faster return to normal activity, shorter hospital stays, lower intraoperative bleeding and fewer wound infections, compared with abdominal hysterectomy. However, longer operating times and higher incidence of urinary system damage are seen in laparoscopic hysterectomies. Cesarean section (CS) is the most commonly performed surgery on women and has increased significantly in the last 15 years. Various reasons account for the increase in CSs over the last two decades, including an increase upon maternal request, changes in maternal demographics (e.g., increasing maternal age), changes in physician practice patterns, more conservative practice guidelines, and mounting legal pressures. Because of the gradually increasing rates of cesarean sections (CSs) over the last two decades, the number of hysterectomized patients with previous CSs has increased. In a recent review article, previously performed CSs were demonstrated to be an important risk factor for lower urinary tract injuries, and the recommendation that abdominal hysterectomy might be preferable for these patients was emphasized. TLH may be technically difficult in patients with previous CSs, due to surgical adhesions, and is associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications. Mobilization of the urinary bladder off of the cervix is an important step in total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and is always performed before dealing with the uterine pedicle. If the uterus is unscarred, bladder mobilization may not be technically difficult.

        "summary": "The most suitable food for babies is breast milk. It is known that breastfeeding, beyond providing nutrition, has many health benefits for the baby and the mother. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that babies start breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth and breastfeed exclusively without any additional food, including water, for the first 6 months. After six months, complementary foods should be started, and the baby should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. On the other hand, between 2015-2020, the rates of infants aged 0-6 months fed with breast milk alone are approximately 44% worldwide.\nThere are many factors that affect the time of initiation of breastfeeding and the duration of breastfeeding. Some of those; maternal education, mode of delivery, birth weight and socio-economic status. Another influential factor is paternal support. Fathers may want to be involved in breastfeeding education and support their spouses in this process. However, the reasons such as not taking part in the trainings and not being asked direct questions about breastfeeding may cause fathers to feel excluded in this process. It is important to include fathers in education and interventions to achieve breastfeeding goals. Mothers who are supported by their spouses during the breastfeeding process experience breastfeeding problems less and can cope with these problems better.\nToday, it is known that fathers are not given sufficient importance in promoting breastfeeding. Including fathers in breastfeeding education can increase the rate and duration of breastfeeding of infants. This study was planned to determine the effect of breastfeeding education given to mothers and/or fathers in the postnatal period on breastfeeding, parent-infant attachment and breastfeeding self-efficacy.

Research-grade actigraphy and patient reported outcome measures will be monitored every 3 months for the first year. All participants will be enrolled in an exercise and physical activity tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. The platform allows for synchronization of patients' activity data from their fitness tracker or smartwatch to the secure cloud-based platform.

        "summary": "Covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen patients during or shortly after surgery, and may result in long-term disability. Fortunately, stroke that occurs during non-cardiac surgery is most commonly caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain and is, therefore, preventable if it can be detected early. Current clinical tools used to monitor the brain during surgery do not have the accuracy nor the spatial coverage - they only monitor one small region of the brain. In this study, the investigators plan to apply a cutting-edge optical device, tr-fNIRS, to monitor the whole brain during shoulder surgery. The primary aim is to determine any regional differences in cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) and cerebral autoregulation (CA)between brain regions during surgery and especially during various physiological challenges, such as hypotension. The investigators hypothesize that certain brain regions are more likely to develop cerebral desaturation and impaired CA, and are more prone to brain injury than the frontal lobe region which is the traditional monitoring site. The investigators also hypothesize that cerebral desaturation (or hypoxic injury) events correlate with adverse postoperative neurological outcomes such as covert stroke, overt stroke and/or postoperative delirium.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPerioperative stroke is a significant complication after surgery. Unfortunately, covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline. Further, perioperative overt stroke is associated with an 8-fold increase in perioperative mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay, and decreased quality of life. For shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position, due to systemic hypotension and reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral desaturation events and impaired cerebral autoregulation can occur in up to 80% of patients. Most perioperative stroke in non-cardiac surgery is ischemic and is related to brain hypoperfusion. Importantly, brain hypoperfusion is potentially modifiable with simple measures such as increasing systemic blood pressure (BP) if brain ischemia is identified early enough. However, deliberate hypertension is not devoid of risk and there is currently no effective monitor that can detect brain hypoperfusion during surgery. Cerebral oxygenation has been used clinically as a measure of adequate brain perfusion during surgery. An early clinical trial at Western found that monitoring cerebral oxygenation was associated with fewer cases of major organ dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients. Despite this promising initial finding, current commercial cerebral oximeters have a number of limitations that prevent reliable perioperative neuromonitoring, including non-specificity due to signal contamination from extracerebral tissue, especially during administration of vasoconstrictors or hypothermia. In addition, current commercial cerebral oximeters only have two channels to monitor the frontal lobe regions (i.e., anterior cerebral artery territory). This monitoring strategy assumes that cerebral oxygenation is homogenous across different brain regions so that measurements from the frontal regions can be used clinically to represent the adequacy of global brain oxygenation. Such a limited spatial coverage may result in undetected stroke, despite the patients having apparently normal cerebral oxygenation in the frontal regions throughout surgery. The current research project employs multi-channel tr-fNIRS to address these limitations, with the goal of timely detection and prevention of ischemic brain injury. Multi-channel tr-fNIRS (time-resolved (tr) functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (tr-fNIRS)) is an emerging brain-imaging technology that was originally developed to explore changes in cerebral oxygenation generated by cortical neuronal activity during various cognitive tasks such as speech, sensory and motor functions, and emotion. This is because tr-fNIRS can measure such subtle cerebral oxygenation changes in milliseconds (up to 100 ms) that accompany neuro-activation such as finger-tapping. The investigators has built several tr-fNIRS devices and has the expertise of adapting the full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to perioperative neuromonitoring. Furthermore, tr-fNIRS operate by sending short (picosecond) pulses of light into the head and precisely measures the time of travel of each photon in the tissue. Since there is an equivalence between time and distance, photons that are detected right after the pulse have only probed the extracerebral layers (scalp and skull) while photons that are detected long after (1-2 ms) the pulse have travelled deep into the brain tissues. The investigators have recently shown that this approach reduces the signal contaminations of the extracerebral layers from 80% with current commercial NIRS devices to less than 8% with tr-fNIRS. In this study, the investigators will employ a state-of-the-art full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to monitor the entire brain, as opposed to only select regions (such as the limited capabilities of the current cerebral oximeters) in the perioperative setting. Together with in-house analysis algorithms, the full head coverage tr-fNIRS can detect specific brain regions at-risk of ischemic injury with a high degree of certainty because of greater spatial resolution (in cm) and less signal contamination from extracerebral tissue. All study participants will be recruited and consented adhering to the local ethics guidelines. For all study participants, the surgical and anesthetic management of the patients will be conducted in a standard fashion and will not be altered in this study. The exception is that tr-fNIRS will be used to monitor regional brain oxygenation from anest",

The secondary objective is to examine whether enavogliflozin is effective in reduction of renal events and tricuspid regurgitation, and to evaluate whether beneficial effects of enavogliflozin on primary outcomes are associated with reduction of all-cause mortality.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nFunctional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) develops due to functional and structural alterations related to heart failure (HF), mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation. An increase in cardiac filling pressure due to left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction leads to left atrial, right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) remodeling, which causes tricuspid annular dilatation and TR. The development of significant functional TR causes RV dysfunction and further dilation of RV, which deteriorates TR. Functional TR may occur with HF with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF), and the prevalence of moderate-to-severe functional TR is around 19% in patients with HF. Regardless of LVEF or pulmonary artery pressure, presence of moderate or severe functional TR is associated with more symptoms, reduced cardiac output, and worse renal function. A vicious cycle of significant TR, RV volume overload, adverse remodeling of RA, RV, and tricuspid annulus, and consequent aggravation of TR is suggested as a pathophysiologic mechanism of the poor clinical outcomes of patients with TR, and the presence of moderate or severe functional TR is a strong independent determinant of mortality in patients with HF. Because functional TR has a strong prognostic impact and plays an important pathophysiologic role in patients with HF, functional TR is suggested as a therapeutic target in HF. However, there have been no proven medical therapies for TR and only loop diuretics are cautiously recommended for relief of congestive symptoms in patients with severe TR and signs of RV failure. In patients with functional TR associated with systolic dysfunction, medical therapy for HF with a reduced EF may diminish functional TR by improving LV systolic function. Otherwise, the morbidity and mortality of patients with functional TR remain high and a novel therapeutic agent is needed to improve clinical outcomes of HF patients with functional TR and a preserved LV ejection fraction. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors induce urinary excretion of glucose and sodium by blocking the SGLT2 transporter in the proximal tubule (8). SGLT2 inhibitor-induced natriuresis lower cardiac preload and reduce pulmonary congestion and systemic edema. SGLT2 inhibitors also restore tubuloglomerular feedback and lower the intraglomerular pressure by vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles and consequently reduce hyperfiltration-related renal damage. The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart and kidneys may halt the vicious cardiorenal cycle in patients with functional TR (9), which results in deterioration of renal function, hospitalization for heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. Accordingly, the Enavogliflozin Outcome Trial in Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation (EVENT) will test the hypothesis that, compared with placebo, therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor enavogliflozin for 18 months would improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in HF patients with functional TR and preserved LVEF.",

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent pathology in intensive care (around 10% of patients admitted to intensive care and almost a quarter of patients on mechanical ventilation) and a serious one, with a hospital mortality rate of 40%. The main measures that have an effect on mortality in ARDS involve adjustments to the ventilator, known as protective ventilation. In the most severe patients, adjuvant measures such as prone positioning and the use of curarisation in the initial phase of the disease can improve survival. All these measures have been included in the latest national and international recommendations. However, a vast observational study carried out in 50 countries revealed low compliance with these recommendations. More than a third of patients did not receive protective ventilation, and the majority did not receive prone positioning when this was indicated. During weaning from artificial ventilation, it has been widely demonstrated that replacing clinician judgement with the implementation of paramedical care protocols improved weaning and significantly reduced the duration of artificial ventilation. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a paramedical care protocol for ventilation in the acute phase of ARDS improves compliance with recommendations and thus reduces mortality and the duration of artificial ventilation. However, implementation of such a protocol requires operational training for all the nurses in the participating departments. Simulation appears to be the training method of choice, as it is a teaching technique that enables technical and non-technical skills to be passed on with good retention of what has been learnt, as well as assessing what has been learnt. To make it possible to train several dozen nurses within a tight timescale, a partially dematerialized simulation model incorporating innovative e-learning tools will be developed.",

This work aims to evaluate the impact of an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enhanced algorithm called Boneview on the diagnostic accuracy of clinicians in the detection of fractures on plain XR (X-Ray). The study will create a dataset of 500 plain X-Rays involving standard images of all bones other than the skull and cervical spine, with 50% normal cases and 50% containing fractures. A reference 'ground truth' for each image to confirm the presence or absence of a fracture will be established by a senior radiologist panel. This dataset will then be inferenced by the Gleamer Boneview algorithm to identify fractures. Performance of the algorithm will be compared against the reference standard. The study will then undertake a Multiple-Reader Multiple-Case study in which clinicians interpret all images without AI and then subsequently with access to the output of the AI algorithm. 18 clinicians will be recruited as readers with 3 from each of six distinct clinical groups: Emergency Medicine, Trauma and Orthopedic Surgery, Emergency Nurse Practitioners, Physiotherapy, Radiology and Radiographers, with three levels of seniority in each group. Changes in reporting accuracy (sensitivity, specificity), confidence, and speed of readers in two sessions will be compared. The results will be analyzed in a pooled analysis for all readers as well as for the following subgroups: Clinical role, Level of seniority, Pathological finding, Difficulty of image. The study will demonstrate the impact of an AI interpretation as compared with interpretation by clinicians, and as compared with clinicians using the AI as an adjunct to their interpretation.

In this context, our work will shed light on the development of new treatments and assessment methods for clinicians and researchers working with children with SLD.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSpecific Learning Disorder (SLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the individual has difficulties in reading, written expression, and/or mathematics, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5 (DSM-V). SLD; According to DSM-5, the academic difficulties experienced are explained in detail by dividing them into three subgroups. These are dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The incidence of SLD is approximately 33% in girls and 67% in boys between the ages of 6-12. The ethology of SLD is multifactorial. It is associated with multiple genes and environmental risk factors. Structural imaging studies in children with SLD have revealed that grey matter is reduced. As a result of low grey matter, early literacy education seems to be negatively affected, and fine motor skills such as writing play an important role in this influence. Writing is a complex activity that includes perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Writing activities require a high level of fine motor coordination, postural control, adjustable grip strength, visual perception, and language skills. Considering the studies, it is stated that children who go to primary school spend 31%-60% of their academic days with tasks involving fine motor skills, and most of them do activities such as writing and painting. In addition to their academic and writing performances, children with SLD perform differently in daily life compared to their healthy peers. In general, they have difficulties during self-care activities such as tying shoes, clipping their nails, buttoning/zipping, shaving, and performing activities that require sequencing. At the same time, children with SLD have difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control. Difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control seen in children with SLD affect proximal stability. When proximal stability is poor, distal movements cannot be performed in good quality. Therefore, adequate postural control and proximal stability are essential prerequisites for many activities of daily living. In the literature, it has been shown that grip strength and anthropometric characteristics of the upper extremity affect distal fine motor skills. In a study by Anakwe et al., it was shown that grip strength increased as the forearm circumference measurement value increased. In a study examining the relationship between hand grip and finger strength and anthropometric measurements, it was concluded that grip strength increased as arm and forearm measurements increased. It has been proven that grip strength increases as arm and forearm measurements increase. In the light of our current knowledge, no study has been found that comprehensively examines the fine motor functions, hand grip strength, and hand and forearm anthropometric characteristics of children with SLD. The primary aim of this study is to examine the fine motor skills, hand grip strength, and hand and forearm anthropometric characteristics of children with SLD compared to those of healthy children and to investigate their relationships with each other. The second aim of our study is to examine the effect of fine motor skills on quality of life and participation in activities at home, school, and community environment of children with SLD compared to their healthy peers.",

        "summary": "This study is investigating the feasibility of preoperative 5-day hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) for extremity soft tissue sarcoma (STS). The primary objective is to assess the uptake of 5-day HFRT in patients with STS who are candidates for preoperative radiotherapy and limb preserving surgery. Secondary objectives include evaluation of the rates of favorable pathologic response, major wound complications, local control, acute toxicity, and 1-year late toxicity will be assessed. Exploratory objectives include evaluation of the impact of preoperative 5-day HFRT on access to care, the socio-demographic profile of the trial participants will be compared to that of extremity STS patients seen within Hollings Cancer Center (HCC) and recommended preoperative conventional fractionation radiotherapy (CFRT) in the 3 years prior to the study opening. The retention rate for radiotherapy at HCC in patients meeting trial criteria during the prior 3 years will be compared with the retention rate for radiotherapy during the study period. An exploratory analysis will measure serum SFRP2 pre- and post- radiotherapy to assess changes in response to preoperative 5-day HFRT. Changes in serum SFRP2 will be evaluated for association with a favorable pathologic response to determine the potential of serum SFRP2 as a predictive biomarker. Patient satisfaction with the decision to participate in a trial of preoperative 5-day HFRT will be assessed.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe current standard approach to the management of extremity STS is a combination of radiotherapy and limb preserving surgery. Currently guidelines recommend preoperative conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, which involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. Preoperative hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) is an approach that can shorten the duration of treatment. Clinical outcomes with preoperative HFRT in STS have been reported from retrospective case series, prospective institutional registries and phase I-II trials. However, preoperative HFRT has not been compared in a prospective randomized trial to CFRT and due to the rarity of extremity soft tissue sarcoma, attempts to develop such a trial would face feasibility challenges. Therefore, single arm trials of preoperative HFRT will be critical to defining the feasibility, toxicity, efficacy, and potential improvement in access to care associated with this approach. Radiation therapy combined with wide local excision in the preoperative or postoperative setting optimizes local control for extremity STS. Preoperative radiotherapy confers a higher rate of wound complications but a lower rate of irreversible sequela such as fibrosis and lymphedema compared with postoperative radiotherapy. Resultantly, preoperative radiotherapy is the preferred approach in most cases. Preoperative radiotherapy with CFRT given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. The burden of daily travel and time away from work or care giving can be a barrier to utilization of radiotherapy. A recent analysis of the National Cancer Database demonstrated that farther distance to treatment was a negative predictor for receipt of radiotherapy in extremity STS. Sociodemographic factors such as female sex, older age (>70 years), Black race, and noncommercial insurance coverage were also negatively associated with receipt of radiotherapy. The authors summarized that radiotherapy is underutilized in the treatment of STS and that sociodemographic disparities exist in access to radiotherapy. Receipt of radiation therapy and surgery within a high volume (HV) sarcoma center has been associated with improved overall survival, while Black race and non-metropolitan residents were negative predictors for treatment within such centers. To address disparities in access to radiation therapy, the American Society for Radiation Oncology Committee on Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion has proposed studying novel HFRT schedules. As validation of this strategy, Kalbasi et al. increased retention of extremity STS patients within a HV sarcoma center by 3-fold with the utilization of preoperative HFRT. Further, the decreased time and travel associated with HFRT, can address an established barrier to clinical trial participation, particularly for those living remote from clinical trial sites. Clinical trial participation is particularly low in rural areas which results in these populations being underrepresented in the clinical research. A survey of South Carolina based medical researchers, identified rural residents as a group that are difficult to find and recruit to clinical trials. In a survey of urban and rural South Carolina residents, there was no difference in reported willingness to participate in clinical trials, but rural residents were more likely to perceive limited access to clinical trial sites. Investigating cancer treatment approaches that decrease the economic and logistical burdens incurred by patients, such as preoperative 5-day HFRT, may increase clinical trial participation by rural South Carolina residents and ultimately address disparities in representation of these populations in cancer research. HFRT, using >2.2 Gy/fx, has resulted in equivalent oncologic outcomes to CFRT in other tumor sites such as breast, prostate and rectum. For STS, HFRT may confer a radiobiologic advantage in that the linear-quadratic model predicts larger doses per fraction provide better tumor control for tumors with a lower \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio. For liposarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, their \u03b1/\u03b2 ratio ( 4 Gy) is similar to breast and prostate cancer, malignancies in which HFRT has been widely adopted. While histologic variability certainly exists, most STSs have estimated \u03b1/\u03b2 ratios lower than 10, suggesting increased sensitivity to larger fraction size. Clinical outcomes with preoperative HFRT in STS have been reported from retrospective case series, prospective institutional registries and phase I-II trials. Comparing oncologic outcomes across these series is hindered by heterogeneous clinicopathological features, surgical",

Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a non-pharmacologic intervention that has been studied in the context of stroke, where transient limb ischemia leads to neuroprotection. However, RIC has not yet been studied in MS. The investigators hypothesized that repeating RIC over several days may induce molecular/cellular changes in the CNS that promote remyelination. Since RIC is safe, tolerable and ready for clinical translation (recent stroke trials have shown promise), the investigators will run a clinical study to test RIC in people with primary progressive MS.\nThe purpose of this clinical trial is to determine if RIC in a dose of 4 cycles daily can prevent worsening of walking ability in people PPMS. The trial is funded through MS Canada as well as a private donation to the Hotchkiss Brain Institute MS Translational Clinical Trials Research Program and the University of Calgary. There is no sponsorship from the pharmaceutical industry.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nRemote Ischemic conditioning (RIC): Ischemic-preconditioning entails inducing short periods of cyclical tissue ischemia that confers subsequent protection against ischemia-reperfusion-injury. The rationale is that short periods of ischemia do not cause irreversible injury, but instead induce an endogenous protective environment. This short period of ischemia is not injurious, and it triggers endogenous protective signals (such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules) that reach distant organs, such as the heart, liver or the CNS. As an endogenous, non-specific response, the mechanisms involved in RIC are complex and include inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in endothelial function, cell survival etc. Current treatments for progressive Multiple Sclerosis (the immune-modulators Siponimod and Ocrelizumab) are only modestly effective and primarily benefit people with active inflammatory disease activity (recent relapses and/or enhancing lesions on MRI). Progression free of inflammatory activity is characterized by slow accumulation of disability, greatly affecting quality of life in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The investigators believe RIC is ideally suited to be tested as a therapy for progression in MS. Recent clinical trials in vascular disease have shown that daily RIC can be performed for up to a year and suggested an all-cause mortality benefit. In a recent (RICAMIS trial, 2022) multicenter, randomized trial of people with acute ischemic stroke (> 1,000 participants), 14-day RIC treatment led to improved functional outcomes at 6-months. No serious side effects were reported, and tolerability was good. This important study was the first phase III trial to find a protective effect for RIC in neurological disease, and highlights the timeliness and potential for re-purposing RIC as a therapy for MS. In this trial, the investigators will investigate whether RIC treatment can prevent disability worsening in people with Primary Progressive MS (PPMS). The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-futility of RIC for reducing progression of disability, as measured with the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), in people with PPMS.

It is a condition that affects the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes. PF is often caused by repetitive stress on the plantar fascia, such as from running or jumping. The condition can be very painful and can make it difficult to walk or stand.\n\nCurrently, there are no effective treatments for PF. The most common treatments include rest, ice, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications. However, these treatments are often ineffective and can take months to years to resolve the condition.\n\nRecently, a new treatment called Photobiomodulation Therapy (PBMT) has been shown to be effective in treating PF.

        "summary": "The human brain presents outstanding challenges to science and medicine. Brain function and structure span broad spatial scales (from single neurons to brain-wide networks) as well as temporal scales (from milliseconds to years). Currently, none of the tools available for studying the brain can fully capture its structure and function across these diverse scales - the neuroimaging puzzle. This poses crucial limitations to understanding how the brain works, and how it is affected by numerous diseases.\nThe central goal of this project is to expand currently available tools for non-invasive human brain imaging, to bridge critical gaps in the neuroimaging puzzle. New methodologies will be developed, focused on ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF MRI) and its combination with electroencephalography (EEG). New contrast mechanisms and technological advances enabled by UHF MRI and EEG will be explored to allow unprecedented views into the microstructure of brain regions like the thalamus, and to capture the activity of large-scale neuronal networks in the brain with high sensitivity, temporal and spatial specificity. These advances will be directly applied to address open questions in the diagnosis and treatment of essential tremor, and psychosis.\nIn general, improved brain imaging techniques are critical for a deeper understanding of how the brain works, and to detect and characterize diseases more effectively, thereby improving clinical management and leading to a healthier population. The non-invasive characterization and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like tremor is particularly relevant to aging modern societies.",

        "summary": "Obesity and iron deficiency are the nutritional disorders with the highest prevalence worldwide. Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain iron deficiency secondary to obesity. Among the most studied is the deficit in dietary iron intake or the increase in blood volume that increases the need for the metal. However, one of the most plausible mechanisms linking obesity and iron deficiency is low-grade systemic inflammation, through the iron metabolism intermediate known as hepcidin. The investigators objective is to evaluate the effect of weight loss by caloric restriction on hepcidin and serum iron concentration in people living with obesity and iron deficiency. The study will be divided into two phases: Phase 1: A cross-sectional study (cases and controls) to compare hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers in people living with and without obesity. The second phase consists of an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial. Individuals living with obesity who are iron deficient will be recruited and randomized to one of 2 dietary intervention groups with 60-day follow-up. The intervention groups will be: diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (with red meat) and diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (without red meat). Hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers will be determined at the beginning and end of the intervention.

Upon obtaining signed consent, participants will undergo a medical history assessment, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), body composition analysis (% body fat, % skeletal muscle mass, % fat-free mass), and blood samples will be collected to determine serum hepcidin levels, iron status, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, lipopolysaccharides), and oxidative stress markers (MDA). Additional blood samples will be taken for biochemical tests (glucose, lipid profile, creatinine, urea, liver function tests), insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and, optionally, DNA isolation for polymorphisms determination and those associated with iron metabolism and obesity. Participants will also complete a food frequency questionnaire (SNUT). Phase 2: Open randomized controlled clinical trial This phase will be conducted to assess the impact of weight loss on hepcidin levels, iron status, and inflammatory markers in individuals living with obesity.

There is a complex interaction between environmental (microbial and non-microbial) and human (genetic and non-genetic) factors. This will determine the quality of the immune response against the infectious agent and the clinical manifestation. By definition, individuals who die from an infection have defective immunity to the pathogen in question (immune agent (immune deficiency).\nThe investigation of individual variability in the development of infectious diseases began in the early 20th. The first evidence to support the hypothesis that individual variability variability and immune deficiencies were hereditary came from observations of familial cases or genetic isolates genetic isolates (from a homogeneous population) of rare or common infectious diseases, which in some cases Mendelian heredity hat predisposition to infectious diseases runs in families even more so than diseases associated with less determined environmental factors, such as certain cancers. such as certain cancers. Finally, studies comparing the rate of concordance of infectious diseases between monozygotic and dizygotic twins also implicate genetic factors in disease susceptibility.\nThese observations were validated by the discovery of genetic defects associated with severe infectious diseases, leading to proof of concept.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nUrinary incontinence (UI) is involuntary urinary leakage. This condition causes physical, psycho-social, and economic problems. It is more prevalent in women than in men. It occurs in women during pregnancy, childbirth, or menopause. It can also be triggered by factors such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus, chronic urinary infections, hysterectomy, and obesity. While urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening condition, it significantly impacts the quality of life for women. It leads to social phobia, social isolation, reduced self-confidence and self-esteem, embarrassment, psychological issues, as well as individual and societal costs. Urinary incontinence represents a growing burden in numerous countries. Investigators believe that the prevalence of UI may be underestimated because many women either seek healthcare assistance late or not at all due to perceiving it as a natural consequence of aging or childbirth or because they feel embarrassed about the issue. Furthermore, only a small fraction of women who are diagnosed with UI receive effective treatment. More than half of women with UI (66.4%) take approximately three years to seek medical assistance due to fears of stigmatization and a lack of information about treatment. The treatment and care for UI necessitate a multidisciplinary approach due to the complexity of the condition and the various issues it involves. However, before women are willing to seek medical assistance for UI, they must first recognize it as a medical issue. Hence, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of UI, raise awareness among women about the condition, and provide ongoing support for those affected by it. By taking these steps, we can effectively manage and prevent this condition, as well as create opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence, type, and risk factors of UI in married women and its effect on their quality of life.",

Approximately 560 patients will be recruited to be able to detect a difference of around 10% in SSAS rate between groups. Patients will be followed using multimodal imaging and quality of life questionnaires before and after the surgical repair until 1 year postoperative. The primary outcome will be single surgery anatomic success (SSAS), defined as absence of reoperation for recurrent RRD in the operating room. Secondary outcomes will be pinhole visual acuity (PHVA) at 8-10 weeks and 6 months, final best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), final retina status (i.e., attached or detached), time to onset of RRD recurrence, severity and number of complications, and questionnaire results.\nDiscussion: This will be the first 2 \u00d7 2 factorial randomized controlled trial examining repair techniques in primary RRD.

Many factors influence the onset and duration of peripheral nerve blocks. In the advent of ultrasound-guided nerve blocks, the accuracy in administering LA has significantly improved, potentially reducing the required dosage, which is also associated with less risk for toxicity. However, the effect of the concentration of LA on the onset time and duration of ultrasound-guided ankle blocks for forefoot surgery has not yet been studied. This poses a clinically relevant dilemma regarding the necessity of administering lower or higher concentrations of ropivacaine to achieve a clinically relevant faster onset time and longer duration of an ankle block.",

Given the rising age of global populations, reducing the burden associated with lost physical function is essential to minimise health and social care costs. Unfortunately, very few older adults engage in sufficient S&B exercise to reap these benefits, with a lack of time, self-efficacy and access to leisure facilities cited as the key barriers. Finding innovative ways promote an acceptable and engaging format of S&B exercise is consequently a public health priority.\nOne novel way that aims to address typical barriers to participation in older adults is through the promotion of exercise 'snacks', as opposed to a more traditional, lengthy structured exercise session at a leisure centre. Exercise snacking describes short bursts of exercise that are designed to be undertaken over a short period in the home environment and without the need for any specialised exercise clothing or equipment. In the initial laboratory and cross-sectional and pilot intervention research, the investigators have been testing two formats of 5-minute, twice-daily, strength exercise- and tai-chi-snacking, which has been shown to be acceptable and feasible to implement in older adults. This protocol presents initial efficacy for evoking improved physical function in people aged 65 years or more. The investigators' remote study demonstrated that remote assessment and delivery of 4-week exercise and tai-chi snacking interventions were acceptable and feasible. However, qualitative feedback indicated that exercise programmes may be more acceptable and interesting with simpler tai-chi movements and exercise snacking programme with upper body movements. Nevertheless, the investigators only recruited healthy older adults, doing short-term interventions in previous studies. This study aims to test the effectiveness of progressive S&B interventions over a sustained period in pre-frail older adults.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe administration of intravenous anesthetics in the elderly population requires adequate titration to avoid deleterious effects derived from overdosing or underdosing. Older patients show greater sensitivity to similar doses of propofol compared to younger patients. In addition, there is extensive interindividual variability among older patients, which would also explain the different responses to the same dose of drugs. This variability would be secondary to differences in comorbidities and physiological age, in contrast to chronological age, which would not explain the differences found in response to anesthetics in these patients. One way in which an attempt has been made to make the doses of anesthetics in different patients comparable is the use of models that predict what infusion rate is required to maintain a given concentration at the site of drug action. The relationship between a propofol effect site concentration (Ce) with a given effect can be represented by pharmacodynamic (PD) models. Recently, Eleveld et al. created a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for the administration of intravenous propofol in a population of wide ages, including neonates to older patients. However, the pharmacodynamic parameter used in this model was the BIS index, which has been questioned for its use in older adults. In addition, the creation of this PD model only included 3 patients older than 70 years, so the underrepresentation of this age group in the construction of the model could affect its performance, making it even more difficult to correctly predict the effect in this population. Anesthetic drugs exert their desired hypnotic effect on the brain. Brain electrical activity can be monitored non-invasively by recording electrical potential on the cranial surface using electrodes. The electroencephalographic (EEG) changes observed with the administration of anesthetics are usually systematic across different patients. These have been described and have been used to identify different phases of anesthetic depth or hypnosis. In addition, the representation of the EEG signal by means of a spectrogram has facilitated the incorporation of this information into commercial EEG monitors that previously only included highly processed indices such as the BIS. Within the EEG patterns of the spectrogram described for anesthetic maintenance with propofol, the alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations stand out. However, the power of alpha oscillations decreases with age and with other changes that are associated with age, such as decreased cognitive ability, increased comorbidities and brain vulnerability. Therefore, guiding our administration of propofol based on obtaining a pattern of alpha predominance appears to be difficult in this aged population. The general objective of this work is to build a PKPD model that uses the pharmacokinetic parameters of the Eleveld model and new pharmacodynamic parameters derived from the frontal EEG in a population older than 65 years of age. Our hypothesis is that the Eleveld PKPD model, modified with this new pharmacodynamic parameter, will predict better the hypnotic effect of propofol than the original Eleveld PKPD model, in adult patients older than 65 years. The creation of a PKPD model of propofol for the population over 65 years of age would allow a better titration of this drug to avoid possible deleterious effects secondary to its under or overdosage.",

        "summary": "About 26 000 patients are treated per year with radiotherapy for non-malignant diseases in the Czech Republic, majority of them with heel spur syndrome which prevalence ranges from 8-10% in the general population. Heel spur represents important socioeconomic as well as health care issue. Radiotherapy by orthovoltage X-ray belongs to standard conservative treatment methods with proven antiinflammatory effect. Nevertheless, with increasing incidence of cancer, it may be assumed that availability of radiotherapy service for heel spur patients will be further limited including limitations related to potential pandemic or other emergency situation. This represents upcoming unmet clinical need, where alternative approaches with dramatically abbreviated fractionation schedules are needed in order to keep availability as well as effectivity of heel spur (and other non-malignant disorders) radiotherapy.\nThe aim to presented single institutional prospective randomized open-lable clinical trial is to evaluate low dose radiotherapy delivered in single fraction manner in the treatment of heel spur syndrome.\nThe project aims to design a randomized trial that compared fractionated and single fraction radiotherapy (non-inferiority). Patients will be randomized into 6 groups according to the total dose, total of 966 patients will be enrolled. The primary objective is to compare Calcaneodynia sum score at 3 months after radiotherapy between fractionated vs. single fraction radiotherapy.",

Low-dose external beam radiotherapy (LD-EBRT), known for its anti-inflammatory effect, offers effective pain relief for HSS patients. Currently, the standard LD-EBRT regimen consists of six fractions of 1 Gray (Gy) administered twice weekly, resulting in a total dose of 6 Gy. This study posits the hypothesis that very low total doses of orthovoltage radiotherapy, delivered in a single fraction, may provide pain relief comparable to that achieved with higher doses of fractionated radiotherapy. The primary goal of this research is to determine whether one-day irradiation (a single fraction) is non-inferior to fractionated radiotherapy over a three-month period in terms of pain relief for HSS patients.

The most severe and debilitated CLBP patients often have comorbidities such as overweight and obesity. Despite the growing body of scientific literature pointing towards the close interaction between overweight/obesity and CLBP, few treatment programs for people with CLBP nowadays take overweight into account. Therefore this study will examine the added value of a behavioral weight reduction program (changes in diet, behavior and physical exercise) to current best evidence rehabilitation (pain neuroscience education plus cognition-targeted exercise therapy) for overweight or obese people with CLBP. An international, multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing a behavioral weight reduction program combined with pain neuroscience education and cognition-targeted exercise therapy versus pain neuroscience education and cognition-targeted exercise therapy alone, will be conducted. The primary outcome is pain and the primary endpoint was chosen at 12 months follow-up; secondary outcomes include health care use and daily functioning (see detailed description of outcomes for an overview of all secondary outcomes). If the promising results of the proof of concept study are corroborated, the new intervention will have a high socio-economic impact, including an annual health care cost reduction of \u20ac66 million in Switzerland, and \u20ac60 million in Flanders, and is expected to increase life expectancy in the long term.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGastroparesis is a chronic disease of the stomach that causes delayed gastric emptying without stenosis. It is a chronic alteration of gastric motility that leads to a delay in stomach emptying. It is an underdiagnosed condition. The prevalence is estimated at around 3% in the United States (mean age of 37.7 years, with an F: M ratio of 4:1. It is mainly an idiopathic condition; however, it can also be caused by diabetes mellitus and post-surgical conditions, such as fundoplication, vagotomy, bariatric surgery, and esophagectomy. Less frequently by conditions like post-infectious gastro-paresis, neurological or autoimmune diseases. The clinical symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, post-prandial fullness, bloating, belching, and upper abdominal discomfort. The gastroparesis cardinal symptoms index (GCSI) is a reliable, reproducible, and valid instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. It is based on three sub-scales (post-prandial fullness/early satiety-4 items; nausea/vomiting-3 items; bloating-2 items), and each item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (severe). GCSI is not a diagnostic tool, but it is helpful to measure the severity of the disease and the post-treatment improvement. Though the prevalence of gastroparesis has significantly increased over the last decade, management is still challenging. Patients with mild symptoms can be referred for dietary modifications coupled with medical therapy with prokinetics, especially metoclopramide. However, the response to prokinetics decreases over time. Moreover, these drugs have side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms and amenorrhea. Surgical approaches have been proposed; however, the invasive nature of those procedures and the low rate of clinical success have made them less favorable. Endoscopic interventions have also been described, including intra-pyloric injection of botulinum toxin, endoscopic gastrojejunostomy, and transpyloric stenting. For patients with refractory (persistent symptoms for >6 months refractory to medical therapy) and severe gastroparesis based on GCSI > 2, gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy can be considered. In 2013, the first human gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) was performed. It was inspired by the per-oral endoscopic myotomy technique, with a similar dissection method, that allows pyloromyotomy. The technical steps of G-POEM involve mucosal incision about 5 cm from the pylorus with the creation of access to the submucosal plane after detaching the planes by injection of lifting solution; creation of the submucosal tunnel with dissection technique up to the duodenal bulb and exposure of the pylorus; verification of the integrity of the mucosal surface; pyloromyotomy and closure of the mucosal flap with multiple endoclips. In the single pyloromyotomy group, a selective circular pyloromyotomy is performed at the 6 or 7 o'clock position after identifying the pyloric ring. In the double pyloromyotomy group, another selective cut is performed at the 4 or 5 o'clock position to keep at least 1 cm between the two pyloromyotomies. Only one retrospective case-controlled study compares single versus double pyloromyotomy at G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis. It showed a higher clinical response rate with double pyloromyotomy when compared with single pyloromyotomy in a 3- to 6-month follow-up period. In this randomized controlled prospective multicenter study, we aim to compare clinical outcomes and the efficacy of single versus double pyloromyotomy in G-POEM for refractory and severe gastroparesis. Prospective subjects will be approached regarding study inclusion either during a pre-endoscopy visit or shortly before their planned endoscopy procedure.

        "summary": "The brain is a highly active organ that requires a large blood flow to function properly. Normally, blood flow is tightly linked to the brain's energy demands. However, during surgery, anesthesia can affect this relationship in different ways. Some types of anesthesia can decrease blood flow to the brain, while others can increase it. Anesthesiologists need to be careful to maintain adequate blood flow to the brain during surgery, especially when blood pressure drops. Drugs may be used to increase blood pressure, but some of these drugs can also affect blood flow to the brain. It is still unclear how to best maintain blood flow to the brain during surgery and how different types of anesthesia and drugs affect this process.\nThe study aims to assess the clinical utility of a new technique that uses light-based neuromonitoring to measure changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolism. The investigators will recruit 80 adult patients undergoing surgery under general anesthesia and randomize them into one of four groups to evaluate the effects of different anesthetic agents and vasopressors on brain hemodynamics and metabolism. The study will include patients over 18 years of age with no history of neurological conditions, substance abuse, or contraindications to cerebral oximetry devices or specific anesthetic agents. The patients will receive standard anesthesia care and be monitored with our light-based neuromonitoring system. This study aims to demonstrate the device's ability to detect changes in cerebral hemodynamic parameters related to anesthesia induction and systemic hypotension.

        "summary": "Shaft fractures account for 20% of humeral fractures and 3% of all adult fractures in France, with an estimated incidence of 13 to 20/100,000 people. Men aged 21 to 30 years and women aged 60 to 80 years are particularly affected. Intramedullary nailing is among the standard treatments for humeral shaft fractures (when surgery is required). Once inserted, the nail is locked in order to limit stress on the fractured bone, as well as possible secondary rotational displacements or malunion. Bipolar interlocking (BI) is typically performed on both sides (proximal and distal) of the fracture site. This procedure is performed under radiological control, exposing the patient and care team to radiation (during the entire procedure). The objective of the treatment is to obtain consolidation of the fracture within 12 months, and to limit the occurrence of irreversible complications such as malunion or nonunion (2-10% at 12 months post-surgery). The unipolar interlocking (UI) technique has recently been introduced. In this technique, locking is performed only on the proximal side of the fracture site. By avoiding the distal approach, potential complications such as radial nerve damage, with the risk of irreversible paralysis (3.8-14.2% in studies of the BI technique in this indication) or the risk of infection on the distal side can be avoided. It also reduces operative time, and consequently the radiation received by patients and caregivers. However, the UI may be poorly positioned, resulting in malunion that requires revision surgery.\nDespite the absence of recommendations due to the lack of existing data, several teams use the UI in routine care. In this context, a descriptive cohort of 121 patients operated on at the Dijon University Hospital5 showed similar rates of consolidation between the 2 techniques (93.8% for UI versus 95.2% for BI, p=0.64), functional scores, and complications, as well as a significant 29% decrease in operating time in the UI group (mean + SD: 63.1\u00b121.3 min versus 88.0\u00b130.1 min for VB, p<0.01).

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nSubstance use disorder (SUD) is a complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use of a substance despite its harmful consequences. People with SUD have an intense focus on using a certain substance(s) such as alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs, to the point where the person's ability to function in day-to-day life becomes impaired. People keep using the substance even when they know it is causing or will cause problems. Drug use brings with it the likelihood of several negative health consequences. These can include a wide range of physical and mental health disorders, foremost of which are dependence, HIV infection, hepatitis-related liver diseases, overdose and premature death. The problem of substance use is becoming one of the most serious and rapidly growing phenomena all over the world. It accounts for substantial global morbidity, mortality, and financial and social burden. According to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, there were an estimated 494,000 drug-related deaths attributable to the use of drugs in 2019. In 2020, 1 in every 18 people aged 15-64 worldwide - an estimated 284 million people (5.6 per cent of the population) - had used a drug in the past 12 months. However, the coverage of interventions for the treatment of drug use disorders remains low overall. Implementation of scientific evidence-based drug prevention interventions remains low as well, especially in middle- and low-income countries. In Egypt, SUD is a serious public health threat. Recent studies have demonstrated increases in the prevalence of the use of tobacco, illegal drugs, and over-the-counter drugs, particularly among youth. Drug treatment registers are often used as a proxy indicator of treatment demand. This information is useful for analysis of service utilization and can be used as an indicator of trends in prevalence and patterns of high-risk drug consumption. Assiut University Hospital is the biggest hospital in Upper Egypt, and it provides health services for Assiut city and most of the neighboring governorates. Addiction management unit of Assiut University Hospital contains 16 beds, based on paid service and about 400 patients have been admitted per year. SUD is a dynamic process that changes constantly over time with new trends of drug dependence emerge every now and then, thus timely information about trends in psychoactive substance use could yield tailored interventions and reduce potential harms.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe extremity artery is the peripheral blood vessel of the whole body, and it is often involved early in the diseases that are easy to damage the small vessels, such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases. Early lower limb atherosclerosis mainly occurs in the dorsal foot artery, which is commonly seen in people with diabetes and long-term smoking. Connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus also mainly involve small blood vessels, and vascular lesions may appear earlier than those of other specific organs such as heart and lung. Because of its shallow location, the extremity artery can be better used as a screening site for vascular diseases, and it is the window for early reaction of vascular diseases. However, the early stage of extremity artery disease is easy to be ignored, and patients often have pain and numbness of the affected limb. When the disease is severe, it can lead to ulcer not healing, and even limb gangrene and amputation, which greatly affects the quality of life and brings huge troubles and economic pressure to the patients. Therefore, early diagnosis of extremity arterial lesions is of great significance for early diagnosis of microvascular injury diseases such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases, reducing the incidence of complications, and reducing the rate of amputation and mortality. Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in clinic. In recent years, with the development of ultrasound technology, the frequency of ultrasonic probes has been increasing.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe purpose of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of STERIFY GEL in promoting healing of periodontal pockets following SRP, compared with treatment with SRP alone. With specific visco-elastic and mucoadhesive properties, STERIFY GEL easily penetrates into the deepest and hard-to-reach areas of periodontal and peri-implant pockets, adhering to the gingival tissue and alveolar bone, providing complete coverage of the pockets. The effect of STERIFY GEL is promoted by a physical mechanism of action. After SRP, the gel is applied into the gingival pocket, where it acts primarily as a filler to restore volume, physically preventing bacteria from entering and reinfecting the pocket. STERIFY GEL can thus mechanically protect treated pockets and bone defects, promoting tissue healing. The occluding action at the level of periodontal and peri-implant gingival pockets, in synergy with the accessory action of hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, prevents bacterial recolonization and promotes subsequent tissue regeneration. Although SRP surgery is considered a gold standard treatment for periodontitis, it may in some cases be insufficient to decontaminate the pocket allowing bacteria to recolonize the tissues promoting new inflammation that can worsen the clinical picture.STERIFY GEL may find useful application in cases of moderate to severe chronic periodontal disease as an adjunctive treatment following SRP to improve and accelerate healing parameters and prevent recurrent inflammation and infection.In addition, antimicrobial control action prevents antibiotic use and the risk associated with antibiotic resistance.Such control of periodontal disease also allows for the maintenance of patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment (e.g., patients on bisphosphonate therapy, defected etc.).",

        "summary": "Peri-implantitis is defined as the pathological condition around dental implants characterized by inflammation in the peri-implant mucosa and progressive bone loss, eventually leading to implant loss. Peri-implantitis is thought to be a disease analogous to periodontitis with a prevalence reaching 22%. Though peri-implantitis is readily recognized as a part of modern dentistry, the exact etiology or an effective treatment regimen hasn't been established yet. Thus, contemporary research is orientating toward acknowledging the aetiologic and risk factors of the disease and of course establishing prognostic markers for disease prevention. Microbiota residing in the subgingival plaque are considered the main etiologic factor of the disease, however, current literature has not concluded on the exact microbial composition of peri-implant lesions. In addition, genetic predisposition has been recognized as a risk factor for disease initiation and progression and several observational studies have addressed the potential association between various gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of peri-implantitis. Lastly, to establish effective preventive measures, several biomarkers have been evaluated as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease progression.\nObjectives:\nTo identify the relationship of peri-implantitis with Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and MMP-8 gene polymorphisms. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the production of prostaglandins (PGs) which are an important inflammatory mediator participating in the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. In addition, PGE2 expression in the peri-implant crevicular fluid will be assessed.\nTo characterize the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis lesions, using novel identification techniques enabling the identification of specific opportunistic bacteria associated with the disease.\nTo test the diagnostic accuracy of a modern chairside test, using metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), an enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, as a biomarker of disease progression.",

Per-oral endoscopic myotomy is known as the effective treatment for achalasia patients. During per-oral endoscopic myotomy, capnoperitoneum, capnomediastinum, and systemic CO2 accumulation can potentially impair hemodynamics. Moreover, it has been suggested that achalasia is associated with autonomic dysfunction. We hypothesized that patients with autonomic dysfunstion would esperience more hemodynamic instability during per-oral endoscopic myotomy compared with patients without autonomic dysfunction. In this prospective observational study, the autonomic function test will be performed before surgery, and advanced hemodynamic parameters will be recorded using EV1000 clinical platform (Edwards Lifesciences, USA) during surgery.

        "summary": "Virtual reality (VR) glasses are technological devices that are often used in medical fields recently and are seen as suitable for distracting children. In the last few years, many studies have been conducted to facilitate pediatric patients against painful or frightening medical procedures. For uncomfortable procedures, distracting the child's attention is seen as the most important point. VR technology has been used for procedures such as burn cases, tooth extraction, intramuscular injection, intravenous cannula, lumbar puncture, and the results of the research have been found to be satisfactory. Using VR glasses alone or in combination with standard care is effective in reducing pain and anxiety. So far, there is no study in the literature on distraction with VR during inhaler treatment in pediatric patients. Children cannot receive inhaler treatment efficiently due to reasons such as restlessness, crying, and pulling the mask during inhaler treatment, and their hospital stay is prolonged. In this study, the investigators planned to compare the patients who received inhaler treatment with VR glasses with the patients who received treatment without the aid of any device in terms of treatment compliance.\nThus, the investigators aimed to make the inhaler treatment more comfortable with VR technology.",

This age group (preschool) was chosen because it is the age group that presents the most difficulties to families and physicians during inhaler treatment and screen exposure does not cause problems up to a certain point. The study was conducted as a prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled study in the Pediatric Emergency Department of the Health Sciences University Haseki Training and Research Hospital. Children with neuromotor retardation, visual and auditory problems, underlying chronic diseases (bronchiolitis, chronic lung diseases other than asthma, congenital heart diseases, neurological diseases such as epilepsy), obesity or malnutrition (to equalize the effectiveness of the drug dose), adrenaline, budesonide or those who receive ipratropium bromide treatment, Those who will receive inhaler inhaler treatment for the first time, Those who have received inhaler treatment in the last 72 hours, Those who have a previous operation or sedative history, Those who have a fever above 37.5\u00b0C, Those who have used VR before, Patients with a saturation value below 92% at the time of admission, Those presenting with severe asthma attack, Those with respiratory failure symptoms, Patients with a score of 5 and above according to the bronchiolitis severity score Those under 2 years of age to avoid screen exposure patients (infants) and patients over 5 years old (school period) were excluded from the study. Children with a score of 5 and above according to the bronchiolitis severity score were excluded from the study. The children included in the study were divided into 3 groups by randomization method: VR audio-visual users (Roller Coasters, group 1), VR audio-visual users (Wild Dolphins, group 2) and those who did not use any additional equipment (group 3). 3D Roller Coasters and 3D Wild Dolphins videos were used as VR images via Youtube application (Google LLC. California, USA; Youtube\u00ae). VR glasses were integrated into the tablet and given to the accompanying parent, so that the parent could see what their child was watching at that moment. Children in all groups were given 'salbutamol' inhaler treatment for 15 minutes, and equality was achieved between the groups in terms of treatment active substance and duration. Salbutamol was given to each child as 2.5 mg/2.5 ml. The children were observed during their 15-minute inhaler treatment, and the crying times were compared with the anxiety scoring made by the same doctor before and after the treatment, and the minute respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate change (HR) and the duration of inhaler treatment were compared. In addition, families filled out questionnaires about their children's mental state before and after the treatment. The FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, consolability) Pain Assessment Scale was used for the anxiety scoring made by the physician, and the Yale Modified Anxiety Scale (MYPAS), which was thought to be appropriate for our study, although it was designed to measure pre-operative anxiety. For families, a form consisting of eight 'yes-no' questions called the Parents' Pain Measure (MPPM), modified by us and normally used for post-operative anxiety/pain measurement, was used. In addition, Wong Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBS) was also used to evaluate the anxiety of the children for convenience to the family. The children to be included in the study were determined by a single researcher. The first investigator identified the children who met the inclusion criteria, noted the FLACC and MYPAS score, as well as the RR, SpO2, and HR values, and referred the child to the other investigator. The second investigator divided the child into his group using the randomization method, and determined the duration of crying and effective treatment, along with the duration of treatment, with a double chronometer during treatment. At the end of the treatment, the family and the child were re-directed to the first researcher on the condition that they did not tell the first researcher which group they were in.

Our study sample will consist of approximately 400 adult users (aged \u226518 years old), who are new app users (who have engaged in a 7-day free trial). As users may have varying registration dates, the data collected will only include the first 24 weeks of an individual's interaction with the platform. WayBetter is a wellness lifestyle mHealth app available to anyone who wants to improve their overall well-being. All users are asked to accept the company's privacy policy and are prompted to fill out personal data including (but not limited to) [email address, weight] when creating an account. All users are given a one-week free trial as well as $10 USD to use as a deposit towards any WayBetter app game, courtesy of WayBetter Inc. Users can complete any of the games they signed up for during their free trial, even if they decide not to continue to their membership. To continue to participate in games, users must subscribe to a six-month membership ($69 USD total). In general, users can join up to ten games at a time. The app has a game directory (explore tab) that includes 60+ games each week in three categories: fitness, nutrition, and mindset. New games start on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each game lasts between 1-4 weeks and requires players to achieve a specific behavioral goal (e.g., 5K Steps Per Day requires that they walk at least 5,000 steps per day on at least 4 days per week for 2 weeks). Upon joining a game, players have an option to make a deposit, called a financial commitment of $10-30, depending on the game. Multiple methods are used to validate goal achievement. Some games require players to verify their physical activity data by connecting their WayBetter app account (i.e., syncing) to a wearable device or step tracking app. Other games require participants to verify their behavior by submitting photos (e.g., photo from their wearable device or step tracking app showing that they met the game's daily step goal; photo of meals they ate). Each game also has a social feed, where users can view each other's posts and photo submissions and share anything related to their fitness journey (e.g., progress, inspiration, something they are proud of). All players who achieve the game's goal are declared winners. Winners who made deposits are rewarded by splitting the total pot of deposits evenly, such that they earn back their original deposit plus addition profit, dependent on how many users 'lost'. The app incorporates an additional gamification aspect by introducing levels; players are required to win 3 games to advance a level (one from each category; they can choose any games they want) WayBetter will send out a recruitment email to WayBetter users five days after they enter into a seven-day free trial. In the email, participants will be invited to complete a study survey via the Qualtrics link provided. After clicking on the link, participants will first be prompted to read and respond to the study LOI. Thereafter, participants will be asked to complete the survey which will aim to collect information about individual-level socio-demographics (i.e., household income, rural or urban living status, gender, age, race, and ethnicity), previous health behaviours (i.e., previous fitness, nutrition, stress, weight loss), determinants of behavioural intentions to use health and fitness apps, and behavioural/personality traits (i.e., risk taking traits, healthy behaviour self-efficacy, personality traits). Participants who complete the survey will earn a $10 USD e-gift card, distributed directly to participant provided email via the Tango Card rewards platform (https://www.tangocard.com).

The investigators propose the following scientific hypothesis: In patients with depression, levels of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin in different brain regions may fluctuate at different stages of the disease progression and treatment, along with changes in the activation levels of different brain regions. Neuroimaging studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of depression suggest a reduction in gray matter volume in emotion processing areas such as the limbic system, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Previous neuroimaging studies have found that successful cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) accompanied changes in gray matter volume in the brain, as observed through fMRI. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), which is a component of the third wave of CBT, is expected to exhibit more significant expression in cognitive task-based fNIRS during IPT treatment for depression.

The most important factor for survival for many cancer types is the presence of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes (metastasis). Lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck cancer reduce the 5-year survival by half. Sometimes, the disease is too small to be found on clinical and imaging exams before surgery. 111In-panitumumab is in a class of medications called radioimmunoconjugates. It is composed of a radioactive substance (indium In 111) linked to a monoclonal antibody (panitumumab). Panitumumab binds to EGFR receptors, a receptor that is over-expressed on the surface of many tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell growth. Once 111In-panitumumab binds to tumor cells, it is able to be seen using an imaging technique called single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). SPECT/CT can be used to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body and to visualize areas where the radioactive drug has been taken up by the cells.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nLacrimal drainage obstruction can manifest as epiphora or recurrent infections with mucopurulent discharge and may even cause social embarrassment. Obstruction can occur at any level along the lacrimal drainage system: punctum, canaliculus, nasolacrimal duct, or nasal ostium. It is seen more often in females, especially in postmenopausal women. The etiopathogenesis of lacrimal passage obstruction appears to be multifactorial. Chronic inflammation has been suggested to be the most causal. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a standard surgical procedure used to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), with a reported success rate of more than 90%. Knowledge concerning the morphological characteristics of lacrimal passage obstruction using traditional diagnostic methods (e.g., lacrimal irrigation, probing, dacryocystography) is limited. Dacryoendoscopy was originally described in 1979 and has recently matured for use in lacrimal drainage system imaging. It has been proved to be a useful instrument not only for understanding differences in the etiology of obstructions but also for treating LD obstructions. On the other hand, semiconductor diode laser can achieve more effective tissue dissection than direct probing technique with minimal hemorrhage and improved intraoperative view. Hence, dacryoendoscopic-assisted laser dacryoplasty with silicone intubation (DLDI) offers direct therapy to the obstructed site, leading to minimal collateral damage external to the target zone. In addition, this procedure can be performed under local anesthesia as an outpatient procedure in the office, and it has advantages such as short surgery time and less risk of bleeding during surgery, resulting in its increasingly widespread use in China. Although the silicone intubation using dacryoendoscopy has increased the success rates, the success rates vary from a low of 51% to a high of 90%. The difference in success rates seems to depend on the site of obstruction, differences in the surgical technique, stringency of definitions of success, and duration of follow-up. A greater understanding of factors associated with treatment failure may allow us to glean insights regarding patient selection and ultimately improve treatment outcome.

Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis). The general prevalence charge of stroke is round 2-25 according to thousand population. The chance of recurrence over five years is 15-40%. Ischemic stroke is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in the neck or brain becomes blocked. Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis).Hemorrhagic stroke is because of bleeding into the brain through the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemorrhagic stroke can be in addition subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The concord symptom is abrupt numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body. Sudden disorientation or difficulty speaking or understanding language. sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes; sudden difficulty walking, lightheadedness, or loss of balance or coordination; sudden severe headache of unknown cause.The most common risk factor for stroke is hypertension.Upper motor neuron lesion due to stroke outcomes in a constellation of sensorimotor impairments which includes muscle weakness, impaired selective motor control, spasticity, and proprioceptive deficits that intervene with normal gait.Gait is one of the most important aspects of a stroke rehabilitation program. Patients with stroke are characterized by decreased ankle dorsiflexion during the swing, which leads to a decrease in gait ability. Hemiparetic gait is characterised by using particular spatiotemporal styles, along with decreased cadence, prolonged swing period on the paretic aspect, prolonged stance duration on the nonparetic side, and step length asymmetry.Post-stroke hemiplegic gait is a combination of deviations and compensatory movement dictated by way of residual functions.Decreased functional mobility is a well-known residual disability after stroke and is associated with the ability to move (e.g., get in and out of a bed or chair), walk a certain distance, and turn. , is related. while remaining independent. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a stretching technique used to improve muscle flexibility and has been exhibited to have a positive effect on active and passive range of motion. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a very powerful healing exercise for the improvement of muscle thickness, dynamic stability and gait and broadly used in medical settings to improve the bodily functioning of stroke patients.Some of the techniques of Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation are contarct-relax, hold-relax, rhythmic initiation etc.PNF techniques are done in diagnol pattern involving flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, internal and external rotation. Kinesiotape is an elastic therapeutic tape used for the treatment of various disorders.Kinesiotapingis theorize to have numerous features (1) restoring muscle characteristic by assisting weakened muscles,(2) reducing c ongestion through improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing ache by way of stimulating neurological system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm. Depending on the direction of application and tape tension increasing proprioception and increasing or inhibiting muscle recruitment can be obtained. The effect and positive result of Kinesio Tape greatly centers on increase in neuromuscular recruitment.RCT was conducted by S.Choi et.al in 2020 on immediate effects of ankle nonelastic taping on balance and gait ability in patients with chronic stroke. 30 patients with stroke more than the duration of 6 months, both genders were included in this study. Non-elastic ankle taping is applied first, start at the bottom of the first metatarsal head and wrap the tape diagonally toward the fifth metatarsal head.

        "summary": "Two billion catheters are placed annually worldwide. Of all the people requiring vascular access, nearly a quarter have Difficult Intravenous access (DIVA), a source of multiple punctures. The increased risk of haematomas, haemorrhages, infection, pain and associated trauma is responsible for increased human costs and economic impact.\nTo limit the risks posed by the DIVA, practitioners have solutions such as the per-bone line, other types of lines, and placement of peripheral venous catheter with ultrasound or transluminescence. However, these solutions are not always applicable, depending on the care situation (non-substitutable venous access, fragile patient, etc.) or on the technical platform (available personnel and training, configuration of the premises, available equipment). Moreover, these actions are often taken after failures, in a non-anticipated and non-consensual manner.\nIn order to assess the risk of DIVA, F.Van Loon et al developed in 2016, and then modified in 2018, a DIVA Scale (the A-DIVA Scale) which allows a rapid scoring upstream of peripheral venous catheter placement to classify patients according to the risk of DIVA.\nComposed of five items (non-palpable and non-visible vein, diameter < 3mm, history of DIVA, operator experience) worth one point each, the score allows three categories to be established: low risk, moderate risk, high risk. The study showed that the proportion of first puncture failures increased with the risk of the patients (defined according to the categorized score).\nThe use of a tool such as the A-DIVA Scale is of interest if it allows the definition of actions to be taken in relation to the risk it identifies. In view of this, it appears essential to optimize the management of peripheral venous catheters, particularly for patients with DIVAs. The aim of this study is to develop a graduate and specific response to the issue of multiple punctures. Our project is to create and evaluate a specific algorithm, consisting of a risk assessment (the A-DIVA Scale) and a co-construct decision-making tree (the A-DIVA Tool). Built on the basis of objective clinical data collection and adapted to the possibilities and competencies, this new tool would bring real benefits to the patient in terms of safety (reduction of risks) and comfort (reduction of pain and duration of management), as well as a medico-economic benefit for the institutions. To date, such an algorithm does not exist and its beneficial effects have not been evaluated.",

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death. Detection and removal of polyps can reduce risk for developing colorectal cancer. After finding and removing precancerous polyps, repeat colonoscopy is routinely recommended. However, it is unclear whether repeat additional colonoscopy further reduces risk for colorectal cancer. For older adults age 75 and older, the lack of this information is especially important, given that the risks of colonoscopy go up with age. This research will evaluate whether older adults with a prior history of precancerous polyps have higher colorectal cancer risks compared to older adults who had a prior normal colonoscopy, and whether, among those with prior precancerous polyps, repeating a colonoscopy after age 75 is associated with reduced cancer risk. The investigators will synthesize these data and gather perspectives from Veterans and clinical stakeholders to make recommendations on whether older adults with a prior history of polyps should continue or defer colonoscopy after age 75.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nColorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US), with 149,500 new CRC cases, and 52,980 deaths expected in 202119; 4,000 Veterans are diagnosed with CRC annually. Screening for CRC reduces incidence and mortality, in part due to detection and removal of polyps such as adenomas. National and VA guidelines recommend surveillance for CRC after adenoma removal (defined herein as polypectomy), but the incremental benefit of surveillance after polypectomy on reducing CRC incidence and mortality are uncertain. For adults age 75 and older (older adults) considering surveillance colonoscopy, these issues are of particular importance. Harms associated with colonoscopy increase dramatically with age, with 3.8% to 6.8% of older adults experiencing an emergency visit or hospitalization within 30 days of colonoscopy. Older vs. younger adults have a 1.5 to 3.7-fold increase in post-colonoscopy complications. Older adults also are less likely to live long enough to benefit from interventions such as surveillance colonoscopy, due to competing, non-CRC mortality risks. The well-established age-related increasing risks for competing causes of mortality and colonoscopy-related harms stand in sharp contrast to major evidence gaps: it is unclear whether CRC risk is clinically significant among older adults with prior history of polyps, and whether exposing older adults to surveillance reduces CRC risk. Yet, the default clinical paradigm is for many older adults to receive surveillance colonoscopy. In the VA, surveillance is a very common indication for colonoscopy among older Veterans, with an estimated >17,400 exposed to surveillance annually. The mismatch between available evidence and current clinical practice, coupled with extreme constraints on colonoscopy resources in the VA, make the surveillance colonoscopy paradigm an ideal focus area for quantifying risks and benefits to optimize health outcomes. The Overarching Aim is to advance knowledge on CRC risks among older adults with prior history of polypectomy and potential benefits of surveillance colonoscopy, with the goal of informing policies and clinical strategies that optimize benefits, risks, and resource utilization. The Specific Aims are to: Aim 1. Compare cumulative CRC risk after age 75 in a cohort of older adults with history of normal colonoscopy (n=101,328) vs. colonoscopy with polypectomy (n=29,548) prior to age 75. After normal colonoscopy, US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines note that benefits of repeat screening in older adults are likely minimal and recommend selective screening. Finding no CRC risk difference for older adults with prior normal colonoscopy vs. polypectomy would suggest surveillance guidelines should follow a similar approach. Risk analyses will also be stratified by baseline adenoma type (low vs. high risk). Hypothesis: Cumulative risk for incident CRC (primary analysis) and fatal CRC (secondary analysis) after age 75 will be similar in older adults with normal colonoscopy vs. colonoscopy with polypectomy prior to age 75. Aim 2. Among older adults with polypectomy prior to age 75, assess comparative effectiveness of exposure vs. no exposure to surveillance colonoscopy after age 75 for reducing CRC risk using a case-cohort design. Cases with incident (n=270) and fatal CRC (n=150), and a random sample subcohort with prior polypectomy (n=1,036) will undergo rigorous chart review to ascertain exposure to surveillance. Harms associated with surveillance will be characterized. Risk analyses will also be stratified by baseline adenoma type (low vs. high risk). Hypothesis: Older adults unexposed vs. exposed to surveillance will have similar risk for incident CRC (primary analysis) and fatal CRC (secondary analysis). Aim 3. Obtain multi-level stakeholder perspectives regarding CRC risk and surveillance outcomes to inform future use and VA policy regarding surveillance colonoscopy in older Veterans. The investigators will conduct 44 semi-structured one-on-one qualitative interviews with VA patients (older adults) and providers (primary care, GI, geriatrics) to understand perspectives on CRC risk, and potential benefits and harms of surveillance (Aim 3a). The investigators will then convene an expert panel with key stakeholders including Veterans, primary providers,",

Our previous study demonstrated that AVA was effective in 55% of refractory AA. Since the action mechanism of AVA and EPAG is not exactly the same, and the metabolic level of the elderly is not the same as that of younger patients, it is unknown whether there are predictive factors of efficacy in the treatment of AVA. Thus, we wondered whether CsA+AVA could achieve an efficacy similar to CsA+ATG+AVA in the Elderly.",

        "summary": "papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and has a good prognosis. Surgery is the primary treatment for PTC, and occult lymph node metastasis is not uncommon (20%-80%).The lymph node metastasis of PTC is mostly along the lymphatic drainage path station by station, and most of the first metastasis is to the central lymph node. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association recommendation, prophylactic central lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with primary T3-4 or cN1b without central lymph node involvement. However, PTC with primary site T1-2, no external invasion and cN0 could not be dissected by central lymph node.Previous studies have suggested that prophylactic dissection should be performed to improve disease-specific survival, reduce local recurrence, improve recurrence risk and treatment response assessment, and help RAI decision making. Although routine prophylactic central lymph node dissection may detect occult lymph node metastasis, the need for further dissection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland may lead to an increased incidence of complications, while its effect on reducing the risk of recurrence and improving prognosis is unclear, and the impact on long-term outcomes may be small.Previous retrospective studies in our institution have shown that routine central neck dissection does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. This study was designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in cT1b-T2N0 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma. In order to ameliorate the effects of relapse and long time of death of PTC, thyroglobulin and its antibodies were also evaluated for short-term treatment response after surgery.",

The aim of the study is to ensure that the side effects of the 3-dose treatment are the same or potentially lower than those already published when using the 5-dose treatment as used in the UK PACE-B trial (NCT01584258). The name of this type of radiotherapy is Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) or participants may see it referred to as Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). The study is a two-stage single arm Phase II study open to those Centres that use the RayPilot HypoCath tumour tracking system (Micropos Medical). This commercially available system was not available at the time of the original PACE-B study. The system acts like a Global Positioning Device (GPS) to continuously track the prostate position during radiotherapy. If the prostate moves more than 2mm (about 0.08 in) from its intended position during the treatment, then the radiotherapy team are alerted, and the treatment halted until the prostate moves back into the correct position. The ability to understand exactly where the prostate is throughout the treatment ensures the intended dose hits the cancer and does not accidentally increase the dose to the nearby bladder and rectum. The system is a modification of a standard urinary catheter which sits within the bladder with the GPS placed within the wall of the catheter as it passes through the prostate.

The idea behind bone grafting is to provide optimal bone formation and structural stability, which is crucial for bone healing. However, the harvesting and use of bone from the iliac crest potentially comes with the risk of complications such as delayed union of the osteotomy defect; size mismatch between the graft and the osteotomy defect; longer operation time; donor site morbidity including nerve, arterial, and ureteral injury; herniation of abdominal contents; sacroiliac joint instability; pelvic fractures; hematoma and infection. As these disadvantages of bone grafting can have a major impact on patients' everyday lives, research is needed on whether bone grafting is genuinely necessary during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation of the distal radius\nOBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to investigate whether harvested bone graft from the iliac crest necessary is during corrective osteotomy and plate fixation in patients with malunited distal radius fractures.\nSTUDY DESIGN This is a prospective, randomized, controlled multicenter study.

Patients living far from big cities do not have easy access to such interventions, usually applied in the form of camps. This randomized controlled trial will include 48 children with bilateral CP and aims to test a home version of HABIT-ILE with the use of a specifically designed virtual device and a remote supervision. For this purpose, two types of two weeks intensive treatment programs will be compared: Hand and Arm Bimanual Intensive Therapy Including Lower Extremities at home (HABIT-ILE at home) and classic HABIT-ILE. Moreover, this study also aims to assess whether the patient's abilities are better with a follow-up at home after two weeks of HABIT-ILE therapy than without follow-up post therapy. Four groups will be compared: HABIT-ILE at home therapy with a follow-up at home, HABIT-ILE at home therapy without follow-up, classic HABIT-ILE therapy with a follow-up at home and classic HABIT-ILE therapy without follow-up.

When evaluation of cervical dilation is clinically indicated, obstetricians traditionally perform sterile speculum exams due to concern for decrease in pregnancy latency (length of time between breaking the water and delivery) with sterile digital exams in retrospective studies.

        "summary": "HCC is the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Although surgical treatment may be effective in patients with HCC, the five-year survival rate is only 50-70%. Moreover, due to the lack of early diagnostic marker, most patients with HCC are often diagnosed in an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further understand the possible aetiological factors and surgical treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC. Liver transplantation is an ideal choice for patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC, which can significantly improve the postoperative survival rate. But the most serious problem facing such patients is the shortage of donor livers. In 2015, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment (2-3 segment) transplantation combined with delayed total hepatectomy can greatly alleviate the shortage of liver donors in the above-mentioned patients. Based on the experience of clinical operation, our center proposes and designs a clinical study of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation (SALT) for the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC. On the basis of RAPID, the safety and efficacy of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation were evaluated for the above patients.",

However, the shortage of donor liver is the biggest problem faced by patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC. In 2015, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment 2-3 transplantation with delayed total hepatectomy (RAPID) . This approach allows transplantation of the left liver (segments 2+3) to an adult recipient, while the remaining enlarged right hemi-liver is transplanted to another adult recipient, effectively avoiding some unsuitable left lateral lobe livers for pediatric recipients to be wasted. Recipients who received right-hemi-liver transplantation had a similar prognosis compared with those who received whole-liver transplantation. Therefore, if the RAPID technique is confirmed to be feasible, it can greatly alleviate the shortage of liver donors. In addition to cadaver sources, living adult donors can also be considered as the source of liver donors. A smaller left lateral lobe donor liver also places less burden on the donor than a left or right hemiliver. To sum up, our center proposed and designed a clinical study of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation (SALT) in the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC based on clinical surgical experience. On the basis of RAPID surgery, the overall survival rate of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC was evaluated by SALT.",

While DCM causes a range of symptoms, one of the most disabling is loss of hand dexterity. Surgical decompression is standard treatment for DCM, but reduced dexterity often remains.\nThe investigators have developed a portable, easy-to-use dexterity assessment tool for measuring hand dexterity. Hand function is often assessed using tools incapable of measuring subtle changes in function, limiting a clinician's ability to monitor progression of or recovery from a disease over time. The hope is that if subtle changes in function are identified early, leading to an early DCM diagnosis and treatment, this may prevent patients from experiencing a greater loss of hand function.\nThe goals of this study are to determine the relationship between dexterity and myelopathy severity, as well as to establish the validity and reliability of the dexterity tool. This will be done by assessing dexterity using the dexterity tool in DCM patients (to determine the relationship between disease severity and dexterity, and measure validity) and healthy participants (to establish reliability).",

With the significant increase in long-term survival and increasing age of transplant patients, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, such as those caused by dyslipidemia, have become a major cause of transplant organ failure and recipient death. However, the causes of dyslipidemia after organ transplantation, as well as the effects and mechanisms of dyslipidemia on transplant rejection, are unknown.\nPrevious studies have found that 1. increased lipid levels occur in recipients after heart transplantation; 2. during rejection, hepatic PCSK9 expression is increased in recipients; 3. a high-fat environment increases the immunoreactivity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is suggested that PCSK9-lipid disorder-immune cell interactions may be associated with the development of transplant rejection.\nIn this project, we propose to (1) establish a long-term follow-up system for postoperative cardiac transplantation patients in our department to track the characteristics of lipid changes in transplantation patients, to clarify the link between dyslipidemia and rejection, and to provide a strong evidence-based medical basis for the management of lipids during the perioperative period and in the postoperative period; (2) expand the dimensions of lipid-related assays under the support of the above system, and to incorporate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research methods to elucidate transplantation rejection in a multidimensional manner.

It has been the subject of many studies in the same surgical group. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery can be excruciating in the postoperative period, just like thoracotomy surgeries. What is aimed of this study is to compare it with erector spinae block in this study. Additional anesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of the multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to manage acute pain better. Inadequate treatment can lead to persistent pain conditions. Although numerous nerve blocks exist for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the thoracic dermatomes or their entire innervation.

The cause of postoperative pain is multifactorial, including the type of anesthesia , hemorrhoidectomy technique. and spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) that becomes exposed after hemorrhoidectomy. The spasm of the IAS is considered the target to relieve pain post operatively. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is widely used as an adjunct to relieve pain post hemorrhoidectomy as it release the spasm of the sphincter and subsequently relieve pain. However, this procedure is not accepted by many surgeons due to its recorded complications as bleeding and mild degree of fecal incontinence, so its role following hemorrhoidectomy is still controversial.\nOn the other hand, the spasm of the anal sphincter can be abolished by injection of the botulinum toxin which acts on the acetylcholine receptor and consequently temporary muscle paralysis occurs that is followed by decreased pain and wound healing.\nOur hypothesis is botulinum toxin relaxes the internal sphincter, so prevent its spasm and so reducing the pain and promoting wound healing more rapidly.",

This study will evaluate the ability of methylphenidate to treat PTSD and associated neurocognitive complaints in Veterans. An innovative feature is the study's N-of-1 design. In this design, every participant will move back and forth every 4-5 weeks between treatment with methylphenidate and treatment with placebo, in random order and under double-blind conditions, over a 20-week period.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric illness that is associated with significant suffering and disability in Veterans. Current treatment options are not fully effective for all Veterans, and even when they are effective in lowering total symptom burden, many Veterans continue to experience significant symptom burden and associated functional impairment. Total symptom burden and associated functional impairment is often particularly high for those with comorbid mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely available psychostimulant medication with a long track record of safety, which has been used to improve cognitive functioning in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has also shown benefit for mood and cognitive functioning in studies of moderate or severe TBI and as augmentation in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. In a small pilot study of the efficacy of MPH for subjective cognitive impairment associated with PTSD and/or mTBI, members of the research team found that MPH resulted in not only a significant improvement in subjective and objective measures of cognitive functioning, but also a significant decrease in symptoms of both depression and PTSD. The investigators propose to follow up this promising initial finding with an aggregated N-of-1 randomized placebo-controlled trial of MPH versus placebo (PBO) for PTSD and cognitive symptoms in Veterans with PTSD, with or without comorbid TBI. N=70 Veterans across two sites will each receive sequential 4-week periods of MPH and PBO, in randomized order and separated by a 1-week washout, for a total of 20 weeks. During this time, they will complete weekly or biweekly assessments. This trial design, which is particularly well-optimized for conditions in which a heterogeneous response to treatment is expected, will let us achieve a number of specific aims. First, the investigators will assess the efficacy of MPH compared to PBO for reducing PTSD and depression symptoms in Veterans with PTSD and neurocognitive complaints. Second, the investigators will assess the impact of MPH compared to PBO on neurocognitive functioning in this same population. And third, the investigators characterize the baseline predictors of treatment response to MPH in this population, including whether Veterans with a history of mTBI show greater average treatment response to MPH versus PBO. Finally, this trial design will also allow a systematic assessment of risks in this population, including the risk of discontinuation effects or loss of efficacy over time.",

It is a common condition, affecting approximately 10% of the population in Korea, and its chronic gastrointestinal symptoms significantly impact patients' daily life and quality of life. Factors such as changes in the intestinal microbiota and the intestinal ecosystem are crucial in its etiology. Modern individuals, who are often exposed to numerous stressors, frequently experience persistent intestinal hypersensitivity and inflammation. Foods that are not well digested and fermented in the intestines, producing a significant amount of gas - such as those rich in seasonings, dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol - are known to trigger symptoms. Therefore, it is suggested that a controlled environment like a Temple Stay, which provides both dietary regulation and stress control, could lead to meaningful symptom improvement. However, there is currently a lack of objective scientific research on this. Our research team hypothesizes that a Temple Stay experience of more than a week could consistently change the microbiome and stabilize psychosocial factors. This might control chronic intestinal inflammation and hypersensitivity, leading to subjective symptom improvement and enhanced treatment satisfaction for patients. Through this study, we aim to validate the hypothesis that the dietary changes in a Temple Stay environment will drastically alter patients' dietary intake, enrich the composition of the gut microbiome, and consequently reduce the symptoms of IBS, thereby improving the quality of life.",

        "summary": "Cognitive impairment is one of the commonly reported Long COVID symptoms, mainly in terms of memory, attention, and executive function. The cognitive symptoms of Long COVID are similar to brain fog or chemo brain, manifested as low energy, disorientation, difficulties in attention and communication which are common conditions in cancer patients after chemotherapy. Given the negative impact of such cognitive impairment in daily living and working, it is important to develop effective treatment and self-management techniques to enhance cognitive functions in COVID-19 survivors. Acupuncture, acupressure, dantian breathing, and qigong are promising treatment and self-management techniques to remedy the cognitive impairment in people with Long COVID. Since acupressure, dantian breathing, and qigong are feasible for self-practice, they can be trained to promote a healthy lifestyle. The present study is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of acupuncture, lifestyle management (including dantian breathing, qigong, and acupressure), and acupuncture + lifestyle management to improve general cognitive function of people with Long COVID symptoms, compared with wait-list control. We will recruit 100 COVID-19 survivors who experience at least mild cognitive impairment and/or self-complaint of cognitive difficulty for at least 12 weeks after clinical recovery from COVID-19 infection. They will be randomly assigned to the following groups: (1) Acupuncture Group; (2) Lifestyle Management Group; (3) Acupuncture + Lifestyle Management Group; and (4) Waitlist Control Group.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAlzheimer's Disease is an insidious onset and slowly progressive disease, characterized by the presence of cognitive, behavioral and general dysfunction. Among the neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms seen in Alzheimer's patients, apathy is the most common symptom. It is also followed by depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) affect up to 90% of people with dementia during the illness. Therefore, it brings great difficulties to both patients and their caregivers and causes low quality of life. In addition, the inability to treat the disease completely worsens this situation. Considering the pharmacological treatment of psychological symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression in AD individuals, the existence of adverse side effects, increased mortality, limited drug efficacy, relatively high cost, and the inability to effectively treat some of the most distressing behaviors, it is recommended to give priority to non-pharmacological interventions. The concept of cognitive stimulation in AD is one of the most popular approaches. It is stated that Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the best evidence-based practice with robust clinical trials, applied according to a specific guideline for individuals with mild and moderate dementia. In addition, CST is the only intervention recommended by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to promote cognition, independence and well-being for people with mild to moderate dementia. It has been determined that CST applied to individuals with Alzheimer's disease contributes to the strengthening of cognitive, psychological and social aspects, but there are different results in studies on the effectiveness of cognitive intervention strategies aimed at reducing cognitive functions, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. To enable the conversion of CST into routine clinical practice, practice research to support the standardization and generalization of cognitive stimulation therapy planned for patients with AD and its impact on improving neuropsychiatric symptoms and daily living skills requires further research. In addition, the absence of a widely used standard guideline for pharmacological methods for patients with AD in our country reveals that the planned study will contribute to practice. It has been confirmed by many studies that CST applied to individuals with AD contributes to the strengthening of cognitive, psychological and social aspects, but there are few studies applied by nurses. It is noteworthy that the studies on the CST program applied by nurses in our country are limited. Therefore, the need for more clinical studies is emphasized by nurses to build and disseminate knowledge in this area, as the intervention has been little studied. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effect of CST application on the levels of apathy, loneliness, anxiety and daily living activities in elderly individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This research was planned in a single center and experimental research design with pretest posttest control group. The research was planned to be carried out between January 2023 and June 202 at the Moral House affiliated to Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality Disabled and Health Services Department.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nChronic pain has long been known as one of the major health concerns, impacting psychological health, functioning, and quality of life. However, its treatment is complex and is challenged by a complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors. Common pain treatments present significant medical and technological limitations, reflected in unspecific drug usage and an extremely high number of medical examinations that patients face regularly, with a huge cost burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, the overall efficacy of pain management is often limited (73% dissatisfaction with treatment), leaving the patient in poor life conditions. Designing individualized targeted therapies requires understanding each subject's multidimensional pain experience, taking into consideration both the physical and emotional aspects involved. However, today, the golden standard measurement for pain is self-reports, which inherently suffer from subjective differences in perception and reporting. Healthcare systems advocate for the discovery of biomarkers and reliable clinical trial endpoints for pain to foster diagnosis, monitor pain progression, assess new treatments, and personalized therapeutic response. Nevertheless, most of the evidence today comes from inpatient settings or controlled laboratory environments. The pAIn-sense study aims at providing a radically novel approach in the monitoring and treatment of pain patients: a novel telemonitoring system allowing to understand the real nature of the pain (emotional vs physical), leveraging the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques and wearable sensing technology collecting biometric data, therefore enabling efficient personalized treatments. To achieve this goal, the investigators will combine real patient data both from a physical and emotional perspective, to characterize the pain nature of patients and provide a tailored continuum-of-care. The system will include: Robotic wearable sensors (Hardware): wearable technology for physiological monitoring (e.g., skin conductance, blood volume pressure and heart rate, activity) Digital platform (Software): a customized application that collects psychological assessments, psychological status, medication, subjective pain level and sleep quality. AI-based engine: advanced AI models take all the previous physical and psychological information and model it to provide an outline of what is the nature of the pain level of the subject.

The main aim is to determine how robust the Earswitch is in detecting voluntary eardrum movements (known as ear rumbling) and see how well the Earswitch fits with other assistive technology. To do this, participants will be asked to wear the Earswitch device and voluntarily contract their TT to complete a series of tasks shown on screen and/or explained audibly. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires to understand their opinions about the effectiveness, usability, and comfort of both their current device (if applicable) and the Earswitch.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe overall aim of this study is to evaluate the robustness of the Earswitch technology (hardware and software) in detecting voluntary eardrum movements in people with assistive needs. This is a key step to ensure a robust design informed by patients' needs. A secondary aim is to gather information from assistive device users about how well they can perform voluntary eardrum movements, as this knowledge will be used to inform what types of interfaces are appropriate for the Earswitch. Healthy participants will also be recruited as a separate cohort, to maximise the amount of data collected which can be used to validate and inform future designs. The methodology will be the same across both cohorts with the same equipment (Earswitch, second screen, and laptop) being used, however the healthy participants will not be able to answer all questions in PART 1. Healthy participants will be invited into a University lab to undertake the study, whereas participants with assistive technology needs will be given the option of a home visit. As the same equipment will be used, only the environment (i.e., home vs lab) will change which is not anticipate to affect the study data. At the start of the study a signal will be agreed with the participant (and carer when required) so that the participant can inform their carer and/or the experimenter if they wish to stop the study for any reason. The proposed study will take place in a single session and includes four main parts: PART 1 - Co-design Questionnaires. The specific aims for this part are to collect data on what assistive technologies people use and gain feedback on current switch technology to better understand how the Earswitch can be integrated in conjunction with other switch technology. The participants will be asked questions to understand the type of assistive technology (hardware and software) they currently use. This will include their opinions about the effectiveness, usability, and comfort of their current device, measured using the previously validated QUEST2 questionnaire. This process should not take more than 15 minutes, and will be carried out by the researcher, with the support of a carer where necessary. PART 2 - Earswitch insertion. Following this, the participant, with the help of the experimenter or the carer, will select an earbud size which will be inserted into the participant's ear. The participant will then be asked if it is comfortable or whether they would like to try a different size according to the comfort or fit of the earbud. Once the participant is happy with the size of the earbud, the experiment or the carer will install the Earswitch device, which involves putting a small camera into the participant's ear canal and positioning it so that it can see their eardrum. During this procedure, the participant will be asked to let the experimenter or carer know if it is uncomfortable or if they wish to stop. This should be no different to putting a regular ear bud into the participant's ear. Once this is complete, the participant will be asked some questions about the comfort of the device, and how easy they felt the installation process was. Once the Earswitch has been inserted, the experimenter will take a measurement of how far the otoscope is inserted into the ear, by using a ruler to measure the extruding element (with which the depth of the otoscope can be calculated). In addition, the experimenter will take a close-up picture of the Earswitch sitting in the concha to provide visual evidence of the fit (i.e., how the silicone earbud sits in the concha) and to identify any potential pressure points (e.g., on the tragus) that may help explain the device comfort. PART 3 - Ear rumbling test. Next, some videos will be recorded by the Earswitch device of the participant's ear drum while they contract the tensor tympani muscle voluntarily in response to several tasks. The tasks will ask the participant to voluntarily contract the TT muscle in response to different stimuli when requested. These stimuli will be presented to the participant either visually on a screen, audibly through some speakers, or both depending on their sight and hearing. The purpose of this is to see how well the participant can voluntarily contract their TT muscle on demand, and to see how well the Earswitch can recognise this. The tasks will involve the participant contracting their TT muscle voluntarily in response to a presented stimulus, twice in a row, multiple times in a row, and they will be asked to hold the muscle contraction for certain periods of time (1 second, 2 seconds, as long as possible). In addition, the participant's eardrum will be recorded when they perform everyday tasks to make sure that",

        "summary": "Rationale: Osteoarthritis (OA) is mainly characterized by cartilage degeneration. In knee OA, measuring the distance between the tibia and femur, known as the joint space width (JSW), is an often-used method to quantify the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatments, because it is an indirect measure of cartilage degeneration. However, JSW is often measured while the patient is standing (weight-bearing) with slightly flexed knees, with a flexion angle of around 7-10 degrees, while direct cartilage thickness measurements are usually performed while the patient is lying down (non-weight-bearing) with an extended leg [1]. Because of this difference in positioning, it is difficult to compare different JSW and cartilage thickness measures, as it is not clear what happens with the JSW distribution in the joint when a patient changes position between weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension. In this study, we aim to identify the changes that occur in the knee of OA patients under the influence of weight-bearing and/or flexion, to enable comparing joint space measures from different positions. In this research we want to use MRI as a three-dimensional imaging technique because there is no radiation involved..\nObjective: To evaluate how the 3D knee joint space distribution in knee OA patients changes under the influence of weight-bearing (upright) and flexion MRI scanning.\nStudy design: Explorative cross-sectional study. Study population: 21 patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (Kellgren-Lawrence grade 2 or 3) are included from the orthopaedics department of Medisch Spectrum Twente in Enschede.\nMain study parameters/endpoints: The primary study parameter is the change in medial joint space width between the different positions (weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension).",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nOsteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease that affects the knee joint. The knee joint is a complex structure that is composed of three compartments: the medial compartment, the lateral compartment and the patellofemoral compartment. OA is characterized by the loss of joint space, which is the space between the bones in the joint. The loss of joint space is a hallmark of OA and is associated with pain and disability.\nThe current gold standard for the diagnosis of OA is the X-ray. However, the X-ray is a two-dimensional image that only provides information about the joint space in a single plane. This can lead to inaccurate diagnosis and treatment.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a three-dimensional imaging technique that can provide detailed information about the joint space in all planes. MRI can also provide information about the cartilage, bone and other structures in the knee joint.\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the importance of weight-bearing and flexion in the evaluation of the joint space in patients with knee OA. The investigators will perform MRI scans of the knee joint in four different positions: weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing with flexed and extended knee. The investigators will measure the joint space width in each position and compare the results.\nThe investigators hypothesize that the joint space width will be different in the four scan positions and that the weight-bearing and flexion positions will provide more accurate information about the joint space in patients with knee OA.

        "summary": "Aspiration pneumonia due to dysphagia is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD). Dysphagia intervention in the United States involves evaluation at onset of dysphagia symptoms followed by short-term therapy. Traditional therapy relies on verbal instruction and low-tech at-home exercise regimens without visual biofeedback; lacking a monitoring of accuracy or strength of exercise. Available biofeedback is office-based, bulky and expensive, thus, not readily used. The Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) is a well-researched office based biofeedback system that has recently been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application. This study aims to investigate the impact of swallowing therapy using the BiSSKit app on airway protective outcomes in patients with PD. Thirty participants with PD and dysphagia will be recruited for this study. Participants will undergo a baseline-modified barium swallowing (MBS) evaluation followed by 12 weekly sessions of swallowing therapy. Participants will be randomized to two swallowing therapy groups (1) traditional (2) BiSSKit app. Participants will undergo MBS following therapy completion. Outcome measures include swallowing safety, pharyngeal kinematics, and swallowing-related quality of life. We hypothesize that use of the BiSSKit will result in improved swallowing function compared to the traditional swallowing therapy group.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nDysphagia, or disordered swallowing, is prevalent in almost all neurodegenerative conditions and results in the inability to effectively protect the lower airways from foreign (i.e., food/liquid) and endogenous (i.e., saliva) material [1-3]. An unfortunate consequence of dysphagia is aspiration pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD) [4-6]. Swallowing therapy has proven to be effective for the management of dysphagic symptoms in PD. Treatment is most often delivered in clinics once/week over short time periods with the expectation that exercises be completed at-home. However, these paradigms lack biofeedback to assess the accuracy and strength of the prescribed exercise and accountability to ensure completion of the exercise program. Without biofeedback or options for long-term therapeutic intervention at-home, patients often regress to baseline levels [7-9]. The proposed research project seeks to test the effectiveness of a novel at-home surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback therapy tool called Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) on swallowing safety and efficiency in patients with PD. The significance of this project lies in the fact that dysphagia is expensive in terms of patient quality of life, health outcomes, and healthcare costs [10, 11] often increasing hospital costs by approximately 40% [12]. Thus, a targeted swallowing therapy system with biofeedback that can be utilized at-home may reduce hospitalizations secondary to dysphagia, help maintain therapeutic gains, and reduce the burden that dysphagia places on our healthcare system. sEMG is a therapy tool that has been used in rehabilitation practice for decades. Use of sEMG during swallowing therapy involves placement of electrodes under the chin (overlying the anterior belly of the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles) [13]. While the patient completes a swallowing task, electrodes detect collective muscle contractions associated with hyolaryngeal excursion - a biomechanical event critically important to airway safety and swallowing efficiency [14]. The patient can then see the waveform of the swallow displayed on a computer monitor. Measures of swallowing strength are derived from the amplitude of the waveform. sEMG hardware and associated software available in the marketplace today is cost prohibitive and thus, in the United States, only available for office-based swallowing intervention. sEMG provides external biofeedback regarding swallowing parameters by activating neural networks controlling both motor execution and imagery of the act of swallowing including the pre- and postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, insula, and cerebellum [15]. Research has shown that exercise programs incorporating biofeedback promote significant physiologic change that is maintained over time in patients with dysphagia [14, 16-18]. Patients with PD benefit greatly from biofeedback exercises for respiratory muscle strength and lingual strengthening programs and have even been found to maintain the gains made in therapy with at-home programs [7, 16, 19]. A limitation of the currently available sEMG programs is that research studies have solely focus on the strength aspects of the swallowing (amplitude of the waveform) while failing to address the dynamic, skill-based parameters such as timing and volitional initiation that is captured in waveform morphology. Skill based swallowing training focuses on the precision of movements; and this is especially important for patients with PD [14]. Additionally, traditional sEMG systems in the US lack the ability for clinicians to modulate swallowing targets during tasks, which, according to principles of neuroplasticity, is essential for maximizing therapeutic results. The BiSSKit program is a well-researched office-based biofeedback system that adheres to principles of neuroplasticity and incorporates skill training in addition to strength training [14]. Developed in New Zealand and recently approved by the US FDA, this program has been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application for tablet computers. This hybrid BiSSKiT system incorporates clinical visits and home-based skill/strength training and shows promise to change current therapy delivery models. Although exciting, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of the BiSSKiT with daily home therapy focused on strength and skill based swallowing training on changes to swallowing safety and efficiency in people with PD.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe use of cognitive functions such as memory is essential for the execution of daily activities and represents a crucial element for autonomy maintenance during aging. It is known that the physiological cognitive decline associated with aging also involves memory and can significantly impact the older person's independence. For these reasons, great interest has been generated by two tools that have proved to be decisive in supporting memory functions: non-invasive neurostimulation and memory training. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation that modulates brain activity by employing a direct current delivered through electrodes applied to the scalp. Recently, the use of tDCS has been combined with training interventions focused on working memory in healthy older adults, providing evidence of a significant improvement in memory function when memory training is associated with the use of tDCS compared to when it is performed without it. In particular, adaptive memory trainings coupled with stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex provide benefits that last also at follow-up visits after 1 or 3 months, especially in participants who exhibit a lower baseline performance. While it was observed that adaptive working memory training alone is unable to modulate brain plasticity mechanisms, it was hypothesized that tDCS can modulate brain plasticity by acting through long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms and that it can modulate brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that plays a relevant role in LTP. Several adaptive memory trainings focused on working memory, which is essential for decision-making processes and daily activities. Even if promising results have been shown so far, it appears that no study addressed the implementation of strategic memory training coupled with the use of tDCS. Adaptive memory trainings allow improving the performance in each task by gradually increasing its difficulty, without however resorting to teaching a strategy. Strategic memory trainings permit not only to improve participants' performance in the practiced task but also to generalize the use of memory strategies to new tasks. Intending to prevent cognitive impairment, using these intervention methods in healthy aging and the prodromal phases can be useful. To this end, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) indeed represents an intermediate state between normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (nMCD) and may predict the development of objective cognitive decline. In this frame, the primary goal of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to assess whether the application of transcranial direct current stimulation during strategic memory training (on-line neurostimulation) enhances the effect of strategic memory training. The follow-up visits allow for investigating whether eventual improvements are preserved over time and if this combined intervention affects the evolution of cognitive decline. The treatment protocol consists of 5 sessions (2/3 session/week, 1 hour/day) of strategic memory training combined with on-line tDCS (anodic tDCS, 2mA for 20 minutes, versus sham tDCS, applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - DLPFC). Healthy old participants will be recruited from the general population. Participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are recruited from Neuropsychology/Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Unit and Neurorehabilitation Unit of IRCCS Mondino Foundation. The diagnosis of SCD is formulated based on a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation (baseline cognitive assessment - T0) according to the guidelines presented in the literature. At T0, the following standardized tests are used: Global cognitive function is assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); Cognitive reserve is assessed using Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq); Mood is assessed using Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). At T0, practiced and not practiced memory tasks (Bottiroli et al., 2013) will be administered to the participants as pre-tests: Associative learning; List learning; Name-face learning; Place learning; Text learning; Grocery learning; Participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria are enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental group (strategic memory training + ACTIVE tDCS) or control group (strategic memory training + SHAM tDCS).",

        "summary": "Heart failure (HF) is increasingly common and associated with excess morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs. New medications are now available which can alter the disease trajectory and reduce clinical events. However, many cases of HF remain undetected until presentation with more advanced symptoms, often requiring hospitalisation. Earlier identification and treatment of HF could reduce downstream healthcare impact, but predicting HF incidence is challenging due to the complexity and varying course of HF. The investigators will use routinely collected hospital-linked primary care data and focus on the use of artificial intelligence methods to develop and validate a prediction model for incident HF. Using clinical factors readily accessible in primary care, the investigators will provide a method for the identification of individuals in the community who are at risk of HF, as well as when incident HF will occur in those at risk, thus accelerating research assessing technologies for the improvement of risk prediction, and the targeting of high-risk individuals for preventive measures and screening.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis, with millions of people infected and thousands of deaths. The rapid spread of the virus has highlighted the need for effective and efficient diagnostic tools to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Point-of-care tests to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection have the potential to allow earlier detection and isolation of confirmed cases compared to PCR-based diagnostic methods performed in centralized laboratories, with the aim of cost-effective reduction of transmission. In theory, sufficiently sensitive and specific point-of-care format tests could be implemented at PoE and used to screen low-prevalence populations effectively. In particular, rapid COVID-19 antigen tests in a lateral flow format COVID antigen RDTs or AgRDTs can play a key role in accelerating access to testing and improving turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. COVID antigen RDTs detect specific proteins known as antigens on the surface of the virus and can identify people who are at the peak of infection when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. A number of AgRDTs are now available, some of which have received emergency use authorizations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and/or the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These tests have the potential to detect an active infection with performance that is close to that of PCR in specific settings. However, the performance of COVID antigen RDTs outside of highly controlled settings is not well defined,particularly in low-prevalence groups of asymptomatic people (Bryan et al., 2020; Lassauni\u00e8re et al., 2020 Linares et al., 2020; Porte et al., 2020). Antigen tests with rapid turnaround times and minimal user skill have been recently approved for emergency use listing (EUL) by the WHO. Performance data show sensitivity and specificity levels (at least 80% and 97%, respectively) sufficient for diagnostic purposes of SARS-CoV-2 in targeted individuals, but their role in population-based screening remains to be established. In this evaluation, performance characteristics of rapid SARS-COV-2 detection kits (including but not limited to the Standard Q COVID-19 Antigen Test Standard Q RDT and the Panbio\u2122 COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Panbio RDT, will be assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and their overall agreement with standard nucleic acid testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.

The optimal selection of the potency and duration of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in HBR patients is still a matter of debate. Multiple strategies to reduce bleeding during secondary prevention, such as reducing the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, using single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor, or de-escalating to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor, have been proposed. De-escalation to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor is particularly attractive because it maintains efficient pharmacological inhibition of multiple platelet pathways while potentially reducing bleeding through less aggressive activity. Yet, there has been no study comparing the effects of different de-escalation strategies with the standard potent P2Y12 inhibitors in HBR patients. The aim of the DESC-HBR study is to assess the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid in HBR patients, in comparison with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors, on the proportion of patients with optimal platelet reactivity (OPR).

        "summary": "Atrial fibrillation is a cardiac arrhythmia most often originating in the left atrium, causing anarchic electrical activity and thus a loss of atrial contraction. This increases the risk of stroke through clot formation in the atrium, but also of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is a major cause of stroke, accounting for more than 25% of all strokes. In addition, a quarter of ischemic strokes remain without an obvious cause at the end of hospitalization, and it is recommended that atrial fibrillation be detected intensively with long-term heart rhythm recording. Implantable loop recorders can detect 30% of atrial fibrillation cases over the 3-year battery life of these devices, after a stroke of undetermined origin. However, these devices require a small operation to implant them under the skin, and they are expensive.\nThe hypothesis of this study is that MRI imaging of the left atrium would enable better selection of patients to receive an implantable loop recorder. MRI can quantify the proportion of the left atrium with scar tissue, which is likely to favour the onset of atrial fibrillation. If the results confirm this hypothesis, the number of patients requiring an implantable loop recorder could be reduced, and perhaps an anticoagulation strategy based on MRI data could be introduced.\nIn addition to the usual follow-up by cardiologists and neurologists, participation in this study involves a cardiac MRI (with contrast agent) within 3 months of the stroke.",

Hospital readmissions are an undesirable occurrence that can increase cost for hospitals, and can cause further negative outcomes for patients. Identifying factors that increase a patient's chances of being readmitted to the hospital, as well as developing an intervention to effectively reduce this risk, has historically been challenging.\nOur new method uses a combination of common features such as diagnosis and length of hospital stay, with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, the RecuR Score model developed by the University of Maryland Medical System, that identifies patients at the highest risk of having an unplanned hospital readmission. Participants identified as higher risk will then be enrolled into our pilot where they will be randomized to receive either the standard of care treatment or an enhanced protocol that includes additional disease education, coordination of home health services, and a focus on their readmission during existing multidisciplinary team huddles.\nThe main goal of this study is to reduce unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of initial discharge, in those most at risk of being readmitted, using the aforementioned novel methods for identifying these participants and a transitional care intervention. This success of this goal will be analyzed across different readmission risk levels in the study population. Secondary goals of this study include reducing unplanned hospital readmission within 90 days, reducing 30-day post-discharge mortality, and reducing 30- and 90-day emergency department (ED) usage after an initial hospitalization.",

Nasal congestion (i.e. reversible mucosal congestion/nasal mucosal obstruction) is one of the most general and bothersome symptoms in rhinitis and is associated with other medical conditions such as rhinosinusitis and otitis media. This study is relevant as in addition to the high global occurrence of AR, this disorder has substantial effects on the quality of life (QOL) (e.g. during sleep and work). AR is related to high direct medical costs (mainly prescription of medications and outpatient visits) and indirect economic costs (including productivity decrease).

        "summary": "A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when an artery supplying blood to the heart is suddenly blocked resulting in damage to the heart muscle.\nPatients presenting to hospital with a heart attack undergo an immediate angiogram (x-ray of the arteries in the heart) and are usually treated immediately with a balloon and stent to open their blocked artery. This procedure is called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (or primary PCI for short).\nAn angiogram is a routine procedure that involves insertion of fine plastic tube (catheter) into either the groin or wrist under local anaesthetic. The tube is passed into the artery in the heart and X-ray pictures are taken to find out if the arteries are blocked. Blocked arteries can usually be opened by passing a small balloon into the artery, via the fine plastic tube followed by placement of a stent (a fine metal coil) into the artery to prevent it from blocking again.\nAlthough this treatment is very successful, it can result in damage to the heart muscle when the artery is opened. Cooling the entire body has been shown to reduce heart muscle damage during heart attacks in some patients but not in others; however, it is uncomfortable due to the shivering, expensive and can result in delays in opening the blocked artery.\nThe investigators are conducting a series of research studies to find out if cooling the heart muscle directly through the catheter being used for the normal primary angioplasty treatment using room temperature may be effective in preserving heart muscle, without the shortcomings of entire body cooling.\nThe investigators have already published an initial series of ten cases in which this treatment appeared to be feasible without causing significant clinical problems.\nThe present study is a pilot study designed to assess the rate of patient recruitment and feasibility of this new treatment while exploring some detailed outcomes measuring the restoration of blood flow within the coronary artery at the end of the procedure.\nUltimately if the present pilot study is successful, the investigators plan to go on to undertake a much larger randomised outcome study to determine definitively whether this treatment can help reduce heart attack size.",

Women with a history of depression have a 20 fold higher risk of PDA at subsequent pregnancies. The adverse outcomes extend beyond maternal well-being to long-term deficits in children and families.

Specifically, the microbial composition of the gut along with their metabolites are directly involved in disease onset and course. Recent clinical studies have identified diet as the most powerful environmental factor in manipulating gut microbiome. Given vulnerability and resistance of pregnant women to pharmacotherapy, particularly in those with a predisposition to mood disorders, as well as pregnant women's high motivation and commitment to improving gestational diet, a dietary/supplemental intervention to 'optimize' gut microbiome, is a favored approach in disease management.

The investigators implement a peer-mediated intervention in inclusive preschool classrooms, randomly assigned to treatment (n=12) or control (n=13) conditions. A focal child is identified in each classroom, representing a child with LI (3 to 5 years of age) who exhibits the poorest pragmatic-language skills and highest level of social exclusion in the classroom. Over a 12-week period, the focal children will receive peer-mediated intervention from identified peers, who use strategies to engage the focal child socially during center time, as supported by a classroom facilitator (teacher, aide). Outcomes of interest include the overarching classroom social network and its embedded socialization processes (e.g., frequency of child-to-child interaction), the focal child's interactions with peers and exposure to peer talk, and the focal child's social, behavioral, and linguistic skills. The study employs state-of-the-art social network analyses to represent the classroom network at the child, dyad, and network level and is dynamically modeled over the academic year using advanced location-tracking technologies and voice-activated recorders to capture incoming and outgoing peer talk for the focal child.

Theoretically, the investigators propose that improved socialization experiences in the preschool classroom can disrupt the social exclusion and peer maltreatment experienced by children with LI, leading to accelerated growth in linguistic, social, and behavioral outcomes for children with LI.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a peer-mediated intervention on the social and linguistic outcomes of children with language impairment (LI) in inclusive preschool classrooms. The investigators propose that improved socialization experiences in the preschool classroom for focal children can disrupt the social exclusion, leading to accelerated growth in linguistic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The investigators will use a randomized controlled trial to estimate treatment impacts of a peer-mediated intervention, with 12 classrooms assigned to the treatment condition and 13 to the control condition. Within each classroom, the focal participants are children isolated from their classroom social network with low pragmatic language skills. One target child is selected per classroom using a priori exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. In the fall of each year, simple random assignment is used to allocate classrooms to the treatment group and to the control group. First, investigators identify all children's positions within the classroom social network using a teacher matrix conducted in fall of the academic year; from this network a child-level social network index is calculated (i.e., individual degree centrality; lower scores are characteristic of social exclusion). Second, teachers simultaneously complete the Developmental Pragmatic Profile (DPP) for each child in the classroom. Finally, among the participating focal children, investigators select the target child based on the lowest centrality scored weighted by DPP score, so that focal children represent the most socially isolated children with the poorest social-pragmatic communication skills. Children and teachers participate for a 9-month period, and the primary approach to treatment for focal children is described here. Specifically, focal children in classrooms randomized to the treatment condition receive peer-mediated pivotal response training (PRT) per procedures detailed by Brock et al.. PRT procedures are facilitated by a classroom teacher or teaching assistant-who receives ongoing training and support from research staff. First, investigators provide a one-on-one 1-h training session for each facilitator that focuses on how to identify, initially train, and then support peers on a day-to-day basis during center time. Second, investigators partner with the facilitator to identify two peers who (a) demonstrate good social skills; (b) respond well to adult directions; (c) have consistent attendance; and (d) do not have a history of negative interactions with the target student. The facilitator explicitly identifies the focal child (buddy) and asks the children to use three strategies to play with the buddy during center time: (a) offer your buddy some play options; (b) show and talk about how to play with your buddy; (c) compliment your buddy; and (d) show your buddy how to take turns. At each training session the facilitator will describe one strategy, provide examples, and practice the strategy through role play. After trainings, the facilitator provides ongoing support during center time to implement the strategies over 12 weeks during months 3-6 of the 9 months of study participation. The investigators propose that improved socialization experiences in the preschool classroom for focal children can disrupt the social exclusion, leading to accelerated growth in linguistic, social, and behavioral outcomes.",

Approximately 3 months after finishing the physical therapy program, participants will undergo a final evaluation to see if the treatment effects have been maintained.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease process that disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses, resulting in a range of neurological signs and symptoms. Walking-related impairment is one of the most common symptoms, reported to affect more than 90% of people with MS. The leading non-pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is rehabilitation, such as physical therapy. Rehabilitation is believed to restore function through experience-dependent neuroplasticity. There is strong evidence that physical therapy can improve mobility-related function in people with MS, and emerging evidence that motor-relearning approaches to rehabilitation may be associated with changes in brain structure and function that correlate with improvements in functional performance. The leading pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is dalfampridine. Dalfampridine improves motor function by increasing nerve conduction through demyelinated axons, however, dalfampridine alone is not likely to generate neuroplastic changes needed for lasting benefits, because neural plasticity requires salient and task-specific practice with high repetition at adequate intensity, as well as complex environments that stimulate opportunities for movement to facilitate synthesis of neurotrophic factors. Indeed, the treatment effects of dalfampridine are reversed as soon as the treatment was discontinued. However, it is possible that improved nerve conduction velocity provided by dalfampridine may accelerate neuroplasticity generated from rehabilitation. Yet, combining dalfampridine with concurrent rehabilitation has never been studied. The objective of the proposed study is to test our central hypothesis that providing a motor-relearning physical therapy intervention in combination with dalfampridine will produce superior gains to either intervention alone in mobility through augmented neuroplasticity. Aim 1 will determine if dalfampridine can augment the effects of physical therapy in restoring function in people with MS by comparing the combined intervention to physical therapy without dalfampridine. Aim 2 will explore the comparative effectiveness between the combined intervention with dalfampridine alone, and between physical therapy alone and dalfampridine alone. In Aim 3, the investigators will investigate mechanisms of treatment effects by evaluating functional connectivity before and after each intervention arm. Exploratory Aim 4 will examine whether there are specific clinical and personal factors associated with treatment responsiveness to each type of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome will be percent change from baseline in Timed 25-Foot Walk to enable direct comparison to previous dalfampridine studies. A range of secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes, both objective and self-reported, will examine restoration of function (objective and perceived) beyond just walking speed. The investigators will enroll 48 participants with MS-related mobility deficits and EDSS \u22646.5. In the first treatment phase, all participants will receive 6 weeks of dalfampridine treatment to assess the effects of this treatment and determine individual responder status for stratified randomization in phase 2. Following 2-week dalfampridine washout and new off-drug baseline assessment, stratified randomization will allocate participants to either 6 weeks of physical therapy with resumed dalfampridine or 6 weeks of physical therapy without dalfampridine. Outcomes will be reassessed after the physical therapy treatment phase. This project tests a novel combination of two traditional interventions to improve mobility in people with MS, with specific aims that investigate both restoration of function and mechanisms of treatment effects using brain imaging outcomes. These two leading, yet distinct approaches for improving mobility in people with MS, may have complementary mechanisms of action leading to enhanced outcomes when combined. The findings generated by this research will inform the design of further studies exploring longer-term outcomes and disease progression trajectories associated with the interventions found to be most effective and tolerable for individuals with MS in this stage of the research.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nPrimary dysmenorrhea is a Greek term which means difficult flow and the term describe painful periods. The pain is usually felt in the lower abdomen but sometimes it may radiate in thighs and to the back. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common type of gynecological disorder among females worldwide. Some females may feel some associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting diarrhea, headache, dizziness and in severe conditions syncope. All of these symptoms occur usually in females with normal pelvic anatomy and symptoms occur just before menses. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs 6-12 months after the onset of ovulation cycle. Primary dysmenorrhea can be distinguished from secondary dysmenorrhea on the basis of symptoms and other pelvic or reproductive organ disorders. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, in secondary dysmenorrhea pain starts few days before the onset of menstrual cycles and may last longer than the cycle. The chances of secondary dysmenorrhea are more prevalent in females above the age of 20. A complete pelvic examination should be performed in females who are sexually active and have dysmenorrhea and those who are suspected to have endometriosis. In general population the prevalence of Primary dysmenorrhea is about 47-80%. Seventy five to eighty five percent of female have said to report that the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea are mild. Primary dysmenorrhea is not life threatening and does not cause any disabilities but some researches have said that most young girls are reported to be absent from school/college and not being able to perform any activity due to the severity of pain. Some evidence shows the link between dysmenorrhea and prostaglandin, the level of prostaglandin is said to be increased and leads to uterine contraction and ischemia. The release of prostaglandin leads to excessive uterine contraction and the constriction of small endometrial blood vessels leads to ischemia and thus pain. The level of prostaglandin is said to be increased during premenstrual phase in which progesterone level decreases and the level of prostaglandin increases in endometrial cells by the action of membrane phospholipids. The action of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors plays an important role in pain relief. Another interesting factor shows the link between physical activity and dysmenorrhea. Females who perform physical activities like exercise for the purpose of developing or maintaining fitness have reported to be going through less pain and behavioral changes. Physical activities and exercises are believed to have reduced the level of stress and stress related symptoms. When we do exercise endorphins hormones are released from brain which increases the pain threshold and have said to improve the mood of the person performing exercise. It has also been observed that performing isometric exercises for 8 weeks has reduced the intensity and duration of pain but has no effects on the amount of bleeding. Performing stretching exercises for 8 weeks has also reduced the severity and length of pain in young girls and they have reported to be taking less medicine. The purpose of this research is to provide the information that which exercises i-e stretching or strengthening are more effective in reducing the intensity, frequency, duration and severity of pain in primary dysmenorrhea.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe risk associated with arterial hypotension during general anesthesia for surgery or interventional procedure has been demonstrated, but the threshold at which consequences for perfusion of one or more organs appear varies according to the mechanism of hypotension, associated abnormalities (Heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen transport), and the patient's terrain. Currently, a mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mm Hg and a reduction of less than 30-50% from the value measured before general anesthesia are commonly used treatment thresholds to ensure good perfusion of all organs. These values are based on large cohort studies that associate these blood pressure thresholds with the occurrence of postoperative complications or during the resuscitation stay. They cannot be generalized to certain subpopulations that are underrepresented, such as women and elderly patients. Normally, cerebral blood flow is self-regulated, which allows cerebral blood flow to adapt to oxygen requirements and to different levels of high and low blood pressure. However, this protective mechanism may fail for a degree of hypotension that depends on several factors such as the age or vascular health of the patient. For example, in patients with preexisting hypertension, the autoregulatory capacity of the brain is likely impaired making organs more susceptible to ischemia at low blood pressure. Thus, current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines in the setting of noncardiac surgery recommend individualizing care for patients with associated cardiovascular comorbidities. Arterial stiffness is currently one of the best independent, early biomarkers predictive of cardiovascular complications and cardiovascular comorbidity. Assessment of arterial stiffness is currently performed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement. Therefore, higher blood pressure goals tailored to the physiology of each patient may be preferable for these high-risk patients. Because there is individual variability in cerebral autoregulation, a strategy based on a one-size-fits-all recommended blood pressure (BP) value is nonsense. What is the tolerable target BP level for a patient under general anesthesia? Is there a simple and non-invasive way to measure the level of cerebral blood flow autoregulation and, more importantly, adequacy to the brain's oxygen requirements? The aim of the study is to measure non-invasively, easily and reliably the variations of cerebral perfusion in patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors during controlled variations performed during routine care to adjust the blood pressure level within the recommended safety standards during general anesthesia. The setting of the optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) level will be achieved within the ranges of values commonly used, taking into account the patient's cardiovascular comorbidities. In particular, the lower limit of MAP of 60 mmHg for patients without cardiovascular risk factors and 80 mmHg for patients with risk factors should never be exceeded, in accordance with current French and international recommendations. The main objective is to identify a significant linear relationship between the percentage change in mean velocity (Vm) and the percentage change in the 95% spectral frequency front (SEF95) during the MAP change. Cerebral perfusion and cerebral O2 adequacy will be compared and assessed by continuous and simultaneous measurements of cerebral blood flow by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral O2 adequacy by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a brain function parameter by intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) - frontal EEG. The classification of patients in the cardiovascular risk group will be determined in addition to their history and treatment by an arterial stiffness parameter (pulse wave velocity) measured non-invasively before and during the protocol by MESI mTablet automatic digital sphygmomanometer (MESI ltd, Slovenia). The objective for a given patient is to look for a possible threshold value of pressure that could impact the blood flow velocity (Doppler) and possibly the EEG and cerebral oximetry. This clinical research work is performed on adult patients undergoing scheduled surgery at Lariboisi\u00e8re Hospital under general anesthesia. All measurements are obtained non-invasively. The monitoring routinely includes continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring by non-invasive means (Clearsight\u00ae, EV1000\u00ae, Edwards Sciences) in anesthesia pulsed O2 saturation (Sp",

        "summary": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive lung cancer subtypes, accounting for approximately 15-20% of total lung cancer cases. Although SCLC is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy, it is highly susceptible to recurrence. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the clinical practice of oncology, and the newly released results of the ASTRUM-005 study have led to the incorporation of Serplulimab into the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. Although immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is currently the most promising regimen, due to the limited understanding of genetic alterations and the marked genetic heterogeneity of SCLC, treatment responsiveness varies greatly. Thus, there is an urgent need to find molecular biomarkers that can effectively predict prognosis and further suggest the effectiveness of this new treatment mode.\nMinimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of tumor cells disseminated from the primary lesion to distant organs in patients who lack any clinical or radiological signs of metastasis or residual tumor cells left behind after local therapy that eventually lead to local recurrence. These years, the development of real-time, high-sensitivity liquid biopsy assays have enabled the identification of MRD in individual patients with cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that detection of MRD dynamics following definitive therapy for solid cancers is strongly prognostic and has extremely high positive predictive value for risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the predictive value of MRD dynamics on disease prognosis before and after the first-line treatment of Serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC.",

        "summary": "Every year in France, 60,000 children are born prematurely (before 37 weeks of amenorrhea), and present an immaturity of their various systems, in particular the digestive system. This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.\nIn the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.\nDevelopmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed. It is therefore essential to properly assess the digestive status of premature babies in order to determine whether they have feeding intolerance and whether they require treatment with abdominal massage.\nTo date, the investigators have not found measurable criteria or existing scales that can describe the digestive status of newborns.

        "summary": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective approach for treating both benign and malignant blood disorders. It primarily involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate tumor cells within the patient's body, as well as to suppress the recipient's hematopoiesis and immune function. The transplantation replaces the recipient's original hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with donor-derived HSCs, thereby reconstructing the donor's hematopoietic and immune functions to achieve disease cure.\nPoor graft function (PGF) following transplantation, which refers to inadequate engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells, is one of the major factors limiting the effectiveness of allo-HSCT. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), identified within the bone marrow stroma, are a type of non-hematopoietic multipotent stem cells. Several studies, including previous research by our research team, suggest that MSCs can improve the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment by secreting various cytokines. This leads to the promotion of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of hematopoietic function, and support for hematopoiesis as well as direct or indirect promotion of vascular regeneration in damaged tissues and organs.\nTherefore, exploring the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in treating poor graft function after allo-HSCT, observing the recovery of blood parameters in patients with poor engraftment, monitoring transplantation-related complications and immune reconstitution, and conducting preliminary investigations into the underlying mechanisms can contribute to the exploration of new clinical techniques for the treatment of PGF following allo-HSCT.",

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nParkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, usually results in physical deterioration, as well as a spectrum of psychosocial sequels that could bring various challenges on one's daily lives. Patients experience common motor symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, in parallel with psychosocial stressors (i.e., non- motor symptoms NMS), such as sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal symptoms, dopaminergic drug-induced behaviors (e.g., hallucination, impulse control issues) and mood disturbance (e.g., depression, anxiety). While 21% of individuals struggling with the disease reported at least one of these psychosocial symptoms within the initial stage of the disease, they are generally at risk for increased emotional distress, cognitive declines, and elevated stress hormone (cortisol) levels. Both motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease could affect the quality of life of individuals and that of their caregivers. A cross-sectional study conducted by our research team has explored the symptom burden and support care needs in people with PD across East and Southern Asia (n=186), revealing significant unmet needs among Hong Kong PD patients regarding their psychosocial-spiritual concerns. In particular, they experience significant, moderate palliative care needs at the early to middle course of the illness. The extent of unmet support care needs among patients with mild to moderate PD is as great as that among patients with other chronic health conditions, such as advanced cancer, late-stage lung cancer, stage 4/5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and late stage chronic kidney disease. The visible and unpredictable symptoms of a distorted body (e.g., tremor and gait dysfunction) and the suppressed expressions due to having a masked face, reduced voice and slurred speech often results in difficulty seeking help and stigmatization of the disease. Despite the tremendous influences and common occurrence of NMS, they are surprisingly under- recognized in clinical practice because of the lack of spontaneous verbal complaints by the patients, as well as the lack of systematic questioning by healthcare professionals. A qualitative exploration of the illness experience of local PD patients highlighted the importance and urgent need for holistic PD interventions that emphasizes on early identification and preventive measures of individual who are at risk for PD patients, alleviation of the effects of the psychological sequels to PD patients, as well as the reduction of stigma and promotion of community support towards PD. The study adopts a 2-arm randomized controlled design, aiming to investigate the effectiveness of two mind-body interventions - yoga, and arts-based approaches in improving the psycho-social-spiritual well-being among PD patients.",

The investigators have identified a significant tumor burden in non-enhancing (NE) regions beyond the contrast-enhancing (CE) portion of tumor. Furthermore, the investigators have adapted a pH-sensitive technique called amine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI to identify tumor cells in NE regions with high sensitivity and specificity. This study is a randomized trial of CEST based resections versus standard of care in newly diagnosed glioblastoma with primary endpoint of progression free survival and secondary endpoints of overall survival and quality of life metrics. The hypothesis being tested is whether surgical resection of infiltrating tumor cells visualized by CEST MRI contributes to survival in glioblastoma patients.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe investigators have previously addressed the difficulty in identifying tumor in non-enhancing (NE) T2 hyperintense regions surrounding the contrast-enhancing bulk of tumor. The investigators have applied pH sensitive amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echo planar imaging (CEST-EPI) to patients with glioblastoma. CEST imaging can utilize detection of fast-exchanging amine protons to obtain an imaging contrast that is dependent on tissue acidity. Bulk water protons undergo chemical exchange with amine protons. CEST imaging detects the attenuation of bulk water magnetization following a saturation pulse, which can vary by concentration of amine protons. This contrast can be quantitated as the asymmetry in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTRasym) relative to water proton resonance frequency. Tumor cells are known to produce elevated levels of extracellular hydrogen, given 1) a higher metabolic rate secondary to increased cell turnover and 2) an affinity for anaerobic glycolysis - the Warburg Effect. The investigators have shown active tumor burden and active replication occurring in infiltrating glioblastoma cells. and thus leveraged CEST imaging to visualize infiltrating tumor cells. 19 In newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, higher median MTRasym at 3ppm within CEST+ NE regions p=0.007; p=0.0326] and higher volumes of CEST+ NE tumor [p=0.020; p<0.001] were associated with decreased PFS. Prospective MRI guided biopsies of CEST+ NE regions showed a correlation with presence of cell density and %Ki-67 positivity [p<0.001, p<0.001]. Furthermore, using pathological diagnosis as the gold standard, the investigators saw a threshold of MTRasym > 1.50% as able to identify tumor cells with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 71.4%. In unpublished data with additional samples only from newly diagnosed WHO IV glioblastoma, the calculated sensitivity and specificity was 100% when using neuro-pathological review as the gold standard. Additionally, when using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) detection of tumor cells via copy number variation analysis as the gold standard, from 17 biopsies in CEST+ NE regions, the same threshold of 1.50% identified tumor cells with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100%. Given the strong correlation between tumor cells and CEST+ NE regions, the investigators have preliminary conducted CEST+ NE resections on 5 patients with newly diagnosed WHO IV glioblastoma. In this preliminary data, the investigators found no significant post-operative complications with the larger resections. All patients received standard of care adjuvant therapy (temozolomide + radiotherapy) and none of the patients have experienced progression (median PFS 13 months). With this data, the investigators hypothesize that maximal safe resection of CEST+ NE regions will minimize the post-surgical tumor cell burden and allow for increased survival. Experimental Approach. The investigators will carry out a prospective, randomized controlled trial of surgical resection of glioblastoma with pH sensitive amine CEST-EPI. Patients will be enrolled by me at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. The UCLA department of neurosurgery brain tumor program is a high-volume neuro-oncology center.

During playful interactions, two individuals continuously co-create an imaginary world together, such as playing roles in an imaginary scene or co-creating synchronized movements together. Playful interactions are characterized by an enhanced sense of flow and joy and have been associated with physical and psychological well-being across the lifespan. This research team and others have shown that playful interactions are particularly beneficial for the older population, which are at higher risk of cognitive decline and social isolation. The overarching aim of this proposal is to conduct an in-depth investigation of the effects of playful interactions, in older population. Specifically the investigators will test the effect of short playful interaction on cognitive measures, as well as social and affective indices, and compare them to a non-playful interaction (such exercise class, or personal conversation).",

The investigators will examine changes in indices of mood, mental health, social functioning, cognition compared to an active control intervention. The investigators will examine the mediating role of personality traits and cognitive functions in connection to the beneficial effect of playful interactions in aging. The investigators hypnotized that playful interactions will induce greater effects on emotional and social indices, as well as on executive functioning, compared to more familiar social interactions. The investigators hypothesize that these effects will be found in older populations. The investigators hypothesize that the effects of short-term playful interaction tasks as compared to the matched social control condition will be preserved in the online format. Individuals' characteristics and personality traits will influence the effects of the interaction on the dependent variables. Participants 80 participants (up to 95, considering attrition). To detect a significant interaction between conditions and participant groups (ANOVA within-between interactions with repeated measures as a proxy for MLM, with 4 groups, and 6 types of repeated measures), assuming a medium-small effect size (f2 = .20), and a conservative estimate of correlation (r = .33), a sample size of at least 18 in each arm group is required to achieve a power of 0.90, using GPower. The investigators will recruit 20 participants per group expecting attrition. Procedure The study will take place in six sites including assisted living facilities, community centers and adults day centers in Israel. Participants will be invited by the research assistance to take part in the study. Participants who will be willing to take part in the study will meet with the research team and will read and signed an informed consent form before participating in the study. Following the informed consent signing, base line measures will be collected (traits and cognitive measures) (T0). Following base line assessment participants will be randomly assigned to four arms. At first, they will randomly assign to one of two conditions (online or face to face). The interactions will be separated in a week. A random half of the two conditions of participants (online and face to face) will be assigned to practice the playful interaction at the first week and control interaction in the second week, whereas for the other half this order will be reversed. One designated experiment assigned each participant randomly to one of the two interactions (playful or control), to keep the other experiments blind to the activity. For each participant, separate interactions will be conducted by a different experimenter. These are the four arms: Playful interactions operationalized by dramatic improvisation techniques based on verbal and non-verbal elements in face to face setting Playful interactions operationalized by dramatic improvisation techniques based on verbal and non-verbal elements in online setting An active control condition that involves introductory conversation and movement exercises in face to face setting in face to face setting An active control condition that involves introductory conversation and movement exercises in face to face setting in online setting The interventions will meet the following criteria: a) ease of implementation in an online system; b) a short interaction between 15-20 minutes. Both interactions incorporated bodily movement; however, the playful interaction encompassed elements of co-creation, spontaneity, and innovation, whereas the control interaction adhered to a more conventional and routine approach. The online interactions will take place using the ZOOM video conference software under laboratory conditions. All interactions will be guided by graduate students of the Theatre department at the university of Haifa or drama therapy students or theatre facilitator - the facilitators, who are unfamiliar to the participants. One designated experiment assigned each facilitator randomly to one of the two interactions (playful or control), to keep the other experiments blind to the activity. The facilitators will be randomly assigned to the different interactions, so that for each participants the separate interactions were conducted by a different facilitator. All interactions will be videoed recorded. A fidelity check will be done by the research team every week to make sure each participants was given the correct interaction (playful or control), and that each interaction included all phases in the protocol. Both interactions will commence with a battery of tests and self-reports before (T1) and after each session (T2). The battery of tests was conducted by an experimenter who will be blind to the type of intervention (playful or control).

However, there have been no other treatment modalities except for tumor treating fields (TTFields) that have brought survival benefits for ndGBM patients during the past two decades. Since TTFields therapy is super expensive (about 1 million yuan/0.15 million dollars per year) and fewer than 10% of ndGBM patients can afford it around the globe, the Stupp Protocol is still being used as the first-line and the most widely-adopted treatment option for ndGBM patients around the world. Elemene, a Chinese anti-tumor medicine extracted from the plant Curcuma Wenyujin, has been isolated as a monomeric drug and has a broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect in various cancers, such as lung cancer, breast carcinoma, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. In recent years, its application in GBMs as revealed in the preliminary retrospective studies published in Chinese Journals and a few English Journals have shown survival benefits with acceptable toxicity. Elemene can pass through the blood-brain barrier because of its small molecular weight and lipid solubility and has synergistic anti-tumor effects with TMZ and radiotherapy for GBM patients. Several in vitro studies also have shown that Elemene could inhibit GBM cell proliferation, promote cell differentiation, and induce cancer cell apoptosis. All these findings from the above studies have indicated the potential survival benefits of Elemene in treating ndGBMs. However, so far, no clinical trials have tested the efficacy and safety of the new treatment protocol (Elemene added to the Stupp Protocol) for ndGBMs compared with the conventional Stupp protocol.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe International Headache Society (IHS) reported that approximately 90% of headaches consist of tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine, which are the primary type of headache, and affect approximately 50% of the population. The incidence of headaches and migraines is to peak at the age of 20-50, and is more common in women than in men. Recurrent tension-type headaches and migraine attacks negatively affect the quality of life of individuals, reducing working capacity and participation in social and family activities. Therefore, tension-type headaches and migraines cause significant social exclusion, loss of workforce and economic burden. TTH and migraine impede personal care, productivity and leisure activities, which are an integral part of individuals' lives due to symptoms such as pain, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and/or dizziness. Participation in purposeful activities for individuals is an essential component of health and well-being. Activity self-efficacy is a definition that includes the sense of personal competence and satisfaction about the activities women engage in. When individuals engage in work, play, and daily life activities, women sustain, reinforce, shape, and modify women's capacities, beliefs, and tendencies. High self-efficacy perception can affect the sustainability of physical activity and the productivity of individuals. Both TTH and Migraine tend to occur during the most productive and high-capacity phase of life, between ages 25-55, affecting muscle groups used in daily life activities, potentially leading to limitations in participation, coping, and self-management skills among women. In this regard, it is important to study how tension-type headaches and migraines, which have significant social and individual effects, alter the self-sufficiency and perception of activity in women. Constant thinking of pain and avoiding physical activity can reveal dysfunction in individuals. Because of the individual-specific and complex structure of human roles, each individual suffering from a headache faces different limitations in fulfilling daily roles and social participation, depending on lifestyle and preferences. Thus, non-pharmacological treatments (physiotherapy practices, lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, body awareness therapy) are recommended for women with TTH and migraine complaints to relax various muscle groups. One of these treatments is progressive relaxation training. PRT is defined as a method of voluntary, regular relaxation of large muscle groups in the human body with relaxation throughout the body. Specifically, applying PRT to muscle groups found in hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest, abdomen, hips, feet, and fingers, which are most frequently utilized in daily life activities, enhances its benefits for individuals. In the literature, various studies reported that PRT improved occupational performance, participation in daily life activities and quality of life in addition to pain management in individuals with various chronic pains. According to the knowledge, there exists no study in the literature comparing the beneficial effects that PRT, one of the optimal treatments that can be applied in women with TTH and migraine, can have on these two distinct headache groups. Furthermore, studies examining the impact of PRT on activity self-efficacy perception and social participation are quite limited. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the effects of PRT on pain characteristics, attack frequency, activity self-efficacy perception, and social participation in women with two different types of headaches, TTH and migraine. This study will enable clinicians working with women suffering from TTH and migraine to comprehensively evaluate them in clinical settings and provide more comprehensive intervention approaches to address challenges encountered in daily life.",

Thus, bias in group selection was presented in the study. Homogeneity between the groups was ensured by testing the gender, age, number of days of hospitalization, educational status, occupation, previous surgery, and regular use of pain medication. As a result of the analyses, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference between the gender, age, number of days of hospitalization, educational status, occupation, previous surgery, and regular use of pain medication in the intervention and control groups (p>0.05) (Table 1). According to the results, the intervention group (n: 26) and the control group (n: 26) showed homogenous distribution. Data collection tools Data were collected using the Information Form, Fear of Pain Scale-III, and Visual/Visual Analogue Scale.

Fear of Pain Scale-III: The scale was developed by McNeil and Rainwater in 1998 to measure the fear of pain. The scale was adapted into Turkish by \u00dcnver and Turan (2018). The scale consists of 30 items and 3 sub-dimensions Fear of Severe Pain, Fear of Mild Pain and Fear of Medical Pain with 10 items in each sub-dimension. The response options of the scale prepared in 5-point likert type are; 5-extreme, 4-very much, 3-quite, 2-somewhat, 1-never. 1-never feeling fear, the 5-excessive feeling of fear. All items in the scale are positive and there are no reversed items. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 30 and the highest score is 150.

After an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from China to almost all over the world, it nearly affected all countries. In spite of its typical presentation in the form of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and pneumonia, other GIT manifestations were reported. We found some of COVID-19 survivors who had complained from anal fissure problem. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of acute anal fissure among COVID-19 patients, its possible risk factors and outcome.\nMethods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 at Mansoura university isolation hospital, on COVID-19 patients' who were diagnosed with anal fissure. Those who survived and were discharged home safely were telephone called to pick up whether they suffered from any symptoms of anal pain, difficulty in defecation suggesting anal fissure, in order to identify their outcomes, the risk factors for anal fissure development and how they were managed.\nResults A total of 176 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were categorized into two groups. The first group included patients who developed anal fissure (n=65) and the 2nd group included patients who did not develop anal fissure (n=111). No significant difference was noted in demographic data apart from the age which was younger in the fissure group. The incidence of anal fissure was 36.9% of total population. The majority of patients' anal fissure problem resolved spontaneously after patients improved from the COVID symptoms without receiving any treatment (43.1%).\nConclusion Anal fissure is quite common problem after COVID-19. Young and middle age patients are more vulnerable to develop anal fissure after COVID-19 infection.",

        "summary": "Palatal-tissue harvesting is a routinely performed procedure in periodontal plastic surgery. Subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) is considered the gold standard in root coverage. However, over the years, several materials have been attempted to accelerate wound healing and to decrease the post-operative patient discomfort and pain, which are considered the most common disadvantages of tissue harvesting from the palate. Reharvesting from the same region could be necessary in some complicated gingical recessions. For this reason, patients may face long treatment times due to recovery periods of the palate between surgeries.\nPlatelet-rich fibrin (PRF) which has 3-dimensional fibrin matrix structure contributes to regeneration of surgical wounds by releasing growth factors for 10-14 days and showing angiogenic properties.\nIn medicine and dentistry, ultrasonography (USG) method can be used to measure tissue thickness, vascularization, elasticity and blood flow. USG, as a non-invasive method, can provide objective data in evaluating the effects of surgical techniques and biomaterials used on soft tissue healing dynamics and tissue perfusion.\nThe investigators hypothesised that leukocyte rich PRF (L-PRF) application to the palatal area after sCTG harvesting could increase palatal tissue thickness and vascularity throughout 3-month follow-up period compared to the controls. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of the L-PRF membrane on soft tissue donor site healing after harvesting sCTG in terms of wound healing dynamics using USG method.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of platelet rich fibrin (PRF) on wound healing following palatal connective tissue harvesting. The study was planned as a randomized prospective controlled study. Patients with Miller class 1 or 2 gingival recession who needs root coverage surgery in the Department of Periodontology were included in the study. The subepithelial connective tissue graft was obtained in each patient using the single incision technique from the region between the mesial of canine and the mesial of first molar in the palate. Connective tissue dimensions were approximately 10 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 2 mm. Finally, the incision line was sutured with 5/0 synthetic, nonabsorbable, sterile monofilament suture in the control group while L-PRF membrane was placed to the donor site in the test group before the suturing. Patients were evaluated using an ultrasonography device (MyLab\u2122 Seven, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. USG measurements were performed on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 90 for palatal tissue thickness and tissue vascularization by an oral and maxillofacial radiologist with at least six years of experience. A 6-18 MHz intraoral probe was used in intraoral USG examinations. Sterile gel was applied to the intraoral probe and covered with a stretch film. Then, it was placed directly on the mucosal surface of the donor site in the palatal area. Mucosal thickness was evaluated using the B-mode of the device, and vascularization was evaluated using the color doppler and pulsed wave doppler modes of the device. The mean pulsatility index (PI) values of each patient were calculated and considered for statistical analysis. The power analyse of the study was performed for sample size calculation. Sample size was calculated using a statistical program (G*Power; Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany) for \u03b1 = 0.05 and effect size = 0.26. The analyses revealed that 10 subjects per group achieved a power of 80 % with 95% confidence. The data were analysed with the SPSS 21 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to detect data's normality. For the comparison of the parameters of the study groups, independent samples T-test test was used for normally distributed data while Mann Whitney U test test was performed as non-parametric test. Within-group comparisons between the different time periods were tested with repeated measures of ANOVA. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple variations.

        "summary": "TMD (temporomandibular disorders) is the name for a collective syndrome of disorders that includes abnormal function of the muscles of mastication, the temporomandibular joints and surrounding structures. It is one of the most significant causes of orofacial pain, along with dental pain. In TMD syndrome, the cause of pain is often due to overloading of the masticatory muscles rather than primary changes in the joints themselves.\nNowadays, doctors who treat patients with TMD have no doubt that one of the very important etiological factors of this condition is psycho-emotional disorders (excessive nervous excitability, anxiety, depression), which has been confirmed by numerous authors of studies on this subject [4-11].\nThe etiology of TMD is complex and multifactorial. Numerous factors may also contribute to the development of the disorder. An important factor affecting the state of masticatory function is an increase in stress levels (psycho-emotional tension). Structures such as the hypothalamus, reticular formation and limbic system have a decisive influence on the emotional state of each patient The activity of the limbic system, which governs the emotions of adults, and the additional connections of the gamma loops to the masticatory muscles, determine that increased emotional tension translates into a significant increase in the contractile activity of the masticatory muscles.\nTMD and functional disorder of the masticatory muscles are the most common complaint of the patients, seeking treatment in dental office. The two main symptoms of TMD problems are pain and dysfunction. Myalgia -the most common cause is an increased level of muscle use. It is related to vasocontraction of relevant arteries and accumulation of metabolic waste product in the muscles. Activities such as daytime clenching of the teeth and bruxism, habits of chewing gum, biting lips, finger nails or cheeks are factors that cause significant strain on the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joints.",

Other IVF procedures will be the same as the standard practice of the Centre. Both women and clinicians will be blinded from the group allocation i.e. a double blind study.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe study aims to investigate the treatment of couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Eligible couples will be recruited for the study after providing informed written consent following counseling. The IVF protocol involves various steps. Women will undergo preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) as clinically indicated. Ovarian stimulation will be carried out using gonadotropin injections, and regular ultrasound monitoring will be conducted to track the growth of follicles. To prevent a premature LH surge, progestin primed ovarian stimulation or a GnRH antagonist will be administered. Once at least three follicles reach a size of over 17 mm, a trigger injection of either human chorionic gonadotrophin or a GnRH agonist will be given to induce final maturation. Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after the trigger under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The recruited women will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the microfluidic chip group or the density gradient centrifugation group. Randomization and blinding will be ensured to maintain the integrity of the study. Only the laboratory staff involved in sperm preparation will be aware of the group assignment, while the women and clinicians will be blinded to the treatment groups. Semen specimens will be collected by masturbation on the day of oocyte retrieval, following a period of 2-7 days of sexual abstinence. The semen samples will undergo evaluation according to WHO guidelines, including semen volume, sperm concentration, and percent motile spermatozoa. Sperm DNA damage will be assessed using an alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. The extent of DNA damage in spermatozoa will be examined using specific parameters. Sperm preparation will be performed based on the randomization list. In the microfluidic chip group, the Sperm Separation Device will be used, and the prepared sample will be collected in a test tube. In the density gradient centrifugation group, sperm preparation will be completed using a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation method, and the resulting sperm pellet will be washed and resuspended. Oocytes will be fertilized through intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and normal fertilization will be confirmed by the presence of two pronuclei. A few cells will be taken from the blastocysts for comprehensive chromosome analysis. Cryopreservation of all blastocysts will be done, and only euploid blastocysts without aneuploidies will be replaced in subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycles. Frozen embryo transfer (FET) will be performed in subsequent natural or hormonal replacement cycles, depending on the women's menstrual cycle regularity. Pregnancy outcomes will be monitored through urine pregnancy tests and transvaginal ultrasounds. If the pregnancy test is positive, further ultrasounds will be done to confirm fetal viability and the number of fetuses. Pregnancy and delivery data will be retrieved after delivery, and information on pregnancy outcomes, number of babies born, birth weights, and obstetric complications will be recorded. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of the two different sperm preparation methods and their impact on IVF outcomes, including pregnancy rates and obstetric complications.",

        "summary": "Allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis affect more than 25% of the world population and are the leading cause of illness in children. The complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors results in the manifestation of allergic diseases . The pathological presentation of allergic disease involves the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a multifaceted response in specific target tissues such as the airways . This response results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to target tissues and the production of specific IgE antibodies, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [11], [12]. It is well established that allergic inflammation triggers neuronal dysfunction, which activates specific inflammatory mechanisms, potentially leading to structural changes in the diseased tissue . Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related proteins initially discovered to be involved in regulating neuronal development and now known to govern both peripheral and central nerve growth.\nBDNF is a secretory protein belonging to the neurotrophin family and is involved in a range of neural processes during human development [19], [20]. In the early stages of development BDNF is essential for neurogenesis, survival and maturation of neuronal pathways. In the adult, alongside neurotransmitters, hormones and other neurotrophins, BDNF maintains synaptic plasticity, dendritic growth and the consolidation of long-term memory. The biological effect of BDNF is mediated via its binding to the trkB receptor. The activation of these receptors on eosinophils may be important in regulating the inflammatory cascade leading to allergic disease [15], [24]. Neurotrophin mediated activation of bronchial eosinophils might therefore play a role in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in allergic asthma .\nThe BDNF gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and is alternatively spliced resulting in several different transcripts [26]. Genetic polymorphisms in BDNF have been associated with allergic phenotypes such atopic dermatitis [27] and asthma [28], [29], [30], [31] in different populations. The functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) has been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking and affect the secretion of BDNF [32]. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is expressed in the glandular, nasal epithelium, and peripheral nerves in the nasal mucosa, has been shown to induce biochemical and structural changes in nerves that can lead to hyper-responsiveness [33], [34], [35] The biological effects of neurotrophins are mediated by binding either to the high-affinity tyrosine kinase (trk) receptors or to the low-affinity receptors known as pan-neurotrophin receptor p-75.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nAllergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disease that affects the nose and upper airways. It is characterized by inflammation of the nasal mucosa, which leads to symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion. The prevalence of AR is increasing worldwide, and it is estimated that approximately 10-30% of the population is affected by this disease.\n\nThe pathogenesis of AR is complex and involves several factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immune system dysregulation. Several studies have shown that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of AR. In particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in the immune response and inflammation have been associated with an increased risk of AR.\n\nOne of the genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AR is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. BDNF is a protein that is involved in the growth and survival of neurons in the brain. Several studies have shown that SNPs in the BDNF gene are associated with an increased risk of AR.\n\nAnother gene that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AR is the nerve growth factor (NGF) gene. NGF is a protein that is involved in the growth and survival of neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Several studies have shown that SNPs in the NGF gene are associated with an increased risk of AR.\n\nIn addition to genetic factors, environmental factors also play a significant role in the development of AR. One of the environmental factors that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AR is exposure to allergens. Allergens are substances that can trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. Exposure to allergens can lead to the activation of the immune system and the production of inflammatory mediators, which can contribute to the development of AR.\n\nThe aim of this study is to investigate the role of BDNF gene single nucleotide polymorphism and NGF serum level as risk factors that increase the severity of allergic rhinitis. The study will include 100 patients with chronic allergic rhinitis and 100 healthy controls. The patients will be divided into two groups based on the severity of their symptoms. The first group will consist of patients with mild symptoms, and the second group will consist of patients with severe symptoms. The healthy controls will not have any symptoms of allergic rhinitis.\n\nThe study will involve the collection of blood samples from all participants. The blood samples will be used to measure the levels of BDNF gene single nucleotide polymorphism and NGF serum level. The levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and C-reactive protein (CRP) will also be measured in the blood samples.\n\nThe results of this study will provide valuable information about the role of BDNF gene single nucleotide polymorphism and NGF serum level as risk factors for allergic rhinitis. This information can be used to develop new treatments for this disease and to improve the management of patients with allergic rhinitis.",

Up to 10% of community dwelling older adults have depressive symptoms in Europe. Older adults are also subject to chronic illnesses which further exacerbate psychological symptoms. Furthermore, normal aging is associated with decline in cognitive functioning. Given the prevalence of mental health problems and cognitive difficulties in older adults, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could be helpful in this population. Accordingly, a growing number of studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions in the elderly have beneficial effects on psychological health (decrease in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and increase in general mood and positive affect) and cognition (enhanced attention, executive functions).\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique which can be useful to study the neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness, and give neurobiological evidence of its beneficial effect in the elderly. Studies that examined spectral power outcomes between mindfulness and control state showed (i) increased alpha and theta power, as a marker of internally-directed attention processing and executive functioning and (ii) a shift towards left-sided anterior alpha activation, a pattern associated previously with positive emotions.\nThe aim of this study is to evaluate short and long-term cognitive, psychological, and physiological effects of a standard 8-week MBI in healthy older adults.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nInactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, leading to chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) and contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the world's population is inactive and older adults are at highest risk. Inactivity in older adults is linked to age-related diseases and cognitive decline. Inactivity also imposes social costs through increased medical expenses, which are already high among the growing older adult population in the US. Incentive-based interventions have gained popularity among behavioral scientists and policymakers as a tool for improving health-related behaviors. But there are drawbacks - first, monetary incentives are often not cost-effective, and therefore scalability is limited. Second, behaviors often return to baseline when monetary incentives are removed, i.e., healthy habits are hard to maintain when incentives are limited in duration. Third, there is a concern that monetary incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation to engage in health-promoting behaviors. In light of the limited success of incentive-based behavior change programs, the investigators propose to design and evaluate alternative incentives that address these challenges of scalability, habit formation and crowd-out. The investigators will aim to encourage physical activity through alternative incentives - by making a meal donations on behalf of participants (prosocial incentives) and give participants monetary incentives (personal incentives). Both types of incentives have underpinnings in behavioral economics. Meal donations harness prosocial preferences, which may be more powerful and less likely to reduce intrinsic motivation than equivalent monetary incentives. The overall aim is to evaluate the impact of alternative incentives on step count of older adults in the short-term and long-term. Exploratory analysis will also evaluate the impact on physical and mental health. The investigators will recruit 200 older adults and randomize half of them to receive additional prosocial and personal incentives for their walking behavior. The other half will not receive these incentives. The investigators will track step count of these two groups for 8 weeks using a Fitbit device. Under the treatment functionality, participants accrue a meal donation and a point for Feeding America for each day that they meet the step goal. The investigators plan to recruit older adults ages 55 and above at grocery stores and other locations around San Diego, CA. Recruitment will be on a rolling basis. PI Samek has recruited participants at grocery stores in prior studies, hence the investigators believe this is feasible. Participation will be limited to individuals who own a smart phone (61% of older adults in the US own a smart phone, and the investigators expect this number to grow as the population ages). Studies have shown that older adults are open to using app-based technologies, for example older adults are accepting of mindfulness apps. The research team will be given access to participants' Fitbit data through Fitabase, a research platform that collects data from internet connected consumer activity devices. The investigators identified 7,500 steps as an appropriate goal as studies show older adults walk 4,000 steps on average. For the treatment group, meals will be donated by the research team to Feeding America for each day they meet the step goal of 7,500 steps. They will also receive money for each day they meet the step goal of 7,500 steps a day, for up to 5 days a week. The control group will not receive these incentives for their walking behavior, but their daily step count data will be collected. Participants will receive a Fitbit upon enrollment. The investigators will collect their physical activity data for 1 week, as their baseline physical activity.

While this system helped increase the number of children with OSA symptoms who received a referral, many children remained unidentified. The goal of this study is to see whether involving parents in the system can identify even more children. In this study, the investigators propose to test the impact of a health communication message, designed to educate and activate parents about their child's risk for OSA. This message is an infographic that helps parents recognize nighttime symptoms of OSA and how these nighttime symptoms may be impacting their child during the day. If a child has OSA symptoms, parents would view this infographic before their child's PCP visit and could discuss OSA with their child's PCP. For children with OSA symptoms, their parents will be randomized to either: 1) view the health communication message, or; 2) usual care, in which parents are not given any additional information about OSA or their child's risk prior to the appointment. In both cases, PCPs will receive a prompt indicating that the child is at risk for OSA.",

Evaluation of prewriting skills allows for the identification of those children who struggle with these tasks so that early intervention might address these foundational skills before academic demands become more challenging. However, current prewriting skill assessments are limited to pencil-and-paper assessments that require an evaluator to score the drawn shapes.

        "summary": "There is increasing awareness of the importance of providing mental health services and support that promote a recovery-oriented and human rights-based approach. A mental health service system that is guided by a rehabilitation and recovery perspective places emphasis on treating the consequences of the illness rather than just the illness per se, and on empowering people to regain control of their identity and life, and to have hope for the future. Within this philosophy, mental health policies in several countries advocate for the introduction of peer workers in mental health services, people with lived experience of mental health issues and recovery, who are employed to use their lived experience to support those who access mental health services. However, more effectiveness and implementation research is needed. Evidence also suggests that the period following hospital discharge is of high risk of treatment dropout for people with serious mental illness, thus interrupting their recovery process. Therefore, this vulnerable population may particularly benefit from more targeted interventions during this transitional period.\nThe research project will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and implementation of the Critical Time Intervention-Peer Support model, a recovery-oriented based model for people with serious mental illness discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Portugal. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in three psychiatric services in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and their catchment areas. People with diagnoses of psychotic disorders discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities will be recruited and randomly divided into CTI-PS intervention or usual care. Those allocated to the intervention group will additionally receive CTI-PS rather than usual care alone over a 9-month period. Outcomes at baseline, 9- and 18-months will be analyzed by multilevel models, considering the observations clustered within sites. Longitudinal analyses will be used to examine trends over time of the outcomes of interest.\nThe implementation of the CTI-PS model will introduce a novel approach to community mental health care that has not yet been tried in Portugal. This study aims to explore to what extent this intervention can be effective and implemented in countries with the characteristics of Portugal. Additionally, the proposed research aims to contribute to the global knowledge about peer interventions by investigating whether the CTI model maintains its effectiveness using peers.",

        "summary": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of mortality in western countries. Coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) is the first-line imaging test in patients with suspected obstructive CAD. However, in most patients, cCTA shows non-obstructive CAD. The management of patients with non-obstructive CAD is unclear. This is due to the lack of cCTA-based methods capable to assess the risk of disease progression towards developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) based on the atherosclerosis characteristics of each patient. A solution for prognostication in these patients is particularly appealing since it could allow to identify patients who can benefit of a more aggressive medical treatment and management, thus improving outcome.\nProposed methods, which include qualitative evaluations such as the identification of adverse atherosclerotic plaque characteristics or quantitative evaluations such as the quantification of atherosclerotic plaque burden, may in some cases suffer of limited reproducibility between operators and software. Most importantly, each single biomarker is insufficient to accurately predict patient risk, hence potential synergic integration of cCTA and clinical biomarkers is the key to efficiently guide the personalization of patient's management. Furthermore, the few risk stratification methods that have been proposed are not designed to work on platforms capable of deploying the solution to other clinical settings, promoting prospective or external validation",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground and Rationale: In recent years, cCTA has become a crucial diagnostic tool for suspected CAD, recommended as the first-line test for patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of CAD by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and the American HeartAssociation (AHA) and Italian guidelines. However, most patients have non-obstructive CAD. While the management of patients with obstructive CAD is established, as it revolves around further diagnostic test for ischemia evaluation or upfront coronary artery revascularization, this is not the case for patients with non-obstructive CAD. However, these cohort of patients still has a significant risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) that could be prevented by implementing adequate medical therapy. To date, many approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue. However, these proposed solutions lack the ability to provide quantitative and reproducible results with a sufficiently strong predictive value, are often proposed as a stand-alone solution without the integration with multiple prognosticator imaging and clinical parameters, and are not delivered through platforms capable of providing external validation and easy integration in the clinical workflow. Among the proposed prognostic approaches, some are based on the qualitative evaluation of coronary artery plaque features, such as positive remodeling, low attenuation of the plaque, presence of spotty calcification, and napkin ring sign, which is subject to significant inter-reader variability. Other approaches rely on quantitative methods for evaluating atherosclerotic burden based on the extent of coronary artery plaques and their characteristics, such as calcium density, number of lesions, regional distribution, plaque volume, non-calcified plaque volume etc. However, these approaches may be hampered by low reproducibility, especially among different scanner vendors. Interestingly, a new research has also shown that, besides coronary artery vessel wall characteristics, pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation carries significant predictive value, as it reflects the state of coronary inflammation that plays a key role in the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. All these CAD characteristics are often analyzed independently from one to another, reducing their potential synergistic prognostic value and creating redundant variables that have negligible effect on prognosis. We propose an AI-based analysis that can integrate all this data in order to select the most important determinant of CAD progression and to discard futile features, thus creating an agile and clinically valuable risk stratification model. Furthermore, we plan to create a novel imaging marker of CAD with unfavorable outcome, to be integrated in the AI-based model, which will be based on topological features of the coronary artery tree. In fact, data on the association between coronary artery topology (e.g., vessel-length, coronary artery volume index, cross-sectional area, curvature, and tortuositv) and prognosis is scarce. However, it is known that vessel tortuosity influences wall shear stress and leads to disruption of laminar flow, resulting in endothelial dysfunction and flow alterations that may lead to atherosclerosis, eventually causing adverse cardiac events. Thus, this novel biomarker may carry a significant prognostic role. Based on these premises, our research aims to develop a novel clinical-imaging AI-based model to identify and categorize patients at high risk of disease progression and provide a more personalized management approach to improve patient outcomes. However, besides the primary objective of creating an AI-based model for CAD risk stratification, we aim to overcome some issues that currently hamper the widespread clinical application of AI in cardiovascular care. In fact, it is recognized that the integration of AI-based applications into the clinical workflow, which will increase usability and decrease costs, is currently lacking. We aim to tackle these issues with the help of the industrial partners involved in this project that will build a platform capable of delivering the software solution to provide external validation of the algorithm. This platform will be characterized by state-of-the-art security measures, interoperability with current clinical software, and easy-to-use interface.\n\nOfficial Title: Artificial Intelligence for Preventing Heart Disease: Observational, Single Center, Prospective and Retrospective Study\n\nConditions: Coronary Artery Disease\n\nParticipation Criteria:\nEligibility Criteria:\n- Patients with cCTA performed for CAD assessment\n- Exclusion Criteria: Refusal to participate in the study\n- Age <1",

The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is simple, economical and safe, and can better reflect the exercise tolerance and cardiopulmonary function of patients. It is widely used to evaluate the efficacy and rehabilitation effect of patients with cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases. Although drugs can be used for symptomatic treatment such as cough and phlegm, there is still a lack of effective western medicine to relieve these symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, qi promotion of sweat, fear of wind and cold, loss of appetite and other symptoms. Citing an article on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus published by Nature, a top international scientific journal, it is believed that at the current stage, active research and development of drugs that can alleviate symptoms of novel coronavirus infection, promote the recovery of the disease and improve the quality of life, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of mild to moderate novel coronavirus patients will have huge public health benefits [7]. Jade screen, as a famous prescription for the treatment of surface deficiency syndrome, comes from Wei Yilin's Prescription for the effect of the World Medicine in the Yuan Dynasty (some researchers also believe that it comes from Zhu Zhenheng's Danxi Xin Method in the Yuan Dynasty).

The jade screen is made of Astragalus, fried white art and windproof. Astragalus is mainly used for spleen and lung Qi deficiency, which is used to benefit Qi and solid surface, and is the king medicine. White art invigorating spleen and qi, helping astragalus qi and solid surface, as minister medicine; Windproof table and wind evil, as a tonic. However, there are few prospective clinical intervention studies on the use of Manzhi Guben granules for symptomatic supportive treatment during outpatient treatment of convalescent patients with novel coronavirus infection, and there is still a lack of high-quality clinical evidence-based medical evidence on its effectiveness in improving exercise tolerance of convalescent patients after novel coronavirus infection. This provides a good opportunity for the research of this project. By means of modern medical research, it is found that the main components of Manzhi Guben granules (Yupingfeng + Angelica sinensis) are: (1) Astragalus supplementing Qi and consolidating surface, antiviral infection, significant stimulation of interferon system, regulating and promoting humoral and cellular immunity; (2) Atractylodes atractylodes can nourish qi, invigorate spleen, dry dampness, enhance cellular and humoral immunity, and promote phagocytosis of macrophages; (3) Wind-proof and wind-dispelling, which can enhance immune function and fight infection; (4) Angelica sinensis: It has anti-thrombotic effect, improves blood circulation, improves coronary circulation in cardiovascular system, has anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect, lowers blood sugar effect, and has protective effect on lung. Some recent studies have found through modern pharmacological research means that a variety of active compounds in the prescription of Yupingfeng can play a role in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus infection through multi-target and multi-pathway [9,10], which further provides the basic theoretical basis for the clinical application of Manzhi Guben granules.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe fast growth of Decision Neuroscience is contributing to unveil the cognitive processes underlying choices and their neural bases. The results obtained so far show that decision-making involves neural mechanisms underpinning a complex balance between automatic appetitive or aversive drives generated by subcortical structures, and processes of executive control centered in fronto-parietal brain networks. While the role of meso-limbic structures in reinforcement learning have been widely investigated, it is much less clear to what extent are choices shaped by a) individual differences in executive skills; b) contextual factors potentially interfering with such skills, such as knowing that the outcome of those choices will impact only on one's own vs. another's welfare. This a critical gap, since executive abilities are known to decline even in physiological ageing, thus potentially interfering with the quality of choices. On this ground, this single center non-interventional fMRI study aims to provide novel insights into the relationship between executive and decision-making skills, and their possible changes with ageing, in 150 healthy individuals. This goal will be pursued by combining a behavioral assessment of decision-making and executive skills with a multimodal fMRI session including data concerning a) brain activity associated with decision-making and executive functioning in social vs. non-social contexts, b) brain structural morphometry (grey-matter volume/density), and c) brain structural connectivity (diffusion weighted imaging). The behavioral assessment will involve the main metric of decision-making (e.g., risk aversion, loss aversion, delay discounting) and executive functioning (e.g., selective attention and inhibitory control). MRI data will unveil the neural bases of individual differences in decision-making and executive performance in terms of performance-related patterns of brain activity, structure and connectivity.

It can be caused by treatments such as chemotherapy or by certain medical conditions. Neutropenic sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when patients with neutropenia develop an infection. There is currently no way to test for neutropenic sepsis outside of hospitals. Neutrocheck is being developed for use as a self-test by patients at home alongside remote consultation with a HCP or at point-of-care by a HCP. This will allow rapid identification of patients requiring urgent intravenous antibiotics and medical assessment. In cases where Neutrocheck has eliminated the possibility of neutropenic sepsis, patients can avoid unnecessary and stressful hospital visits and valuable hospital resources will be saved.\nParticipants in this study will be invited to use the Neutrocheck test kit in a setting similar to a home environment to carry out a test, whilst being observed by a study moderator.\nThe Neutrocheck devices used in the study will be for investigational use only. This study will not be testing the accuracy of the Neutrocheck result, rather if Neutrocheck can be used safely and in a user-friendly way. Results will not be considered valid.

        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nBackground: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells that leads to destructive bone lesions, renal damage, anemia, and hypercalcemia. MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy. The American Cancer Society estimates that annually over 34,000 new cases of MM will occur in the U.S. and over 12,000 deaths due to MM in 2022. Overall survival (OS) has improved significantly over the past 20 years with the development of proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies. However, despite these advances, patients ultimately relapse requiring multiple subsequent lines of therapy. As MM evolves, it generally becomes more refractory, and patients ultimately succumb to their disease. With multiple lines of efficacious therapies, the correct early identification of relapsed disease is important to trigger initiation of a new line of therapy. Limitations in conventional imaging highlight a need for molecular imaging agents with better sensitivity for detecting and measuring tumor burden to improve staging and treatment selection for patients with MM and plasma cell dyscrasias. 18F-fluciclovine is a radionuclide approved by the FDA for evaluating suspected prostate cancer recurrence but has shown additional ability in detecting MM lesions.

Symptoms may greatly impact daily life. Some patients experience severe respiratory distress, which can lead to emergency department visits and occasionally intubation. The standard treatment is typically behavioral therapy performed by speech and language pathologists. However, new evidence suggests that video biofeedback may be an effective alternative treatment. Video biofeedback allows patients to directly visualize their breathing while performing specific breathing exercises. This is a desirable treatment because it can be performed at the time of diagnosis and requires minimal additional time or resources. The investigators' goal is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the relative effectiveness of video biofeedback and behavioral therapy in the treatment of PVFM. The primary endpoint will be the change in Dyspnea Index score before treatment and one month after treatment. Patients will complete surveys to collate data about patient expectations of behavioral therapy, their reasons for pursuing additional treatment if applicable, and the perceived benefits of the specific intervention. The investigators hypothesize that no clinically meaningful difference will be detected between behavioral therapy and video biofeedback for the treatment of PVFM.

The quality of sleep impacts physical and cognitive aspects, including memory, immune system, and neuroendocrine function, with abnormalities associated with cardiovascular changes, neuropsychiatric disorders, and mortality. Additionally, sleep disorders are related to an increased incidence of delirium in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Routines to control environmental factors in ICUs seem to have an impact on reducing the incidence of acute brain dysfunction - delirium - and could help prevent sleep disturbances in critically ill patients. This study aims to demonstrate an improvement in sleep quality in critically ill patients through the reduction of the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire score and propose a package of measures to improve sleep practices in ICU-admitted patients.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nCritically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to sleep disorders. In the context of critical illness and ICU admission, there is an intersection of factors contributing to this situation: pre-existing health conditions, severe acute illness, sleep-altering treatments (sedatives, analgesics, mechanical ventilation), psychiatric disorders, and the physical environment. In addition to the impact during hospitalization, the literature points to a long-term reduction in quality of life due to sleep disturbance. Recent studies following up on patients after ICU discharge reveal high rates of sleep disorders up to 6 months after hospital discharge - related or unrelated to new psychiatric disorders and even cognitive changes. Furthermore, sleep disorders are associated with an increased incidence of delirium in ICUs, which refers to altered consciousness and cognition in patients admitted to the intensive care environment, which are associated with worsened patient outcomes such as increased hospital stay and consequently the risk of fatal complications. The prevalence of delirium is around 70%, with an incidence of 89%. Delirium assessment in ICUs is usually performed daily. In order to improve the sleep quality of this population, there are modifiable factors, whether environmental (lighting, noise, general care), physiological (medications, ventilatory parameter adjustments), or psychological (anxiety, pain, absence of family members). Routines to control environmental factors in ICUs seem to have an impact on reducing the incidence of acute brain dysfunction - delirium - and could help prevent sleep disturbances in critically ill patients. These measures include dimming or reducing corridor lights at night, grouping (when possible) care activities at appropriate times, raising curtains, and encouraging mobilization during daytime shifts. For non-delirious patients, the use of earplugs and eye masks is also recommended. Therefore, the investigators have developed this research project with the aim of evaluating the implementation of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary protocol to promote an improvement in sleep quality in critically ill patients. The SPIRIT Protocol is a summary of recommendations for clinical trials, which was used as a support in this study. This is a multicenter clinical trial with a quasi-experimental design. The first step consists of assessing the sleep quality in sequential patients admitted to the ICU and characterizing the disruptive elements. After this period, the second step will involve sensitizing and training the multidisciplinary team about the importance of sleep for critically ill patients and providing training for the implementation of a multifaceted protocol of interventions to promote sleep quality improvement. Once the multidisciplinary protocol is implemented, the sleep quality of the patients and the clinical impact of this protocol will be reevaluated.",

Interestingly, L. reuteri was also regularly detected in humans in studies conducted around 1960, but is very rarely found in contemporary humans, suggesting a recent decline of the L. reuteri population in Westerners. L. reuteri is further convincingly linked to a wide range of health benefits, such as modulating immune function and stimulating immune cell development, and it produces tryptophan metabolites that modulate the immune system. These findings provide a clear rationale to test the immunological effects of a L. reuteri strain that originates from PNG and explore nutritional strategies to potentially enhance these effects by supporting the colonisation of this strain.

        "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that often results in motor and/or cognitive impairment. Epidemiologically, the onset occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, with a peak around the age of 30.\nMS is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of signs and symptoms, both in terms of the neurological systems involved and the degree of impairment and severity. The most common symptoms include, among others, difficulty walking and lack of balance. The lack of stability and coordination reduces independence and mobility, predisposing people with MS to accidental falls and compromising mobility in daily life. Another symptom that characterises MS is cognitive impairment, which mainly alters information processing speed and short- and long-term memory. MS-related cognitive impairment is detectable at every stage of the disease. Very often, people with MS have co-existing cognitive and motor deficits, which add to the complexity of managing MS. In order to address this condition, a treatment strategy that combines cognitive and motor rehabilitation needs to be identified. Despite the increasing availability of effective drug therapies that may impact on balance, rehabilitation is a very important means to counteract the progression of disability and improve physical function, affecting social participation and improving quality of life. In recent years, rehabilitation makes use of various robotic devices, which are based on repeatable, intense and motivating exercises, integrated with an enriched virtual environment, capable of improving the quality of movement. In light of the literature, which mainly focuses on robotic therapy for walking, this pilot study aims to evaluate the effects of a specific robotic treatment for balance in MS patients.\nThe primary objective of the study is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT) on static balance.\nThe secondary objective is the evaluation of the effects of technological rehabilitation by means of a robotic platform (Hunova\u00ae Movendo Technology srl, Genoa, IT)\non dynamic balance and walking (assessed with clinical and instrumental scales)\non fatigue and cognitive performance in terms of sustained attention, dual-task cost and cognitive-motor interference;\non quality of life.",

Gemelli over 12 months.the TMA diagnostic algorithm has been implemented in the laboratory software of the hospital and applied whenever a patient in the Emergency ward or any other department undergoes blood tests that include platelet count and lactate dehydrogenase. The basic profile in the Emergency ward always has these two parameters. The algorithm automatically identifies patients with a predicted probability of TMA >90% (6); if this criterion is associated with a platelet count<100 x 109/L, an automated warning to the hematologist on-call is issued with an SMS, and the patient enters the TMA diagnostic process defined in the diagnostic and treatment pathways (Percorso Diagnostico e Terapeutico Assistensiale, PDTA). The on-duty hematologist urgently evaluates the patient for whom a warning has been issued, relating with the clinician(s) of the ward in which the patient is located. If the suspicion of TMA is confirmed, the diagnostic procedures outlined in the PDTA are performed, with the immediate execution of 2nd level tests.

More specifically, those impacted above C5-C7 have impaired upper extremities, which limits the use of arms and hands for activities such as eating, drinking, and grooming. Functional access to water for these individuals becomes a key to increased independence and successful completion of ADLs. Therefore, commercialization of smart fountain faucets, which can automatically deliver water in target temperature, force, & nozzle setting for a specific ADL, has the potential to empower individuals with SCI for greater independence & and improved quality of life.

The initiative will target a broad population of students ranging from those interested in learning more about mental health (online psychoeducation program) to those seeking additional help for their psychiatric symptoms (e-CBT program). Our research team is strongly experienced in designing effective AI-assisted online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs for various mental health conditions in diverse populations. Therefore, being as effective as in-person methods of healthcare delivery, it is hypothesized that our online interventions disseminated via a robust implementation science and community collaboration strategy will be a feasible, cost-effective, and pragmatic solution to address accessibility issues with post-secondary student mental healthcare. The proposed mental health hub will offer a comprehensive care model using a stepped-care approach. Its implementation will be guided by a rigorous approach involving seven aims divided into three phases (pre-adoption, delivery, and post-adoption phases). (1) Pre-adoption phase: will assess post-secondary students' current mental health landscape through surveys and focus groups (Aim 1). This information will be used in the development of a 6-week online psychoeducation (Aim 2) and 12-week diagnosis-specific e-CBT (Aim 3) programs. The psychoeducation program will be followed by 6-months of AI-assisted journaling exercises to monitor the student's mental health and determine whether they would benefit from stepping up their care to receive the diagnosis-specific e-CBT program. The diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs will be adapted from prior clinically validated and diagnosis-specific psychotherapy modules developed by the lab. Four diagnosis-specific modules will support the most common mental health disorders in students (GAD, SAD, MDD and ADHD), as indicated by previous studies and the research team's cross-sectional survey of students in Ontario, Canada. Both programs will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT) - a secure cloud-based platform co-developed by the PI that offers online mental health interventions. (2) Delivery phase: will determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the online psychoeducation (Aim 4) and diagnosis-specific e-CBT (Aim 5) programs by comparing them to treatment, as usual, using validated clinical assessment tools. (3) Post-adoption phase: will use the collected data to monitor the success and fidelity of the programs using surveys and focus groups (Aim 6), and to build capacity and scale the project to other Canadian municipalities (Aim 7). As such, in contrast to other initiatives that target student mental health, this will be the first to involve students and end-users in all phases, from conception to implementation. The digital nature of this healthcare program and the implementation of AI technology results in new solutions that enable easier accessibility and broader reach to individuals in significant need of mental healthcare services. Therefore, to support the development of these mental healthcare resources, the research team has assembled a diverse, cross-functional interdisciplinary team of community leaders, including researchers, clinicians, health decision-makers, and end-users. Ultimately, leveraging the extensive expertise of a cross-functional research team, the objective of the study is to develop and implement a successful and effective digital care plan with the potential to improve post-secondary student mental health care substantially.",

AV2 is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, that is capable of deactivating HPV. It is however not able to destruct the already infected cells, which raises the need for an additional ablative treatment i.e. salicylic acid (SA). Implementation of AV2-Salicylic acid (AV2-SA) combination therapy would ensure permanent lesion clearance by on the one hand inactivation of HPV by AV2, and on the other hand elimination of the lesion by SA treatment. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of AV2-SA treatment versus standard SA treatment, by comparing cure and recurrence rates of cutaneous warts between the two treatment groups (at 12 weeks and six months after randomization). The second aim is to assess the safety and tolerability of AV2-SA therapy.

This may further result in arrhythmia, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary hypertension is caused by endothelial dysfunction, remodelling of the pulmonary vascularization, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventually causes shunt reversal into right-to-left (Eisenmenger's syndrome). At this point, closure of the defect is contraindicated. Small LV, although less extensively studied than dilated LV, also implies impaired LV function. Small LV means less tolerance to volume overload, which in turn impairs cardiac output and presents higher risk of heart failure and mortality (Saito et al., 2021). ASD closure in cases with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents a clinical challenge. Complete closure may cause pulmonary hypertensive crisis and low cardiac output syndrome; however, if left untreated, the disease progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases, which may also lead to Eisenmenger's syndrome and shunt reversal. Today, this condition is treated with fenestrated closure, either with patch or fenestrated septal occluder. The fenestration is hypothesized to provide protective effect against pulmonary hypertensive crisis because it allows blood to flow from right to left heart. The added volume into the left heart is then, hypothesized, to provide volume training for the left heart, mainly in the case of small LV. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of fenestrated closure compared to non- fenestrated closure to the left ventricular size at systole and diastole.",

The investigators aim to address the role of OS and mitochondrial TERT in the progression and therapeutic resistance of PTC. OS and TERT subcellular localization will be investigated in 150 PTCs and correlated to the genetic and expression profile of the tumors and to the clinical and prognostic features of the patients. Mechanisms implicated in TERT mitochondrial migration and the contribution of mitochondrial TERT to tumor progression will be investigated in cancer cell lines and primary cell cultures.

The study is composed of 3 parts, referred to as Part I, Part II and Part III. Patients will be consented separately for Part I and for Part II/III: a first consent is given for tissue collection and pTTL production, and a second consent is given for pTTL treatment, including pre-conditioning chemotherapy and follow-up. Part I of the trial entails patient identification, recruitment and screening of trial patients. It also comprises production of pTTL, which is performed in 3 steps: Collection of tumour samples and normal samples for NGS and neoantigen selection. Production of stimulatory NAG-coupled beads raw material TC0301. Collection of starting material for pTTL manufacturing from RLN. pTTL manufacturing. The time required from collection of tumour material and RLNs up until pTTL production and administration to the patient is approximately 8 to 12 weeks. The RLN starting material is cryopreserved after initial processing, enabling flexibility in the timing of pTTL administration. Part II of the trial entails pre-conditioning and supportive care therapy, treatment with pTTL, and 26 weeks safety follow-up. Pre-conditioning contains cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and will be administered between Day -7 and Day -5 before scheduled pTTL administration. Supportive care treatment will start on Day -9 or Day -8. pTTL administration will normally be administered on Day 1, with the option of administration on Day -3 if cell expansion kinetics during pTTL production indicates this would be preferable. Part II will end when the last treated patient has been followed for 26 weeks or earlier in case of death or patient withdrawal.

        "summary": "Despite technical advances in Medically Assisted Reproduction (AMP), the success of fertility treatments is sometimes limited by embryo implantation failure. The coordinated development of the embryo and the uterine endometrium requires close communication between the maternal tissue and the embryo. In in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer generally takes place between the 2nd (D2) and the 6th (D6) day following oocyte fertilization. Recent studies have shown the advantages of sequential transfer (transfer of an embryo on D2/D3 followed by the transfer of another embryo on D5/D6), with higher implantation and clinical pregnancy rate, fewer miscarriages, more live births, and yet no increase in multiple pregnancies. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations continue to prioritize the transfer of a single embryo for all patients aged under 38. To improve pregnancy rates for patients having a single embryo transferred, the study investigators wish to carry out on blank transfer, based on the principle of sequential transfer. The study investigators hypothesize that a culture medium, placed in the uterus before the time of embryo transfer, will modify immune tolerance. The study will test whether transferring the same culture medium in an equivalent quantity as during the real transfer into the uterus 2/3 days before the embryo transfer will improve tolerance to this foreign medium and, therefore, embryo implantation. The aim of this study is thus to evaluate the impact of a blank transfer with culture medium alone, on the results of frozen embryo transfers (FET) from IVF.",

MN can be fabricated from a variety of materials, preferably biocompatible polymers. Maltose, a natural carbohydrate, is a safe and biocompatible product that can be fabricated into MNs that are biodegradable and soluble within several minutes. Besides, local anaesthetic agents such as lignocaine can be impregnated within the MN matrix, facilitating its transdermal delivery more efficiently which results in enhanced efficacy. So far, maltose MN efficacy in enhancing the transdermal drug delivery (TDD) of lignocaine and thus reducing the pain experienced by healthy patients requiring intravenous cannulation prior to routine eye surgeries (phacoemulsification, trabeculectomy etc) has not been extensively studied. Hence, the objectives of this research are: 1) To evaluate the safety profile of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch as a means of pain reduction in adult patients requiring routine vein-puncturing procedures; 2) To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lignocaine in the systemic circulation when the transdermal lignocaine delivery is enhanced through microneedle usage; 3) To compare the efficacy of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch with standard 5% Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) dermal patch for pain reduction during venepuncture procedure based on mean changes in VAS scores and skin algesimeter index (pharmacodynamic (PD) study).",

The patients were visited at baseline (with the collection of vaginal swabs) and treated with vaginal administration of tocopherol acetate for 14 days. At the end of treatment (final visit) the patients were visited with the collection of vaginal swabs.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe vaginal microbiota has a significant bearing on a woman's mental and physical health at every stage of life. A balanced microflora of the vaginal environment (eubiosis) consists of a predominant presence of lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacilli ensure the maintenance of an acidic pH that effectively makes the environment inhospitable to pathogens by preventing infection and protecting the genital tract. At the end of the reproductive period, the reduction of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, results in a decrease in the lactobacillus component with consequent depletion of the vaginal microbiota and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential human nutrient found mainly in oily fruits. It is a fat-soluble molecule with high antioxidant power. Topically administered, it not only plays a key role in protecting epithelial cell membranes from oxidative damage but is also able to modulate bacterial growth by contributing to pH acidification. The latter feature, in the vaginal canal, creates a favorable environment for the lactobacilli flora, positively affecting the microbial population and thus contributing to the prevention of all those problems related to increased vaginal sensitivity to pathogens during menopause. In addition, recent data show that vitamin E can counteract the production of biofilm produced by certain pathogens, which has detrimental effects on the homeostasis of the vaginal environment. The period of observation is from January 1st, 2020 to December, 31st, 2022, while the Data Collection period will be from June, 30th, 2023 to July, 31st, 2023.",

        "summary": "Dyspnea is one of the most common reasons for admission to the emergency department[1]. Oxygen saturation has great importance in determining the triage status of patients admitted to the hospital with dyspnea and planning the emergency treatment [2].\nPeripheral perfusion index (PI), which shows tissue oxygenation is a noninvasive way of demonstrating tissue perfusion in critically ill patients. Studies have shown that PI is an accurate, fast and reliable pulse oximetry-based indicator of tissue perfusion [3-5]. PI shows the perfusion status of the tissue in the applied area for an instant and a certain time interval. The PI value ranges from 0.02% (very weak) to 20% (strong) [6].\nTriage scales are used to distinguish emergency and non-emergency patients. The emergency triage system is used to quickly determine the care priorities of patients during admission to the emergency department[7,8].\nIt is important to make the triage classification for dyspnea in emergency services quickly and accurately to start the treatment protocols as early as. In this study, the investigators aimed to determine the relationship between perfusion index and the emergency triage classification in patients admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea.",

        "summary": "Background: Terminally ill patients often experience significant psychosocial distress having depressed mood, death anxiety, pain, and an overall poor quality of life. Recent evidence from pilot studies suggests that serotonergic hallucinogens including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin produce significant and sustained reductions of depressive symptoms and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, and life meaning in patients suffering from life-threatening diseases. Additionally, serotonergic hallucinogens may produce antinociceptive effects.\nObjective and Design: The study aims to evaluate effects of LSD on psychosocial distress in 60 patients suffering from an end-stage fatal disease with a life expectancy \u226512wks and \u22642yrs in an active placebo-controlled double-blind parallel study. Patients will be allocated in a 2:1 ratio to one of the two intervention arms receiving either two moderate to high doses of LSD (100 \u00b5g and 100 \u00b5g or 100 \u00b5g and 200 \u00b5g) as intervention and two low doses of LSD (25 \u00b5g and 25 \u00b5g) as active-placebo control.",
