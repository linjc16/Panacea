        "summary": "Chronic pain (CP) is a substantial healthcare challenge with considerable economic costs. Recently, the term Nociplastic Pain (NP) has been introduced as a third descriptor of mechanisms related to CP. NP describes conditions that arise from altered nociception despite no clear evidence of actual or threatened tissue damage. It represents a new way of describing somatoform painful conditions, originating from altered central-nervous pathways (e.g., central sensitization) and with the important involvement of clinical psychological factors. Among nociplastic chronic syndromes have been included fibromyalgia (FM), chronic migraine (CM) and vulvodynia (VU). These chronic pain disorders have been usually studied separately, although the high comorbidity rates. Many studies evidenced the role of psychosocial variables in the onset and maintenance of the burden related to these conditions. Among them, personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may play a pivotal role in the onset of the NP. The first aim of this study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). A second aim, to improve the tailored psychological treatment devoted to these conditions, is to explore the association between FM, CM, and VU with depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention. To identify specific descriptors, NP conditions will be compared with a control group of subjects reporting other types of CP (e.g., knee arthrosis, rheumatoid arthritis). The study involves the collection of data from a self-administered questionnaire in several Italian centers specializing in the above-mentioned clinical conditions under the guidance of the research team of the Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, PI Professor Federica Galli.",

The study will involve the administration of a protocol of self-report questionnaires consisting of two parts: the main (about 25 minutes for the administration) and the optional one (additional 20 minutes). The primary outcome measures will be central sensitivity index, traumatic experiences index, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, and environmental sensitivity. The secondary outcome measures will be presence and intensity of psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychosomatics, physical and psychological quality of life index, alexithymic traits, perceived social support, sexual satisfaction, genital pain, and sexual functioning.",

        "summary": "An overactive bladder (OAB) is a condition characterized by frequent en nightly voiding, small bladder capacity and the occurrence of sudden urge to void, with or without urinary incontinence. The prevalence of OAB with bothersome complaints is around 11% in women and 9% in men with an increasing incidence with age. OAB is not an illness or disease but nevertheless had a significant impact on both the individual as society. First-line treatment for OAB consists out of behavioral and physiotherapy. Anticholinergic medication can be associated to improve bothersome symptoms, but has the downside of causing unwanted side effects. If the formentioned treatment is not sufficient, second line treatment can be discussed. Depending on the patient's characteristics and the physician's preference intravesical injections of Botox or the implantation of a sacral neuromodulator (SNM) can be considered.\nBoth options are equal and effective, but many individual differences exist in preference. Regarding outcome, some factors have been described to prefer one therapy above the other, for example in case of concomitant fecal incontinence, frequent urinary tract infections,\u2026 The personal preference of doctors and patients has been investigated, but currently no study has focused on therapy preference in a culturally and linguistic divers (CALD) population. The latter broadly describes a population with ethnical, cultural, religious and/or language characteristics and is a general accepted measure of diversity.\nIn the current study, the investigators aim to describe the different (dis)advantages of both second line treatments for OAB in a discrete choice experiment.

The goal is to investigate if CALD patients make a different choice in treatment and what factors contribute to that decision in order to provide more tailored information regarding the treatment options in the future.

        "summary": "Diabetes mellitus (diabetes) is a chronic condition that represents a major public health and clinical concern. Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) is a critical part of the care of individuals with diabetes. SMBG entails capillary fingerstick blood glucose testing multiple times per day. Many people with diabetes find this testing painful and cumbersome, often resulting in poor compliance to a glucose self-monitoring schedule. Furthermore, SMBG only provides limited visibility on daily and nightly glucose profiles, meaning that hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes can be missed or detected with delay. The use of minimally invasive continuous glucose monitoring devices (CGMs) in diabetes management circumvents these challenges as CGMs measure glucose every few minutes over a period of 1-2 weeks through a sensor with a fine needle that is inserted once into a user's arm or abdomen. This enables periodic glucose measurement without repeat finger pricks and provides the user with a detailed glucose profile over the entire wear time of the sensor, thus enabling better adjustment of therapy or behaviour.\nIn populations where CGMs are accessible to people with diabetes as standard of care and without additional cost, many people with type 1 diabetes have switched from SMBG via fingerstick to the use of CGMs permanently, using the devices continuously. This is rarely possibly for people with type 1 diabetes in the public sector in LMICs as CGMs are not provided as standard of care. Little data on effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of the use of CGMs in LMIC populations is available to inform clinical models for the integration of CGMs into diabetes management. Furthermore, it has not been investigated if intermittent, as opposed to continuous use of CGMs provides clinical benefit. Intermittent use could be beneficial for people with diabetes who do not have the means to pay for continuous use of CGMs.\nThis study aims to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability, and cost of intermittent and continuous use of CGM among people with type 1 diabetes in South Africa.",

        "summary": "Preterm neonates born at less than 30 weeks' gestation are commonly maintained on invasive or non-invasive respiratory support to facilitate gas exchange. While non-invasive respiratory support (NIS) can be gradually reduced over time as the infant grows, most weaning strategies often lead to weaning failure. This failure is evidenced by an increase in significant events such as apneas, desaturations, and/or bradycardias, increased work of breathing, or an inability to oxygenate or ventilate, resulting in escalated respiratory support. Although the optimal approach to weaning NIS remains uncertain, neonatal units that delay Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) weaning until 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age exhibit lower rates of chronic lung disease. Therefore, the investigators aim to compare the duration on respiratory support and oxygen exposure in infants born at less than 30 weeks' gestational age who undergo a structured weaning protocol that includes remaining on CPAP until at least 32-34 weeks corrected gestational age (CGA). The hypothesis posits that preterm infants following a structured weaning protocol, including maintaining CPAP until a specific gestational age, will demonstrate lower rates of weaning failure off CPAP (defined as requiring more support and/or experiencing increased stimulation events 72 hours after CPAP weaning) than those managed according to the medical team's discretion.",

Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[4]. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon[5].\nA new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, T\u00fcbingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago[6]. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed[7]. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal [8].

To be treated, dyspnea must be detected and quantified, which is impossible in approximately 50% of patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. However, these non-communicative patients are exposed to the same risk factors for dyspnea as communicative patients and the impossibility to communicate a suffering increases its traumatic impact. In addition, simple therapeutic means, such as optimizing the settings of the ventilator, can significantly alleviate or even eliminate dyspnea. It is therefore particularly important to be able to detect and quantify it effectively. The Mechanical Ventilation - Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) is an observational dyspnea scale that bypasses patient involvement and represents a promising tool in the detection of dyspnea in non-communicative patients. However, its use is partly based on the observation of the facial expression of fear or the abdominal paradox, the assessment of which remains subjective. The analysis of ventilatory variability, which reflects the load-capacity balance of the respiratory system, could provide an alternative to detect dyspnea in these patients. The investigators are therefore going to measure the ventilatory variability using the thoracic motion signals obtained with a force sensor integrated in a chest strap and the ventilatory flows at airways in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation during a spontaneous breathing trial and compare the indices of ventilatory variability with the dyspnea visual analog scale in communicative patients and with the MV-RDOS in all patients (communicative and non-communicative).",

        "summary": "Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the commonest nerve compression syndrome in the upper limbs, and carpal tunnel decompression is one of the most prevalent upper limb surgical interventions. Surgeries for CTS may be more effective compared to conservative measures in reducing symptoms and improving hand function, particularly in patients with severe CTS.\nThe etiology of CTS is multifactorial and includes occupational and personal factors. Physical workload factors play an important role in CTS but the role of some personal factors is less clear. Obesity is a well-documented risk factor for CTS. Hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis are possible risk factors for CTS. Finally, the role of smoking in CTS is uncertain.\nTraditional approach makes use of a longitudinal skin incision from the palm toward the wrist and across the transverse carpal ligament. Though this approach offers excellent visualization, reliable release of the full retinaculum, and ability to identify anatomic variations, it is associated with some intractable complications, including wound pain, scar tenderness, flexor tendon entrapment and thenar as well as hypothenar (pillar) pain, which are difficult to recovery.\nThe attempt to perform CTR without extra complications leads to the development of different techniques and several mini-incision approaches.\nThese techniques help to reduce incisional discomfort after surgery, but it can lead to frequent incidence of blood vessel injury or incomplete release. The mini-incision approaches have the advantage of leaving a smaller scar, less scar pain, and lower grade of pillar pain. Though several methods have been proposed, there were still some disadvantages in them. Though CTR can be safely accomplished by them, incomplete release still occurred in several cases for some reasons.\nAfter intensive research in the current literature, there is a paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of mini-incision approaches in achieving CTR in Egyptian patients. That is why we conducted the present study to present our experience with the modified mini-incision technique and compare its outcomes to the conventional open approach.",

        "summary": "The placement of a catheter in a large-caliber vein is sometimes necessary for the administration of treatments or the monitoring of a patient. This may be associated with complications during its realization, such as the puncture of an adjacent artery with possible formation of a hematoma or the puncture of the pleura with creation of a pneumothorax. These complications may be favored by variations in the anatomy. The use of ultrasound allows visualization of the vessels, its adjacent structures and the puncture needle along its path.\nThe contribution of ultrasound with the technique of venipuncture under ultrasound guidance is to date the best means of preventing complications by reducing the risk of early mechanical complications by a factor of 5 to 10 according to the studies. The retrospective, multicenter, observational study recently published by Bj\u00f6rkander et al reported the experience of 8 Swedish hospitals with 14243 central venous catheter placements, 58% of which were in the internal jugular vein. Nearly one catheter in two was placed with the use of ultrasound (49%). One hundred and eighteen mechanical complications were recorded, of which 23 were considered serious, including 21 pneumothoraxes and 2 severe hemorrhages. Lack of ultrasound use was found to be an independent risk factor for complications in multivariate analysis by logistic regression. Despite a high level of evidence in the scientific literature on the contribution of ultrasound guidance for the placement of central venous catheters, and the recommendations of national and international learned societies published before the start of this study, almost one patient in two had not yet benefited from this technique, which could nevertheless greatly reduce the incidence of early mechanical complications.\nThe recent introduction of ultra-portable ultrasound scanners could encourage the generalization of the use of ultrasound, given their reduced cost. The hypothesis of the research is that the placement of a central venous catheter is similar whether the ultrasound machine is an ultra-portable ultrasound machine or a conventional ultrasound machine",

        "summary": "Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) is a methodology developed in the 1970s by Richard Bandler and John Grinder, based on the idea that language and behavior are interconnected and can be systematically modeled and changed. NLP is often used as a form of psychotherapy, coaching, or personal development, although its effectiveness has been debated in the scientific community.\nNLP practitioners believe that our thoughts, emotions, and behavior are influenced by our internal representations of the world, which are constructed through language and sensory experiences. Changing the use of language and the perception of experiences, thoughts, emotions, and behavior can be adjusted accordingly. NLP uses various techniques to achieve this, including reframing, anchoring, and rapport-building. Reframing involves changing the perception of a situation by putting it in a different context or perspective. Anchoring consists in associating a particular state of mind or emotion with a specific physical or sensory stimulus, such as a touch or a smell. Rapport-building involves establishing a connection and a sense of trust with another person through mirroring and matching their body language, tone of voice, and language patterns.",

        "summary": "Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is one of the most common problems treated by neurosurgeons, particularly as the population ages. While often dismissed as a benign problem, it has become clear that cSDH is associated with worse long term functional and cognitive outcomes compared to matched controls. Though surgical techniques for treatment of cSDH are becoming more effective and safe, a persisting problem of fluctuating, stroke-like neurological deficits has re-emerged. Such deficits are not always directly related to hematoma mass effect and not always relieved with surgical decompression, but can result in prolonged hospital course, additional workup, and sometimes even additional invasive treatments. While the cause of such events is unknown, we recently documented for the first time that massive waves of spreading depolarization can occur in these patients and were closely linked to such neurologic deficits in some patients. In the current study, we plan to expand on these preliminary findings with rigorous, standardized application of post operative subdural electrocorticography monitoring, pioneered at our institution to detect SD. We also plan to build on our large retrospective analysis estimating the overall incidence of such deficits in cSDH patients by assessing multiple proposed risk factors for SD. In addition, for the first time, we will assess the short- and long-term consequences of cSDH and SD with detailed functional, cognitive, and headache related outcome measurement. These assessments are based on several remarkable cases we have observed with time-locked neurologic deterioration associated with recurrent SD. This study qualifies as a mechanistic clinical trial in that we will be prospectively assigning patients to the intervention of SD monitoring and assessing outcomes related to the occurrence of SD. This constitutes the application of a novel measure of brain signaling and assessing biomarkers of these physiologic processes of SD. These studies will provide critically needed information on this novel mechanism for neurologic deficits and worse outcomes after cSDH evacuation. Upon successful completion, we would identify a targetable mechanism for poor outcomes that occur commonly in patients with cSDH. This overall strategy offers the opportunity to radically improve the care of patients with cSDH by focusing on clinical trials of pharmacologic therapies for neurologic deficits in patients with cSDH.",

During this therapeutic window, the annualized relapse rate remained stable, and patients showed no radiological disease activity.\nScandinavian observational studies of off-label use of anti-CD20 in MS provide real-life evidence of the absence of recovery of clinical and radiological activity after prolonged interruption of treatment.\nAfter 2 years of treatment, and with disease activity under control, spacing administration intervals could reduce the risk of infection without reducing treatment efficacy. This would facilitate the decision to maintain highly active immunotherapy over the long term. In addition, this therapeutic de-escalation, by reducing the frequency of infusions and associated day hospitalizations, would help to reduce treatment management costs.\nOur aim is to evaluate the non-inferiority of 12-monthly spacing of ocrelizumab infusions versus the conventional 6-monthly regimen, in a population of active MS patients over 18 years of age who have already received 4 or more semi-annual cycles of treatment for 2 years.",

Tumor cells have altered metabolism compared to normal cells.This makes metabolic activity imaging useful for diagnosing and assessing neurological disease. However, current options for metabolic activity imaging are limited. Metabolic activity imaging is primarily conducted using positron emission tomography (PET) with a radioactive tracer called fludeoxyglucose F-18 (\u00b9\u2078FDG). A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of radioactive glucose (\u00b9\u2078FDG) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed, computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. PET imaging is very expensive and is usually much less available than other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field to provide clear and detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. While MRI is more available than PET, it isn't as useful in evaluating metabolic activity.

        "summary": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is often accompanied by a variety of other symptoms, such as bipolar disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), Avoidant Personality Disorder (AvPD), Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD), etc. The behavioral and social complications often marginalize the population, impact on life satisfaction, undermined societal values that impact on economic and financial fairness, and so forth. Furthermore, persons with ASD are neurodiverse from standardized pharmacological and clinical cares, and are interpreted disadvantaged in the context of neurotypical treatments.\nThe research protocol aims to differentiate the neuropharmacological implications of ASD from its behavioral and social implications. Such a differentiation is beneficial to the quality of care for neurodiverse population, both in terms of precision treatment in medical settings, and in terms of psychotherapeutic treatment efficacy in the interpretation of behavioral and social traits.\nThe study protocol continues from the adverse event of the participant in NCT05711810 trial, after the positive immunological results in the NCT05839236 trial. The intervention medicine continues from Sertraline adjusted on the choice of Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor (SSRI) in the previous two trials for complex post-traumatic stress disorder (CPTSD) of the participant, and its combined used with Duloxetine in the choice of Selective Norephedrine Reuptake Inhibitor (SNRI) for norephedrine regulations.\nThe hypothesized target is on the discrete psychiatric intervention centered approach to ASD treatment care. In the PRC where the study is being carried out, amphetamine class medicines are strictly prohibited and defined as illegal substances, regardless of their only proven effect for ASD patient care. Contributed by the sociostructural elements and necessities, black market amphetamine and ketamine have not only emerged in the regime for decades, but also have become a lucrative business. Their recreational uses are also sometimes accompanied by real necessities and needs; black markets cater to the needs but guidance on the usages is based on word-of-mouth stories without professional medical assistances. There is one case the Principal Investigator (PI) collected, that one person, possibly under depression contributed by PTSD, took relatively high dosage of amphetamine and went into a state of psychosis with overwhelming persecution mania.

Most of the deaths are in children under five living in Africa. It is a major problem for those who live in affected areas and for travellers. There is a great need for a safe, effective malaria vaccine.\nThis study is being done to evaluate an experimental malaria vaccine for its safety and also look at the body's immune response to the vaccine.\nThe vaccine tested in this study is called and RH5.1. This is given with an adjuvant called Matrix-M. This is a substance to improve the body's response to a vaccination.\nThe aim is to use the vaccines and adjuvant to help the body make an immune response against parts of the malaria parasite. This study will assess:\nThe safety of the vaccines in healthy participants.\nThe response of the human immune system to the vaccines.\nThis will be achieved by giving participants three doses of the RH5.1 vaccines at two different dose levels (10 micrograms and 50 micrograms). One group will have 3 doses of 10 micrograms given at 0, 1 and 6 months whilst the other will receive 2 doses of 50 micrograms (at 1 and 2 months) followed by a 10 microgram dose at 6 months- known as a 'delayed fractional dose'. Blood tests and information about any symptoms will be performed/collected that occur after vaccination.\nInformation from previous studies suggests that a delayed fractional dose improves the immune response to the vaccine, particularly in terms of the antibody response. Current prediction is that this improvement is due to the delay in dosing, rather than the reduction in dose, and this study will help to answer that. Having a vaccine at a single dose is important for efficient production and dosing for vaccines rolled out in national programs so being able to move away from 'delayed fractional dose' regimens to 'delayed final dose' regimens will be important for vaccine development.",

Serial neurochecks are part of guideline recommendations, but there is equipoise between hourly (Q1) and every-other-hour (Q2) evaluation. In the ICU, care-related awakenings occur frequently, but it is unclear if differential neurocheck frequencies result in differential sleep, providing the scientific premise for this proposal.\nPopulation: Twenty-two patients (N=11 per group) who have undergone elective aneurysm coiling will be enrolled. On post-operative day (POD) 0, patients will be screened and approached for informed consent if they do not meet exclusion criteria, e.g., prior intracranial injury, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, mechanical ventilation. Patients with elective aneurysm coiling are being chosen because they require ICU level of care following their intracranial procedure, but do not have structural brain injury or ongoing sedation needs that might impact sleep measurements.\nMethods: Usual care: Patients are monitored every 15-30 minutes for up to 6 hours post-procedure, then Q1 or Q2 for up to 24 hours. If these patients remain stable, they are discharged home on post-operative day (POD) 1. Proposed Intervention: Enrolled patients will be randomized to Q1 or Q2 neurochecks following the institutionally required 6 hours of stable neurological and vascular checks. Once randomized, patients will undergo placement of electroencephalogram (EEG) with video, electrooculogram, and chin lead. The video EEG will be in place for at least 8 hours to include the overnight (10PM-6AM) time period. Following completion of the recording, the signals obtained will be reviewed by a blinded polysomnographic sleep technician for sleep characteristics including quantitative assessments of wakefulness, deep (N3) sleep, REM sleep, sleep efficiency, and sleep fragmentation and arousals. On POD1, patients and their nurse will fill out the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire to rate subjective sleep quality.",

        "summary": "Extranodal extension (ENE) refers to the spread of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) outside the lymph nodes. It is a well-known factor that indicates a poorer prognosis and outcome for patients who have undergone surgical removal of the cancer. In such cases, it is recommended to combine chemotherapy with radiation therapy after surgery.\nAs the number of cases of HNSCC related to the human papillomavirus (HPV) is increasing, treatment approaches have shifted towards using radiation therapy as the primary treatment method instead of surgery. This raises an important question about the significance of ENE observed through imaging tests (referred to as iENE) and its impact on the prognosis. Unfortunately, this question remains unanswered.\nThe objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study across multiple medical institutions. The investigators will gather data including scan results, histopathology reports, and data from patient charts from individuals who have been treated for head and neck cancer. The aim is to analyze and correlate the findings between the pathological evidence of ENE and the imaging results, while also assessing the prognostic value of iENE. Additionally, the investigators will explore the influence of HPV status on these factors.\nBy collecting and analyzing this data, the investigators hope to establish standardized criteria that can assist radiologists in accurately identifying ENE through imaging tests. This research is essential for enhancing our understanding of HNSCC and improving the effectiveness of diagnostic procedures and treatment planning.",

The study will measure interobserver variability amongst radiologists in grading radiographic ENE and to measure the impact of standardized criteria on this variability. The study will be conducted under the auspices of the Head and Neck Inter Group (HNCIG, Www.Hncig.Org) and is part of the Evaluation Prognostic and Predictive Indicators in Head and Neck Cancer (EPIC) Programme. The study will include data from consecutive patients at each site treated between 1/1/1999 and 12/31/2020 who fulfil all the eligibility criteria. The primary outcome measures will be the accuracy of a radiologic call of iENE (with pENE being the gold standard comparator) by radiologists not trained for any standardized diagnostic classification systems for iENE, overall survival rates based on presence of iENE and pENE, recurrence rates based on presence of iENE and pENE, overall survival rates based on presence of various degrees of iENE and pENE, and recurrence rates based on presence of various degrees of iENE and pENE. The secondary outcome measures will be the diagnostic accuracy of various radiographic features of iENE with pENE, diagnostic accuracy of published standardized classification systems with pENE, interobserver variability measured by Cohen's kappa, and utility of various existing standardized diagnostic classification systems in accurately diagnosing iENE.

        "summary": "During their lifetime, 15 to 25% of patients with diabetes mellitus will develop a Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU) related to neuropathy and/or peripheral arterial disease. DFU is the leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO), which complicates up to 60% of DFU, is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. It has been shown that medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Empirical antimicrobial treatment is not recommended for DFO as for other chronic infections. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy (BB) procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons: lack of availability, cost, and delay. Some clinicians also find bone biopsy cumbersome or too invasive.\nTo overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind BB procedure performed by diabetologists at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside BB is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside BB versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO",

The secondary objectives are to compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy, compare microbiological culture results between groups, compare the safety of both procedures, compare DFO remission according to results of BB (negative or positive), estimate total costs for the intervention and total medical costs in each groups, estimate total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based upon EQ5D5L scores, and calculate the point estimate of the incremental cost utility ratio and estimate the probability of decremental cost effectiveness for the beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional biopsy. The study will include subjects with diabetes and DFU with a suspicion of DFO. DFO is a complication of a large amount of DFU and is a major trigger of lower limb amputations. As we will include participants before bacteriological confirmation of DFO through bone biopsy, we will use the clinical and radiological criteria for DFO according to IWGDF 2019 guidelines. The intervention is a bedside blind bone biopsy procedure performed by a physician at the bedside in the clinical ward. The primary outcome measure is the remission of DFO at 12 months and is defined by a composite criterion as: an epithelialized ulcer for 28 consecutive days and absence of local inflammation and/or stabilization or improvement of radiologic abnormalities and no need for surgery of the foot to treat DFO during follow-up.

        "summary": "Physical therapies based on electrical or electromagnetic stimulation have been used in rehabilitation, in some cases combining electrical therapy with radiofrequency. Specifically, resistive capacitive electrical transfer therapy (CRet) has been used in physical rehabilitation and sports medicine to treat muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries. CRet is a non-invasive electrothermal therapy classified as deep thermotherapy, which is based on the application of electrical currents within the radiofrequency range of 300 kHz - 1.2 MHz. While the heat conducted by surface thermotherapy cannot reach the muscle due to the electrical resistance of the tissues, the capacitive-resistive electrical currents in CRet therapy can generate heating of deep muscle tissues, which in turn improves haemoglobin saturation. In Europe, CRet is widely used in various medical rehabilitation processes. The physiological effects of this type of physiotherapy are generated by the application of an electromagnetic field with a frequency of approximately 0.5 MHz to the human body. The effects attributed to this technique include increased deep and superficial blood circulation, vasodilatation, increased temperature, removal of excess fluid and increased cell proliferation.\nSome of these reactions, such as increased blood perfusion, are known to be related to the increase in temperature, but others, such as increased cell proliferation, appear to be primarily related to the passage of current.\nIt is also true that this increase in tissue temperature, generated through the application of the device, is a physical reaction to the passage of current (Joule effect). Although there is already clinical literature supporting this mechanism, the amount of energy and current that must be transferred to obtain the desired temperature rise is unknown. Moreover, the control of these reactions, by adjusting parameters such as absorbed power and electrode position, is still largely based on the empirical experience of therapists .\nRecently, new cadaveric publications have been generated, which support the mechanisms of current flow and thermal changes in this situation.\nAgainst this background, in which thermal effects, current passage and symptomatic improvements have been demonstrated in patients with pathology, the possibility that these treatments may improve functional sporting abilities is raised. This hypothesis arises from the fact that current flow and thermal changes have been directly related to viscoelastic changes in capsular and muscle tissue.\nTo date, there is no study that has assessed whether this therapy generates any change in functional variables related to sports performance in professional athletes.",

GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett\u00b4s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in GERD patients: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. There is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders.\nA long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population.\nAnxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD.\nThe reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity.\nSeveral studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort.\nThe aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores.

Patients followed up for LS are at high risk of developing CRC at an early age, and have a high cumulative CRC risk. In this context, CRC screening by colonoscopy is of major importance, as it is associated with a reduction in both CRC incidence and mortality.\nIn France, the Institut National du Cancer (INCa) recommends colonoscopy with indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE), as it is associated with a significant increase in the adenoma detection rate (ADR) compared with white light. However, EC is not routinely performed in clinical practice, as it is a time-consuming technique requiring a dedicated slot with a trained operator.\nRecent years have seen the emergence of artificial intelligence techniques for real-time polyp detection aids or CADe devices.

New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity.\nThis study looks to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of such a model, using rehabilitation technology to enrich and enhance delivery of rehabilitation within an NHS inpatient stroke unit environment. This model of rehabilitation delivery has already been tested by the research team with community-dwelling participants in the chronic phase of stroke (over a year since stroke) and is known to be feasible and safe. Participants will be recruited from the stroke unit at University Hospital Wishaw during the acute and sub-acute phase of stroke (0-6 months since stroke), if requiring rehabilitation following a stroke and deemed medically fit enough to participate. Participants will be supported to complete activities in a newly dedicated 'technology enriched rehabilitation space' by NHS staff, in addition to their usual treatment. This will enable participants to engage in rehabilitation activities relating to their physical, cognitive, visual, communication and functional goals using equipment such as an adapted treadmill, interactive screens and tablets, upper limb exercise devices, power-assisted gym equipment and virtual reality. All devices are commercially available and known to be safe for use with stroke patients, however the use of such devices within NHS services is currently known to be under-utilised. Data will be obtained through a range of measures to monitor safety (incidence and types of adverse events), adherence (sessions/time attended, movement repetitions) and through interviews with participants, their family/carers, and staff to understand user acceptability.",

Hospital care for these patients accounts for 7% of all NHS beds and 5% of the entire NHS budget. The number of strokes across the UK is projected to increase by 60% between 2015 and 2035. Rehabilitation delivered by a multi-disciplinary team including Allied Health Professionals (occupational therapists [OT's], physiotherapists [PT's], and speech and language therapists [SLT's]) is known to improve functional recovery after stroke, particularly if it can be applied intensively and within enriched, stimulating environments. However, a large gap exists between the minimum recommendations for stroke rehabilitation (three hours of multidisciplinary therapy a day, at least 5 days out of 7) and what the NHS are currently able to provide, given the majority of in-patient stroke units are operating below the staffing levels recommended in national clinical guidelines, and are therefore challenged to provide the amount of therapy to facilitate optimum recovery for stroke patients. An analysis of data from the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme found, on average, patients who required specific therapy following stroke received around 14 minutes of PT, 13 minutes of OT, and 7 minutes of SLT per day of inpatient stay. Therefore, new and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity. Commercially available technology, such as robotics, adapted treadmills, virtual reality, and mobile digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors, have been shown to be a safe and feasible method of increasing rehabilitation intensity, under the prescription and supervision of therapy staff. Despite the potential offered by rehabilitation technology to help deliver evidence-based levels of practice intensity and automated feedback without additional labour costs, currently few technologies have been adopted into everyday rehabilitation.

        "summary": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. In this scenario, early coronary reperfusion is the main therapeutic strategy as it substantially reduces mortality. Paradoxically, however, reperfusion triggers additional tissue damage that accounts for about 50% of the infarcted heart mass, i.e., ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRL). In this context, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a sphingolipid synthesized by sphingosine kinases (Sphk), carried in plasma bound to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and released after cellular damage such as LIR. Particularly, in animal models of AMI, therapies targeting downstream S1P receptor signaling triggered by HDL/S1P are able to promote endothelial barrier functions and attenuate secondary damage to LIR. Thus, the molecular control of sphingosine kinase 1 (Sphk1) transcription during LIR in vivo or during hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) in vitro may represent an important mechanism for maintaining endothelial homeostasis since it promotes the generation of S1P and this may promote subsequent HDL enrichment. Thus, the role of pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for five days in volunteers undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (BVR) will be investigated in order to verify the vascular expression of SPhk1, transcriptome and vascular proteome remodeling, as well as S1P content in HDL.",

To improve the quality of ICU care that patients receive after admission to the ICU, a variety of academic societies, including the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Society of Critical Care Medicine, are currently developing evidence-based guidelines and consensus guidelines and statements regarding ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, ICU diary. The ABCDEF bundle, nutritional therapy, and ICU diary have been developed and are being promoted for implementation in hospitals around the world. The implementation of evidence-based ICU care is strongly recommended, especially for patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who frequently require ventilators to maintain their lives, because their patient outcomes are worse than those who were admitted to ICU with other causes.\nHowever, there is still little evidence on how the quality of ICU care (compliance rate) correlates with patient prognosis and outcomes, and there are currently no clear goals or indicators for the ICU care we should develop.\nThis study aims to investigate the epidemiology and treatments given to the patients and evaluate the implementation of evidence-based ICU care and its association with the outcomes of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome admitted to the ICU. The contents of mechanical ventilation settings, respiratory conditions, and the evidence-based ICU care, such as analgesia, sedation, rehabilitation, and nutrition, given to the patients will be collected in a daily basis.\nAim 1: Epidemiology Aim 2: Treatments Aim 3: Evidence-based ICU care Aim 4: ARDS related Post Intensive Care Syndrome",

        "summary": "In France, about 5000 new people with a primary malignant brain tumor are diagnosed each year. The most common primary tumors are gliomas, originating from glial cells (astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas). Low-grade gliomas are mildly aggressive, but they often evolve into a more malignant form.\nMutations in the genes encoding isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) are found in about 80% of low-grade gliomas and are associated with a favorable prognosis. Remarkably, IDH-mutated gliomas are characterized by a specific cellular metabolism causing the accumulation of D-2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) in tumor cells. 2HG can be detected in vivo using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and is recognized as a unique, noninvasive biomarker of IDH-mutated gliomas. Noninvasive detection of IDH mutations via 2HG MRS represents a crucial step for decision-making and patient care.\nA subset of IDH-mutated tumors also presents a complete deletion of 1p and 19q chromosome arms (1p/19q codeletion). The 1p/19q codeletion is specifically linked to the oligodendroglial histologic subtype and it has been associated with a better patient outcome. However, the biological effects of this genetic alteration are still unclear and in vivo markers are lacking. Recently, we reported the first in vivo detection of the cystathionine molecule in human brain gliomas using MRS and explored the association between cystathionine accumulation and 1p/19q codeletion in gliomas.\nIn this project, the investigation team will combine cutting edge MRI and MRS techniques for metabolic and microstructural characterization of brain tumors with the aim of providing novel reliable noninvasive biomarkers of tumor genetic subtypes. These methods will enable noninvasive identification of IDH-mutated gliomas and, potentially, 1p/19q codeleted gliomas. In addition, the researchers will investigate the utility of 2HG, cystathionine and MRI microstructural markers to monitor tumor response to anti-cancer treatments and tumor progression.\nThe outputs of this project, altogether, may open new avenues to a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of oncogenesis and the design of new treatments for gliomas.",

        "summary": "Despite progress in chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-SCT) is still the only curative procedure for some hematological malignancies. The probability of finding a matched sibling donor (MSD) is estimated under the classical 30%, because of the age of patients and their relatives, and a matched unrelated donor (MUD) can take time to identify. Currently in France, 25% of the allo-SCT are performed with an haplo-identical related donor. The Baltimore group developed an approach using haploidentical related donors, RIC, T-replete bone marrow and post-transplant high dose cyclophosphamide (PTCy) in patients with advanced hematological malignancies. PTCy has shown to eradicate alloreactive donor and host T-cells, activated by respective antigens, thereby reducing the incidence of graft versus host disease (GvHD) but delaying hematopoietic recovery. Therefore, the main source of graft is peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) mobilized by G-CSF in France. Unfortunately, with PBSC we observe a higher cumulative incidence of GvHD (around 50%) and a higher toxicity-related mortality (TRM), especially for recipients >50 years old. The co-transplantation of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSC) at the time of transplantation has previously shown a double interest in GvHD immunomodulation and hematopoiesis support. Pre-clinical studies (in mice) have shown that mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) from Wharton's Jelly reduce the incidence of GvHD when the infusions are weekly repeated.

        "summary": "Dentists have recently preferred to use composite materials and restorative techniques that allow the use of simplified clinical protocols in order to reduce the time the patient spends in the dentist's chair and minimize technical sensitivity. Color selection in the clinic is a very sensitive process and is affected by environmental factors and operator-related variables. This has led to the development of single-color universal composite resins that aim to facilitate color selection. These materials have a universal opacity and several Vita shades and are recommended by manufacturers to be used in a single color layer that can match different tooth colors. In recent years, monochromatic universal composites have been developed that are supposed to be compatible with all Vita Classic Scale shades from A1 to D4. Manufacturers report that single-color universal composites can be applied to teeth of all colors without using the layering technique using different color composites.\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of 2 different single-color universal composite resin materials (OMNICHROMA and Zenchroma) in the restoration of non-carious cervical lesions with the control group (Filtek Z250, 3M), which is a multi-color composite resin material, using modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) and World Dental Federation (FDI) criteria.",

        "summary": "Up to 60% of endometrial cancer cases are attributed to obesity, in part because obesity promotes development of atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), and up to 40% of women with AEH go on to develop endometrial cancer. The increasing prevalence of obesity in premenopausal women has resulted in increasing rates of AEH in this age group. Hysterectomy with removal of the fallopian tubes and ovaries is 100% effective in preventing endometrial cancer, but this approach results in infertility. Fertility-sparing treatments exist, such as treatment with oral or intrauterine progestin, but these treatments do not work uniformly and do not combat the underlying cause of endometrial cancer, which is obesity and metabolic syndrome. Additionally, up to 41% of women on progestin eventually experience relapse of AEH or endometrial cancer. Third, many patients have insulin resistance that may worsen with progestin therapy. Thus, to improve treatment of AEH and grade 1 endometrial cancer, prevent and reverse endometrial cancer, and allow women to preserve their fertility, the investigators must integrate an effective weight loss strategy to be given with progestin treatment. It is the hypothesis that premenopausal women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer who desire uterine preservation will be more likely to have atypia-free uterine preservation at two years if they receive progestin in combination with a behavioral weight loss intervention versus progestin plus enhanced usual care.",

Improving sleep quality in critically ill patients is a major challenge to promote ICU patient's recovery.\nA very promising treatment is the application of a nocturnal  quiet-time  during which non urgent care, comfort care, systematic measures of vital parameters are delayed and clustered in order to limit room entries. However,  quiet time  procedures have failed to improve sleep quality to date.\nA miniaturized medical device recording one EEG channel and embedding an automated sleep scoring algorithm running in real-time was devised. This device (positioned on forehead, and continuously recording noise and light levels) indicates if the patient is awake or asleep using a tablet positioned at doorstep of the room, so that nurses know if patient is sleeping, without entering the room.\nHypothesis proposes that applying sleep protection procedures (clustering cares, limiting room entries, reducing lights and noise, delaying non urgent care\u2026) when patients are sleeping (= EEG-guided strategies) will increase patients sleep quality.\nThis study will assess the effect of such device on sleep quality in ICU patients.

At present, a functional cure, also known as clinical cure or sustained Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) loss, is recommended as the ideal endpoint of HBV treatment. However, HBsAg loss can be achieved in less than 10% of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients treated with current available antiviral drug interferon (IFN\u03b1) or nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) monotherapy. With the support of the national major special funding for infectious diseases from 11th Five-Year Plan to 13th Five-Year Plan, we have implemented a pioneer clinical study of sequential combination of IFN\u03b1 therapy on NAs to treat NAs-treated CHB patients (ie. New Switch Study). This is the world's first clinical trial aiming to functional cure, which increased the rate of HBsAg loss to 15% in the overall population in our study, and to 30-50% among those with lower baseline HBsAg levels. How to further improve the HBsAg loss rate is an urgent issue for us. The key point of achieving functional cure is to reverse the HBV-specific T cell exhaustion and establish the long-term immune control against HBV infection. (Programmed death-1) PD-1/programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis blockade has been demonstrated to reinvigorate exhausted CD8+ T cells, and would be a potential strategy to treat chronic HBV infection. In this study, a large multicenter prospective study will be performed to explore the safety and efficacy of a novel combination strategy involving immune checkpoint inhibitor (anti-PD-1 antibody) and IFN\u03b1 in CHB patients, observe the HBsAg loss rate in NA-treated CHB patients receiving this combination strategy, evaluate the potential of breaking immune tolerance by this strategy, and further assess its efficacy to further improve the clinical cure rate on the basis of New Switch Study. Based on New Switch Study, this study further attempts to reverse T cell exhaustion in CHB patients, explore a novel platform of combination therapy development for clinical cure, and ultimately increase the HBsAg loss rate to higher than 50% in overall patients.

After birth, a symbiotic relationship develops with the strains of bacteria that colonise our gut, and the presence and proportion of bacteria is individualised and highly variable.\nA healthy bacterial flora is essential for the cells of the intestinal mucosa. Glycoproteins in the cell surface mucus coat are important nutrients for bacteria, while some bacterial strains supply mucosal cells with nutrient molecules (e.g. short-chain fatty acids) that are their essential energy source.\nAn abnormal change in the proportion of bacterial strains that make up the microbiome, dysbacteriosis, in which pathogenic bacteria proliferate at the expense of members of the normal flora, can cause a number of pathologies. Nutrient supply to the cells of the mucosa is reduced, making them more vulnerable and leading to various pathological conditions.\nThe microbiome and the essential nutrients they produce have also been found to play an important role in wound healing. A decrease in the diversity of the microbiome, an increase in the relative number of pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in the proportion of 'beneficial' bacteria increases the risk of surgical complications of infection and suture failure.",

        "summary": "Over 65% of all lung cancer patients experience significant weight loss fuelled by a catabolic state that is represented by enhanced protein breakdown. The metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients. Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS). An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.\nThe investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.\nThe primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period.

        "summary": "Background: Parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDDs) have a tendency to provide insufficient caregiving and often need parenting support to prevent neglect and child removal. However, parents with IDDs are not provided with appropriate support, and there is a lack of evidence-based programmes tailored to these parents' needs. Parenting Young Children (PYC) is a home-based parenting programme developed for parents with IDDs. PYC has shown promising clinical results in interview-based studies, but there is no evidence of its effectiveness. The purpose of the proposed study is to evaluate the PYC programme for improving parenting in parents with IDDs where there is risk of child neglect. The study will include a quantitative evaluation, a process evaluation, and a qualitative evaluation of the children's and parents' perspectives on participating in PYC.\nMethods: The quantitative evaluation will have a multi-centre, non-randomised, comparative study design. Eligible for participation are parents with IDDs who have children aged 0-9 years living at home and who are assessed as needing tailored parenting support. Thirty parents receiving PYC and thirty parents receiving treatment as usual (TAU) will be recruited from Swedish municipal social services. Outcome variables will be examined before and after the intervention, with a follow-up 6 months after completing the intervention. The primary outcome will be goal-attainment in parenting skills, and secondary outcomes will be parental self-efficacy and children's wellbeing. Interview methods will be used to explore the perspectives of parents and children in the PYC group.\nDiscussion: This study is motivated by the need for evidence-based support for parents with IDDs, and it focuses on upholding the centrality of child-caregiver relationships and family preservation, as well as children's rights and the rights of people with disabilities. Social services have expressed ethical concerns with employing a randomized design for this vulnerable group, and this study will therefore evaluate PYC in a non-randomized comparative study.",

        "summary": "Bacterial blood stream infections are common and life-threatening. Bloodstream infections have historically been identified using blood cultures, which often take 24-72 hours to result and are imperfectly sensitive. Early administration of antimicrobial therapy is a fundamental component of the management of adults presenting to the hospital with a suspected bloodstream infection and/or sepsis.\nBut because blood cultures frequently take 24-72 hours to result, patients are typically treated with empiric, broad spectrum antibiotics. In a meta-analysis of sepsis studies, empirical antibiotic therapy was inappropriate for the organism that ultimately grew in culture in almost half of patients. Thus, patients are commonly exposed to unnecessary antibiotics without evidence of infection or with evidence of infection requiring narrow antibiotic selection. For example, current guidelines recommend the use of empiric intravenous vancomycin as coverage for a bloodstream infection caused by the bacterial pathogen methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Vancomycin requires careful monitoring due to its narrow therapeutic range and high risk of toxicity. Administration of vancomycin to patients who do not have MRSA can lead to avoidable adverse drug events and costs, as well as drive antimicrobial resistance.\nThere has been increasing interest in using rapid diagnostic tests that identify bacteria directly from whole blood samples without relying on growth in culture, referred to as direct-from-blood tests, to guide early therapeutic management of patients with suspected bloodstream infections in addition to standard blood cultures. One such FDA-approved, direct-from-blood test is the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel. This panel's performance as a direct-from blood test for bacterial pathogens has been described in previous studies. A recent meta-analysis of largely observational studies reported a faster transition to targeted microbial therapy and de-escalation of empirical microbial therapy, as well as a shorter duration of intensive care unit stay and hospital stay for patients who received this direct-from-blood test.\nWe will conduct a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial examining the effect of using the T2Bacteria\u00ae Panel direct from-blood testing, compared to using blood cultures alone (standard of care), on antimicrobial receipt and clinical outcomes for adults presenting to the hospital with suspected infection and who have been initiated on empiric therapy with intravenous vancomycin.",

Studies have revealed that neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, abnormal lipid metabolism and impaired vascularization, which play a role in the pathogenesis of MetS, affect the structure of the brain and cognition. Atherosclerosis of the carotid artery, increased brain atrophy and white matter damage are potential explanatory mechanisms that lead to an impact on cognitive skills in patients with MetS. In addition, the existence of MetS components such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension alone also negatively affects cognitive functions, and the level of cognitive influence also increases as the number of components an individual has increases.\nThe literature reports that learning, executive functions, processing speed, attention/working memory and global cognitive functions are affected in individuals with MetS, but no consensus has been reached on this issue.

        "summary": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a mis/disinformation ecosystem that promotes divergent views of vaccine efficacy, as well as the legitimacy of science and medicine. Individuals are confronted with vaccine-related information from a multitude of sources, posing a challenge to identifying inaccurate information. COVID-19 vaccine uptake is lower among people with anxiety and depression than in the general population, due in part to higher levels of vaccine hesitancy. The prevalence of anxiety and depressive symptoms among US adults increased significantly during the COVID pandemic and has remained elevated. Interventions capable of mitigating the impact of vaccine hesitancy and mis/disinformation among undervaccinated people with anxiety or depression are therefore an urgent priority. Emerging evidence suggests that reasons for vaccine hesitancy and the impact of conventional vaccination messaging differ between those with and without mental health symptoms. There may also be added challenges overcoming logistical barriers to vaccination for people with anxiety or depressive symptoms.\nThe investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of two different brief digital intervention strategies compared with conventional public health messaging for increasing vaccine uptake in undervaccinated adults with and without anxiety or depressive symptoms. Attitudinal inoculation is a brief, scalable strategy that leverages the power of narrative, values, and emotion to strengthen resistance to mis/disinformation and reduce hesitancy. Though this approach has been shown to decrease COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among US adults, the extent to which this approach increases COVID-19 vaccination remains unknown. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based intervention for anxiety and depression. However, the efficacy of incorporating CBT-informed messaging in a vaccine promotion intervention has not been tested. The investigators hypothesize that both attitudinal inoculation and CBT-style communication will be more effective than conventional public health messaging to increase COVID-19 vaccination. The investigators also hypothesize that the CBT-informed intervention will be more effective than the attitudinal inoculation intervention for increasing COVID-19 vaccination among participants with symptoms of anxiety or depression.",

        "summary": "Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a complex clinical syndrome caused by cardiac abnormalities compromising the ability of the heart to provide a blood supply adequate to the metabolic needs of peripheral tissues. ADHF is characterized by systemic and pulmonary fluid retention, with weight gain, peripheral edema, needing diuretic therapy. Moreover, ADHF is associated with neurohormonal hyper-activation with enhanced sympathetic nervous and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems stimulation, that sustain the vicious circle of cardiac dysfunction and fluid retention.\nThe administration of high doses of diuretics, usually required in ADHF treatment, can induce hypovolemia-induced neurohormonal activation and transient deterioration of kidney function, that, in turn, counteracts the effect of diuretics and limits recovery from fluid overload.\nThe investigators hypothesized that, in patients with ADHF, a more controlled and physiologically-oriented dehydration may blunt diuretic-associated neurohormonal activation, thus providing a safer and more sustained clinical benefit. This controlled dehydration can be achieved by combining furosemide with the RenalGuard System (see The RenalGuard\u2122 System Operator's Manual for specific instructions in setting up and running the device). To date, no data have been provided regarding the potential beneficial effect of this therapeutic strategy in patients with ADHF and fluid overload. Much of the evidences on the use of the RenalGuard system comes from the clinical setting of acute kidney injury (AKI) prevention in patients undergoing intravascular contrast exposure. In this specific field, furosemide-induced high-volume diuresis with concurrent maintenance of intravascular volume through matched hydration, by the RenalGuard System, is now considered by current Guidelines a recommended strategy for AKI prevention in patients with chronic renal failure undergoing coronary interventional procedures. Based on this experience, the investigators will assess the safety and efficacy of this known system capable of delivering intravenous fluid in an amount exactly pre-determined, considering the volume of urine produced by the patient and precisely weighed by the system. This could prevent hypovolemia that may occur in response to high-volume diuresis induced by furosemide. The researchers will perform a spontaneous, prospective, randomized trial aiming at investigating the effect of combined furosemide-induced diuresis and automated matched dehydration, compared with standard furosemide administration in ADHF patients with fluid overload.",

        "summary": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is estimated to become the second leading cause of cancer-related death by 2030. Effective management of PDAC is challenged by a combination of late diagnosis, lack of effective screening methods and high risk of early metastasis. Although systemic chemotherapy improves survival, 5-year survival is only 6%. Chemotherapy efficacy is attenuated by innate and acquired drug resistance of tumor cells, a strong desmoplastic reaction that limits local accessibility of drugs and a cold tumor microenvironment (TME) with high infiltrating levels of immunosuppressive cells. In PDAC, increased T cell exhaustion defined by increased PD-1/PD-L1 activity in both peripheral blood and tumor microenvironment, is associated with poor prognosis. Hence the rationale for targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 axis with the aim to release the brake and exert an anti-tumor response. In PDAC successful results with Immune Checkpoint Inhibition (ICI) monotherapy are limited and combination therapy with other agents is encouraged; specifically agents that induce dendritic cell priming. We hypothesize that combination therapy of ICI therapy with a toll like receptor 3 (TLR-3) agonist is a potential effective strategy. TLR-3 agonists are hypothesized to increase dendritic cell maturation and cross-priming na\u00efve cytotoxic CD8 T cells while eliminating regulatory T-cell attraction, thereby acting as an immune-boosting agent. We propose that rintatolimod/durvalumab-combination therapy is feasible and may induce synergistic anti-tumor immune responses in PDAC.",

        "summary": "The potential benefits of exercise for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases and pain have been well documented in the scientific literature. Psychiatric, neurological, metabolic and cardiovascular diseases are examples of conditions that impact the health and quality of life of the population. Due to the effects provided by exercise, it can modify the natural course of these diseases. This concept is important to justify the efforts made by government bodies committed to promoting exercise, such as the WHO. However, the habitual practice of physical activity following the primary guidelines may be hampered by some factors, including those that support the physiological repercussions of exercise on the body, such as muscle pain. In this sense, an important complicating factor such as delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS), present in the post-exercise recovery period, can impair adherence and permanence in physical activity programs, thus representing a considerable barrier to exercise promotion. They can also severely impair the performance of high-level athletes. Flavonoids, present in plants, but also in foods of the human diet, are known to have several biological properties, including analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects. Currently, there are still few studies that have evaluated the effects of flavonoids on the development and evolution of DOMS in humans.",

The treatment guidelines recommend combining the pharmacological treatment with psychotherapeutic methods, starting already in the acute phase. At the same time, there is little research evidence on which mechanisms of psychotherapy are most effective and best feasible for the acute setting. Therefore, we want to run a pilot study to test specific psychotherapeutic interventions for patients with psychosis on acute psychiatric wards.\nThe method of Motivational Interviewing is a well-known and established interviewing technique, which originally comes from the treatment of addictive disorders. In our study, it is used to strengthen the therapeutic alliance between patient and practitioner already in the acute phase of the disease, to increase adherence, and thus to achieve the overall goal of better integrating patients with pronounced positive symptoms into treatment. This appears to be extremely important, as non-adherence represents one of the greatest risks for chronification of the disease.

        "summary": "Schizophrenia represents a significant contributor to the global burden of disease, with this burden disproportionately impacting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In India, the burden due to schizophrenia is further exacerbated by low access to effective psychosocial interventions aimed at promoting recovery, rehabilitation, and community tenure, as well as inadequate attention to managing co-occurring chronic medical conditions that result in significantly reduced life expectancy among those living with schizophrenia compared to the general population. A major driver of these alarming gaps in access to care for persons with schizophrenia in India is the limited capacity within primary care settings aimed at addressing the complex co-occurring mental health, physical health, and functional needs of this patient population. There now exists strong evidence demonstrating that community programs delivered in primary care and leveraging psychosocial interventions combined with linkage to specialty psychiatric services are effective for supporting treatment and recovery of schizophrenia in low-resource settings. We will leverage our existing collaboration and robust research infrastructure in both rural and urban settings in Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, India to conduct a hybrid type 1 effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate whether the use of a digital platform offers added clinical benefit and can support integration of this task shared care for schizophrenia into routine primary care settings.

For this reason, midwife students should have the knowledge, skills and self-efficacy about a good level of EFM monitoring during their undergraduate education. In recent years, simulation-based education in the field of health has increased rapidly. This method creates an opportunity for health professionals, students, patient assessment, interaction and holistic care without compromising patient safety, and develops participants' critical thinking, clinical decision making and problem solving skills.\nIn this context, it is very important to evaluate the EFM trace in the antepartum and intrapartum periods, to determine the possible risks, to plan, implement and evaluate the interventions, to provide the emergency crisis management in a short time without affecting the fetal health, and to increase the self-confidence of the midwives.\nThe research was planned quantitatively in the form of randomized control-intervention of the scenario-based realistic simulation method, to increase the satisfaction and self-confidence levels of midwifery students in learning, to evaluate the simulation design and educational effectiveness, in EFM management. The research will facilitate midwifery students to intervene with the patient in a shorter time, with confidence and with sufficient clinical skills, and patient safety will be increased.

The biopolymer consists essentially of two types of polysaccharide chains: chitin (poly-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) and beta-(1,3)-D-glucan (D-glucose units linked essentially via beta-1,3 bonds). Because of its beta bond, human intestinal enzymes cannot digest it, as a result, the majority of chitin-glucan can reach the colon where it can be fermented by the microbiota.\nBy modulating the composition and/or activity of the intestinal microbiota, fermentation of chitin-glucan could have beneficial effects on health.\nThe aim of the RELIEVE study is to assess if BK003 could improve the relief of global symptoms, individual symptoms, stool consistency and frequency of evacuations, quality of life, anxiety, and depression in patients with Crohn's disease in remission without treatment or with stable maintenance therapy and having IBS-like symptoms and to confirm the product's safety.",

        "summary": "The unexpected changes caused by the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer can lead individuals to question their beliefs, life meanings, and goals, prompting a search for meaning. According to Park and Folkman's (1997) Meaning-Making Model, the process of meaning making functions as a coping mechanism. It helps individuals adapt challenging experiences into their lives, ultimately assisting in their psychological adjustment to stressful situations. Based on this theoretical model, principles from meaning therapy (Wong, 2010), literature reviews, interviews with breast cancer patients, and expert consultation, an 8-week online individual psychological intervention was developed. It was aimed at facilitating the finding of new meanings in the experience of breast cancer and promoting psychological well-being. It includes psycho-educational, cognitive, existential, and behavioral components explicitly focusing on the meaning-making process. This intervention is called the Meaning Centered Coping Program (MCCP). The main purpose of this study was to test whether the MCCP was an effective intervention program for women diagnosed with breast cancer. For this purpose, the study sample consisted of women with stage I, II, and III breast cancer. Then, participants were randomly assigned to the MCCP group and the wait-list control group. A number of reliable and valid measurement tools were used to compare the MCCP group with the waitlist control group and to examine the effect of the program. Compared with the control group, significant improvements were expected in the level of meaning in life, post-traumatic growth, situational meanings, psychological inflexibility, and psychological well-being in the MCCP group.",

Hypothyroidism can have multiple causes; most patients suffer from primary autoimmune hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma, or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease occur. Most patients with hypothyroidism are treated with levothyroxine (L-T4) to supplement the lack of thyroxine (T4) produced by their own thyroid. Serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are currently measured to assess the efficacy of this therapy and to establish euthyroidism. It is known that fT4 concentrations in patients using L-T4 can be above the upper limit of the reference interval, while their TSH is not (completely) suppressed. This raises the question whether fT4 is an accurate reflection of thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4. TSH is considered a reliable parameter of thyroid hormone status; however, TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid function in specific hypothyroid patient groups (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Free triiodothyronine (fT3), the active thyroid hormone, has been suggested to be an interesting alternative of fT4 to assess thyroid function. Previously, the methods to measure fT3 were not that robust; however, methods to determine fT3 have been improved, are currently reliable and not susceptible to changes due to L-T4 intake. In addition, the fT3/fT4 ratio is thought to be an interesting candidate in assessing thyroid hormone status as well. The aim of this study is to improve laboratory diagnostics of thyroid hormone status in patients with hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status. We will primarily investigate the additional already available laboratory tests fT3 and fT3/fT4 ratio. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using L-T4 in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status.",

        "summary": "After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients.\nGenerating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation.\nWe aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma.",

        "summary": "This phase III trial compares the effects of shorter chemotherapy (chemo)-immunotherapy without anthracyclines to usual chemo-immunotherapy for the treatment of early-stage triple negative breast cancer. Paclitaxel is in a class of medications called anti-microtubule agents. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Carboplatin is in a class of medications known as platinum-containing compounds. It works in a way similar to the anticancer drug cisplatin, but may be better tolerated than cisplatin. Carboplatin works by killing, stopping or slowing the growth of cancer cells. Cyclophosphamide is in a class of medications called alkylating agents. It works by damaging the cell's deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill cancer cells. It may also lower the body's immune response. Docetaxel is in a class of medications called taxanes. It stops cancer cells from growing and dividing and may kill them. Doxorubicin is an anthracycline chemotherapy drug that damages DNA and may kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Shorter treatment without anthracycline chemotherapy may work the same as the usual anthracycline chemotherapy treatment for early-stage triple negative breast cancer.",

        "summary": "The proposed project seeks to achieve four objectives that will, collectively, evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP-1) -a model for a home visitation and case management program for parents who used substances during pregnancy. First, the proposed project aims to estimate the causal impact of PCAP-1 on preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. Second, the project will estimate PCAP-1's effectiveness in achieving other program goals: parent recovery, parent's connection with needed comprehensive community resources, and preventing future children from being exposed to drugs and alcohol prenatally. Third, the project intends to estimate any cost savings from the perspective of the state. Finally, causal evidence of program effectiveness across the prior three objectives would enable PCAP-1 to be rated according to strength of evidence on relevant federal registries (i.e., FFPSA and HOMEVEE). All four objectives will be pursued by leveraging an ongoing randomized control trial (RCT) of PCAP with substantial backing from public and private partners, including the Oklahoma Department of Human Services (OK's Title IV-E agency). This quasi-experimental project will recruit 40 new participants to receive PCAP-1 services and will use data on participants from the existing trial for the control group. This extension of the original RCT is efficient and highly feasible, drawing upon and adapting an existing evaluation framework and protocol. This design will facilitate an unbiased estimation of one-year program effectiveness while also enabling a comparison of the differential effectiveness of PCAP-1 and the original three-year PCAP model as a secondary benefit. Moreover, given that the population PCAP serves are disproportionately poor and low-income and PCAP is designed to be culturally competent and relevant, PCAP-1 harbors the potential to address inequities in child welfare outcomes, substance use disorder treatment services, and child and family well- being by improving outcomes for these families. With a strong backing by state agencies and community partners, the evaluation of PCAP-1 will contribute to a knowledge gap in the field for in-home program models serving a highly vulnerable population with high rates of child welfare involvement and use of foster care.",

        "summary": "Admission to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) is well-recognized to be extremely distressing and stressful for the patient and family. As medical research and technology have advanced more and more children in the PICU are surviving, however in turn incurring new and persistent impairments across physical, cognitive, emotional, and social domains of health. This phenomenon is often referred to as post-intensive care syndrome (PICS). These impairments not only impact the patient but parents have also been found to have poor emotional health outcomes following discharge from the PICU.\nConsistently, parents/caregivers of children admitted to the PICU report their primary concerns to be 1) the overwhelming physical environment of the PICU, 2) uncertainty about the child's survivorship and outcomes, 3) relationships and communication with staff, and 4) feeling helpless. Additionally, research has shown that caregiver-perceived stress during the child's hospitalization positively predicts post-traumatic stress three months after discharge for parents/caregivers (Nelson et al., 2019), which may translate into higher risk and duration of post-traumatic stress in their children. Therefore, providing an in-hospital outlet such as a PICU Journal for patients and families to express their subjective experiences may help bridge the gap between perception and reality as a means of buffering against post-traumatic responses. Conceptually, a semi-structured journal intervention may integrate the therapeutic aspects of journaling while also providing pertinent information and serving as an advocacy and communication tool. Prior research has demonstrated the use of a PICU Journal is feasible for implementation and has been well-received by families of children in the PICU (Herrup et al., 2019).\nTherefore, the aims of this mixed-method study are to 1) examine the relationship between this journaling intervention and the perceived stress, care engagement, symptoms of anxiety, and depression, and the development of PICS in parents of children hospitalized in the PICU, and 2) examine the relationship between parent participation in this intervention and the development of PICS-p in children, and 3) assess the feasibility of this intervention from key stakeholders.",

Spatial neglect prevents them from functioning independently, and their needs in the hospital and at home are greatly increased. An effective treatment for spatial neglect is 10 days of visuomotor training while wearing optical prisms (PAT), however many clinicians [fail to diagnose spatial neglect and use this approach. In this study, the investigators will develop a brain scanning test that could objectively identify the Veterans with spatial neglect after stroke who are the best candidates to receive PAT and recover their ability to function.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as zimberelimab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Quemliclustat acts as a blocker for adenosine. Adenosine is a chemical produced in the body that can lead to a decrease in the immune system's response towards cancer. Quemliclustat has the potential to decrease the amount of adenosine, allowing the immune system to recognize and act against the cancer. Chemotherapy drugs, such as oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and fluorouracil, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

        "summary": "Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) is the most common congenital malformation, with about one in 500 children born with CL/P in Sweden, corresponding to approximately 175 births annually. Depending on the extent of the cleft palate, the degree of functional loss varies, but both eating, hearing, speech, bite and appearance can be affected.\nPatients treated for isolated or combined cleft palate may suffer from velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI), which means difficulties in closing the passage between the oral and nasal cavities during speech. Velopharyngeal insufficiency is associated with hypernasality, audible nasal air leakage and weak articulation, which might lead to difficulties with communication and social stigmatization.\nThe most common form of speech-improving surgery is a posterior based velopharyngeal flap, creating a bridge between the palate and the posterior pharyngeal wall to more easily compensate for the abnormal airflow through the nose during speech. However, surgical management of VPI is challenging, with variable success rates reported in the literature. In a retrospectively based questionnaire study on patients who underwent surgical treatment of VPI, 30% experienced only a small speech improvement or no improvement at all. In addition, postoperative speech impairment have also been reported, as well as perioperative bleeding and postoperative sleep apnea. Thus, selecting the patients who benefit most from speech-improving surgery is therefore of great importance.\nThe aim with the current study is evaluation of speech function through patient- and parent-response outcome measurements following surgical treatment of velopharyngeal insufficiency in children with isolated or combined cleft palate.",

        "summary": "Hysterectomy is one of the most common surgical procedures performed worldwide, with more than 400,000 hysterectomies performed annually in the United States. As a consequence, even uncommon complications can affect large numbers of patients. Among potentially life-threatening events, vaginal cuff dehiscence complicates 0.14-1.38% of procedures, and any vaginal cuff complications (dehiscence, hematoma, bleeding, infection) are estimated to affect 4.7-9.8% of patients. In this scenario, any preventive strategy can provide clinically relevant benefits. Regarding colporrhaphy, only the adoption of a laparoscopic approach instead of a vaginal approach is supported by high-quality evidence. Our group demonstrated that the laparoscopic closure of the vaginal cuff after total laparoscopic hysterectomy reduces the incidence of vaginal cuff complications.\nAmong other potentially effective interventions, the use of barbed sutures was associated with a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence than the standard suture. In a recent meta-analysis, the use of barbed sutures has been associated with a pooled incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence of 0.4% versus 2% after a traditional vaginal suture. However, this evidence is limited because most pooled studies were retrospective, and only two were randomized controlled trials. Moreover, these two randomized controlled trials had a very small sample size and were not powered to detect clinically relevant differences. On that basis, despite the promising utility of barbed sutures for vaginal cuff closure after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the choice of the type of suture is not evidence-based but still guided by personal opinions, as well as by the preference and habits of the operators.\nTherefore, this study aims to investigate whether the laparoscopic vaginal cuff closure with barbed suture determines a lower incidence of vaginal cuff dehiscence and complications than conventional sutures after total laparoscopic hysterectomy.",

Vision is an important and defining element of laparoscopy and significantly affects the outcome of an operation in regard to time, mistakes and precision. Several new imaging systems have become available for laparoscopic surgery, including three-dimensional (3D) high-definition (HD), and two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high-resolution (4K) monitors. In experimental and clinical settings, several studies have been published in recent years suggesting that 3D systems present a number of potential benefits for surgeons and patients compared to the conventional 2D systems. The 3D HD system significantly reduces operation time and blood loss, and additionally shortens hospital stay. However, the performance of 3D systems against the new, ultra-high-definition 4K systems is barely known and highly controversial. There is a paucity of studies comparing these two imaging systems in clinical settings. The goal of this clinical trial is to compare 2D 4K versus 3D HD imaging systems in a complex bariatric surgery, more precisely a gastric bypass operation.

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing quick access to transactions, providing ease of use and sometimes as a status indicator, can pose a risk of addiction when used uncontrolled. Since young people are more intertwined with technology and use smartphones more, they are at greater risk of addiction and the problems that addiction can cause. Poor sleep quality is an important problem that can occur with smartphone addiction and negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Smartphone addiction and the problems it causes are an important public health problem that threatens the whole society, especially young people. In solving this problem, it is among the duties of nurses to teach individuals healthy lifestyle behaviors instead of problematic behaviors. A road map is needed to facilitate the behavior change process. Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is widely used today to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which targets interventions appropriate to the individual's stage of change, is used as a guide that facilitates behavioral change. TTM is a model that contributes to change, accelerates it, and supports individuals considering change. In addition to TTM, another method that is more frequently used and contributes to change, especially in addicted individuals, is the motivational interviewing method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and aims to reveal the individual's internal motivation. It is thought that the university years, which are an important period in terms of developing and maintaining health-protective and preventive behaviors, will both increase students' health responsibility and protect them from health-threatening behaviors with the healthy lifestyle behaviors acquired during this period.

        "summary": "Although effective evidence-based interventions have been developed for alcohol and cannabis use disorders, it is still unclear which individuals respond best to treatment. A recent model known as the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANA) proposes that assessing for differences in three neurofunctional domains (executive function, incentive salience, and negative emotionality) could allow for a stronger neuroscience-based framework for understanding heterogeneity in response to addiction treatments but this has never been tested prospectively. In this study, we will recruit two groups: (1) participants with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and (2) participants with cannabis use disorder (CUD). Participants will undergo thorough baseline assessments of each of the three ANA domains prior to evidence-based treatment for their respective disorders. Individuals with AUD will be treated with 12 weeks of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for AUD plus optional pharmacotherapy guided by a pharmacotherapy algorithm. Individuals with CUD will be treated with 12 weeks of CBT + motivational enhancement therapy for CUD. The primary objective of the study is to assess whether baseline ANA measures are associated with changes in drug consumption and craving over treatment.",

        "summary": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most diagnosed cancer worldwide and second leading cause of cancer death. Most CRCs arise from a polyp, developing through two major precursor lesion pathways: the traditional adenoma-carcinoma pathway, and the serrated neoplasia pathway. This provides opportunities to prevent cancer by removing its precursor lesions. CRC screening efforts are directed toward removal of precancerous polyps with colonoscopy and detection of early-stage CRC, which has been demonstrated to reduce CRC incidence and mortality effectively, making CRC one of the most preventable and treatable forms of cancer.\nCurrent guidelines in China recommend starting CRC screening uniformly at age 50 in average-risk individuals. However, a one-fits-all approach to determining CRC screening starting age may be not conducive to personalized screening, especially in the developing countries with scarce health resources. The incidence of early-onset CRC (CRC diagnosed before the age of 50) has shown a continuous increasing trend worldwide, spurring the US Preventive Services Task Force to recommend initiating average-risk CRC screening at age 45 instead of 50. Furthermore, different populations may benefit from even earlier screening, and CRC incidence may differ on the basis of population characteristics and CRC risk factors. For individuals younger than 50 years old, earlier screening based on risk factors may address this concern.\nPrevious studies have recommended earlier starting age of CRC screening combined with risk factors such as but not limited to sex, age, family history, lifestyle and comorbidity. Some upper gastrointestinal diseases have also been reported to be associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasms, which may be related to the destruction of gastric acid barrier function and long-term use of pump proton inhibitors. Compared with colonoscopy examination, individuals were more willing to undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) examination for gastric cancer screening, especially among the younger, potentially utilizing the EGD to guide earlier colonoscopies for patients at increased risk. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the association between esophagogastric histopathology and colorectal neoplasms in patients under the age of 50 and whether these risks factor could be combined with to guide earlier CRC screening.",

        "summary": "Under normal conditions, pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. This peripheral activation is processed as perception of pain by the central nervous system. In order to reliably evaluate the state of the nociceptive system in both clinical and experimental settings, standardized tests are essential. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) is a set of tests used to measure the intensity of a stimulus that produces a specific sensory perception in a subject. For example, if we gradually apply pressure, the point where the sensation changes from pressure to pain is called the pressure pain threshold. This type of test can be performed with different types of stimuli, including hot and cold stimuli or mechanical stimuli. Although these tests have been shown as reliable in healthy volunteers and pain patients, they are subjective in their nature, since they are based on a conscious evaluation of tested subjects. Likewise, these measures show substantial variability due to differences in the application of the tests by individual examinators. In short, even though the method is quantitative, its methodological characteristics make it subjective and dependent on both the operator and the subject under study. Moreover, contrasting results have been recently found regarding the measurement variability when repeating the QST at intervals of days. Thus, it is essential to investigate and develop new QST alternatives to obtain objective markers that may potentially contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind chronic pain conditions.",

The study will use machine learning to develop the PTR, using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not. Specific Aim 2 (Cost-effectiveness Outcomes): To assess the costs of optimal vs. non-optimal treatments and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing relative costs and effectiveness between those who were randomly allocated to their optimal treatment with those who were randomly allocated to a non-optimal treatment, based on the PTR developed in Aim 1. The investigators hypothesize that optimizing will be more cost-effective than not. Exploratory Aim 1 (Mediators): To explore whether one can use the PTR to make our tests of mediation more precise. Patients who respond differentially to different treatments adhere to different causal mechanisms, and inclusion of the PTR in interaction terms with the purported mediators should facilitate the detection of moderated mediation among patients who show specificity of response. The investigators will also consider whether treatment-related factors (e.g., adherence, quality) act as mediators of the effects of each treatment on remission and recovery. This exploratory aim will offer insights into mechanisms of action for each treatment. Exploratory Aim 2 (Genetic Predictors): To explore whether polygenic risk scores and other biomarkers can enhance the prediction of both general and differential response to either treatment.",

The latter makes it possible to categorize patients according to their risk of generating atheromatous plaques and to classify them into several risk levels (groups) according to their score: low (<40th percentile), intermediate (between the 40th percentile and the 65th percentile: group III) or high risk (>65th percentile, group IV). 18F-Na PET scan can mark unstable coronary plaques. For the intermediate risk population who would demonstrate within 6 to 18 months after first calcium score either an increase of percentile of more than 20% or an increase above 20 points of the calcium score and for high risk population, 18F-Na PET scan will be recommended and repeated 6 months later.

        "summary": "In a society with increased life expectancy, the economic, social and personal burden of dementia increases. Dementia is often caused by a combination of neurovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Impaired brain clearance is suggested to be closely related to dementia development, as waste products (e.g. amyloid beta) accumulate in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the most common neurovascular disease that even contributes to about 45% of dementia pathophysiology in patients with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's dementia. White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are the key brain MRI manifestation of cerebral SVD. There is evidence that the currently known and MRI-visible WMH are landmarks of an already progressed stage of the underlying pathology. The pathophysiology of WMH has been attributed to multiple underlying mechanisms, such as hypoperfusion, defective cerebrovascular reactivity and blood-brain barrier dysfunction. Furthermore, different anatomical locations and different types of WMH are related to different underlying pathological changes. Using ultra-high field 7T MR imaging techniques WMH lesions can be detected with a higher sensitivity and resolution than on 3T MRI. The hypothesis is that different pathological mechanisms of cerebral SVD lead to variations in WMH shape. Moreover, the brain clearance ('glymphatic') system of the brain appears to be tightly connected to dementia pathology. Thus, novel markers of glymphatic activity could aid to describe and understand the pathology.",

In most cases, medical treatment has failed when surgery is discussed. If treatment with surgery then is delayed, complications may arise, such as fistula, severe inflammation with risk of perforation or stenosis, nutrition problems i.e. This may affect quality of life, and also make the surgery more complicated, with higher risk of per- and postoperative complications.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic led to a shift in resources where elective surgery has been postponed. The waiting time for elective surgery for IBD-patients at Sahlgrenska University Hospital/\u00d6stra is still affected which might have impact on patient health outcomes as well as health economics, due to the risk of complications and need of emergency and planned care while waiting for surgery.\nThe primary object is to evaluate how long an IBD patient can wait for surgery before affecting health economy and quality of life. In the operation program Orbit, we identify all patients with ulcerative colitits (UC) and Crohn\u00b4s disease (CD) that stands in line for elective surgery (not including dysplasia/cancer). The date when operation was decided is registered including time of delay. Patient characteristics are registered in CRF, including diagnosis, age and reason for scheduled surgery.

However, common genetic mutations are known for both diseases.\nThe aim of the study is to provide a scientific basis for molecular genetic NBS for cystinosis and primary hyperoxaluria (PH). Specifically, the study will investigate whether the inclusion of these diseases into general NBS should be recommended. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis.\nThe screening laboratory Hannover, Germany is involved in the project. Hospitals that send their dry blood spot cards for routine NBS to Hannover are offered participation in the project.\nParents who want to participate receive an additional information sheet. A parent and the attending physician sign the information sheet as documentation of informed consent, which allows data transfer and patient referral to a specialist in case of a positive result. Molecular genetic screening in the pilot project is performed from the same dry blood spot card used for routine NBS.\nIn both diseases, testing is performed for 2 known mutations: In cystinosis for the 2 mutations most common in Germany, and in PH for the most common mutation in infantile hyperoxaluria (PH1) and in Europe (PH3).\nNormal findings are not communicated to the parents, which may contact the laboratory to ask for them. Parents of newborns with two mutations in the cystinosis gene are immediately informed about the disease by a physician. Further diagnostics to confirm the disease are organized close to home.\nIn contrast, parents of newborns with only one mutation in one of the two hyperoxaluria genes are informed.

        "summary": "Kirsten rat sarcoma (KRAS) mutation is one of the most common genetic mutations associated with tumor development in various human cancers, including pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancer. Previous studies have shown that KRAS mutations are present in approximately 70% of pancreatic cancer patients, 35% of colorectal cancer patients, 20% of non-small cell lung cancer patients, and 15% of cervical cancer patients. Patients with KRAS mutations generally have a shorter overall survival and increased resistance to treatment compared to wild-type tumors. KRAS mutations have been known for decades, but they have been considered undruggable as effective therapies targeting them were lacking.\nPreclinical studies focusing on colorectal and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines have suggested that colorectal cancer cell lines exhibit a stronger response to EGFR signaling and activation of multiple RTKs (Receptor Tyrosine Kinases) than non-small cell lung cancer cell lines. As a result, they show poorer responses to KRAS G12C inhibitors, leading to the development of initial and acquired resistance to KRAS G12C inhibition. Based on this hypothesis, a phase 1-2 clinical trial, known as the KRYSTAL-1 study, was conducted in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. The study demonstrated that the objective response rate was 19% with adagrasib monotherapy and 46% with the combination of adagrasib and cetuximab (an EGFR inhibitor), indicating that the addition of an EGFR inhibitor can overcome resistance. Building on this hypothesis, a phase 3 trial is currently underway for KRAS G12C inhibition plus EGFR blockade in metastatic colorectal cancer (ClinicalTrials.gov identifiers: NCT04793958, NCT05198934).\nIn this study, the aim is to investigate the efficacy of sotorasib (KRAS G12C inhibitor) plus panitumumab (EGFR inhibitor) in patients with advanced solid tumors harboring KRAS G12C mutations, who have failed standard treatments.",

        "summary": "Gingival recessions (GR) are often associated with non-carious cervical lesions (NCCL), resulting, thus, in a combined defect. This mucogingival condition has a different treatment prognosis when compared with a GR without wearing surface associated and frequently requires a surgical-restorative approach to achieve better esthetics and functional results. A limited number of clinical studies assessed different multidisciplinary protocols for the management of single combined defects and there is evidence that the use of dental materials does not harm the periodontal tissues and does not influence the root coverage obtained by means of subepithelial connective tissue graft (CTG). Although the association between coronally advanced flap (CAF) and CTG provides more predictable and stable outcomes in the long term, its use is related to some drawbacks. Different biomaterials have been developed to overcome these limitations as a possible alternative to autogenous graft. However, despite its potential, there is a lack of studies evaluating its use in treating this type of condition. Thus, this study aims to assess from a clinical and esthetics point of view and patient-centered outcomes, the use of a new collagen matrix (Geistlich Fibro-Gide\u00ae) associated with CAF for the management of single combined defects. For such purpose, 50 patients with single RT1 gingival recessions associated with NCCL will be enrolled and randomly allocated to one of the following groups: control group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap for root coverage (PR+CAF) and test group (n=25), partial restoration of cervical lesion and coronally advanced flap associated with volume stable collagen matrix (PR+CAF+VCMX). The two groups will be compared regarding the clinical parameters, among which bleeding on probing (BOP), biofilm accumulation (IP), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession reduction (RecRed), and the percentage of combined defect coverage (%CDC). Patient-reported outcomes such as post-surgery pain and discomfort, time to recover, the decrease of dentin hypersensitive, and aesthetics will be gathered. A professional assessment will be carried out regarding the aesthetic parameters. All these evaluations will be performed at the baseline and three and six months postoperatively.",

The morbidity is high, both digestive and neurological. ECUN can lead to complications at short-term (death, intestinal stenosis) and at long-term (neuro-cognitive disorders). The challenge of preserving the neurological development is a major issue. It involves control of inflammation. This inflammation causes neurological lesions and is responsible for a disorder of the long-term neurocognitive development.\nAt Robert-Debr\u00e9 and Trousseau, the management of newborns with ECUN is focused on the control of this inflammation.

        "summary": "Visual impairment is one of the ten most prevalent causes of disability and poses extraordinary challenges to individuals in our society that relies heavily on sight. Living with acquired blindness not only lowers the quality of life of these individuals, but also strains society's limited resources for assistance, care and rehabilitation. However, to date, there is no effective treatment for man patients who are visually handicapped as a result of degeneration or damage to the inner layers of the retina, the optic nerve or the visual pathways. Therefore, there are compelling reasons to pursue the development of a cortical visual prosthesis capable of restoring some useful sight in these profoundly blind patients.\nHowever, the quality of current prosthetic vision is still rudimentary. A major outstanding challenge is translating electrode stimulation into a code that the brain can understand. Interactions between the device electronics and the retinal neurophysiology lead to distortions that can severely limit the quality of the generated visual experience. Rather than aiming to one day restore natural vision (which may remain elusive until the neural code of vision is fully understood), one might be better off thinking about how to create practical and useful artificial vision now.\nThe goal of this work is to address fundamental questions that will allow the development of a Smart Bionic Eye, a device that relies on AI-powered scene understanding to augment the visual scene (similar to the Microsoft HoloLens), tailored to specific real-world tasks that are known to diminish the quality of life of people who are blind (e.g., face recognition, outdoor navigation, reading, self-care).",

The study will involve basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH) designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when using an external computer to directly specify pulse trains (e.g., send a 1 s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12 of an Argus II implant). Important parameters for safety include a) pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), b) charge density should be limited. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust to extremely high rates of stimulation and high current levels.

        "summary": "Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) have long been linked to mental health problems in adulthood. In the case of cancer, no study has considered that such an anteriority could make patients more vulnerable emotionally, even though the presence of reactionary disorders such as stress, anxiety or depression are characteristic of such a pathology. Activated during periods of stress and therefore during the illness, even the attachment system is mobilized and must be considered to allow more understanding of the illness experience. The attachment style can be seen here as an individual dimension that plays a role in the emotional regulation and resilience of patients. It is also particularly solicited during the remission phase, a complex and singular period of cancer disease that confronts patients with an ambivalence of hope and fear. The fear of recurrence is a concern that the cancer may return or progress in the same organ or in another part of the body. This is a determining factor in the occurrence of anxiety-depressive disorders. Finally, several studies have shown a strong association between depression/anxiety and Cancer-Related Fatigue (CRF) after treatment, especially during the remission phase.\nACEs leave physiological and epigenetic impact that can nowadays be easily evaluated, thus providing additional evidence between adversity, physiological and epigenetic vulnerability and the ability to adapt to life's challenges such as cancer. Life history changes are mediated by changes in cellular mechanisms affecting genome expression. It is currently widely demonstrated that ACEs increases epigenetic modifications.\nThe interest of this project is therefore to highlight the psychological consequences related to the occurrence of cancer in the developmental history (in terms of adversities) of patients who have completed adjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer, taking into account the patients' previous attachments, resilience, fear of recurrence and perceived fatigue in order to consider their interactions and their effects on their psychological health and ultimately on their quality of life.",

Primary surgical resection is feasible in about 10-15% of patients with an early-stage disease. Another 30-35% of patients have locally advanced disease with invasion into major vasculature but without detectable metastases. Surgery offers a chance of cure. The introduction of adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy has improved prognosis after surgery.\nIn the management of patients with PDAC, the role of neoadjuvant therapy is less certain. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of having no macroscopic or microscopic residual tumor (R0 resection). In the The European Study Group for Pancreatic Cancer (ESPAC-5) study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS).\nChimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein not expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed about 80% of PDAC.\nThere are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CAR-T cell therapy.\nThe safety of CAR-T cells targeting MSLN in the treatment of cancers has also been verified in several clinical trials on lung cancers (NCT01583686, NCT02414269, NCT01355965). Professor Li Peng's group at the Chinese Academy of Science designed third generation CAR-T cells targeting MSLN and validated their use in both human PDAC cell lines, animal models, and in 4 patients with advanced malignancies. In a 42-year-old man with metastatic PDAC, the MSLN targeted CAR-T treatment led to complete response follow several hepatic artery infusion and intravenous infusion. These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells.\nIn the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesise that Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival.",

As inheritance of early studies, a value of 50-60 mmHg has been historically accepted as the gold standard MAP. However, in the last decades, the CPB management has remarkably changed, thanks to the evolution of technology and the availability of new biomaterials. Therefore, as already highlighted by the latest European Guidelines, the current management of CPB can no longer refer to those pioneering studies. To date, only few single-centre studies have compared different strategies of MAP management during CPB, but with contradictory findings and without achieving a real consensus. Therefore, what should be the ideal strategy of MAP management during CPB is still on debate. This trial will be the first multicentre, randomized, controlled study to compare three different strategies of MAP management during the CPB.\nMethods: We described herein the methodology of a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial comparing three different approaches to MAP targeting during CPB in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery: the historically accepted standard MAP (50-60 mmHg), the high MAP (70-80 mmHg) and the patient-tailored MAP (comparable to the patient's preoperative MAP). It is the aim of the study to find the most suitable management in order to obtain the most adequate perfusion of end-organs during cardiac surgery. For this purpose, the primary endpoint will be the peak of serum lactate (Lmax) released during CPB, as index of tissue hypoxia.

        "summary": "Alcohol use is a causal factor in more than 200 diseases and injury conditions (see ICD-10) and in France, alcohol is the first cause of hospitalization. Binge drinking (BD) has emerged as a major public health issue among student populations and is associated with negative consequences and social, cognitive and brain alterations. More than half of French university students have reported BD in the past month and are at increased risk of several alcohol-related consequences such as memory and sleep impairments, and reduced quality of life. BD is also a major risk factor in the development of alcohol addiction, with individual and environmental factors playing a role that is still poorly understood. Moreover, most students and young adults are reluctant to seek interventions when it is provided by health care professionals (only 4-5%) and have poor insight with regard to their alcohol use patterns / habits. Thus, there is an urgent need for developing effective prevention and intervention programs to reduce alcohol drinking in students. Recent studies have demonstrated that new types of technology-delivered interventions are promising tools for addressing unhealthy alcohol use. For example, an uncontrolled trial pilot study using a smartphone application-delivered intervention produced a reduction in both number of drinks per week and BD from baseline to 3-month follow-up. A recent review also showed significant outcomes of a mobile health intervention for self-control of unhealthy alcohol use. The investigators hypothesize that a timeline follow-back and personalized feedback based on the use of a mobile application can reduce excessive alcohol intake at 3-months. This study will provide scientific knowledge about BD in students, but also regarding a new type of intervention that could be effective for prevention in non-treatment seeking individuals and reducing the severity of health problems associated with excessive alcohol intake.",

PRRT is a type of radiation therapy for which a radioactive chemical is linked to a peptide (small protein) that targets cancer cells. When this radioactive peptide is injected into the body, it binds to a specific receptor found on some cancer cells. The radioactive peptide builds up in these cells and helps kill the cancer cells without harming normal cells. In this trial 177Lu-DOTATATE is used for PRRT. 177Lu-DOTATATE PRRT may increase the length of time until worsening of the midgut NET compared to the usual approach. Everolimus is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It is also a type of angiogenesis inhibitor. Everolimus works by stopping cancer cells from reproducing and by decreasing blood supply to the cancer cells.

Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Chemotherapy drugs, such as gemcitabine and cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays, particles, or radioactive seeds to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors. Researchers want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, adding nivolumab to chemotherapy has on patients with newly diagnosed NPC. In addition, they want to find out if children with NPC may be treated with less radiation therapy and whether this decreases the side effects of therapy.",

This has led to it being licensed for use in the UK in 2022 and is now being prescribed in this age group. There is little information in trials however that shows the effect KaftrioTM (ETI) has on the gut or liver in this age group.\nPrevious studies in the GIFT-CF series (NCT 03566550, NCT04006873 and NCT04618185) has found differences in the functioning of the gut between adults with CF and healthy controls but it is not known whether these differences are present in those aged 6 to 11 years.\nThis study is a significant amendment of the GIFT-CF3 protocol (NCT04618185) that aims to measure gut function using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in children with CF before and after starting ETI. This study also aims to opportunistically measure lung function and structure using MRI and explore how the liver can be measured using MRI in this age group.\nThe study is split into 2 stages. The first is a pilot stage using the modified GIFT-CF protocol recruiting 3 children with CF before starting ETI and 3 healthy volunteers. This is to determine we are able to successfully perform these scans in these age groups. If successful, the second stage will recruit a further 12 children with CF before they start ETI. This will take our cohort up to 15 children with CF. This cohort will then be rescanned 6 months after starting ETI using the same scan protocol.",

The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study (NCT04618185) to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint. In total, participants will be asked to remain in the MRI scanner for approximately 30 minutes at a time. For comfort, participants will be able to watch multimedia programmes through the use of a specially adapted television while in the scanner. Participants will also be asked to complete validated gastrointestinal questionnaires throughout the study day and recall their GI symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and complete a 3 day food diary.

The grades of MG loss (i.e. meiboscore) is calculated as the ratio between the area of the MGs and the eyelids, and this calculation is based on the two-dimensional digital infrared images.In the current formula, the area of the eyelid is the denominator. However, because the eyelids need to be flipped over for the examination and evaluation, and there may be interobserver variability in the measurement of the area of the eyelids. Aging and involutional eyelid disorders, such as ptosis, ectropion, and entropion, may lead to laxity or deformation of eyelids, and impact the shape and area of eyelid area consequently.These factors could cause inaccuracy in current evaluation method, and impact the grading and evaluation of treatment efficacy of MGD, especially in self-controlled studies, such as in clinical trials.\nIn this study, the investigators propose to use a modified calculation formula for the grading of MGs. The investigators could measure the white to white (WTW) distance of cornea, and then calculate the area of cornea (i.e. corneal base area) accordingly.Unlike the eyelid, the WTW distance does not change significantly during aging or between sexes.Thus, the investigators hypothesize that using the corneal base area as the new denominator in the formula for the grading of MG loss is a better way comparing with the conventional method.",

Some epidemiological studies report that infants experience an average of 7.5-14 painful procedures per day per infant during the first 14 days of their hospitalization.\nThe most significant problem encountered in understanding pain in infants is the lack of verbal expression of pain. Newborns express their pain with nonverbal behavioral expressions. Therefore, any pain assessment is based on the ability to recognize the pain symptoms of others. The pain experienced may cause physiological imbalances and abnormalities in brain development and stress response in infants in the short and long term. It can negatively affect family-infant communication, as well as cause emotional and psychosomatic problems later in life.\nToday, music therapy has positive effects on reducing stress, reducing pain, oxygen saturation level, and peak heart rate values in providing individualized developmental care of the infant in neonatal intensive care units. Heart sound, babies hear the mother's heart sound the most during the intrauterine period in the womb. Therefore, when babies hear the sound, they are familiar with in the womb, they will feel safe and a sense of relaxation will occur in the baby. Several studies have proven that playing heartbeat sounds to newborn babies can positively affect their physiological indicators, feeding, length of hospital stay and pain outcomes. The current literature shows that the presence of rhythmic sound can positively affect the neurobehavioral development of the infant and reduce pain. Rhythmic sounds have healing/positive effects on newborns; listening to white noise reduces preterms' pain scores, stabilizes vital signs, and plays an active role in preterms' sleep-wake period.\nIn line with all this information, this study was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study in order to determine the effects of music played during heel spear application, white noise and heart sound in infants.",

An optimized reconstruction of this area after the burn allow the patient to recover the best possible function and increase his chances of returning to professional activity and daily life. Advances in burn treatment, such as improved resuscitation management, rapid excision of burns, skin grafting, regular dressings, and improved metabolic support, have reduced the morbidity and mortality of severe burns. However, significant challenges remain.\nThe hand is the most frequently involved area in burns and is affected in 90% of severe burns. Hand burns requiring releasing incisions are circular, deep burns and represent a significant functional challenge. In the acute setting, current treatment options must prevent complications associated with disruption of the skin's protective function. In the longer term, these treatments should allow the regeneration of fully functional skin. However, some sequelae may persist in the form of sensory deficits, residual pain, retractile scars hindering function in this highly mobile area, or even aesthetic sequelae.\nThe aim of our study was to perform a descriptive analysis of the aesthetic and functional sequelae related to hand burns that required acute realeasing incisions using objective and subjective tools available in the medical records (demographic, clinical and follow-up data in the context of routine care).

Participants will perform a Jar Switching Task (described in Research Strategy Aim 1- Jar Switching Task) in which balls are drawn with replacement from one of two known jars. The current jar in use switches based on an underlying change rate across trials. Subjects must perform three task blocks: 1) report the current jar in use (short-term inference), 2) predict the subsequent jar (long-term inference), and 3) both report and predict the jars (multi-timescale inference). The investigators will record these responses, the number (and sequence) of balls drawn, and the response time (time from the end of trial until the response) for each trial. Subjects will perform all blocks (parameters and number of blocks to be determined by inference model development and testing prior to task development) so that we can compare responses at each timescale. Since participants participate voluntarily for small sums of money (around $10/ hour based on duration of task) and the investigators' previous studies have collected over 200 subjects in a matter of days, they will aim to record behavioral data from 1000 subjects.

        "summary": "Insomnia is a highly common, chronic disorder that is distressful for the patient but also for caregivers and can give rise to a heavy burden on the healthcare team. Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults.\nSome patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty. Lemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other traditional sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events.\nWhile lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with an early onset dementia. Understanding the effectiveness and tolerability of lemborexant will be helpful in an N of 1 trial to understand the details of effect and effectiveness in individual patients.",

Post-operative delirium is a devastating complication, leading to longer ICU and hospital stay, increased incidence of discharge to nursing facility and poorer long-term cognitive outcome.\nDespite the impact this complication has on individuals, their families and healthcare resources, little is known about the causes and potential preventative measures.\nIt is thought that systemic inflammation compromising the integrity of the blood brain barrier is an important contributing factor. Recent data suggests that antifibrinolytics like tranexamic acid (TXA) might be able to lessen the inflammation of the nervous system caused by surgery and CPB through the inhibition of plasmin production, thereby stabilising the blood brain barrier. Worldwide, the use of TXA has become standard of care in cardiac surgery and other types of surgery with a high risk of bleeding. It has been shown to reduce bleeding by 25% and significantly reduce the rate of transfusion in cardiac and noncardiac surgery.\nAt Royal Papworth hospital it is routine practice to administer 2g of TXA before commencing CPB irrespective of patients' body weight. We are hypothesising that there is a weight-based effect of TXA on neurological outcomes after cardiac surgery, showing a signal that a higher dose per kg bodyweight will lead to less delirium measured with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score (RASS).

        "summary": "Natural Orifice Specimen Extraction Surgery (NOSES), which involves obtaining specimens from the abdominal cavity without any incisions, has attracted much attention in recent years, and it has been widely popularized in the treatment of rectal cancer because of its postoperative non-incision, advantages of less trauma, quicker recovery, and postoperative aesthetics. Anastomotic fistula is a serious complication of rectal cancer surgery. For patients at high risk of anastomotic fistula, prophylactic ileostomy is often performed intraoperatively to divert feces and protect the anastomosis. For such patients, rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma (NOSES with specimen extraction via stoma) is usually performed, borrowing a prophylactic stoma incision to retrieve the specimen, and also realizing the absence of additional abdominal incision. However, this procedure is prone to stoma infection and has a high complication rate (20-40%), which limits the popularization of NOSES surgery and is an urgent clinical problem. Our center has proposed a new stoma closure method (Dumpling Suture Method), which reduces the size of the incision by folding the suture to achieve the effect of hiding the skin incision and reduce stoma infection. In our previous study, 17 cases of the new procedure were completed in our center, and 25 patients with stoma closure by the traditional method were included in the same period for control purposes. After six months of follow-up, we found that the dumpling suture method significantly reduced the incidence of stoma complications compared with the traditional suture method (5.8% vs. 36%), and no additional adverse effects were observed. This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-controlled clinical study planned to recruit 66 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the trial and control groups. The primary endpoint is stoma complication rate at 30 days postoperatively. In this study, we aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the dumpling suture method  compared with the traditional stoma suture in reducing postoperative stoma complications through a randomized parallel controlled clinical trial, which is of great significance for the improvement of the rectal NOSES procedure and the reduction of the incidence of stoma complications.",

        "summary": "Specific language and learning disorders (SLLD) affect around 5-10% of school-aged children, or 1-2 child(ren) per class. SLLDs correspond to the impairment of a specific cognitive function and are divided into 5 categories: dyslexia, dysphasia, dyspraxia, dyscalculia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (DSM-5). In recent years, real progress has been made in their clinical diagnosis and management, thanks to a better description of these disorders in the DSM-5 and the advent of rehabilitative treatments (neuropsychology, speech therapy, occupational therapy, orthoptics, etc.). SLLD can occur in a sporadic or familial context (sibling involvement, a symptomatic parent, other relatives who may mimic dominant inheritance with variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance).\nIt has long been suspected that SLLD is secondary to multifactorial inheritance, with a combination of frequent genetic variations and environmental factors. In France, in the absence of an obvious syndromic diagnosis, the current strategy is to prescribe array CGH, combined in girls with a search for fragile X syndrome (in boys, this syndrome leads to systematic intellectual disability, which does not justify its study in SLLD). A few genes have been described as being specifically involved in a small proportion of SLLD, most often with de novo variations or inherited from a symptomatic parent. There are no distinctive clinical features to guide targeted sequencing of these genes. Moreover, our recent experience shows that genes implicated in intellectual disability may also be involved in SLLD. Very few studies have been published in the literature evaluating the value of exome sequencing in SLLD. Only two studies have been identified, involving 10 and 43 patients with specific SLLD.\nIn view of the roll-out of the French Genomic Medicine Plan (PFMG 2025), it is important to set up a study aimed at assessing the value of genome-wide sequencing in the etiological work-up for SLLD.\nParticipation in the study consists of:\nan inclusion visit, where an additional blood sample will be taken during the baseline work-up\na results visit (4 months after the inclusion visit)\nOptional qualitative study: semi-structured interview 1 year after the inclusion visit proposed to 20 patients or families with a positive result and to 10 patients with a negative result.",

There is an increase in the incidence and severity of ROP development in direct proportion to the decrease in birth week and birth weight. While ROP is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks was 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce the pain and increase the comfort level of the premature newborn. As a pharmacological method, there is no other routine method used to reduce pain other than the administration of local anesthetic drops before the examination. Because of this situation, nurses apply various non-pharmacological methods to alleviate pain. These methods are; breast milk, sucrose use, oral dextrose use, non-nutritive sucking, positioning, listening to music and mother's voice.

Ibrutinib has also been found to be effective in mantle cell lymphoma, Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia and marginal zone lymphoma. However, ibrutinib treatment is associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (AF), with an estimated 2-year AF rate of 16% in patients treated with ibrutinib during a median follow-up of 28 months. In most studies, AF was identified by reports as a treatment-related adverse event, and systematic screening for AF was not performed. As AF is often paroxysmal, the more intensive the screening, the higher the incidence. In a prospective cohort study of 53 patients treated with ibrutinib for CLL, patients were monitored by pulse palpation and ECG every 3 months. The cumulative incidence rate of ibrutinib-associated AF was 23% at 12 months and 38% at 2 years.

        "summary": "The project aims at implementing a more pro-active surveillance of potential transmission of influenza viruses to humans (zoonotic transmission). Clinical surveillance of influenza in humans and avian species is well organized and has been operating for decades, but currently there is no pro-active systematic surveillance of potential transmission of animal (avian or swine) influenza viruses to humans, only follow-up of people showing clinical symptoms. People working with potentially infected animals have the highest risk. Moreover, they can represent the first steps in a pandemic: if the virus adapts to humans, infected workers could potentially spread the virus to other people.\nCurrently, highly pathogenic clade2.3.4.4b H5 avian influenza viruses are continuously circulating in wild birds in Belgium and the number of introduction in poultry farms has raised, increasing the contact opportunities with high viral concentrations. Several reports of suspected human infection have been made by different countries. In addition, the virus was detected in sick non-human mammals. The large circulation in wild birds thus represents an increase risk of spill-over to mammalian species, including humans, (by contact directly with wild birds, or via outbreaks in poultry). This increased opportunity for accidental spillover to new host species increases the chances for the avian virus to adapt to mammals, including humans.\nLikewise, there have also been an increased number of human cases of swine influenza reported by several European countries. A pro-active surveillance aiming at also detecting asymptomatic infections would allow an early detection of transmission that could help to prevent a new pandemic.\nAs a piloting approach during this specific project, some dedicated sentinel networks among at-risk workers will be initiated: people in poultry farms involved with the management of outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza; people working at bird (or more generally wild life) rehabilitation centres or poultry farms; veterinarians working in pig farms/slaughterhouses.",

        "summary": "Pes planus is a foot deformity characterized by a low medial longitudinal arch. It is more common in young adults. With low arch, tension occurs in the plantar fascia. Fascia and soft tissue loading may lead to different musculoskeletal problems such as plantar fasciitis, medial tibial stress syndrome, patellofemoral disorders and back pain. In addition, pes planus can affect individuals' activities of daily living, productivity in occupational settings, and injury risk and performance in sports.\nTreatment of pes planus includes strengthening, stretching, taping and orthotics for the foot muscles. Among these applications, strengthening of the foot core muscles is one of the most common and effective methods. By strengthening the foot core muscles, it is aimed to reduce the effect of the kinetic chain. Pes planus is a postural deformity that affects the kinetic and fascial chain, but the treatment program is usually planned regionally. With fascial continuity and fascial conduction, the tension on the plantar fascia in pes planus affects the gastro-soleus, peroneus longus and brevis, hamstring muscles, iliotibial band and thoracolumbar fascia. Stretching of the plantar fascia, which is included in current treatment programs, has only a local effect and thus cannot prevent fascial chain involvement. Myofascial release, one of the methods used to reduce the tension in the fascia, has been used frequently in recent years. Myofascial release is performed with methods such as manual, foam roller and instrument assisted release. Foam roller (cylinder foam) is a practical myofascial release method that can be self-applied by the individual.\nIn addition to strengthening the intrinsic muscles of the foot in individuals with pes planus, it has been reported that fascial chain involvement should also be taken into consideration due to the tension in the plantar fascia with low arch. This study was planned to investigate the effect of myofascial release methods on lower extremity performance in addition to foot core exercises used effectively in the treatment of pes planus.",

Duodenoscopes used for Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), in order to treat different biliary and pancreatic disorders, have been recently linked to infections transmission following the procedures. Given their reusability and their complex design of the tip with a moving metallic component, named the elevator, these instruments must be reprocessed through high level disinfection (HLD) in order to prevent the spread of nosocomial infections. Even strict adherence to all HLD procedures results in a residual level of potentially infectious microbes. In fact, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postmarket surveillance communication reported duodenoscope culture results demonstrating contamination rates of up to 3.6% for low and moderate-concern organisms and up to 5.4% for high-concern organisms in reprocessed conventional duodenoscopes. As a consequence, at least 20 outbreaks of duodenoscope-transmitted multidrug resistant organism (MDRO) infections occurred between 2012 and 2015, despite reported compliance with duodenoscope reprocessing guidelines. The increasing concern that currents practices of reprocessing reusable duodenoscopes is insufficient, has led the FDA to released recommendation suggesting to develope a newly designed duodenoscopes. On one hand, a way is to generate duodenoscope with disposable components, such as a one-use end cap, which can be removed and allow access to the components of the elevator and other areas of the duodenoscope for reprocessing. On the other hand, an alternative is to produce a fully disposable single-use duodenoscope.

        "summary": "The purpose of this study is to explore the physical exam characteristics of patients referred to orthopedic surgeons with a diagnosis of thumb carpometacarpal (CMC) arthritis. CMC osteoarthritis of the thumb is one of the most common degenerative conditions of the hand in 11% of men and 33% of women (Gillis et al., 2011). Patients with CMC arthritis may experience pain, decreased range of motion, loss of grip and pinch strength, often limiting participation in activities of daily living (Bertozzi et al., 2014). In 1979, two physicians identified a variation of a tendinous connection in the wrist between the tip of the index finger and the tip of the thumb known as the Linburg-Comstock variation (LCV) (Linburg & Comstock, 1979). The prevalence of the LCV varies respectively from 13-66% in both males and females (Eri\u0107 et al., 2019). A physical examination of patients with LCV reveals concurrent flexion of the flexor digitorum profundus to the index finger and flexor pollicis longus. The study aims to gain more insight into patients diagnosed with CMC arthritis through clinical examination for LCV to consider an association of the diagnoses.\nCurrently, there is no evidence surrounding patients with symptomatic CMC arthritis and LCV. The hypothesis is that there is an association between symptomatic CMC arthritis and LCV. Patients with a LCV may then be more likely to develop painful CMC arthritis.",
        "model_output": "The study is a descriptive cross-sectional study of patients with a diagnosis of thumb CMC arthritis. The study will collect demographic data, and dichotomous data indicating whether a patient has the variation or does not have the variation, and if the variation is present in one hand or both hands. The study will take place at the Bone and Joint Center at 1365 Washington Avenue, Albany New York, and satellite offices in Guilderland, Clifton Park, Malta, Saratoga, Schenectady and Catskill. Data will be collected for up to two years. There are no risks to patients enrolled in the study, as the test involves asking the patient to simply bend the tip of their thumb. Documentation of the variation is not usually noted in the chart. Therefore, the physicians involved in the study will be asked to include the findings of the variation in their documentation. The patients will be informed during clinical examination if they have a LCV. There is no compensation to participants for enrolling in the study.",

        "summary": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by severe motor and non-motor symptoms, including upper limb dysfunction. Due to the degradation of dopaminergic neurons in the striatum, PD patients experience difficulties with motor learning and more specifically with the consolidation of motor memory. Recent work showed that intensive writing training improved writing skills in PD. Although consolidation effects were present, difficulties with retention were also still apparent. Besides impacting writing, manual dexterity deficits in PD can also affect the use of touchscreens. Researchers from our lab demonstrated that impairments were most pronounced in multi-direction sliding motions, indicating the need for training of these motor skills. Our lab demonstrated the classic difficulties with retention in PD after one session of training of a swipe and slide pattern on a tablet (SSP-task) as single task (ST), although immediate gains were demonstrated. Therefore, in this study the investigators will examine whether a two-week home-based training program of a tablet-based SSP-training program will lead to immediate and consolidated improvements that are retained in time. This program will combine ST and dual task (DT) training to provide variation during the training period, but also to increase the cognitive challenge during learning, thereby stimulation consolidation of learning. The primary aim of this study consists of investigating the learning effects after two weeks of targeted touchscreen training. Secondary, the investigators will examine whether these effects will also be retained after four weeks without practice and whether targeted training results in consolidated improvements, in terms of automaticity and transfer towards an untrained task. Given the objective recording of compliance to the training protocol, the investigators will explore the association between compliance rates and learning effects.",

        "summary": "After a hip, knee or shoulder arthroplasty, the evolution is not always favorable. It can be marked by an infectious or non-infectious complication, most often implant failure. In this context, joint fluid aspiration (JFA) is indicated to document a prosthetic joint infection (PJI) or to bring to light arguments for implant failure. Nevertheless, opinions differ on its indication for microbiological identification. Some teams perform it systematically when faced with a prosthesis dysfunction. Others, only in the presence of suggestive signs of PJI. Finally, others never perform it.\nBased on clinical, radiological and biological (CRP) signs, at the preoperative stage and before JFA, we classify our patients into 3 groups: supposedly septic (chronic joint infection), supposedly aseptic (implant failure) or intermediate (Unknown). This last group, often encountered in consultation, poses a diagnosis problem more than the others.\nIn our experience, JFA is an essential diagnosis tool in these 3 groups of patients. It helps to choose the surgical strategy. In addition, the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid as the alpha defensin, the leucocyte esterase and the CRP could provide an additional argument to investigate the infectious origin or not, in particular in difficult cases.\nIn summary, the disagreement on the usefulness of JFA in case of PJI suspicion and any other prosthetic dysfunction, the lack of data on large prospective studies and our questioning about the contribution of JFA in the aseptic and intermediate group of patients, motivated us to set up this study to evaluate the interest of the JFA for the preoperative diagnosis, as well as that of the dosage of biomarkers in the joint fluid.",

        "summary": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common chronic disease. It is the main cause of morbidity and disability in the world with, among other things, an increase in cardio-metabolic risk and a reduction in life expectancy, regardless of suicide risk. MDD is the most expensive medical condition: 10-20 billion \u20ac/year in France. This cost is mainly attributable to the functional consequences of the disease, highlighting the medico-economic challenge represented by the optimization of the organization of care.\nIn France, more than 80% of MDD patients are enrolled in non-psychiatric care pathways, mainly primary care or MSO hospital care (medicine, surgery, obstetrics). Unfortunately, less than half of patients benefit from treatment at an appropriate dosage or duration, thus exposing them to the risks of relapse, recurrence and chronic evolution. It is necessary to optimize this management, in particular by improving secondary prevention, which consists of maintaining treatment in the months following symptomatic remission.\nSeveral support programs (monitoring with assessment of symptomatology) have shown their effectiveness on depressive symptomatology with a favorable medico-economic report, in particular by allowing maintenance of antidepressant treatment. None of these studies have been conducted on French care pathways.\nInvestigators propose to evaluate the efficacy of telemedicine management (added to usual care) in non-psychiatric care pathways on the evolution of depressive symptomatology for MDD patients. Investigators hypothesize that telemedicine monitoring downstream of MSO hospitalization will increase the response rate to antidepressants at 6 months and reduce the costs attributed to depressive symptoms compared to usual care, in particular by optimizing secondary prevention strategies by maintaining treatment.\nThe main objective of the research is to assess the efficacy of telemedicine monitoring on depressive symptoms and treatments, added to the out-of-hospital downstream care pathways for patients initially hospitalized in MSO (medicine-surgery-obstetrics), compared to usual care.",

Several barriers for successful implementation of CDSS have been identified: over-alerting, lack of specificity of rules, and physician interruption during prescription. The effectiveness of CDSS could be increased in two ways. Firstly, by creating rules that are more specific to a given adverse drug reaction: the current study focuses on acute renal failure and hyperkalemia (two serious and frequent ADR in older hospitalized patients). Secondly, by involving the pharmacist in the review of the alerts so that he/she can transmit, if deemed necessary, a pharmaceutical recommendation to the clinician. This procedure will reduce over-alerting and prevent task interruption.\nThe hypothesis is that the use of specific rules created by a multidisciplinary team and implemented in a CDSS, combined with a strategy for managing and transmitting alerts, can reduce specific ADRs such as hyperkalemia and acute renal failure.",

        "summary": "Mesenteric fat can be invaded by gut bacteria through a process called bacterial translocation, which is the invasion of viable bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract to extraintestinal sites (mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidney, bloodstream, etc.). In Crohn's disease (CD), bacterial translocation could increase the disproportionate inflammatory response already present and contribute to disease progression by stimulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and immune-cell infiltration in the mesentery. Several mechanisms may promote bacterial translocation, such as bacterial overgrowth, disruption of the intestinal mucosal barrier and alterations in the immune system.\nIleocecal surgical resection is required in some patients with complicated or refractory CD. Unfortunately, post-surgical disease recurrence happens in up to 40% of cases, probably defining a subgroup of CD patients with a particular aggressive form of the disease. The complete microbiome (in gastrointestinal and extraintestinal sites) in CD patients that develop early post-surgical recurrence, as well as the association to innate immunity alterations, has not yet been studied.\nThe primary aim of the study is to explore the bacterial microbiome of CD patients and its association with early post-surgical recurrence and clinical or genetic variables related to innate immunity. To achieve this, the bacterial DNA present in mesenteric fat and ileal tissue (inflamed and non-inflamed) from surgical resection samples as well as blood samples from CD patients will be studied. Genetic polymorphisms, relevant clinical data and disease recurrence will also be evaluated.\nThe investigators hypothesize that bacterial translocation to the mesentery fat near the inflamed intestine is one of the mechanisms for perpetuation and chronicity of inflammation and therefore post-surgical recurrence in CD. The investigators expect to find a distinctive bacterial profile (in quantity and quality) in the mesenteric fat of patients with early post-surgical recurrence and/or with genetic variants that cause alterations in innate immunity.\nThe study of the microbiome in CD could help to identify the patients with a more aggressive disease form that will probably present early post-surgical recurrence, and could raise the possibility of microbial modulation as therapy for CD.",

Effective antibiotic and surgical treatments have been developed for these infections but they are still able to develop into life-threatening diseases such as meningitis and sepsis. The direct cause of acute head and neck infections is often unknown but it has been suggested that they are due to a disturbance of the normal bacterial growing in the mouth or are from dental origin.\nThe most common microorganisms identified from these infections in published studies are a group of bacteria known as viridans group streptococci (VGS). There are over 30 individual species of bacteria in the viridans group and VGS are difficult to identify to the level of a single species because of their variability. There is a lack of species identification within the hospital setting and this project aims to gain a deeper understanding of the microorganisms causing acute head and neck infections, focusing on identification of individual species of VGS bacteria.\nThe investigators will analyse bacterial DNA to determine which species have been identified and will also look at patient data and clinical outcomes (eg. length of hospital stay) to determine if the species causing the infection has any effect on patients.",

However, approximately 10-15% of these localized melanomas will eventually metastasize, despite appropriate local treatment. Once metastasis occurs, median survival is less than two years. Melanomas at high risk of metastasis can be identified by gene expression profiling. The investigators aim to treat these high risk melanomas to prevent future metastasis. Statin drugs, like atorvastatin, have been used to treat high cholesterol for the prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events, but not for preventing melanoma metastasis. Statins could prevent melanoma metastasis through decreasing tumor cell migration, decreasing tumor cell adhesion, and increasing immune system response. Statins are also efficient inhibitors of new lymphatic vessels formation. Since tumor lymphatic vessels serve as highways to lymph nodes and may suppress immune system responses, statins may block a critical step towards melanoma metastasis. Using atorvastatin may have the potential to prevent metastasis and improve outcomes in patients with resected high-risk melanoma.",

CAR T-cell therapy is a type of treatment in which a patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) are changed in the laboratory so they will attack tumor cells. T cells are taken from a patient's blood. Then the gene for a special receptor that binds to a certain protein on the patient's tumor cells is added to the T cells in the laboratory. Some solid tumor cells have an L1CAM protein on their surface, and T cells can be modified with a receptor, called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR), to help recognize this protein and kill these tumor cells. Large numbers of the CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion for treatment of certain cancers. These L1CAM mutation specific T cells may help the body's immune system identify and kill L1CAM locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancers' tumor cells.",

The pathophysiology of sepsis is based on an inappropriate host response to infection. Certain medical devices with higher adsorption capacity make it possible to limit this inappropriate response and could thus improve the hemodynamics of patients in septic or vasoplegic shock. The preliminary experience of the investigators from clinical data of vasopressor withdrawal in pediatric patients treated with oXiris shows a 50% reduction in the vasopressor score, Vaso Inotropic Score (VIS), for 40% of patients within 24 hours following the start of treatment. Similar results were found in adult patients treated for severe COVID-19 or vasoplegic shock by the other centers participating in the study.\nCytokine purification is an important physiological effect of purification membranes. However, this may not fully explain the rapid hemodynamic improvement of patients treated with an oXiris membrane.\nThe role of angiotensin metabolites (Ang 1-5, 1-7, 1-9) in the systemic vascular tone of patients has been recently discussed. The administration of angiotensin 2 in vasoplegic shock in adults helps correct hypotension. In the group of patients with increased renin, this treatment was associated with a reduction in mortality. Indeed, increased renin associated with dysfunction of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) leads to an accumulation of Angiotensin 1 which degrades to Ang 1-7.\nThe hypothesis f the investigators is that the concentration of Ang 1 and Ang 1-7 is elevated in cases of vasoplegic shock and that the clearance of these vasodilator peptides by blood purification is associated with clinical improvement.",

After six months, complementary foods should be started, and the baby should continue to be breastfed for two years or more. On the other hand, between 2015-2020, the rates of infants aged 0-6 months fed with breast milk alone are approximately 44% worldwide.\nThere are many factors that affect the time of initiation of breastfeeding and the duration of breastfeeding. Some of those; maternal education, mode of delivery, birth weight and socio-economic status. Another influential factor is paternal support. Fathers may want to be involved in breastfeeding education and support their spouses in this process. However, the reasons such as not taking part in the trainings and not being asked direct questions about breastfeeding may cause fathers to feel excluded in this process. It is important to include fathers in education and interventions to achieve breastfeeding goals.

Based on our previous mutation analyses of 120 patients with high-risk adenoma removed by enbloc resection with subsequent colonoscopy after 1 year, there is a correlation between mutation in exon 7 of the TP53 gene and risk of early metachronous lesions development. The results also indicate that mutation phenotype (mutation profile and burden) of all lesions detected on index colonoscopy can determine risk of metachronous lesions.

Fortunately, stroke that occurs during non-cardiac surgery is most commonly caused by inadequate blood flow to the brain and is, therefore, preventable if it can be detected early. Current clinical tools used to monitor the brain during surgery do not have the accuracy nor the spatial coverage - they only monitor one small region of the brain. In this study, the investigators plan to apply a cutting-edge optical device, tr-fNIRS, to monitor the whole brain during shoulder surgery. The primary aim is to determine any regional differences in cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) and cerebral autoregulation (CA)between brain regions during surgery and especially during various physiological challenges, such as hypotension. The investigators hypothesize that certain brain regions are more likely to develop cerebral desaturation and impaired CA, and are more prone to brain injury than the frontal lobe region which is the traditional monitoring site.

        "summary": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a frequent pathology in intensive care (around 10% of patients admitted to intensive care and almost a quarter of patients on mechanical ventilation) and a serious one, with a hospital mortality rate of 40%. The main measures that have an effect on mortality in ARDS involve adjustments to the ventilator, known as protective ventilation. In the most severe patients, adjuvant measures such as prone positioning and the use of curarisation in the initial phase of the disease can improve survival. All these measures have been included in the latest national and international recommendations. However, a vast observational study carried out in 50 countries revealed low compliance with these recommendations. More than a third of patients did not receive protective ventilation, and the majority did not receive prone positioning when this was indicated. During weaning from artificial ventilation, it has been widely demonstrated that replacing clinician judgement with the implementation of paramedical care protocols improved weaning and significantly reduced the duration of artificial ventilation. Therefore, investigators hypothesize that the implementation of a paramedical care protocol for ventilation in the acute phase of ARDS improves compliance with recommendations and thus reduces mortality and the duration of artificial ventilation. However, implementation of such a protocol requires operational training for all the nurses in the participating departments. Simulation appears to be the training method of choice, as it is a teaching technique that enables technical and non-technical skills to be passed on with good retention of what has been learnt, as well as assessing what has been learnt.

Brain function and structure span broad spatial scales (from single neurons to brain-wide networks) as well as temporal scales (from milliseconds to years). Currently, none of the tools available for studying the brain can fully capture its structure and function across these diverse scales - the neuroimaging puzzle. This poses crucial limitations to understanding how the brain works, and how it is affected by numerous diseases.\nThe central goal of this project is to expand currently available tools for non-invasive human brain imaging, to bridge critical gaps in the neuroimaging puzzle. New methodologies will be developed, focused on ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (UHF MRI) and its combination with electroencephalography (EEG). New contrast mechanisms and technological advances enabled by UHF MRI and EEG will be explored to allow unprecedented views into the microstructure of brain regions like the thalamus, and to capture the activity of large-scale neuronal networks in the brain with high sensitivity, temporal and spatial specificity. These advances will be directly applied to address open questions in the diagnosis and treatment of essential tremor, and psychosis.\nIn general, improved brain imaging techniques are critical for a deeper understanding of how the brain works, and to detect and characterize diseases more effectively, thereby improving clinical management and leading to a healthier population. The non-invasive characterization and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases like tremor is particularly relevant to aging modern societies.",

Different mechanisms have been proposed to explain iron deficiency secondary to obesity. Among the most studied is the deficit in dietary iron intake or the increase in blood volume that increases the need for the metal.

The investigators objective is to evaluate the effect of weight loss by caloric restriction on hepcidin and serum iron concentration in people living with obesity and iron deficiency. The study will be divided into two phases: Phase 1: A cross-sectional study (cases and controls) to compare hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers in people living with and without obesity. The second phase consists of an open-label randomized controlled clinical trial. Individuals living with obesity who are iron deficient will be recruited and randomized to one of 2 dietary intervention groups with 60-day follow-up. The intervention groups will be: diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (with red meat) and diet with caloric restriction rich in protein (without red meat).

Given the rising age of global populations, reducing the burden associated with lost physical function is essential to minimise health and social care costs. Unfortunately, very few older adults engage in sufficient S&B exercise to reap these benefits, with a lack of time, self-efficacy and access to leisure facilities cited as the key barriers.

Perioperative pain following spine surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal analgesia can be effectively given preemptively to alleviate pain and facilitate early mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine.

Men aged 21 to 30 years and women aged 60 to 80 years are particularly affected. Intramedullary nailing is among the standard treatments for humeral shaft fractures (when surgery is required). Once inserted, the nail is locked in order to limit stress on the fractured bone, as well as possible secondary rotational displacements or malunion. Bipolar interlocking (BI) is typically performed on both sides (proximal and distal) of the fracture site. This procedure is performed under radiological control, exposing the patient and care team to radiation (during the entire procedure). The objective of the treatment is to obtain consolidation of the fracture within 12 months, and to limit the occurrence of irreversible complications such as malunion or nonunion (2-10% at 12 months post-surgery). The unipolar interlocking (UI) technique has recently been introduced. In this technique, locking is performed only on the proximal side of the fracture site. By avoiding the distal approach, potential complications such as radial nerve damage, with the risk of irreversible paralysis (3.8-14.2% in studies of the BI technique in this indication) or the risk of infection on the distal side can be avoided. It also reduces operative time, and consequently the radiation received by patients and caregivers. However, the UI may be poorly positioned, resulting in malunion that requires revision surgery.\nDespite the absence of recommendations due to the lack of existing data, several teams use the UI in routine care. In this context, a descriptive cohort of 121 patients operated on at the Dijon University Hospital5 showed similar rates of consolidation between the 2 techniques (93.8% for UI versus 95.2% for BI, p=0.64), functional scores, and complications, as well as a significant 29% decrease in operating time in the UI group (mean + SD: 63.1\u00b121.3 min versus 88.0\u00b130.1 min for VB, p<0.01).

This service is now being run remotely, however, there is little existing evidence to support the best practice for this. Currently, baseline fitness is assessed remotely using either a sit to stand test or a step test. Once completed people are prescribed regular exercises and asked to exercise to a level of intensity using a measure called Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE). However, these measurements may not be reliable. We are carrying out a study to assess if another waking test (modified Rockport test) and asking patients to exercise to a target heart rate are better measures of assessing baseline fitness and exercise intensity.\nAll participants will receive weekly telephone calls to check their progress and be provided with a wrist worn fitness tracker (Fitbit). Participants will be randomised to one of two groups. The only difference between the groups will be the way the exercise is prescribed. In one group participants will be asked to complete the exercises to an exercise level they find somewhat hard. The other group will be asked to complete the exercises to maintain a set heart rate.\nAll participants will be asked to complete an activity log (submitted weekly) as an online form. A small group of people (maximum 10) will be asked if they would like to complete an in-person baseline fitness assessment also, this is optional.\nThis study runs for up to eight weeks with participation ending after eight weeks or at the time of surgery, whichever is sooner.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of hepatocellular carcinoma patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.\nOn the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models. However, a robust and concrete evidence of abscopal effect with combinational immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation or external radiation therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still lacking.\nThis study investigates the efficacy and safety of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation as first-line treatment for previously untreated metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Thus, contemporary research is orientating toward acknowledging the aetiologic and risk factors of the disease and of course establishing prognostic markers for disease prevention. Microbiota residing in the subgingival plaque are considered the main etiologic factor of the disease, however, current literature has not concluded on the exact microbial composition of peri-implant lesions. In addition, genetic predisposition has been recognized as a risk factor for disease initiation and progression and several observational studies have addressed the potential association between various gene polymorphisms and the occurrence of peri-implantitis. Lastly, to establish effective preventive measures, several biomarkers have been evaluated as potential diagnostic and prognostic markers of disease progression.\nObjectives:\nTo identify the relationship of peri-implantitis with Cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2) and MMP-8 gene polymorphisms. Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the production of prostaglandins (PGs) which are an important inflammatory mediator participating in the pathogenesis of peri-implantitis. In addition, PGE2 expression in the peri-implant crevicular fluid will be assessed.\nTo characterize the microbiota associated with peri-implantitis lesions, using novel identification techniques enabling the identification of specific opportunistic bacteria associated with the disease.\nTo test the diagnostic accuracy of a modern chairside test, using metalloproteinase-8 (MMP-8), an enzyme implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease, as a biomarker of disease progression.",

        "summary": "Virtual reality (VR) glasses are technological devices that are often used in medical fields recently and are seen as suitable for distracting children. In the last few years, many studies have been conducted to facilitate pediatric patients against painful or frightening medical procedures. For uncomfortable procedures, distracting the child's attention is seen as the most important point. VR technology has been used for procedures such as burn cases, tooth extraction, intramuscular injection, intravenous cannula, lumbar puncture, and the results of the research have been found to be satisfactory. Using VR glasses alone or in combination with standard care is effective in reducing pain and anxiety. So far, there is no study in the literature on distraction with VR during inhaler treatment in pediatric patients. Children cannot receive inhaler treatment efficiently due to reasons such as restlessness, crying, and pulling the mask during inhaler treatment, and their hospital stay is prolonged. In this study, the investigators planned to compare the patients who received inhaler treatment with VR glasses with the patients who received treatment without the aid of any device in terms of treatment compliance.\nThus, the investigators aimed to make the inhaler treatment more comfortable with VR technology.",

The most important factor for survival for many cancer types is the presence of cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes (metastasis). Lymph node metastases in patients with head and neck cancer reduce the 5-year survival by half. Sometimes, the disease is too small to be found on clinical and imaging exams before surgery. 111In-panitumumab is in a class of medications called radioimmunoconjugates. It is composed of a radioactive substance (indium In 111) linked to a monoclonal antibody (panitumumab). Panitumumab binds to EGFR receptors, a receptor that is over-expressed on the surface of many tumor cells and plays a role in tumor cell growth. Once 111In-panitumumab binds to tumor cells, it is able to be seen using an imaging technique called single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT). SPECT/CT can be used to make detailed pictures of the inside of the body and to visualize areas where the radioactive drug has been taken up by the cells. Using 111In-panitumumab with SPECT/CT imaging may improve identification of sentinel lymph nodes in patients with head and neck squamous cell cancer undergoing surgery.",

        "summary": "Two billion catheters are placed annually worldwide. Of all the people requiring vascular access, nearly a quarter have Difficult Intravenous access (DIVA), a source of multiple punctures. The increased risk of haematomas, haemorrhages, infection, pain and associated trauma is responsible for increased human costs and economic impact.\nTo limit the risks posed by the DIVA, practitioners have solutions such as the per-bone line, other types of lines, and placement of peripheral venous catheter with ultrasound or transluminescence. However, these solutions are not always applicable, depending on the care situation (non-substitutable venous access, fragile patient, etc.) or on the technical platform (available personnel and training, configuration of the premises, available equipment). Moreover, these actions are often taken after failures, in a non-anticipated and non-consensual manner.\nIn order to assess the risk of DIVA, F.Van Loon et al developed in 2016, and then modified in 2018, a DIVA Scale (the A-DIVA Scale) which allows a rapid scoring upstream of peripheral venous catheter placement to classify patients according to the risk of DIVA.\nComposed of five items (non-palpable and non-visible vein, diameter < 3mm, history of DIVA, operator experience) worth one point each, the score allows three categories to be established: low risk, moderate risk, high risk. The study showed that the proportion of first puncture failures increased with the risk of the patients (defined according to the categorized score).\nThe use of a tool such as the A-DIVA Scale is of interest if it allows the definition of actions to be taken in relation to the risk it identifies. In view of this, it appears essential to optimize the management of peripheral venous catheters, particularly for patients with DIVAs. The aim of this study is to develop a graduate and specific response to the issue of multiple punctures. Our project is to create and evaluate a specific algorithm, consisting of a risk assessment (the A-DIVA Scale) and a co-construct decision-making tree (the A-DIVA Tool). Built on the basis of objective clinical data collection and adapted to the possibilities and competencies, this new tool would bring real benefits to the patient in terms of safety (reduction of risks) and comfort (reduction of pain and duration of management), as well as a medico-economic benefit for the institutions.

        "summary": "papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) is the most common thyroid cancer and has a good prognosis. Surgery is the primary treatment for PTC, and occult lymph node metastasis is not uncommon (20%-80%).The lymph node metastasis of PTC is mostly along the lymphatic drainage path station by station, and most of the first metastasis is to the central lymph node. According to the 2015 American Thyroid Association recommendation, prophylactic central lymph node dissection is recommended for patients with primary T3-4 or cN1b without central lymph node involvement. However, PTC with primary site T1-2, no external invasion and cN0 could not be dissected by central lymph node.Previous studies have suggested that prophylactic dissection should be performed to improve disease-specific survival, reduce local recurrence, improve recurrence risk and treatment response assessment, and help RAI decision making. Although routine prophylactic central lymph node dissection may detect occult lymph node metastasis, the need for further dissection of the recurrent laryngeal nerve and the parathyroid gland may lead to an increased incidence of complications, while its effect on reducing the risk of recurrence and improving prognosis is unclear, and the impact on long-term outcomes may be small.Previous retrospective studies in our institution have shown that routine central neck dissection does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrence. This study was designed to evaluate the benefits and risks of prophylactic central lymph node dissection in cT1b-T2N0 patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma.

The aim of the study is to ensure that the side effects of the 3-dose treatment are the same or potentially lower than those already published when using the 5-dose treatment as used in the UK PACE-B trial (NCT01584258). The name of this type of radiotherapy is Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT) or participants may see it referred to as Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR). The study is a two-stage single arm Phase II study open to those Centres that use the RayPilot HypoCath tumour tracking system (Micropos Medical). This commercially available system was not available at the time of the original PACE-B study. The system acts like a Global Positioning Device (GPS) to continuously track the prostate position during radiotherapy. If the prostate moves more than 2mm (about 0.08 in) from its intended position during the treatment, then the radiotherapy team are alerted, and the treatment halted until the prostate moves back into the correct position. The ability to understand exactly where the prostate is throughout the treatment ensures the intended dose hits the cancer and does not accidentally increase the dose to the nearby bladder and rectum. The system is a modification of a standard urinary catheter which sits within the bladder with the GPS placed within the wall of the catheter as it passes through the prostate.

However, the harvesting and use of bone from the iliac crest potentially comes with the risk of complications such as delayed union of the osteotomy defect; size mismatch between the graft and the osteotomy defect; longer operation time; donor site morbidity including nerve, arterial, and ureteral injury; herniation of abdominal contents; sacroiliac joint instability; pelvic fractures; hematoma and infection.

When evaluation of cervical dilation is clinically indicated, obstetricians traditionally perform sterile speculum exams due to concern for decrease in pregnancy latency (length of time between breaking the water and delivery) with sterile digital exams in retrospective studies. These studies are concerning, however, by the indications for the exams and are at risk for confounding by indication.

Moreover, due to the lack of early diagnostic marker, most patients with HCC are often diagnosed in an advanced stage with poor prognosis. Therefore, there is an urgent need to further understand the possible aetiological factors and surgical treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with HCC. Liver transplantation is an ideal choice for patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC, which can significantly improve the postoperative survival rate. But the most serious problem facing such patients is the shortage of donor livers. In 2015, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment (2-3 segment) transplantation combined with delayed total hepatectomy can greatly alleviate the shortage of liver donors in the above-mentioned patients. Based on the experience of clinical operation, our center proposes and designs a clinical study of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation (SALT) for the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC. On the basis of RAPID, the safety and efficacy of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation were evaluated for the above patients.",

While DCM causes a range of symptoms, one of the most disabling is loss of hand dexterity. Surgical decompression is standard treatment for DCM, but reduced dexterity often remains.\nThe investigators have developed a portable, easy-to-use dexterity assessment tool for measuring hand dexterity. Hand function is often assessed using tools incapable of measuring subtle changes in function, limiting a clinician's ability to monitor progression of or recovery from a disease over time. The hope is that if subtle changes in function are identified early, leading to an early DCM diagnosis and treatment, this may prevent patients from experiencing a greater loss of hand function.\nThe goals of this study are to determine the relationship between dexterity and myelopathy severity, as well as to establish the validity and reliability of the dexterity tool.

With the significant increase in long-term survival and increasing age of transplant patients, atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, such as those caused by dyslipidemia, have become a major cause of transplant organ failure and recipient death. However, the causes of dyslipidemia after organ transplantation, as well as the effects and mechanisms of dyslipidemia on transplant rejection, are unknown.\nPrevious studies have found that 1. increased lipid levels occur in recipients after heart transplantation; 2. during rejection, hepatic PCSK9 expression is increased in recipients; 3. a high-fat environment increases the immunoreactivity of human peripheral blood lymphocytes. It is suggested that PCSK9-lipid disorder-immune cell interactions may be associated with the development of transplant rejection.\nIn this project, we propose to (1) establish a long-term follow-up system for postoperative cardiac transplantation patients in our department to track the characteristics of lipid changes in transplantation patients, to clarify the link between dyslipidemia and rejection, and to provide a strong evidence-based medical basis for the management of lipids during the perioperative period and in the postoperative period; (2) expand the dimensions of lipid-related assays under the support of the above system, and to incorporate transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic research methods to elucidate transplantation rejection in a multidimensional manner.

Surgery is indicated for those not responding to conservative management, those with grade III, and grade IV hemorrhoids.\nSurgical treatment is the only curative method for hemorrhoidal disease and indicated for advanced and complicated disease. The most radical operations with the best results are the Milligan-Morgan and Ferguson hemorrhoidectomy .\nHowever, the major concern of hemorrhoidectomy is the post-operative pain that occurs in 20-40 % of patients and it is considered the main cause of refusing surgery. The cause of postoperative pain is multifactorial, including the type of anesthesia , hemorrhoidectomy technique. and spasm of the internal anal sphincter (IAS) that becomes exposed after hemorrhoidectomy. The spasm of the IAS is considered the target to relieve pain post operatively. Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) is widely used as an adjunct to relieve pain post hemorrhoidectomy as it release the spasm of the sphincter and subsequently relieve pain. However, this procedure is not accepted by many surgeons due to its recorded complications as bleeding and mild degree of fecal incontinence, so its role following hemorrhoidectomy is still controversial.\nOn the other hand, the spasm of the anal sphincter can be abolished by injection of the botulinum toxin which acts on the acetylcholine receptor and consequently temporary muscle paralysis occurs that is followed by decreased pain and wound healing.\nOur hypothesis is botulinum toxin relaxes the internal sphincter, so prevent its spasm and so reducing the pain and promoting wound healing more rapidly.",

He estimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than that of men.\nDisabled women coexist in a dual state of vulnerability where being a woman and being a disabled person have two social disadvantages. Among people with disabilities, women with disabilities (WWD) have higher unmet healthcare needs than women without disabilities.\nCancer is an important public health problem and cause of death all over the world. Among the most common cancers in women; breast, uterine corpus, ovarian and cervix cancers are seen to be prominent, respectively. It is known that with regular examinations and screenings, early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer increases the chance of treatment.\nInternational studies show that women face barriers and difficulties in accessing reproductive health and cancer screening services. In studies, it was stated that especially women with disabilities living in rural areas had lower mammography and Pap-smear tests compared to women without disabilities. In recent years, the Health Belief Model has been used frequently to examine the effect of health beliefs on cancer screening behaviors in women and to increase screening rates. The model explains the beliefs and attitudes that affect individuals' behaviors. According to the model; If a person has a desire to prevent illness or a belief in recovery, he recommends taking a specific health action to prevent illness as a positive behavior. It was emphasized that nurses have important roles and responsibilities in the protection and development of health, and that they can identify individuals with disabilities who are considered fragile, and provide health education and counseling to these groups. It is thought that the disabled-friendly accessible health care practices under the guidance of the Health Belief Model will bring the preventive health care behavior of women with disabilities to the desired level.\nDisabled women experience inequalities in benefiting from routine health services and health screening services in special areas such as reproductive health and protection from women's cancers.

        "summary": "Rationale: Osteoarthritis (OA) is mainly characterized by cartilage degeneration. In knee OA, measuring the distance between the tibia and femur, known as the joint space width (JSW), is an often-used method to quantify the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatments, because it is an indirect measure of cartilage degeneration. However, JSW is often measured while the patient is standing (weight-bearing) with slightly flexed knees, with a flexion angle of around 7-10 degrees, while direct cartilage thickness measurements are usually performed while the patient is lying down (non-weight-bearing) with an extended leg [1]. Because of this difference in positioning, it is difficult to compare different JSW and cartilage thickness measures, as it is not clear what happens with the JSW distribution in the joint when a patient changes position between weight-bearing/non-weight-bearing and flexion/extension. In this study, we aim to identify the changes that occur in the knee of OA patients under the influence of weight-bearing and/or flexion, to enable comparing joint space measures from different positions. In this research we want to use MRI as a three-dimensional imaging technique because there is no radiation involved..\nObjective: To evaluate how the 3D knee joint space distribution in knee OA patients changes under the influence of weight-bearing (upright) and flexion MRI scanning.\nStudy design: Explorative cross-sectional study.

New medications are now available which can alter the disease trajectory and reduce clinical events. However, many cases of HF remain undetected until presentation with more advanced symptoms, often requiring hospitalisation. Earlier identification and treatment of HF could reduce downstream healthcare impact, but predicting HF incidence is challenging due to the complexity and varying course of HF. The investigators will use routinely collected hospital-linked primary care data and focus on the use of artificial intelligence methods to develop and validate a prediction model for incident HF. Using clinical factors readily accessible in primary care, the investigators will provide a method for the identification of individuals in the community who are at risk of HF, as well as when incident HF will occur in those at risk, thus accelerating research assessing technologies for the improvement of risk prediction, and the targeting of high-risk individuals for preventive measures and screening.",

The optimal selection of the potency and duration of antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic and bleeding events in HBR patients is still a matter of debate. Multiple strategies to reduce bleeding during secondary prevention, such as reducing the duration of dual antiplatelet therapy, using single antiplatelet therapy with a P2Y12 inhibitor, or de-escalating to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor, have been proposed. De-escalation to a lower potency or lower-dose P2Y12 inhibitor is particularly attractive because it maintains efficient pharmacological inhibition of multiple platelet pathways while potentially reducing bleeding through less aggressive activity. Yet, there has been no study comparing the effects of different de-escalation strategies with the standard potent P2Y12 inhibitors in HBR patients. The aim of the DESC-HBR study is to assess the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid in HBR patients, in comparison with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors, on the proportion of patients with optimal platelet reactivity (OPR).

FASD is completely preventable if women do not drink during pregnancy. Prenatal alcohol use frequently co-occurs with other substance use, especially tobacco and cannabis. The adverse effect on birth outcomes by alcohol and tobacco use together is worse than either substance alone. Recent evidence from animal models shows that prenatal exposure to both cannabinoids and alcohol potentiate the likelihood of alcohol-induced birth defects.\nData from Cape Metropole, SA, showed that all women who reported prenatal alcohol use also tested positive for tobacco use, with 25% also reporting cannabis use. Alcohol use while breastfeeding also occurs at a relatively high rate in SA.

This increases the risk of stroke through clot formation in the atrium, but also of heart failure. Atrial fibrillation is a major cause of stroke, accounting for more than 25% of all strokes. In addition, a quarter of ischemic strokes remain without an obvious cause at the end of hospitalization, and it is recommended that atrial fibrillation be detected intensively with long-term heart rhythm recording.

However, these devices require a small operation to implant them under the skin, and they are expensive.\nThe hypothesis of this study is that MRI imaging of the left atrium would enable better selection of patients to receive an implantable loop recorder. MRI can quantify the proportion of the left atrium with scar tissue, which is likely to favour the onset of atrial fibrillation. If the results confirm this hypothesis, the number of patients requiring an implantable loop recorder could be reduced, and perhaps an anticoagulation strategy based on MRI data could be introduced.\nIn addition to the usual follow-up by cardiologists and neurologists, participation in this study involves a cardiac MRI (with contrast agent) within 3 months of the stroke.",

Identifying factors that increase a patient's chances of being readmitted to the hospital, as well as developing an intervention to effectively reduce this risk, has historically been challenging.\nOur new method uses a combination of common features such as diagnosis and length of hospital stay, with a novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm, the RecuR Score model developed by the University of Maryland Medical System, that identifies patients at the highest risk of having an unplanned hospital readmission. Participants identified as higher risk will then be enrolled into our pilot where they will be randomized to receive either the standard of care treatment or an enhanced protocol that includes additional disease education, coordination of home health services, and a focus on their readmission during existing multidisciplinary team huddles.\nThe main goal of this study is to reduce unplanned hospital readmission within 30 days of initial discharge, in those most at risk of being readmitted, using the aforementioned novel methods for identifying these participants and a transitional care intervention. This success of this goal will be analyzed across different readmission risk levels in the study population. Secondary goals of this study include reducing unplanned hospital readmission within 90 days, reducing 30-day post-discharge mortality, and reducing 30- and 90-day emergency department (ED) usage after an initial hospitalization.",

The study will be conducted at UM CRMC, an approximately 100-bed community hospital located in Charles County, Maryland. The target patient population is admitted patients (inpatients) at UM CRMC with a high readmission risk (RecuR Score) and/or specific admission diagnoses that are amenable to peri- and post-discharge interventions, where the goal is to reduce the readmission rate of this high-risk population. The study will use a fallback design with two primary endpoints. The first sequential primary endpoint is 30-day post-discharge unplanned hospital readmission in the overall study population. The second sequential primary endpoint is 30-day post-discharge unplanned hospital readmission in the medium-high risk population (RecuR Score 2 & 3).

Nasal congestion is one of the most general and bothersome symptoms in rhinitis, which affects the quality of life (QOL). Current medications are undesirable due to their side-effects. Acupuncture for AR in general can be considered as safe and can be seen as a potential remedial blueprint for nasal congestion. Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial uses a standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - to open the nose and affect underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time, to maintain its nose opening effect.

        "summary": "A heart attack (myocardial infarction) occurs when an artery supplying blood to the heart is suddenly blocked resulting in damage to the heart muscle.\nPatients presenting to hospital with a heart attack undergo an immediate angiogram (x-ray of the arteries in the heart) and are usually treated immediately with a balloon and stent to open their blocked artery. This procedure is called primary percutaneous coronary intervention (or primary PCI for short).\nAn angiogram is a routine procedure that involves insertion of fine plastic tube (catheter) into either the groin or wrist under local anaesthetic. The tube is passed into the artery in the heart and X-ray pictures are taken to find out if the arteries are blocked. Blocked arteries can usually be opened by passing a small balloon into the artery, via the fine plastic tube followed by placement of a stent (a fine metal coil) into the artery to prevent it from blocking again.\nAlthough this treatment is very successful, it can result in damage to the heart muscle when the artery is opened. Cooling the entire body has been shown to reduce heart muscle damage during heart attacks in some patients but not in others; however, it is uncomfortable due to the shivering, expensive and can result in delays in opening the blocked artery.\nThe investigators are conducting a series of research studies to find out if cooling the heart muscle directly through the catheter being used for the normal primary angioplasty treatment using room temperature may be effective in preserving heart muscle, without the shortcomings of entire body cooling.\nThe investigators have already published an initial series of ten cases in which this treatment appeared to be feasible without causing significant clinical problems.\nThe present study is a pilot study designed to assess the rate of patient recruitment and feasibility of this new treatment while exploring some detailed outcomes measuring the restoration of blood flow within the coronary artery at the end of the procedure.\nUltimately if the present pilot study is successful, the investigators plan to go on to undertake a much larger randomised outcome study to determine definitively whether this treatment can help reduce heart attack size.",

Women with a history of depression have a 20 fold higher risk of PDA at subsequent pregnancies. The adverse outcomes extend beyond maternal well-being to long-term deficits in children and families. The gut-brain axis is a newly recognized key player in mental health disorders. Specifically, the microbial composition of the gut along with their metabolites are directly involved in disease onset and course. Recent clinical studies have identified diet as the most powerful environmental factor in manipulating gut microbiome. Given vulnerability and resistance of pregnant women to pharmacotherapy, particularly in those with a predisposition to mood disorders, as well as pregnant women's high motivation and commitment to improving gestational diet, a dietary/supplemental intervention to 'optimize' gut microbiome, is a favored approach in disease management. The study investigators aim to exploit microbial responsiveness to diet together with this maternal motivation, to alter the risk and severity of a universal public health concern that has dire and long-term consequences for new moms and their children.\nThe investigators of this trial, will first study the challenges in pursuing a study aimed at changing the microbiome of pregnant women with a history of mood disorders.

The investigators implement a peer-mediated intervention in inclusive preschool classrooms, randomly assigned to treatment (n=12) or control (n=13) conditions. A focal child is identified in each classroom, representing a child with LI (3 to 5 years of age) who exhibits the poorest pragmatic-language skills and highest level of social exclusion in the classroom. Over a 12-week period, the focal children will receive peer-mediated intervention from identified peers, who use strategies to engage the focal child socially during center time, as supported by a classroom facilitator (teacher, aide). Outcomes of interest include the overarching classroom social network and its embedded socialization processes (e.g., frequency of child-to-child interaction), the focal child's interactions with peers and exposure to peer talk, and the focal child's social, behavioral, and linguistic skills. The study employs state-of-the-art social network analyses to represent the classroom network at the child, dyad, and network level and is dynamically modeled over the academic year using advanced location-tracking technologies and voice-activated recorders to capture incoming and outgoing peer talk for the focal child.

The study uses an randomized controlled trial design with 12 classrooms assigned to the treatment condition and 13 to the control condition. Within each classroom, the focal participants are children isolated from their classroom social network with low pragmatic language skills. The primary approach to treatment for focal children is described here. Specifically, focal children in classrooms randomized to the treatment condition receive peer-mediated pivotal response training (PRT) per procedures detailed by Brock et al.. PRT procedures are facilitated by a classroom facilitator-a classroom teacher or teaching assistant-who receives ongoing training and support from research staff. First, investigators provide a one-on-one 1-h training session for each facilitator that focuses on how to identify, initially train, and then support peers on a day-to-day basis during center time. Second, investigators partner with the facilitator to identify two peers who (a) demonstrate good social skills; (b) respond well to adult directions; (c) have consistent attendance; and (d) do not have a history of negative interactions with the target student. The facilitator explicitly identifies the focal child (buddy) and asks the children to use three strategies to play with the buddy during center time: (a) offer your buddy some play options; (b) show and talk about how to play with your buddy; (c) compliment your buddy; and (d) show your buddy how to take turns. At each training session the facilitator describes one strategy, provides examples, and has peers practice the strategy through role play. After trainings, the facilitator provides ongoing support during center time to implement the strategies over 12 weeks during months 3-6 of the 9 months of study participation.

Methods: Researchers will conduct a single site Phase II Pilot 2:1 RCT of PQ-ResPOND (intervention, n=30) vs. usual care (control, n=15) in 45 children \u22651 year-old & AYA with SNI and moderate to severe recurrent pain behaviors. After randomization, participants will answer weekly PQ-ResPOND surveys and monthly outcome surveys over 12 weeks via the PQ App, and a semi-structured exit interview. Intervention: participants assigned to this arm will receive the PQ-ResPOND intervention which combines (i) parent-mediated activation through weekly collection and feedback to parents and clinicians, via our PQ App, of parent reported child pain (Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Revised scale (NCCPC-R)) and other symptoms (PediQUEST-Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale adapted for children with SNI), with (ii) PPC team-mediated activation of primary clinicians and parents: through PPC consultation, and (iii) PPC team activation through training in a",

        "summary": "Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the most aggressive lung cancer subtypes, accounting for approximately 15-20% of total lung cancer cases. Although SCLC is relatively sensitive to chemotherapy, it is highly susceptible to recurrence. The advent of immunotherapy has revolutionized the clinical practice of oncology, and the newly released results of the ASTRUM-005 study have led to the incorporation of Serplulimab into the first-line treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. Although immunotherapy in combination with chemotherapy is currently the most promising regimen, due to the limited understanding of genetic alterations and the marked genetic heterogeneity of SCLC, treatment responsiveness varies greatly. Thus, there is an urgent need to find molecular biomarkers that can effectively predict prognosis and further suggest the effectiveness of this new treatment mode.\nMinimal residual disease (MRD) refers to the presence of tumor cells disseminated from the primary lesion to distant organs in patients who lack any clinical or radiological signs of metastasis or residual tumor cells left behind after local therapy that eventually lead to local recurrence. These years, the development of real-time, high-sensitivity liquid biopsy assays have enabled the identification of MRD in individual patients with cancer. Multiple studies have demonstrated that detection of MRD dynamics following definitive therapy for solid cancers is strongly prognostic and has extremely high positive predictive value for risk of recurrence and treatment efficacy.\nThe aim of this study was to explore the predictive value of MRD dynamics on disease prognosis before and after the first-line treatment of Serplulimab in combination with chemotherapy for extensive-stage SCLC.",

While some preliminary findings in oxytocin administration trials have been promising, a complete understanding of the effects of long-term oxytocin administration in autism remains elusive, as participant numbers in oxytocin administration studies in autism have been small, most studies exclusively recruit males, and reproducibility has been inconsistent.\nTo address this critical knowledge gap, this project will include a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled crossover trial of a four-week intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 international units, twice-daily) in 128 male and female youth with ASD aged 12-20, with social and repetitive behaviors as primary outcome measures. The investigators predict that intranasal oxytocin treatments will increase performance on social behavior measures and reduce repetitive behaviors using caregiver-reported measures.\nAlong with the investigation of oxytocin's long-term effects, the investigators will also assess the impact of oxytocin administration on computer-based laboratory tasks that can precisely measure how participants process social cues and disengage with repetitive behaviours.

        "summary": "Every year in France, 60,000 children are born prematurely (before 37 weeks of amenorrhea), and present an immaturity of their various systems, in particular the digestive system. This can result in feeding intolerance, which is expressed by abdominal distension, regurgitation or vomiting, irregular transit and abdominal discomfort. This feeding intolerance influences the length of hospitalization and can lead to necrotising enterocolitis, a major complication.\nIn the Neonatal Intensive Care Units of Clermont-Ferrand hospital center, abdominal massages have been performed by physiotherapists for several years in order to improve the condition of the digestive system. However, the indication for abdominal massage is very dependent on the caregivers in charge of the newborn and the evaluation of the abdominal condition remains subjective with a great variability between examiners. Thus, some newborns will receive massage multiple times a day while others will not.\nDevelopmental care is essential for these premature infants, especially to avoid over-stimulation. It is important not to add care, such as massage, if it is not needed. It is therefore essential to properly assess the digestive status of premature babies in order to determine whether they have feeding intolerance and whether they require treatment with abdominal massage.\nTo date, the investigators have not found measurable criteria or existing scales that can describe the digestive status of newborns. The main objective of the study is therefore to create and validate a clinical assessment scale for the abdominal status of preterm infants.",

        "summary": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an effective approach for treating both benign and malignant blood disorders. It primarily involves high-dose chemotherapy to eliminate tumor cells within the patient's body, as well as to suppress the recipient's hematopoiesis and immune function. The transplantation replaces the recipient's original hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with donor-derived HSCs, thereby reconstructing the donor's hematopoietic and immune functions to achieve disease cure.\nPoor graft function (PGF) following transplantation, which refers to inadequate engraftment of the transplanted hematopoietic stem cells, is one of the major factors limiting the effectiveness of allo-HSCT. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), identified within the bone marrow stroma, are a type of non-hematopoietic multipotent stem cells. Several studies, including previous research by our research team, suggest that MSCs can improve the bone marrow hematopoietic microenvironment by secreting various cytokines. This leads to the promotion of hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differentiation, enhancement of hematopoietic function, and support for hematopoiesis as well as direct or indirect promotion of vascular regeneration in damaged tissues and organs.\nTherefore, exploring the efficacy of umbilical cord-derived MSCs in treating poor graft function after allo-HSCT, observing the recovery of blood parameters in patients with poor engraftment, monitoring transplantation-related complications and immune reconstitution, and conducting preliminary investigations into the underlying mechanisms can contribute to the exploration of new clinical techniques for the treatment of PGF following allo-HSCT.",

The investigators have identified a significant tumor burden in non-enhancing (NE) regions beyond the contrast-enhancing (CE) portion of tumor. Furthermore, the investigators have adapted a pH-sensitive technique called amine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI to identify tumor cells in NE regions with high sensitivity and specificity. This study is a randomized trial of CEST based resections versus standard of care in newly diagnosed glioblastoma with primary endpoint of progression free survival and secondary endpoints of overall survival and quality of life metrics.

After an outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has rapidly spread from China to almost all over the world, it nearly affected all countries. In spite of its typical presentation in the form of fever, cough, myalgia, fatigue and pneumonia, other GIT manifestations were reported. We found some of COVID-19 survivors who had complained from anal fissure problem. The aim of this study was to report the prevalence of acute anal fissure among COVID-19 patients, its possible risk factors and outcome.\nMethods This is a retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 at Mansoura university isolation hospital, on COVID-19 patients' who were diagnosed with anal fissure. Those who survived and were discharged home safely were telephone called to pick up whether they suffered from any symptoms of anal pain, difficulty in defecation suggesting anal fissure, in order to identify their outcomes, the risk factors for anal fissure development and how they were managed.\nResults A total of 176 patients were enrolled in this study. Patients were categorized into two groups. The first group included patients who developed anal fissure (n=65) and the 2nd group included patients who did not develop anal fissure (n=111). No significant difference was noted in demographic data apart from the age which was younger in the fissure group. The incidence of anal fissure was 36.9% of total population. The majority of patients' anal fissure problem resolved spontaneously after patients improved from the COVID symptoms without receiving any treatment (43.1%).\nConclusion Anal fissure is quite common problem after COVID-19.

Subepithelial connective tissue graft (sCTG) is considered the gold standard in root coverage. However, over the years, several materials have been attempted to accelerate wound healing and to decrease the post-operative patient discomfort and pain, which are considered the most common disadvantages of tissue harvesting from the palate. Reharvesting from the same region could be necessary in some complicated gingical recessions. For this reason, patients may face long treatment times due to recovery periods of the palate between surgeries.\nPlatelet-rich fibrin (PRF) which has 3-dimensional fibrin matrix structure contributes to regeneration of surgical wounds by releasing growth factors for 10-14 days and showing angiogenic properties.\nIn medicine and dentistry, ultrasonography (USG) method can be used to measure tissue thickness, vascularization, elasticity and blood flow. USG, as a non-invasive method, can provide objective data in evaluating the effects of surgical techniques and biomaterials used on soft tissue healing dynamics and tissue perfusion.\nThe investigators hypothesised that leukocyte rich PRF (L-PRF) application to the palatal area after sCTG harvesting could increase palatal tissue thickness and vascularity throughout 3-month follow-up period compared to the controls. Therefore, in this study, the investigators aimed to evaluate the effects of the L-PRF membrane on soft tissue donor site healing after harvesting sCTG in terms of wound healing dynamics using USG method.",

It is one of the most significant causes of orofacial pain, along with dental pain. In TMD syndrome, the cause of pain is often due to overloading of the masticatory muscles rather than primary changes in the joints themselves.\nNowadays, doctors who treat patients with TMD have no doubt that one of the very important etiological factors of this condition is psycho-emotional disorders (excessive nervous excitability, anxiety, depression), which has been confirmed by numerous authors of studies on this subject [4-11].\nThe etiology of TMD is complex and multifactorial. Numerous factors may also contribute to the development of the disorder. An important factor affecting the state of masticatory function is an increase in stress levels (psycho-emotional tension). Structures such as the hypothalamus, reticular formation and limbic system have a decisive influence on the emotional state of each patient The activity of the limbic system, which governs the emotions of adults, and the additional connections of the gamma loops to the masticatory muscles, determine that increased emotional tension translates into a significant increase in the contractile activity of the masticatory muscles.\nTMD and functional disorder of the masticatory muscles are the most common complaint of the patients, seeking treatment in dental office. The two main symptoms of TMD problems are pain and dysfunction. Myalgia -the most common cause is an increased level of muscle use. It is related to vasocontraction of relevant arteries and accumulation of metabolic waste product in the muscles. Activities such as daytime clenching of the teeth and bruxism, habits of chewing gum, biting lips, finger nails or cheeks are factors that cause significant strain on the masticatory muscles and temporomandibular joints.",

        "summary": "Allergic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis (AR) and atopic dermatitis affect more than 25% of the world population and are the leading cause of illness in children. The complex interplay between genetic, environmental and immunological risk factors results in the manifestation of allergic diseases . The pathological presentation of allergic disease involves the activation of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in a multifaceted response in specific target tissues such as the airways . This response results in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to target tissues and the production of specific IgE antibodies, cytokines and other inflammatory mediators [11], [12]. It is well established that allergic inflammation triggers neuronal dysfunction, which activates specific inflammatory mechanisms, potentially leading to structural changes in the diseased tissue . Neurotrophins are a family of structurally related proteins initially discovered to be involved in regulating neuronal development and now known to govern both peripheral and central nerve growth.\nBDNF is a secretory protein belonging to the neurotrophin family and is involved in a range of neural processes during human development [19], [20]. In the early stages of development BDNF is essential for neurogenesis, survival and maturation of neuronal pathways. In the adult, alongside neurotransmitters, hormones and other neurotrophins, BDNF maintains synaptic plasticity, dendritic growth and the consolidation of long-term memory. The biological effect of BDNF is mediated via its binding to the trkB receptor. The activation of these receptors on eosinophils may be important in regulating the inflammatory cascade leading to allergic disease [15], [24]. Neurotrophin mediated activation of bronchial eosinophils might therefore play a role in the regulation of eosinophilic inflammation in allergic asthma .\nThe BDNF gene is located on chromosome 11p13 and is alternatively spliced resulting in several different transcripts [26]. Genetic polymorphisms in BDNF have been associated with allergic phenotypes such atopic dermatitis [27] and asthma [28], [29], [30], [31] in different populations. The functional polymorphism rs6265 (Val66Met) has been shown to regulate intracellular trafficking and affect the secretion of BDNF [32]. Nerve growth factor (NGF), a neurotrophin that is expressed in the glandular, nasal epithelium, and peripheral nerves in the nasal mucosa, has been shown to induce biochemical and structural changes in nerves that can lead to hyper-responsiveness [33], [34], [35] The biological effects of neurotrophins are mediated by binding either to the high-affinity tyrosine kinase (trk) receptors or to the low-affinity receptors known as pan-neurotrophin receptor p-75.",

Furthermore, normal aging is associated with decline in cognitive functioning. Given the prevalence of mental health problems and cognitive difficulties in older adults, mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) could be helpful in this population. Accordingly, a growing number of studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions in the elderly have beneficial effects on psychological health (decrease in depression, anxiety, sleep problems, and increase in general mood and positive affect) and cognition (enhanced attention, executive functions).\nElectroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique which can be useful to study the neurophysiological correlates of mindfulness, and give neurobiological evidence of its beneficial effect in the elderly.

A mental health service system that is guided by a rehabilitation and recovery perspective places emphasis on treating the consequences of the illness rather than just the illness per se, and on empowering people to regain control of their identity and life, and to have hope for the future. Within this philosophy, mental health policies in several countries advocate for the introduction of peer workers in mental health services, people with lived experience of mental health issues and recovery, who are employed to use their lived experience to support those who access mental health services. However, more effectiveness and implementation research is needed. Evidence also suggests that the period following hospital discharge is of high risk of treatment dropout for people with serious mental illness, thus interrupting their recovery process. Therefore, this vulnerable population may particularly benefit from more targeted interventions during this transitional period.\nThe research project will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness, feasibility and implementation of the Critical Time Intervention-Peer Support model, a recovery-oriented based model for people with serious mental illness discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment facilities in Portugal. The randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted in three psychiatric services in the Lisbon Metropolitan Area and their catchment areas.

A solution for prognostication in these patients is particularly appealing since it could allow to identify patients who can benefit of a more aggressive medical treatment and management, thus improving outcome.\nProposed methods, which include qualitative evaluations such as the identification of adverse atherosclerotic plaque characteristics or quantitative evaluations such as the quantification of atherosclerotic plaque burden, may in some cases suffer of limited reproducibility between operators and software. Most importantly, each single biomarker is insufficient to accurately predict patient risk, hence potential synergic integration of cCTA and clinical biomarkers is the key to efficiently guide the personalization of patient's management. Furthermore, the few risk stratification methods that have been proposed are not designed to work on platforms capable of deploying the solution to other clinical settings, promoting prospective or external validation",

The study will include two cohorts: a retrospective cohort of 2500 patients and a prospective cohort of 500 patients. The primary outcome measure is a composite outcome of death by cardiovascular events or non-fatal myocardial infarction, while the secondary outcome measure is a composite outcome of all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, hospitalization due to angina or angina-like symptoms, and late coronary revascularization. The study will use proportional hazards to analyze the data and will integrate all the data in order to select the most important determinant of CAD progression and to discard futile features, thus creating an agile and clinically valuable risk stratification model.

It can be caused by treatments such as chemotherapy or by certain medical conditions. Neutropenic sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency that occurs when patients with neutropenia develop an infection.

Neutrocheck is being developed for use as a self-test by patients at home alongside remote consultation with a HCP or at point-of-care by a HCP. This will allow rapid identification of patients requiring urgent intravenous antibiotics and medical assessment. In cases where Neutrocheck has eliminated the possibility of neutropenic sepsis, patients can avoid unnecessary and stressful hospital visits and valuable hospital resources will be saved.\nParticipants in this study will be invited to use the Neutrocheck test kit in a setting similar to a home environment to carry out a test, whilst being observed by a study moderator.\nThe Neutrocheck devices used in the study will be for investigational use only.

To improve survival, researchers need to find ways to identify returning disease earlier.\nObjective:\nTo find out if the radiotracer 18F-fluciclovine (a substance injected into the blood during imaging scans) is better at detecting MM than the one (18F-FDG) currently used for this purpose.\nEligibility:\nAdults aged 18 years or older with MM. The MM may be newly diagnosed (NDMM); or it may have returned or failed to respond after at least 1 prior line of treatment (RRMM).\nDesign:\nParticipants will be screened. They will have blood tests. They will have a positron emission tomography (PET) or computed tomography (CT) scan using 18F-FDG. The radiotracer will be injected into a vein. Then participants will lie on a table while the PET/CT scan takes images of their body.\nAll participants will have 3 study visits. During each visit they will have:\nTwo PET/CT scans. One with 18F-FDG, one with 18F-fluciclovine.\nAn optional magnetic resonance imaging scan.\nA bone marrow biopsy. An area on the hip will be numbed; a needle will be inserted to draw out a sample of the soft tissue from inside the bone.\nThese tests may be spread over 30 days for each visit.\nNDMM participants will have their second study visit 2 to 4 weeks after they complete their usual treatment for the disease.

        "summary": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that often results in motor and/or cognitive impairment. Epidemiologically, the onset occurs between the ages of 20 and 40, with a peak around the age of 30.\nMS is an extremely heterogeneous disease in terms of signs and symptoms, both in terms of the neurological systems involved and the degree of impairment and severity. The most common symptoms include, among others, difficulty walking and lack of balance. The lack of stability and coordination reduces independence and mobility, predisposing people with MS to accidental falls and compromising mobility in daily life. Another symptom that characterises MS is cognitive impairment, which mainly alters information processing speed and short- and long-term memory. MS-related cognitive impairment is detectable at every stage of the disease. Very often, people with MS have co-existing cognitive and motor deficits, which add to the complexity of managing MS. In order to address this condition, a treatment strategy that combines cognitive and motor rehabilitation needs to be identified. Despite the increasing availability of effective drug therapies that may impact on balance, rehabilitation is a very important means to counteract the progression of disability and improve physical function, affecting social participation and improving quality of life. In recent years, rehabilitation makes use of various robotic devices, which are based on repeatable, intense and motivating exercises, integrated with an enriched virtual environment, capable of improving the quality of movement.

Although most verrucae will disappear spontaneously, many patients do seek treatment. Current wart treatments do not target the cause of the lesion directly, resulting in variable treatment efficacies and high wart recurrence rates. AV2 is a broad-spectrum antiviral drug, that is capable of deactivating HPV. It is however not able to destruct the already infected cells, which raises the need for an additional ablative treatment i.e. salicylic acid (SA). Implementation of AV2-Salicylic acid (AV2-SA) combination therapy would ensure permanent lesion clearance by on the one hand inactivation of HPV by AV2, and on the other hand elimination of the lesion by SA treatment. The primary aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of AV2-SA treatment versus standard SA treatment, by comparing cure and recurrence rates of cutaneous warts between the two treatment groups (at 12 weeks and six months after randomization). The second aim is to assess the safety and tolerability of AV2-SA therapy. The third aim is to identify subgroups of cutaneous warts that have favorable response to treatment, by comparing cure rates in an HPV genotype-specific manner. This randomized controlled trial will enroll 260 participants with cutaneous warts who will either receive the AV2-SA combination therapy or SA control treatment.

        "summary": "Despite technical advances in Medically Assisted Reproduction (AMP), the success of fertility treatments is sometimes limited by embryo implantation failure. The coordinated development of the embryo and the uterine endometrium requires close communication between the maternal tissue and the embryo. In in vitro fertilization (IVF), embryo transfer generally takes place between the 2nd (D2) and the 6th (D6) day following oocyte fertilization. Recent studies have shown the advantages of sequential transfer (transfer of an embryo on D2/D3 followed by the transfer of another embryo on D5/D6), with higher implantation and clinical pregnancy rate, fewer miscarriages, more live births, and yet no increase in multiple pregnancies. However, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine recommendations continue to prioritize the transfer of a single embryo for all patients aged under 38. To improve pregnancy rates for patients having a single embryo transferred, the study investigators wish to carry out on blank transfer, based on the principle of sequential transfer. The study investigators hypothesize that a culture medium, placed in the uterus before the time of embryo transfer, will modify immune tolerance. The study will test whether transferring the same culture medium in an equivalent quantity as during the real transfer into the uterus 2/3 days before the embryo transfer will improve tolerance to this foreign medium and, therefore, embryo implantation.

Data in the literature have shown that hyporeactivity to catecholamines is associated with a decrease in the density of \u03b1 and \u00df receptors in the aorta and heart, respectively, as well as an increase in GRK2 levels and that NO contributes to the increase of this kinase in sepsis .\nBased on this, it is hypothesized that cardiac dysfunction and decreased peripheral vascular resistance observed in sepsis may result from an increase in GRK2 activity and/or expression and its inhibition may be a relevant therapeutic target in septic shock patients. Based on this line, a measurable clinical benefit of paroxetine through the regulation of GRK2 expression in patients with septic shock is postulated.",

        "summary": "Microneedle (MN) is a mimic of a hypodermic needle, composed of hundreds of micron-sized, out-of-plane protrusions, typically arranged in arrays on a patch that can be applied onto the skin. MN can be fabricated from a variety of materials, preferably biocompatible polymers. Maltose, a natural carbohydrate, is a safe and biocompatible product that can be fabricated into MNs that are biodegradable and soluble within several minutes. Besides, local anaesthetic agents such as lignocaine can be impregnated within the MN matrix, facilitating its transdermal delivery more efficiently which results in enhanced efficacy. So far, maltose MN efficacy in enhancing the transdermal drug delivery (TDD) of lignocaine and thus reducing the pain experienced by healthy patients requiring intravenous cannulation prior to routine eye surgeries (phacoemulsification, trabeculectomy etc) has not been extensively studied. Hence, the objectives of this research are: 1) To evaluate the safety profile of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch as a means of pain reduction in adult patients requiring routine vein-puncturing procedures; 2) To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of lignocaine in the systemic circulation when the transdermal lignocaine delivery is enhanced through microneedle usage; 3) To compare the efficacy of lignocaine-embedded microneedle patch with standard 5% Eutectic Mixture of Local Anesthetics (EMLA) dermal patch for pain reduction during venepuncture procedure based on mean changes in VAS scores and skin algesimeter index (pharmacodynamic (PD) study).",

This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time, next to reduced level of physical activity. Young people spend most of their time in a sitting position while studying (in school class, during homework) and using electronic devices (using the computer, laptop, mobile phone, tablets, or watching TV), and now using e-learning methods. E-learning, and thus prolonged sitting, is a topic that returned to higher education at the beginning of the 2022-2023 academic year because of the current energy crisis. Re-education on sitting posture is a common aspect of LBP management. Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat the negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Studies showed that sitting posture with the backrest on the chair induced minimal changes in lumbar lordosis and significantly lesser pain compared to other types of the chair. Even though the sitting posture will be followed by proper ergonomic principles, every position (lordotic or kyphotic) maintained for a prolonged time leads to discomfort and soft tissue symptoms. Studies showed that body perceived discomfort scores increased over time during sitting and after 30 min of sitting is significantly greater than those at baseline. Currently, breaks are recommended for mitigating the adverse of prolonged sitting, but more evidence is needed to verify effectiveness of breaks. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP. Optimal combination of sitting and breaks will help to develop ergonomic recommendations for young people.

The study will be conducted in two arms: experimental and active comparator. The experimental arm will receive 100 \u03bcg LSD (first session) and 100 or 200 \u03bcg LSD (second session) per os. The active comparator arm will receive 25 \u03bcg LSD (first session) and 25 \u03bcg LSD (second session) per os. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice guidelines.",

        "summary": "The goal of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of SmartMom, a text messaging-based mobile health program for prenatal education. The main questions are to determine if healthy pregnant people receiving SmartMom messages that promote health behaviours in pregnancy versus messages that don't provoke behaviour change have improvement in:\nknowledge about healthy pregnancy and birth\nstandardized measures of depression, anxiety, and fear of childbirth\nadoption of positive health behaviours in pregnancy\nmaternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes\nParticipants in the intervention group will receive three evidence-based text messages per week, plus optional supplemental messages on topics relevant to them, throughout pregnancy.\nThe control group will receive general interest messages on pregnancy-related topics that are not promoting behaviour change.",
        "model_output": "=========\n\nSmartMom: Teaching by Texting to Promote Health Behaviours in Pregnancy is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a behavioral intervention, SmartMom text messaging, in promoting healthy behaviors during pregnancy. The study is designed to measure the change in weight during pregnancy, attendance at prenatal care visits, changes in health knowledge, health literacy, fear of childbirth, depression, anxiety, use of tobacco, vaping, alcohol, or cannabis, rates of planned vaginal birth after cesarean, exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge, rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes, and incremental costs per incidence of suboptimal weight gain and inadequate prenatal care avoided. The study is conducted in Canada, excluding British Columbia, where SmartMom has been piloted. Eligible participants are pregnant persons at 15 weeks gestation or earlier singleton pregnancy who can read and understand English at grade 8 level and comfortable completing online surveys, live in Canada (excluding British Columbia), and have no health conditions existing prior to pregnancy that require individualized care or have previously had a baby with the SmartMom program. Participants are randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which receives three text messages per week with evidence-based information to promote healthy behaviors during pregnancy, or the control group, which receives one text message per week with general information about pregnancy but not about making healthy choices. The study is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and has received ethical approval from the Centre Hospitalier Valida Research Ethics Committee.",
