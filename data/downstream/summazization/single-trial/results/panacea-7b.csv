The investigators have already pointed out separately for the three pathological conditions (chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia) that there is evidence that factors such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences may contribute significantly to the genesis of these disorders through a process of central sensitization of pain pathways. Central sensitization (CS) is defined as increased responsiveness of nociceptive neurons in the central nervous system to their normal or subthreshold afferent input according to the IASP - International Association for the Study of Pain (Arendt-Nielsen et al., 2018). A sensitized nervous system has been considered one of the most important mechanisms involved in NP (Cohen, 2022). CS plays a role in fibromyalgia, in which alteration of central nociceptive processing occurs and pain can be worsened by psychological factors (Sluka & Clauw, 2016). In migraine, CS may contribute to acute allodynia and headache chronification (De Tommaso & Sciruicchio, 2016). Furthermore, in migraine CS may play a role in trigeminal nerve activation and cortical spreading depression (De Tommaso & Sciruicchio, 2016). It has been suggested that migraine may be considered as a brain state of altered excitability and a disorder of sensory processing (Goadsby et al., 2017), encompassing additional symptoms as fatigue and mood disorders (Karsan & Goadsby, 2021). Structural and functional MRI studies in women with provoked vulvar or distant/extra- genital pain have supported a role of central sensitization and dysregulation of endogenous pain modulatory systems in the central nervous system in the pathophysiology of vulvodynia (Bergeron et al., 2020). In the process of central sensitization, psychological factors such as traumatic events in childhood, the development of specific personality expressions (traits), and the use of different forms of defense mechanisms also play a role. No study to our knowledge has yet tried to identify specific clusters of psychological factors (personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences) capable of characterizing or differentiating between the different pathologies expressed by a NP. In addition to this, the study of psychosocial factors associated with the experience of such pathologies or possible emerging clusters such as depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. This will make it possible to identify specifically for each condition the areas of greatest interest that can be investigated and treated in clinical intervention tailored to the person."

The Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model that is universally thought to improve health, and it is known that the Mediterranean diet has beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. The major difference between the Mediterranean diet and the Western-style diet is the source and amount of dietary fat and carbohydrates. The Mediterranean diet is rich in foods containing monounsaturated fat (especially omega-3), antioxidant vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, C, E, folic acid, selenium, zinc, calcium), which are thought to have positive effects on the prevention and course of MS. Preferring vegetable oils instead of animal fats in Mediterranean type diet, preferring fish instead of red meat consumption, preferring low-fat / fat-free milk and dairy products, limiting the intake of simple sugar and refined carbohydrates, increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in pulp and antioxidants. It is thought that this type of nutrition may positively affect the course and treatment of immune diseases by reducing inflammation. Although there is no effective clinical evidence for the application of nutritional support as complementary therapy in MS patients, it is known that patients often use various nutritional supplements to reduce symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. It is also important to determine the frequency of current nutritional support use in order to prevent unconscious use of nutritional support in the group. Because the most common symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, individuals with MS are often less physically active than age-matched adults All these negativities result in decreased functional activities, loss of mobility and balance problems. Walking and, in a broader sense, mobility are functions that are frequently affected in MS and have a high negative impact on quality of life. Gait problems are not uncommon in MS, and it is reported that a significant portion of individuals in this group are adversely affected by their daily living activities. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters."

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition in the general population. The prevalence of OAB is higher in women and in the elderly. The prevalence of OAB is also higher in the CALD population. The treatment of OAB is often challenging and the treatment options are limited. The first line treatment is anticholinergic medication. If this is not effective, the second line treatment options are onabotulinum toxin A (Botox) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM). The aim of this study is to investigate the preference of a CALD population for second line OAB therapy. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) will be used to investigate the preference of a CALD population for second line OAB therapy. The DCE will be conducted in a group of 100 patients with OAB.

The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks CGA exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no). The investigators set the alpha error rate at 0.05 and power at 80%. To achieve a 50% reduction in the CPAP weaning failure rate, they aimed to enroll a total of 80 infants < 28 weeks and 50 infants 28-30 weeks (130 infants in total). Consent will be obtained after the eligible infant has been extubated or has been stable on NIS (defined as CPAP/NIMV/NIPPV- all modes of pressure reliant respiratory support) for over 72 hours. NIS is delivered via occlusive (Fischer & Paykel [F&P]) or non-occlusive (RAM TM/Nioflo TM) interfaces at any pressure and oxygen need. A standardized maintenance/weaning protocol will be implemented for the treatment group (standardized NIS wean) while the control group (routine care) will undergo weaning based on unit-specific practices. All infants in the treatment group will remain on CPAP until either 32 or 34 weeks CGA, depending on their GA age at birth. Infants born at 27 6/7 weeks or less will continue on CPAP until at least 34 weeks if they are in the treatment group, whereas infants born between 28 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks will stay on CPAP until at least 32 weeks if they are in the treatment group. The weaning protocol in the treatment group will incorporate algorithms outlining stability criteria, failure criteria, and algorithms for registered nurses (RN) and respiratory therapists (RTs), including steps to take in such situations. The control group will be weaned according to the unit's or medical team's practices."

Cleft lip and palate is the most common congenital defect of the head and neck. The first known cleft-lip repair was a straight-line suture and a simple cut along the cleft borders, followed by a curved incision to lengthen the lip. The Millard rotation-advancement approach was created to align the scar with the philtral column naturally occurring. The Cupid's bow is distorted and the white roll up is pulled up by scar contracture. Mishra modified Millard's technique to create the vermilion and white roll on the medial lip segment. The aim of this study is to compare the surgical outcomes of the modified Millard and Mishra techniques in unilateral cleft lip repair."

Diverticular disease is a common condition in western countries with relatively uncommon complications. Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon. A new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, Tübingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal. Here we report on the use of OTSC in the endoscopic treatment of colo-cutaneous fistula as acomplication of acute diverticulitis . Rationale: As endoscopy is less invasive maneuver and can be done without general anathesia , so we will try to close the fistula due to acute diverticulitis with OVASCO clip , to avoid major surgery with also high incidence of recurrence again . there is only one clinical trial for this resons , so we will try to achieve result to concolude the use of endoscopy in management GIT fistulas. Research question: Is Endoscopic Management Of Controlled Colo-cutaneous Fistula As A complication of Acute Diverticulitis Effective? Hypothesis: Yes The Endoscopic Management Of Low Output Recurrent Colonic Fistula After Anterior Resection For Rectal Cancer Is Effective . Aim of the work Management Of Controlled Colo-cutaneous Fistula As A complication of Acute Diverticulitis & reducing the morbidity & mortality Endoscopically. Objectives To evaluate the advantages and safety of Endoscopic Management Of Controlled Colo-cutaneous Fistula As A complication of Acute Diverticulitis. To evaluate the effect of Endoscopic Management Of Controlled Colo-cutaneous Fistula As A complication of Acute Diverticulitis in reducing morbidity and postoperative hospital stay.

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients. This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram."

The PHYSIOSCORE is a clinical tool developed to assess the complexity level and physical therapy care in hospitalized patients. The PHYSIOSCORE is composed of 106 items divided into three domains: respiratory, imaging, and neuromuscular. The respiratory domain consists of six items for patients with spontaneous breathing or noninvasive mechanical ventilation and six items for patients on invasive mechanical ventilation. The imaging domain is divided into four segments: pulmonary parenchyma, pleura, vascular plot, and expandability. The neuromuscular domain consists of six items: neuropsychological, muscle strength and tone, postural control, neuromotor coordination, and walking. The PHYSIOSCORE was developed and validated in a sample of 110 patients hospitalized for clinical or surgical cardiac conditions. The interrater agreement and reliability were established following a prospective and observational single-center study. The PHYSIOSCORE was applied to assess the level of attention and complexity of physical therapy care by one professional. Then, a second physical therapist with at least five years of experience performed respiratory and neuromuscular physical therapy. The time spent evaluating respiratory and neuromuscular physical therapist care and registering electronic medical records were all timed.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of selective adjuvant therapy for patients with human papillomavirus (HPV) or its surrogate marker p16, positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (hereafter p16+OPSCC) based on residual circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels. The investigators propose use of ctDNA clearance to identify patients who are optimal for observation post-TORS. This protocol tests the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for adjuvant RT based on intermediate risk factors can be observed post-TORS when ctDNA is cleared. Patients with p16+OPSCC who are candidates for surgery (TORS) and have positive ctDNA will be offered registration for the study prior to surgical resection. After TORS, all patients will have ctDNA drawn within 2-14 days post operatively. Combined with pathological criteria, all patients will be stratified into one three risk groups; low risk, intermediate risk, high risk. The low risk group will be observed (no radiation) per standard of care (SOC). The intermediate group (intermediate pathological features and negative ctDNA) will also be observed (no radiation) per the experimental arm. The high risk group will receive adjuvant treatment (RT +/- chemotherapy) per SOC."

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a chronic malignancy with no current cure. Previously dependent on myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation to induce prolonged remission, recent advances in targeted therapies are enhancing overall survival and extending the duration between treatments. Monoclonal antibodies, including CD38-directed monoclonal antibodies, combination immunotherapies, and T-cell therapies are among the many promising agents for treating relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM. This improvement in treatment outcomes is accompanied by significant risk for toxicities such a neutropenia and subsequent infections which themselves can be life-threatening. Several studies indicate a high symptom burden and poor health-related quality of life for individuals with multiple myeloma, with most of what is known from clinical trials of highly selective populations or qualitative studies conducted outside of the US among mostly white patients. These factors, coupled with the rapidly changing multiple myeloma treatment landscape, limits the generalizability to wider population as well as an understanding of MM's impact across the disease course. A more complete investigation of the symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among patients with multiple myeloma is urgently needed to provide a comprehensive view of the ways in which multiple myeloma and its treatments affects individuals' lives. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of symptom monitoring and digital life coaching (DLC) to inform a more complete understanding of the impact of multiple myeloma on symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among a diverse U.S.-based, contemporary sample. The benefits of routine symptom monitoring have been demonstrated in recent studies, where overall survival increased among cancer patients who routinely monitored their symptoms. As the science related to symptom monitoring continues to evolve, exploring interventions to support both the assessment of and interventions related to disease and treatment-related sequelae it is important to identify how symptoms can best be monitored and managed. Studies to date have explored how symptom monitoring can be conducted for patients in the ambulatory setting, where patients do not receive around the clock assessment and management as they would in the hospital setting. In this context, digital or eHealth technologies are increasingly emerging as ways to promote health behaviors, and to monitor individuals with chronic health states, including cancer. An integrative review of 28 articles specifically evaluating eHealth interventions for patients with cancer identified 16 unique eHealth interventions, largely centered around educational support and decision aids. Telehealth counseling and navigation was found to be effective in supporting psychosocial needs in a small study (n=20) of underserved (defined by the authors as those who were primarily unemployed and uninsured) breast cancer patients. In a study of 1371 cancer patients, 71% reported using a mobile phone daily and 93% reported having internet access from home, of which 68% reported daily internet use, suggesting that internet-based technologies may be purposeful in the sharing of information with and coordination of care for cancer patients. Despite literature indicating its potential efficacy, few interventional studies have been published that evaluate digital health coaching and its relationship with self-efficacy and symptom management, specifically in R/R MM patients. As such, there is a gap in the literature on how digital health coaching might be used to support patients during cancer treatment and into survivorship. Pack Health, LLC is an independent, patient engagement company that was established in 2014 with the mission of helping patients access the right care for their condition and develop the self-management skills to achieve better health and overall well-being. Pack Health offers a symptom management program involving both interpersonal interactions as well as e-modules for patients diagnosed with cancer to better manage pain, fatigue, depression, anxiety and navigate their care more effectively through digital health coaching and tools. A recent pilot study at UCSF conducted in collaboration with Pack Health examined the impact of digital life coaching (DLC) on symptom outcomes for individuals with MM undergoing upfront stem cell transplantation. Outcomes suggest the efficacy of a coaching program for engagement up to day +100 post-transplant, with 73% (n=11) DLC engagement and 94% PRO completion. A randomized study of DLC versus usual care in individuals with MM undergoing upfront stem cell transplantation is underway. However, patients with R/R MM (where the disease has come back after prior lines of therapy such as transplantation) may have unique needs"

Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation. The most common types of IBD are Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn's Disease (CD). The exact cause of IBD is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The most important environmental factor is the gut microbiota, which is the community of microorganisms that live in the intestines. The gut microbiota is important for maintaining a healthy gut, but in IBD patients, the gut microbiota is often altered and this is associated with increased inflammation.
In addition to the gut microbiota, dietary factors are also important in the development and progression of IBD. Patients with IBD often have a low intake of dietary fiber, which is a type of carbohydrate that is not digested by the body. Dietary fiber is important for maintaining a healthy gut, as it is fermented by the gut microbiota and produces short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), which have anti-inflammatory properties. However, patients with IBD often have a low intake of dietary fiber, which may contribute to the development and progression of IBD.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of a 4-week intervention with a dried vegetable fiber (WholeFiberTM) on inflammation, fecal gut microbiota and metabolites, IBD-complaints and Quality of Life (QoL) in patients with CD and UC. The study will also assess the feasibility and acceptance of the intervention in this population."

Episiotomy is a planned surgical incision to the perineum and posterior wall of the vagina during the second stage of labor. The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and non-ablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain. In this study, the therapeutic effect of Er:YAG laser on the tissue healing of the episiotomy scars and the reduction of vulvar pain."

Gallstone disease affects 10-15% of people in the United Kingdom (UK) and over 65,000 patients undergoing cholecystectomy each year, costing the National Health Service (NHS) over 110 million. There is increasing evidence suggesting differences in the gut microbiome of patients with gallstone disease compared to those without (including reduced diversity, decreased prevalence of beneficial and increased prevalence of pathogenic bacteria) but there are only a handful of small scale studies exploring the development of gallstone disease complications and patient outcomes to date. This pilot study aims to understand the profile of the gut microbiome in adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease and its relationship with patient outcomes including: Patients who develop complications of gallstone disease(including but not limited to biliary colic, cholangitis, cholecystitis, pancreatitis and gallstone ileus) following diagnosis and Patients who develop post-operative complications including short (hospital stay, wound healing etc) and intermediate (development of post-cholecystectomy diarrhoea) outcomes. A prospective cohort design will be used to collect data from 75 adult patients presenting to East Kent University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust Hospitals with newly diagnosed gallstone disease following confirmatory imaging investigations. Data will be collected from electronic patient records including clinical history and diagnostic investigations, anthropometry, blood and imaging results (if taken as part of routine clinical care) for the initial presentation and subsequent readmissions/planned follow-up timepoints. Stool samples will be collected from patients either during admission or at home at each timepoint. Samples will be returned by post to the research team where they will be stored and analysed. Patients will also be asked to provide a 3 day food diary card Patients will have a sample collected at time of diagnosis and then at 6 monthly intervals whilst awaiting cholecystectomy. A pre-operative sample will be required within 6 weeks of any surgical intervention. Following cholecystectomy an immediate post-operative sample (within the first week) will be collected as well as a sample at 6 months. Clinical and Scientific Impact: At least 20% of those patients awaiting cholecystectomy experience complications, costing the NHS over £25 million per year. Therefore, there is a huge need to understand mechanisms behind the development of complications and to reduce the symptom burden for patients as well as the financial burden for the NHS. This study is the crucial first step in identifying differences in the gut microbiome between patients who experience complications (both pre and post-op) and those who do not. Once differences are discovered the next step will be to use the information discovered to determine interventions to reduce the development of these complications."

Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) is a common complication in patients with sepsis. The aspartate aminotransferase to platelet (APRI) ratio index is a simple and reliable marker for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis. However, the relationship between APRI and the occurrence of SALD in patients with sepsis is unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between APRI and the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.
                We included adult sepsis patients (≥18 years) as study participants, but only those who had data available for their first hospitalization and first ICU admission were enrolled in our study, if they had multiple admission records in the database. Exclusion criteria include: 1) all types of chronic liver disease; 2) viral hepatitis; 3) primary acute cholangiopathies; 4) cholecystitis; 5) hepatic infarction; 6) liver necrosis; 7) liver trauma; 8) length of ICU stay < 24 hours. Patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission were also excluded. The following indicators were extracted directly or derived from the database(MIMIC IV): age; weight; gender; comorbidity, including hypertension, old myocardial infarct, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, chronic pulmonary disease, chronic renal disease and diabetes; infection site, including blood, lung, skin and soft tissue, abdominal cavity and urinary tract; disease severity scores within the first day of ICU admission, including Acute Physiology Score III (APS III), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), Logistic Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS), Oxford Acute Severity of illness Score (OASIS) and Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPS II); mean vital signs in first 24h, including heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR), temperature and pulse oxygen saturation (SPO2); treatment received within the first day of ICU admission, including invasive ventilation, vasopressor therapy, renal replacement therapy and parenteral nutrition (PN) support; initial laboratory parameters, including white blood cell (WBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red blood cell (RBC), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), platelet, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (TBIL), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, bicarbonate, anionic gap, sodium, potassium, chloride, total calcium, glucose, prothrombin time (PT), partial prothrombine time (APTT), international normalized ratio (INR) and APRI; clinical outcome measures, including intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay (LOS), hospital LOS, ICU mortality, in-hospital mortality, and 30-day mortality. The disease severity scores, including APS III, SOFA, LODS, OASIS, SAPS II, are calculated using the SQL code provided by Johnson et al. APRI is calculated by (AST(IU/L)/ upper limits of normal)/PLT(k/uL)×100. Sepsis is diagnosed according to the Third International Consensus Definitions for Sepsis and Septic Shock (Sepsis-3).

The study was carried out as a randomized controlled experimental study. Women who met the criteria for inclusion in the study and accepted the study (n:180) were told how to apply skin-to-skin contact. Skin-to-skin contact was initiated within the first minutes of normal delivery and skin-to-skin contact was applied to the mothers for a minimum of 15 minutes (due to the high number and frequency of births in the TDL service and hospital conditions). Routine newborn care procedures (eye drops, vaccination, footprints, etc.) performed in the delivery room were performed during skin-to-skin contact. After the skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the newborn was terminated at the end of delivery, 2 hours later, mothers were asked to fill in a personal questionnaire and a traumatic birth scale. The maternal attachment scale was completed 1 month after birth by telephone interview. Standard midwifery practices and labor follow-up were applied to women who met the inclusion criteria in the hospital (during the delivery room) (n: 187), agreed to participate in the study, and were in the control group. Neonatal routine care procedures (vaccine, footprint, eye drop application, etc.) of the postpartum hospital were performed. Then, after 2 hours postpartum, mothers were asked to fill in a personal questionnaire and a traumatic birth scale. The maternal attachment scale was completed 1 month after birth by telephone interview."

This prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind, single-centre study was approved by our Ethics Committee (KAEK2023/06). The investigators followed the Consolidated Reporting Trials Standards (CONSORT). It was conducted in patients undergoing elective lumbar discectomy, and informed consent was obtained from the patients. They were randomised using a closed envelope technique, opened by the physician performing the block. 54 patients were included in the study, divided into two groups of 27 patients as esp block (group 1) and control group (group 2), both groups underwent standard general anaesthesia. The blocks were performed in the operating theatre at the end of the operation, before the patient woke up. The patients were unaware that the block was being performed on them. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device was given to both groups by another doctor blinded to the group, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores assessed for 24 hours. Standard monitoring (peripheral oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring) was performed. Anaesthesia induction was achieved with 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium, and anaesthesia maintenance with 2% sevoflurane, 4 lt/min 50%/50% oxygen/nitrogen mixture. Both groups received 1 g IV paracetamol towards the end of surgery. The patients were extubated after 2 mg/kg of sugammadex and were transferred to the recovery room. The first group underwent sacral espb at the end of surgery. The lumbosacral region was sterilised with povidine iodine and then draped with the patient in prone position. The linear ultrasound probe was placed in the midline on the spinous process of the 5th lumbar vertebra after the sterile covering had been applied. After observation of the sacrum, the level of the 2nd median crest was determined and the ultrasound probe was moved 1.5-2 cm laterally and the 2nd intermediate crest and the erector spinae muscle between the two were observed. 22 G 50 mm needle was advanced from caudal to cranial direction to the sacral crest using in-plane technique, after confirming the needle position with 1-2 ml saline, 0.25% bupivacaine 20 ml was administered, local anaesthesia was observed to spread cauda-cranially separating the erector spinae muscle from the sacral crest, the same procedure was performed on the opposite side. All patient demographics, age, weight, and duration of surgery, post-operative VAS scores, blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation values at 30 min, 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours, total tramadol consumption, rescue analgesic use, time of first rescue analgesic requirement, patient satisfaction and side effects were recorded. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to examine the normality of quantitative data. Comparison of normally distributed data was performed by independent samples t-test, and comparison of non-normally distributed data was performed by Mann-Whitney U test. Comparison of qualitative data was performed using the Pearson chi-squared test. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation, median (minimum - maximum) and n (%). Statistical significance was accepted as p<0.05. In a previous study (9), the power analysis performed to detect a difference of 15.4 mg between the 48-hour opioid consumption values of the two groups (p<0.05) was calculated with 90% power and an effect size of 0.96, and the required sample size was determined to be 24 for each group. If 10-15% of patients were excluded from the study, 27 patients were included for each group and 54 patients in total."

The investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as taught muscle bands, trigger points (TPs), and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker)."

This study will use a two-arm, blinded, randomized controlled trial to estimate the effect of the adapted telehealth video intervention on pain recovery and opioid use at 3 months among opioid-naïve adult Emergency Department (ED) and urgent care patients with musculoskeletal pain. This 2-year study will encompass the conduct and analysis of an assessor-blinded two-arm randomized controlled trial among 200 ED/urgent care patients with acute MSP. Randomization will be block stratified by the subject's age (18-40 years; 41+ years). To test the efficacy of the intervention subjects will be randomized to one of two arms: Intervention (video) Usual Care (standard care provided by ED/urgent care provider and staff) Intervention: The telehealth intervention consists of an interactive video ( 15 minutes) given to the patient after an ED/urgent care visit that provides essential pain treatment information and encourages patients to discuss treatment options with their ED/urgent care provider. Following the video, the participant will contact the research team with his/her answers to the multiple choice questions posed during the video and/or confirm having watched the video within, at most, 5 days of the participant's discharge / acute care visit. Evaluation: Data collection will occur for subjects in all arms of the study according to the schedule below: Baseline after the ED/urgent care visit via phone call interview 1 and 3 months after ED/urgent care discharge via phone call interview Outcomes follow-up: A phone call questionnaire will be performed at 1 and 3 months following patient discharge from the ED/urgent care for patients in all arms of the study. This questionnaire will be designed to evaluate current pain as well as average, maximum, and minimum pain in the past week. Additional questions will include opioid use, pain interference with general activity, walking, sleep, and enjoyment of life; side effects; return ED/urgent care visits for pain; and other health care utilization for pain."

Neuro-Linguistic Programming (NLP) techniques have been used in various contexts, including education. Some educators and practitioners believe that NLP can help children develop their communication skills, self-confidence, and self-awareness and improve their learning outcomes. Some NLP techniques adapted for children include: (1) Anchoring involves linking a particular emotional or sensory state with a physical stimulus, such as a touch or a visual cue. For example, a teacher might use a specific gesture or word to help a child feel more confident before a test. (2) Reframing: This technique involves helping a child see a situation or problem differently. For example, a teacher might help a child reframe a difficult math problem as a fun challenge. And (3) Meta-modeling: This technique involves helping children become more aware of their language patterns and the language patterns of others, which can improve communication skills and self-awareness.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of NLP on the academic performance of primary school students in Lebanon. The study will include 130 children aged between 5 and 11 years attending the same school for at least a year. The intervention will consist of 4 sessions for teachers and 2 for children. The study will assess the impact of NLP on school triggers, schoolchildren's strengths and difficulties, and concentration, hyperactivity, and reasoning of schoolchildren."

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of cSDH is not well understood, and there is no consensus on the optimal management of this condition. The investigators hypothesize that spreading depolarization (SD) is a key pathophysiologic mechanism in cSDH. SD is a phenomenon in which a wave of depolarization spreads across the cortex, leading to a loss of consciousness and seizures. SD has been implicated in the pathophysiology of other neurologic conditions, such as stroke and traumatic brain injury. The investigators propose to perform subdural ECoG monitoring in patients undergoing surgical evacuation of cSDH to assess for the presence or absence of SD. The investigators will also perform long-term follow-up testing to assess for neurologic deficits and recovery. The investigators hypothesize that the presence of SD will be associated with worse neurologic outcomes and that the detection of SD will guide the management of cSDH."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the genetic determinants of response to growth hormone (GH) treatment in children with idiopathic short stature (ISS). ISS is a condition where children are shorter than their peers for no apparent reason. GH is a hormone that stimulates growth and is used to treat children with ISS. However, the response to GH treatment varies greatly between children. Some children respond well to GH treatment and grow a lot, while others do not respond well and do not grow much. The investigators want to find out why some children respond well to GH treatment and others do not.

In this study, the investigators will collect blood samples from children with ISS who have been treated with GH for at least one year. The investigators will compare the genetic information in the blood samples of children who respond well to GH treatment with the genetic information in the blood samples of children who do not respond well to GH treatment. The investigators will also compare the genetic information in the blood samples of children who respond well to GH treatment with the genetic information in the blood samples of children who do not respond well to GH treatment.

The investigators hope that by studying the genetic information in the blood samples, they will be able to identify genetic factors that are associated with response to GH treatment. This information could help doctors to predict which children are likely to respond well to GH treatment and which children are not likely to respond well to GH treatment."

The aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside versus conventional BB in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside BB is non inferior to conventional BB in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. The main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological) on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives of this study are to: compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy compare microbiological culture results between groups compare the safety of both procedures compare DFO remission according to results of BB (negative or positive) The health economic of this study are to: to estimate total costs for the intervention and total medical costs in each groups to estimate total quality adjusted life years (QALYs) based upon EQ5D5L scores to calculate the point estimate of the incremental cost utility ratio and estimate the probability of decremental cost effectiveness for the beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional biopsy. In this study, we will include subjects with diabetes and DFU with a suspicion of DFO. DFO is a complication of a large amount of DFU and is a major trigger of lower limb amputations. As we will include participants before bacteriological confirmation of DFO through bone biopsy, we will use the clinical and radiological criteria for DFO according to IWGDF 2019 guidelines4. These criteria include having at least one of the following signs: A positive probe to bone test and abnormalities on plain X-ray suggestive for osteomyelitis Signs of osteomyelitis on CT-scan and/or MRI and/or white blood cell SPECT/CT and/or 18Fluor-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT- scan."

African Americans (AA) are less likely to receive quality end-of-life (EoL) care. For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. Instead, families are more likely to be labeled as difficult if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians' recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment, and healthcare institutional contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism. Our research group began to address this need with 'African American Community Speaks', a proof-of-concept prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illnesses. The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US. Thus, we propose to adapt our prototype program to urban-dwelling Southern and Northern older AA adults using our established platform of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in two geographically diverse regions: Birmingham, Alabama, and the Bronx, New York. To create the new training program called 'Caring for Older African Americans', our team of experts in CBPR, medical sociology, and clinical trials will work with local Community Advisory Boards to: 1. Conduct a comparative ethnographic study of urban dwelling AAs in the North and South to describe AA community values and preferences related to EoL care; 2. Adaptation of our prior community-developed training program by integrating community-developed storytelling videos for empathizing with experiences of racism in EoL care, guidelines for culturally concordant EoL care delivery, and adapting an existing implicit bias management program to goals of care communication; and 3. Conduct a cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize training times to 1 of 4 start dates using a stepped wedge design to accommodate the training of all clinicians and to mitigate the effect of secular trends. Patients' personal experience of racism will be measured using the discrimination subscale of the Group Based Mistrust Scale. The primary outcome will be patient/family's perception of therapeutic alliance using The Human Connection Scale. Secondary outcomes will be family-reported goal-concordant care, and clinicians' knowledge of cultural values, awareness of implicit bias, and confidence to change practice. This innovative effort will be the first training program that: 1. addresses culturally concordant care, systemic racism, and implicit bias management, the three key elements in enhancing the provision of equitable care; and 2. is designed and implemented in full partnership with two distinct AA communities in the South and the North of the US."

Head and neck cancers are the sixth most common cancer common worldwide causing more than 380,000 deaths each year. More than 90% of these cancers are carcinomas epidermoids arising from the mucosal surfaces of the cavity oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are classically correlated with risk factors linked to excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco and have a rather poor prognosis (mainly HPV negative patients). However, the incidence of Head and Neck cancers in patients without alcohol-smoking risk factor has continued to increase in recent years, in relation to more and more frequent HPV contamination. Evolution of oral sexual practices seems to be one of the explanations for the progression of these cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and oral cavity HPV positive. Some studies show a difference in the expression of certain genes within the two groups of tumors (HPV+ and HPV-) including some that confer sensitivity to certain chemotherapies (CCND1, TYMS) and others to radiotherapy (RBBP4). However, patients with HPV+ Head and Neck cancers are treated according to the same referential as HPV- Head and Neck cancers. There is therefore a real need for studies identifying predictive markers in order to be able to offer patients a more effective suitable and less invasive treatment. This is the context of this research project.

Colorectal cancer is a common digestive tract tumor in China. At present, laparoscopic surgery has become the classic operation of colorectal cancer surgery compared with the traditional open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) refer to the clinical abnormal changes in the lungs after surgery, These include lung infections (pneumonia), atelectasis, pleural effusion, bronchospasm, acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%. The reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications. Numerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for more than 40 years to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of the positive physiological effects of prone positioning on transpulmonary pressure, lung compression and ventilation perfusion ratio, it has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. Currently, the mechanisms of prone position training are decreased lung compression in the gravity dependant zone,homogenisation of transpulmonary pressure, improvement of ventilation/perfusion ratio, and reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) or patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). By placing the patient in the prone position, the lungs compression due to its own weight is reduced via a gravitational-dependent redistribution of fluids. In addition, the weight of the mediastinum is supported by the sternum, the stiffer part of the chest. At the same time, the diaphragm is displaced caudally, decreasing compression of the posterior-caudal lung parenchyma. Finally, in a triangular-shaped lung, more parenchyma is included in the dorsal half than in the ventral one resulting in a more aerated lung in prone positioning. So, the purpose of this study is to observe whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The protocol design is in accordance with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. All potentially eligible participants will be asked to give written informed consent before they are enrolled in this study. This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial guided by the standard of good clinical practice (GCP), and eligible participants are divided into two groups: group PPT and group C, and primary assess the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery."

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hard, and older and vulnerable persons are more likely to get very ill when infected, and have the highest morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required. Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments. The goal of geriatric rehabilitation has been defined as to assist [older people] to manage personal activities of daily living without the assistance of another person. If this is not possible, the goal is to minimize the need for external assistance through the use of adaptive techniques and equipment. Thereby focussing on the amelioration of dependency in activities of daily living. However, we are still in the dark about the amount of functional recovery of geriatric post-COVID-19 patients. We do know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious. Before being able to assure the best outcomes for older post-COVID geriatric rehabilitation patients, we first have to be informed about what the clinical characteristics are, what treatment is provided, and what outcomes geriatric post-COVID-19 patients have in geriatric rehabilitation. Therefore, members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the European Geriatric Medical Society (EuGMS) decided to conduct this multi-center observational cohort study into usual care data on the course of functional and clinical outcomes in post-COVID-19 geriatric rehabilitation patients in several European countries."

The immunogenicity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens is diminished in kidney transplant recipients. This patient group therefore remains extremely vulnerable for viral infections despite vaccination. This impaired immune response is related to the use of immunosuppressive agents, especially Mycophenolate Mofetil/Mycophenolic Acid (MMF/MPA). Patients that use everolimus instead of MMF/MPA elicit a higher immune response after vaccination.
Objective Primary objective: To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain. Secondary objectives: To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior humoral immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by SARS-CoV-2 specific anti-S1 antibody levels herpes zoster vaccination as measured by varicella zoster specific anti-gE antibody levels To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior cellular immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cell response herpes zoster vaccination as measured by varicella zoster specific T-cell response To evaluate safety of replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in terms of incidence of treated acute rejection, kidney function decline, incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) incidence of adverse events of special interest (AESI) of immunosuppression incidence of solicited adverse events (AEs) of COVID-19 vaccination incidence of solicited AEs of herpes zoster vaccination This is a multicentre, open-label, controlled, randomized study to evaluate replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in KTR on immunogenicity and safety after vaccination. The seven participating study sites are Amsterdam UMC, Erasmus MC, Leiden UMC, Maastricht UMC+, Radboudumc, UMC Groningen and UMC Utrecht. At the first study visit, eligibility for study participation will be checked, blood will be drawn, and participants will subsequently be 1:1 randomised to: Continue immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA Replace immunosuppressive therapy with MMF/MPA by everolimus After randomisation, the study will continue in 2 parts: Part 1 - Run-in and COVID-19 vaccination (≥6 weeks + 28 days) The aim of this phase is to first ensure complete washout of MMF/MPA and attaining optimal trough levels of everolimus in patients randomized to everolimus. To monitor tolerability, safety and trough levels, participants will be invited at week 1 and week 3 after randomisation for a blood withdrawal and spot urine collection. At least 6 weeks after randomisation, patients will receive the COVID-19 vaccination (=baseline visit). After 28 days patients will be invited for a study visit for blood withdrawal. Part 2 (optional) - Herpes zoster vaccination (+56 days) Patients that opted to participate in this part of the study will continue their randomised treatment for the next 56 days. During this period patients will receive 2 herpes zoster vaccinations with an interval of 28 days between each vaccination. At 28 days after the second vaccination patients will be invited for the last study visit for blood withdrawal. After completion of the study (either 28 days after COVID-19 vaccination or 28 days after the last herpes zoster vaccination) patients will be offered the option to continue everolimus instead of MMF/MPA as part of shared clinical decision making."

Group A (Study group): This group includes 30 burned patients who will receive resistance exercises 8 weeks (3times/week) by using dumbbells and sand bags in addition to their physical therapy program (splinting, stretching ex.) and medical treatment. 1. Group B (Control group): This group includes 30 burned patients who will receive their physical therapy program (splinting, stretching ex., strengthening ex. and ROM ex.) and medical treatment. The program will consist of seven exercises: triceps press, biceps curl, lat pull down, calf raise, leg press, leg extension and sit-ups using dumbbells and sand bags. Each session will last approximately 45 minutes and consist of a 5-minute warm-up with stretching following by resistance exercise that will be done as a cir¬cuit, ending with 5-minute cool down. The 1 repetition maximum (1RM) is measured at baseline and follow¬ing the intervention. Initially, participants will do two circuits using 50% of their 1RM and repeat them 10 times for the first and second weeks, progressing to two circuits, using 60% of their 1RM and repeat 10 times for the third and fourth weeks. In fifth and sixth weeks, participants will do three circuits using 60% of their 1RM and repeat 10 times. In the last two weeks, patients will do three circuits using 70% of their 1RM and repeat 10 times. A 90-second rest will be allowed between sets of exercises. The plasma liver enzymes level (AST and ALT enzymes) will be measured at baseline and two months after the intervention."

Cervical spondylosis is a common condition that affects the neck and can cause pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. Upper fibers of trapezius stretching is a simple and cost-effective intervention that has been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving range of motion in patients with neck pain. However, its effectiveness in patients with cervical spondylosis is not known. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of upper fibers of trapezius stretching in patients with cervical spondylosis.

In this study, 40 patients with cervical spondylosis will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will receive upper fibers of trapezius stretching in addition to standard care, while the control group will receive standard care only. The intervention group will perform upper fibers of trapezius stretching exercises under the guidance of a licensed physical therapist for 4 weeks. The control group will receive standard care, including heat treatment and strengthening exercises. Both groups will be assessed at baseline, after 4 weeks of intervention, and 3 months later. The primary outcome measures include changes in neck pain intensity, neck range of motion, and neck disability index.

This study will provide valuable information on the effectiveness of upper fibers of trapezius stretching in patients with cervical spondylosis. If the intervention is found to be effective, it can be easily implemented in clinical practice to improve the quality of life of patients with cervical spondylosis."

The purpose of this study is to determine if a referral for Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is more effective than standard of care for patients with mild to moderate dementia.
CST is a group-based, non-pharmacological intervention that has been shown to improve cognitive function in patients with mild to moderate dementia. CST is a 14-session program that is delivered in a group setting. The program is designed to improve cognitive function, social engagement, and quality of life.
The investigators will conduct a two-arm pragmatic trial to determine if a referral for CST is more effective than standard of care for patients with mild to moderate dementia. The investigators will compare the outcomes of patients who receive a referral for CST to the outcomes of patients who receive standard of care.
The investigators will recruit 100 patients with mild to moderate dementia from the Health Care System (HCS) of the University of Colorado. The investigators will randomly assign patients to either the CST group or the standard of care group.
The investigators will assess the outcomes of patients in both groups at baseline and at 6 months. The investigators will compare the outcomes of patients in the CST group to the outcomes of patients in the standard of care group.
The investigators will assess the following outcomes:
1. Cognitive decline measured by an increase in Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score from baseline to follow-up.
2. Cognitive improvement measured by a decrease in Montreal Cognitive Assessment Score from baseline to follow-up.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20% percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5% in Asia. GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett´s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). In the diagnosis of the reflux disease the DeMeester score is used as a measure of esophageal acid exposure time. Important differential diagnosis are benign functional disorders of the esophagus such as is functional heartburn or functional dysphagia. Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. The results are inconsistent: In younger patients (18 - 40 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) the prevalence of anxiety and depression is higher than in those without GERD. There is an independent association between GERD, anxiety and current depression. Patients with anxiety are more likely to experience GERD symptoms and these symptoms seem to be more severe in anxious patients. Anxiety and depression intensify symptom perception. Patients with GERD have a higher incidence of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances than those without GERD, and there is an association between psychosocial disorders and an increased risk of anxiety. Thus, there is a an interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders, which has been discussed as the psychoemotional effects of GERD. GERD is considered to be an independent source of stress. A long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett´s esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure to stomach acid, change into a different type of cell normally found in the intestinal tract, rates of anxiety and depression have been reported to be three to five times higher than in the general population. Anxiety and depression as well as adverse events in life are also independent risk factors for NERD. Patients with NERD show an increased risk for anxiety compared with patients with ERD. The reporting of somatic symptoms is multifactorial and influenced by psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status, sex and mental distress. A high somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The increased sensation to visceral stimuli in which anxiety and depression play an important role has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity. Several studies of patients with reflux symptoms have used the Hopsital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) score as a measure of anxiety and depression and have reported higher anxiety scores than depression scores for this cohort. The aim of this study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores. Furthermore, the modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia is examined. 2. Methods Statement of ethics The present study was conducted according to Declaration of Helsinki principles and was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty of the University of Cologne.

The investigators conducted a prospective observational study at nine children's hospitals that are members of the Western Pediatric Surgery Research Consortium. IRB approval was obtained from each site with waiver of consent for enrollment. Enrollment took place between 2020-2022. Inclusion criteria were children 1-20 years diagnosed with an ASBO by an attending pediatric surgeon and underwent a trial of nonoperative management (NOM) on hospital admission. The use of an enteral contrast protocol was at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Exclusion criteria included peritonitis, suspicion of incarcerated or internal hernia, active intra-abdominal malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, <4 weeks since the most recent abdominal operation, pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, or known contrast allergy. If the attending surgeon made the decision to take a child directly to the operating room (OR) with no attempt at NOM, these children were excluded. Children under one year of age were excluded as the rate of successful NOM is lower in this age group. Site details and Contrast Protocols At the start of the study, four of the nine sites had a contrast protocol in place for ASBO diagnosis and management. During the course of the study, contrast protocols were developed and implemented at each of the five additional sites. At study initiation, three sites used contrast routinely, one used it selectively and 5 did not use contrast. At study conclusion, five sites used contrast routinely and four used it selectively. Contrast agent, volume of contrast, and contrast dilution were not standardized across sites due to the differences in hospital specific formularies; otherwise, the protocol was standardized across sites. Diatrizoate meglumine (osmolality of 1940 mOsm/kg) was used preferentially at eight sites and Ioversol (702 mOms/kg) at one site. Patients received 30-200ml (based on age or weight depending on site) of enteral contrast followed by X-rays at 8-12 hours and 24 hours after contrast administration. Patients were included in the contrast arm if enteral contrast, administered as part of an abdominal CT scan, was followed with subsequent x-rays to assess for progression of contrast to the colon. Failure (complete bowel obstruction) was defined as failure of contrast having not reached the colon by 24 hours after oral administration at which point operative intervention was recommended. The decision to operate was at the discretion of the attending surgeon. Sample Size Calculation The study was powered to detect a 15% difference in operative rate between the contrast and no contrast groups based on the adult literature. To detect this difference with 80% power, the investigators aimed to enroll 314 patients. Data Collection and Outcomes Study data were collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software tool hosted at the University of Colorado. REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies. The surgical inpatient census was monitored daily by study personnel at each site for patients with ASBO. Once identified, data were collected based on a review of the electronic medical record at each site 30 days following hospital discharge. Data collected included patient demographics, medical and surgical history, clinical presentation, laboratory studies, and imaging, management approach including type, volume, dilution of any contrast agent used. Complications specific to the contrast administration including allergic reaction, aspiration of contrast, cardiac arrhythmia, and renal failure were recorded. Details of the hospital course including length of stay, need for operation, indications for operation, and subsequent postoperative course and complications were also included. Statistical Analysis Descriptive statistics were summarized for continuous variables with medians and interquartile ranges, and for categorical variables with frequencies and percentages. Group differences were tested via t-test or Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables and Chi-Squared test or Fisher's Exact test for categorical variables. Comparisons were made between those who received contrast and those who did not. Logistic regression was used to assess the association between contrast and need for operation adjusting for age, body mass index for age z-score (or weight for height z-score for patients under 24 months of age per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention standards), volume of contrast administered, and number of previous laparotomies (< 3 v. ≥3).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative impact of availability and use of different e-liquid flavors on changes in cigarette consumption among current U.S. adult smokers. The study will be conducted in a multi-site, open-label, randomized, three-arm, 8-week, prospective observational study to be conducted at multiple sites geographically dispersed within the U.S. Adult tobacco consumers 21 to 60 years of age (inclusive) who smoked on at least 20 of the past 30 days and smoked at least 5 CPD on the days they smoked will be provided the Study IP for ad libitum use over a 6-week Actual Use Period (AUP) in their real-life/naturalistic environments. Subject-reported consumption of the Study IP, Combustible cigarettes, and other TNPs will be assessed (including, but not limited to, ENDS, smokeless tobacco, and other combustible tobacco products). The study includes pre-screening, a screening and enrollment visit (SEV), a baseline assessment period (BAP), an observational actual use period (AUP), and a close out period (COP). Following the recruitment period, the study duration per enrolled subject will be approximately eight (8) weeks. Following the administration of a Baseline Assessment Questionnaire (BAQ) at the SEV, use of Combustible Cigarettes and other TNP will be self-reported using an eDiary during the 1-week BAP. At SEV, subjects will be asked to indicate their likelihood to use each Study IP flavor variant across the three study arms. Subjects who indicate an interest in using at least one of the two flavors per arm for all three arms will be enrolled into the study and randomized into one of the three arms prior to completion of BAQ. The Study IP evaluated in this study will include the Power Unit and 12 cartridge variants (six flavor variants in two nicotine concentrations, 1.5% and 5%). In each arm, four variants (two flavor variants in two nicotine concentrations) will be available for choice. Subjects will be first dispensed the power unit and preferred Study IP variants (i.e., specific flavor and nicotine concentrations) available within their assigned study arm during SV1 and a handout MM will be given to the subjects to take home at SV1. Starting at SV1, enrolled subjects will be able to select Study IP for use during the AUP from the Study IP available in their assigned study arm. Subjects will be instructed not to use ENDS other than the Study IP provided by the study site for the duration of the AUP in the ICF. However, if subjects report other ENDS use in the eDiary, this will not lead to study discontinuation. Subjects can use the Study IP and other TNP including Combustible Cigarettes ad libitum during the AUP and will self-report product use on a daily basis via an eDiary over the 6-week AUP. Throughout the AUP, a toll-free Hotline will be available for subjects to report potential product-related adverse health experiences, pregnancy, and/or product quality complaints. Subjects will return to the study site three additional times (SV2, SV3, and SV4) for an interview to review eDiary compliance, complete additional questionnaires, return unused Study IP, and receive additional Study IP (SV2 and SV3, as needed). At SV4, subjects will complete an End of Study Questionnaire (ESQ). The COP will allow for reporting study queries to the sites, along with possible adverse health experiences to the toll-free Hotline after SV4. Subjects will be presented with hard-copy marketing material (MM) at the SEV for all Study IP variants in all three study arms. Consistent with typical consumer marketing practices, representative point of sale (POS) MM will be present during subject interactions at the SEV and SVs (e.g., product poster). At SV1-SV4, enrolled subjects will only be exposed to MM relating to the Study IP variants for the respective study arm they are randomized into."

Bronchiectasis are defined as irreversible dilatation of the bronchial tree. Patients with bronchiectasis suffer of chronic cough and sputum production, and are predisposed to recurrent airway infections. Many systemic diseases can cause bronchiectasis: cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiencies (PID) and idiopathic bronchiectasis (IB) represent a significant proportion of patients with bronchiectasis starting in early age. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. The improvement in FEV1 after inhalation of bronchodilators can be attributed to bronchodilation or improved mucociliary clearance. It can be speculated that for some of the bronchiectasis patients, hyper-reactive airways or asthma can contribute to the reversible pattern. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to ATS/ERS statement, the proper way to determine BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most resent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered a positive BDR. While in most scenarios it is reasonable to assume that the change in FEV1 measured after the waiting time can be attributed solely to the affect of bronchodilators, this is not necessarily the case in bronchiectasis. Theoretically, in bronchiectasis, the forced expiration maneuver used in spirometry testing can potentially cause changes in lung function, for example by inducing cough and mobilization of sputum. Evidence for this assumption can be seen in that respiratory therapy in terms if positive expiratory pressure (PEP) therapy can improve various parameters of lung function when tested again closely after the therapy. The goal of this study is to determine if bronchodilator response in bronchiectasis might be influenced by other factors apart from the direct effect of bronchodilators. Secondary objectives are to assess if BDR is associated with age, gender, specific bronchiectatic disease, baseline FEV1, and other clinical factors such as sputum cultures, IgE levels, eosinophil levels, computed tomography (CT) score, family history of asthma and use of inhaled steroids."

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of gender identity, genetic sex and hormone status on pain sensitivity. The investigators will be recruiting 100 participants from the transgender and cisgender communities. The investigators will be using a number of questionnaires to assess various aspects related to quality of life, experiences of stigma, depression and social support. The investigators will also be measuring the participants' body weight and height, blood pressure, and blood samples. The investigators will be using a number of pain tests to assess pain sensitivity. The investigators will be using a handheld probe that has a small rubber tip to apply pressure. As soon as pain is reported, the pressure will be removed. Next, the hand will be immersed into cold water. After 20 seconds, the pressure stimulator will again be applied.

The Scottish Stroke Improvement Programme identifies stroke as the most common cause of severe physical disability amongst Scottish adults. Hospital care for these patients accounts for 7% of all NHS beds and 5% of the entire NHS budget. Furthermore, the number of strokes across the UK is projected to increase by 60% between 2015 and 2035. Rehabilitation delivered by a multi-disciplinary team including Allied Health Professionals (occupational therapists [OT's], physiotherapists [PT's], and speech and language therapists [SLT's]) is known to improve functional recovery after stroke, particularly if it can be applied intensively and within enriched, stimulating environments. It is widely accepted that greater intensity, or dose, of rehabilitation improves outcomes and leads to greater and faster improvement of activities after stroke. However, a large gap exists between the minimum recommendations for stroke rehabilitation (three hours of multidisciplinary therapy a day, at least 5 days out of 7) and what the NHS are currently able to provide, given the majority of in-patient stroke units are operating below the staffing levels recommended in national clinical guidelines, and are therefore challenged to provide the amount of therapy to facilitate optimum recovery for stroke patients. An analysis of data from the UK Sentinel Stroke National Audit Programme found, on average, patients who required specific therapy following stroke received around 14 minutes of PT, 13 minutes of OT, and 7 minutes of SLT per day of inpatient stay. Therefore, new and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of rehabilitation intensity. Commercially available technology, such as robotics, adapted treadmills, virtual reality, and mobile digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors, have been shown to be a safe and feasible method of increasing rehabilitation intensity, under the prescription and supervision of therapy staff. It can be used to enhance usual therapy and can allow stroke patients to work on physical, cognitive, visual, and communication goals, without one-to-one or 'hands on' treatment from a therapist. Despite the potential offered by rehabilitation technology to help deliver evidence-based levels of practice intensity and automated feedback without additional labour costs, currently few technologies have been adopted into everyday rehabilitation. A well-established research group at the University of Strathclyde (UoS) Biomedical Engineering department have been developing and testing a technology-based, holistic model as a possible solution to the gap between clinical need and current provision. The technology enriched rehabilitation model has been tested under controlled conditions with chronic stroke survivors (at least one year post stroke) and shown to be feasible. While this model presents a potential method of scaling up rehabilitation delivery, and has been successfully deployed and tested for feasibility with chronic stroke, it not yet been evaluated for acute and sub-acute stroke patients or tested for clinical acceptability. This specific population has greater potential for recovery as the brain is more receptive to recovery through structural changes to neural pathways (neuroplasticity), therefore delivering higher intensity rehabilitation is therefore more critical at this phase of rehabilitation. Recently, an NHSL occupational therapy advanced practitioner has been seconded into a research post within the UoS Biomedical Engineering department. This has created greater opportunity for collaboration between the research team at UoS and NHS Lanarkshire, to test this technology delivered rehabilitation model within an acute stroke unit where the impact of enhanced rehabilitation is likely to be greater. The Director of Hospital Services at University Hospital Wishaw (UHW) has expressed support for a technology enriched stroke rehabilitation model to be tested within the stroke unit on site and has provided a large room within the ward that can be made available for equipment (loaned from the University of Strathclyde and UK manufacturer Innerva) to be housed and used by patients under supervision from NHS staff. Funding has been secured for research assistant time from the UoS in order to support the introduction of the technology and to complete data collection. Participants will be supported to use the rehabilitation technology by trained NHS staff. This is a mixed methods feasibility study in line with Medical Research Council recommendations for development of a complex intervention.The methodology of the study is as follows; Inpatients on the stroke unit, with a diagnosis of stroke, at University Hospital Wishaw, Scotland, will be assessed for eligibility by the NHS multidisciplinary team using the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

The evolution of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is marked by dyspnea, anxiety and pain, major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort (scale A1 of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire) of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated with NIV. This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study. ALS patients will be recruited during their respiratory evaluation carried out as part of their usual care provided in an ambulatory setting (day care hospital) in the Pneumology Department of Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital.

The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility testing on the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing in women with E. coli urinary tract infections (UTIs) treated by general practitioners (GPs).
The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial in 100 GPs in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire regions. The intervention will be the dissemination of a selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility testing, with a focus on narrower-spectrum antibiotics. The control arm will receive a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing report. The primary endpoint will be the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing, defined as the number of urine cultures associated with a prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin) prescribed by GPs in the same practice over a period from 3 days before to 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing, relative to the total number of urine cultures. This period of interest corresponds to the period of empirical antibiotic therapy (=within 3 days before report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), and the period of directed antibiotic therapy (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing). A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be carried out by varying the time window for broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing around the date of the antibiotic susceptibility testing result, up to a maximum of 7 days before and 14 days after. Secondary endpoints will include the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), the rate of antibiotic de-escalation, the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, as a continuous variable (dose-effect) and ordinal variable (threshold-effect), the GP characteristics (demographics, practice patterns, number of encounters/year, and number of patients declared), the patient characteristics (age, diabetes, pregnancy, nursing home), and the E. coli antimicrobial susceptibility profiles."

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells. Patients with acute ischemic stroke included in the study will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline were given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The investigators evaluate whether sodium valproate can improve clinical outcomes and increase peripheral CD177+ neutrophil levels."

The purpose of this study is to determine if a virtual coach can be used to aid in preoperative weight loss in patients with ventral hernia and obesity. The investigators hypothesize that the use of a virtual coach will result in a greater amount of weight loss compared to standard preoperative weight loss tools.

The study will be conducted as a prospective, non-randomized, parallel assignment study. The study will be conducted at the University of Maryland Medical Center.

Participants will be recruited from the general surgery clinic and the bariatric surgery clinic. Participants will be screened for eligibility and will be asked to sign an informed consent form.

Participants will be randomized to one of two groups. The first group will utilize the MyChart enabled virtual coach to aid preoperative weight loss. The second group will not utilize the MyChart enabled virtual coach to aid preoperative weight loss, but instead use standard weight loss tools.

The primary outcome measure will be the average net amount of weight change per group. Secondary outcome measures will include the number of interactions with the virtual coach, the degree of quality of life, and the degree of satisfaction with the virtual coach.

The investigators believe that the use of a virtual coach will result in a greater amount of weight loss compared to standard preoperative weight loss tools."

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis, and the development of effective treatments is urgently needed. Mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes have been shown to have comprehensive and powerful immunomodulatory and regenerative functions, and they can combat cell death associated with the pathogenesis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, ARDS, and pulmonary hypertension, and promote cell regeneration. Exosomes are one of the key paracrine effectors secreted by MSCs and are considered attractive candidates for alternative MSC therapy due to their biocompatibility similar to parent cells and their ability to maintain healing properties. Under physiological and pathological conditions, exosomes play a key role in intercellular communication by transporting various biomolecules such as miRNA and proteins to target cells. Unlike apoptotic bodies and microvesicles derived from the cell surface, exosomes are produced through the endocytic pathway and load cytoplasmic content of the parent cell. Therefore, they are mini versions of parent cells, mimicking some of their physiological characteristics. Compared to cell counterparts, the non-toxicity, low immunogenicity, high stability, ease of storage, and potential for mass production as ready-made products are several advantages of exosomes, which have led to their expansion in clinical applications as new therapeutic alternatives. In addition, the natural function of exosomes allows them to deliver their membrane and cytoplasmic bioactive components from parent cells to target cells through membrane fusion. Furthermore, biocompatibility is another characteristic. Due to their origin from biological sources and inherent targeting ability, exosomes have been used as carriers of drug components in preclinical studies. In this study, we propose to use umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes to treat moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 patients. The study aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of moderate, severe, and critically ill COVID-19 patients through a multicenter, randomized controlled, single-blind clinical trial."

Dyspnoea is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department (ED). Dyspnoea requires timely evaluation and treatment as several conditions causing dyspnea are time critical. Previous studies have suggested that point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) increase diagnostic accuracy in the initial assessment of patients with dyspnoea. However, in most studies POCUS was done by highly experienced physicians which could limit the generalisability of POCUS in the hands of all emergency specialist and residents. Aim To evaluate whether POCUS performed by a variety of emergency medicine physicians (specialists and residents) increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with dyspnea compared to routine assessment. Method: Specialist and residents in Emergency Medicine at the ED in Lund and Helsingborg (Sweden) will have a short training and certification in a structured dyspnea POCUS protocol. The protocol includes focused lung (8 or 14 zones), heart (subcostal, parasternal and apical four chamber views) and inferior vena cava ultrasound. Study design Prospective observational study Study population Inclusion criteria Adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department within the highest or second highest triage category (Rapid Emergency Triage and Treatment System) and any of the following: Presenting with shortness of breath Oxygen saturation less than 90 % on room air Respiratory rate more than 25 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation less than 95 % on room air Exclusion criteria Inclusion in the study will delay urgent interventions Patient is discharge from the ED (without hospital admission) Patients will be included when a physician certified in the dyspnea POUCUS protocol is present in the ED (convenience sample) Firstly, an ED physician will assess the patient using available routine diagnostic procedures. After consent to the study, the physician will document the estimated likelihood (not likely, unlikely, likely, very likely) of the following diagnosis: heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbation of asthma, pleural or pericardial fluid. Clinical bedside tests will be available as in routine practice in the ED (e.g., ecg, blood gas results). A physician certified in the dyspnea protocol will then perform POCUS and deliver the findings to the initial physician assessing the patients. Hereafter, the initial physician documents the estimated likelihood of the above diagnosis being provided the ultrasound findings. The estimated likelihoods (before and after POCUS) will be dichotomised and compared to the discharge diagnosis. Sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive values of the diagnostic accuracy before and after adding POCUS will be calculated. In addition to routine bed-side tests alle included patients will have the following ordered: chest imaging (x-ray or CT according to ED physicians' choice), N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (pro-BNP), C-reactive protein and white blood count."

Postoperative radiotherapy is widely practiced and highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer, the most common cancer in women. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial randomizing R&R vs. standard-of-care management in patients with radiotherapy in DIBH for left breast cancer. The investigators primary endpoint will assess heart dose (Dmax), and secondary endpoints include longitudinal anxiety and quality of life assessment and clinic workflow efficiency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a validated patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced-technology-based cardiac dose reduction, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors."

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of intra-myometrial oxytocin injection and intra-myometrial tranexamic acid injection in reducing the risk of postpartum bleeding after cesarean delivery in primigravida at term. The study will be conducted in the kasr Al-Ainy hospital, Maternity hospital, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt, during October 2021 to October 2022. After The Ethical Research Committee approval on study protocol, fifty primigravida women at term pregnancy, undergoing elective cesarean delivery will be divided and allocated randomly into two groups after fulfillment eligibility criteria. Fifty women will be included in this clinical study at admission to the labor ward. Written informed permission will be acquired following advising about this study and potential implications. A history in details and clinical examination for all patients to rule out general health problems. Vaginal and Abdominal examinations will be done. Routine preoperative investigations and obstetric ultrasound examinations will be done for all women to ensure that all inclusion criteria were present. The computer will be used for randomization to allocate the patients into two equal groups. Randomization cards will be produced, sealed and stored; sequentially black wrappers will be numbered. The hospital pharmacy is producing packages, and physicians and nurses were unaware of their contents. For the entire length of the trial, all study personnel and participants are blinded to therapy. A senior registrar will execute a cesarean section before the commencement of research, which performs at least 300 cesarean sections. All cesarean section will be operated via spinal anesthesia; the abdomen will be entered through the Pfannenstiel incision. The sealed envelope is carried to the operating room and transferred without informing the researcher or the patients about their contents. The anesthesiologist is administering the medication (Oxytocin or tranexamic acid). After fetal birth and before placental delivery, patients assigned to the oxytocin group (n = 25): 5 I.U of oxytocin (syntocinone 5 I.U/1ML NONARTIS-EGYPT) shall be watered down in 10 cc of saline, and 5 cc shall be injected into each uterine corn before the placental separation. In TXA group (n=25): 1 g from tranexamic acid (kapron®, Amoun, Egypt) shall also be watered down in 10 cc of Saline, and 5 cc shall be injected in each uterine corn before the placenta is separated. The primary outcome is to decrease Intra and postoperative blood loss to reduce PPH risk after CS. After a skin incision, the estimated blood loss would begin. The towels are weighted in (mg) with their covers, using an exact digital balance, before and following the operation, and the weight variation is measured between dryish and saturated towels. Blood loss is counted as follows during the operation: volume contents in the suction container in (ml) (X), the towel weight variation in (gm) (Y) (weight of saturated towels in (gm) - weight of dry towel in (gm)), the amniotic liquid amount in (ml) (Z). Operational blood loss in (ml) = (X+Y) - Z (18). All women are calculated according to the underlying law for permissible blood loss. Allowable blood loss = The estimated volume of blood x (initial hematocrit - final lowest acceptable hematocrit)/ initial hematocrit, an estimated volume of blood = weight of the patient in (kg) multiplies by average volume of blood (75-85 ml/kg) (19)."

The ReceptIVFity test is a new test that can predict the chance of achieving a pregnancy in the current IVF or IVF/ICSI cycle based on the vaginal microbiome profile. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the ReceptIVFity test can improve the chance of achieving a pregnancy in women undergoing IVF or IVF/ICSI.
In this study, women undergoing IVF or IVF/ICSI will be randomized to either the Shared-Decision-Making group or the Physician decision group. Women in the Shared-Decision-Making group will receive the ReceptIVFity test and will be informed about the predicted chance of achieving a pregnancy in the current cycle. Women in the Physician decision group will receive the ReceptIVFity test, but the results will be withheld from the patient and the physician will decide whether to proceed with the current cycle or to postpone treatment until a switch to a favorable ReceptIVFity microbiome profile.
The primary outcome of this study is the rate of successful pregnancy. Secondary outcomes include the number of successful IVF or IVF/ICSI cycles per patient, the total number of IVF or IVF/ICSI treatment cycles per patient, patient satisfaction, and the total costs of all received treatments within the study period.
This study will provide valuable information on the potential benefits of the ReceptIVFity test in improving the chance of achieving a pregnancy in women undergoing IVF or IVF/ICSI."

Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive option, as it is a spice throughout the world which possesses medicinal properties in regulating human nutrient metabolism. In a recent review of the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperlipidaemia in humans with diabetes and prediabetes, this analysis suggested that fenugreek has total cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The effects of fenugreek on triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol showed a trend towards reduction and an incremental trend for HDL-cholesterol but needed further confirmation. The effect of fenugreek in human subjects with hyperlipidaemia without diabetes has not been investigated. This research aims to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed consumed as a tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. Changes in plasma microRNAs will be analysed to establish non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidaemia. Participants without pre-existing CVD or diabetes aged 18-70 years old will be included if they have hyperlipidaemia (plasma triglyceride level between 1.7 - 4.5mmol/l) not on any lipid-lowering treatment or on a stable lipid-lowering treatment (last six months) but still have confirmation of high triglycerides within the range required for study. 114 participants will be randomized into two groups (57/group) to receive either fenugreek seeds or control tea, respectively. Treatment allocations will be placed into sealed envelopes and this will be opened at the baseline study visit with the participant. Fenugreek seeds will be delivered at a dose of 5g/day, drunk as a tea (2.5g/per tea bag), p.o. twice a day at a 12-hour interval) for 8 weeks (56 days). The tea bags will be brewed in a cup (200ml) of boiled hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. This will be self-administered by the subjects, twice a day at a 12-hour interval. The rationale for choosing the dose and intervention time course were based on the previous studies where metabolic effects have been detected. Literature reports from 12 human studies on diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects gave doses of fenugreek seed ranging from 1 to 100g/day, with the median treatment dose being 6.3g/day, to the participants; the intervention time course ranged from 1 week to 3 years, with the median treatment time being 60 days. The dose and duration in this study was therefore designed as being similar to these studies where metabolic effects have been detected, and also, where participant burden will not be too onerous, at a dose of 5g/day, twice a day at a 12-hour interval for 8 weeks (56 days). For the control group, a control black tea (2.5g/bag), self-administered by the subjects, twice in a day at a 12-hour interval. Black tea is a type of fermented tea that has been found to possess much less cardioprotective and lipid profile improving effect compared to green tea due to the different manufacture process. Consumption of black tea has been found not associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease in the United Kingdom. Recruitment will be via outpatient hyperlipidaemia clinics, primary care and advertisements. Study visits will take place at the Centre for Public Health at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks and will involve the collection of demographic information, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and fasting blood samples."

Exclusion criteria: BMI greater than 35 kg/m2, steatohepatitis, chronic kidney disease, systemic vasculitis, conditions that induce systemic inflammation such as psoriasis and systemic lupus erythematosus, contraindications to the use of pioglitazone hydrochloride (heart failure, liver failure - AST or ALT > 2.5x upper normal limit, history of bladder cancer or macroscopic hematuria without investigation), moderate or severe valve disease, need for concomitant use of other hypoglycemic therapies during hospitalization, peripheral edema, recent hospitalization, known allergy to any study drug, polyuria, polydipsia, weight loss, or other clinical signs of volume depletion or diabetes, difficult-to-control systemic arterial hypertension, defined as individuals taking 4 or more drugs, those who withdraw the Informed Consent Form (TCLE), or who, for some reason, are not able to sign or understand the TCLE, history of gastrointestinal disorders that may interfere with study drug absorption, research participant who is participating in other clinical trials or whose participation ended less than six months ago, research participant who has left ventricular dysfunction.
The study will be a prospective, randomized and open clinical study. From a sample of patients hospitalized for myocardial revascularization surgery, followed at the cardiac surgery outpatient clinic, 20 research participants, male, aged over 40 years, non-diabetic or if diabetic, disease duration < 10 years, glycated hemoglobin <8% and non-user of NPH insulin, body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 34.9kg/m2 and glomerular filtration rate above 45mL/min who will be monitored at the Hospital de Clínicas/UNICAMP and randomized to receive pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for 5 days before surgery. The amount of S1P in HDL at baseline (before surgery) will be assessed. This same measurement will be repeated on day 5 (coinciding with the day of surgery) after using pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day. In addition, on the day of surgery, a saphenous vein fragment of approximately 2 cm and an internal thoracic artery fragment of approximately 1 cm will be collected, which will not impair the quality of the graft nor the extent of the material to be used as a graft, because in this case the vascular material is abundant. An aortic artery button and an atrial appendage button will also be collected, which will be discarded. In addition, the results of serum troponin levels in the first 24h post-SVR (6, 12, 24h) will be evaluated to estimate the extent of troponin release. Postoperative examination."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes with bilateral lung infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT imaging. 10% of all ICU admissions are ARDS patients, and the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus has dramatically increased the number of ARDS patients in ICUs across the world. The international epidemiological study (2016) reported a mortality rate of 35-46% for ARDS, and this is very high mortality compared to other ICU diseases. Furthermore, ARDS survivors present with many functional impairments, including physical, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunction (Post Intensive Care Syndrome, PICS), and their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of Life (QOL) are impaired and many other functional impairments have been pointed out. Their inability to get their original life has attracted significant research attention and become a significantly important research topic. Many patients who are unable to return to work due to functional disability require nursing care, and there is concern about the increased burden on the patient, the family supporting the patient, and the social economy. Therefore, the development of effective strategies for patients with ARDS that take into account not only mortality but also functional prognosis is strongly needed. Recent studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume and airway pressure control), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, noninvasive mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have improved outcomes, including mortality, in patients with ARDS. However, the mortality of patients with ARDS is still as high as 40%. In addition, the complete reintegration ratio of patients with ARDS after 1 year of hospital discharge reported in 2003 was only 50%, and recent reports have shown little progress in this aspect. Strategies to improve outcomes (mortality and functional prognosis) of ARDS patients by improving not only treatment but also the quality of ICU care have become a hot topic in recent years. The previous paper showed that excessive sedation and absolute bed rest for the purpose of ventilation control and rest during intubation in ARDS patients correlated with delirium, prolonged duration of ventilation, and even increased mortality. Therefore, attempts have been explored to improve outcomes for ARDS patients by systematically providing sedation, analgesia, rehabilitation, spontaneous breathing and awaking tests, and delirium management during ICU admission. These attempts, known as the ABCDEF bundle, have been actively recommended by a number of academic societies to be introduced in ICUs as an attempt to improve outcomes of patients with ARDS and promote their reintegration into society. (ABCDEF bundle: A (Assess, prevent, and manage pain), B (Both spontaneous awakening trials (SAT) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT)), C (Choice of analgesia and sedation), D (Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage), E (Early mobility and exercise), F (Family engagement and empowerment)), and even ICU care such as nutritional therapy and ICU diaries have been shown to improve outcomes for ICU patients, including ARDS, and are strongly recommended. (In this study, this ICU care is referred to as evidence-based ICU care.) On the other hand, our research team has reported that the overall implementation rate of these evidence-based ICU care, ABCDEF bundles, nutritional therapy, and ICU diaries in ICU patients is quite low, and the rate is significantly lower in mechanically ventilated patients. The reason for the low implementation rates is thought to be that the ventilator is a major barrier. Although many articles have proposed evidence-based ICU care, there is little evidence as to which of these should be prioritized and which should be combined to maximize patient outcomes. The reason for this may be that there is a lack of evidence on which of these should be prioritized and which should be combined to maximize patient outcomes. Implementation of evidence-based ICU care requires many resources and effort, and it is difficult to implement all of them simultaneously. Therefore, the purpose of this international multicenter study is to investigate the current epidemiology and treatment strategy given to the patients with ARDS after the two-year pandemic of the novel coronavirus, clarify the actual implementation of ICU care for ARDS patients who require ventilators at high frequency, and evaluate how the implementation of evidence-based ICU care is associated with patient outcomes.

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant health care system challenge. PCa is the most common male cancer in Finland and most western countries. Interestingly, although the incidence of indolent (latent) PCa is very similar throughout the globe, there is a remarkable global age-adjusted incidence variation (up to 40-fold difference between highest and lowest incidences). Epidemiological data suggest that aging in men is associated with neoplastic processes in the prostate but only a subset of men will develop a true malignancy potentially affecting their life-span or quality of life. Genetic factors have a significant effect on PCa risk, but very likely life-style (e.g. diet and physical activity) affect PCa risk as well, but the mechanisms mediating protective or harmful effects of life-style remain unclear. Gut microbiota, i.e. the collection of microbes colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, is acknowledged to play significant role in many metabolic pathways and pathogenic processes in the human body. Although there is some evidence suggesting that gut microbiota affects therapy responses (especially androgen deprivation) in PCa, it ́s potential role in prostate carcinogenesis is not well documented. Our previous studies suggest that gut microbiota composition is different in men with and without PCa and that changes in steroid hormone synthesis may be one mechanism how gut microbiota affects PCa risk.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of prostate medication (5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and LHRH antagonists) on gut microbiota composition and metabolic characteristics in men with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). The study will include 50 men with BPH and 50 men with PCa. The study will be conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the study will include men with BPH who will be treated with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride, or combination of dutasteride and tamsulosin). In the second phase, the study will include men with PCa who will be treated with LHRH antagonists (degarelix). The study will include a total of 100 men. The study samples (gut microbiota, metabolite sampling) will be collected prior the start of the prostate medication and after 2 months of medical therapy. In addition, after 6 months, PSA measurement is repeated."

This study is conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. Monotherapy of Hydroxyurea was sustained at a daily dosage ranging from 10-20 mg/kg for a duration of 6 months, during which the treatment response was documented. After this initial 6-month period, thalidomide was introduced into the treatment regimen. Thalidomide was administered orally at bedtime, with an initial dosage of 2-5 mg/kg. An incremental dosing approach was employed for thalidomide, with individuals who exhibited an insufficient response to lower doses having their dosage increased to a maximum of 5 mg/kg. Additionally, aspirin was prescribed at a daily dosage of 2-4 mg/kg to mitigate the risk of thrombosis. Blood transfusions were administered under specific conditions throughout the study. Transfusions were initiated if the Hb levels dropped below 7 g/dL or if patients exhibited symptoms or instability, regardless of their Hb levels. Patients who were undergoing iron chelation therapy (utilizing deferasirox, deferiprone, and/or deferoxamine) while on HU monotherapy continued this regimen throughout the combination therapy phase. Throughout combination therapy, various assessments were conducted and documented, including blood transfusion events and comprehensive blood count evaluations, carried out at baseline, as well as during the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year follow-up periods. Concurrently, safety parameters, such as urea and creatinine levels, liver function tests, and measurements of liver and spleen size, were consistently monitored and recorded. Outcome: Good responders were characterized as individuals who were previously reliant on blood transfusions while on hydroxyurea therapy but became transfusion-independent after the initiation of hydroxyurea and thalidomide combination therapy. Furthermore, patients who were already free from transfusions while on hydroxyurea therapy and demonstrated an increase in Hb levels exceeding 1 g/dL upon combination therapy were also classified as good responders. Responders were defined as patients who, while receiving blood transfusions during hydroxyurea therapy, exhibited a substantial reduction of at least 50% in the volume of PRC transfusions over a span of 6 months after the onset of combination therapy. Non-responders encompassed patients who were not reliant on transfusions during hydroxyurea therapy but did not display any significant enhancement in Hb levels following the commencement of combination therapy. Additionally, individuals who were dependent on transfusions but experienced less than a 50% reduction in PRC transfusion volume despite hydroxyurea and thalidomide combination therapy were also categorized as non-responders. Safety: The safety of the drug was evaluated based on the following parameters and the intervention was discontinued or put on hold if: Creatinine >1.1mg/dl, Urea >43mg/dl), Liver function (SGPT >35mg/L) Absolute Neutrophil counts<2*109/L Platelets < 100*109/L"

The objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults. Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.

African-American (AA) mothers have a higher risk for perinatal depression than Caucasian women that is attributable to increased socio-environmental stressors. In addition, AA women have poor healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment compared to Caucasian women. An intervention is required to supplement and support the clinical objectives of the mother's depression care without requiring the mother's direct involvement. Fathers are an underutilized resource to reduce the mother's environmental stress and encourage healthy maternal behaviors. The African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment- Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression (ASSET-PPD) protocol will target the fathers' support of the mothers' mental health treatment and their active engagement in the family to reduce maternal stress. The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal period and 2 postpartum review sessions. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers': 1) prenatal and postpartum family involvement; 2) mental health psychoeducation; 3) interparental communication and relationship skills; and 4) balanced division of family tasks. ASSET-PPD will be evaluated in a pilot RCT with 50 cohabitating or non-cohabitating fathers and AA mothers who will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD intervention or the comparator group. Fathers only will participate in the intervention, and mothers and fathers will complete measures of mental health and parental experiences. Maternal depressive symptoms will be assessed as a primary outcome, and breastfeeding and parent-infant interactions will be assessed as secondary outcomes."

The purpose of this study is to test new algorithms for detecting pump/infusion set malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery. The study consists of three phases: Phase 1: Preliminary Data Collection (Free-living Data) In this phase, data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions are collected. This data is obtained from a download form the patient's artificial pancreas. The one-month session is designed to gather a substantial amount of patient-specific data to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals impact the patient's glycemia as recorded by the CGM sensor. During this phase, the patient continues to use their artificial pancreas in their daily life. Phase 2: Induction of Hyperglycemia The second phase involves the patient visiting the clinic, where, according to a specific protocol and a defined schedule, insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump malfunction. The resulting episode of hyperglycemia is closely monitored under medical supervision. At the end of the experiment, the study team assists the patient in restoring euglycemia before returning home. Phase 3: Retrospective Data Analysis In this phase, the collected data is retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detecting insulin suspension, simulating a pump malfunction. The sensitivity of the tested methods is assessed as the fraction of insulin suspensions (simulating a malfunction) correctly detected. The uniqueness of this dataset lies in the controlled induction of malfunction, achieved by disconnecting the insulin pump and monitoring the resulting hyperglycemic episode. The presence of malfunctions in this data is certain and precisely characterized in terms of the start time and duration. The dataset resulting from this experimentation will be a valuable tool for the scientific community, enabling the retrospective testing of fault detection algorithms."

The primary objective of this retrospective study is to estimate vaccine effectiveness of Pfizer's ABRYSVO vaccine against RSV-related lower respiratory tract infection requiring hospitalization among Kaiser Permanente Southern California members who are eligible for vaccination per current recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). Analyses will employ a retrospective case-control study with test negative design (TND) and a retrospective cohort design. The TND will assess RSV-related outcomes, while the cohort design will assess all-cause outcomes. The cohort study may also assess RSV-related outcomes. Standard of care (SOC) RSV testing and re-testing of remnant SOC respiratory specimens for those who did not have SOC testing will be used to define RSV-related endpoints. For the cohort design, a sensitivity analysis including imputation of results for individuals experiencing lower respiratory tract infections without confirmation of RSV positivity or negativity may also be conducted. In the event that standard of care testing practices decline or there are not enough available specimens for estimating RSV-associated VE, the study may be extended to additional seasons. Secondary objectives of the TND, and if conducted for RSV-related endpoints, of the cohort study, include estimating vaccine effectiveness against: RSV-related lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations among high-risk groups, RSV-related acute respiratory tract infection hospitalizations, and Emergency Department (ED) visits. The retrospective cohort analysis will provide VE estimates against additional all-cause ARI and LRTI outcomes, as well as incidence rates and rate reductions for study outcomes, and will include outpatient outcomes. Analyses will include stratifications by presence of comorbidity, RSV subgroup, severity, age, frailty, and other selected demographic factors."

Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a safe and effective treatment for numerous conditions in neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and urology. In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the procerus was located at a depth of 3.8 ± 0.7 mm at the glabella and 2.7 ± 0.6 mm at the sellion while the intercanthal vein was located 3.0 ± 0.6 mm below the skin's surface superior to the sellion. Careful consideration of depth of injection and facial anatomy must be taken to avoid bruising and intravascular injection of BoTN. Additionally, in a cadaveric study looking at depth of corrugator supercilii of 32 Korean hemifaces using 3D scanning, Lee et al. found that the corrugator supercilii muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 +/-1.4 mm medially and 6.6 +/-1.4mm laterally and recommended BoTN injections at the depth of 4mm. However, no in vivo studies have been performed to validate this as the optimal depth of injection. In a split face study evaluating the depth of botulinum injection into the corrugator supercilii muscle no difference in brow height between injecting periosteally versus in superficial dermis. The investigators previously studied the ability of botulinum toxin to diffuse in crow's feet through laser pores into the target muscle. (8) In our randomized study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of BoTN for the treatment of glabellar lines when injected at a depth of 2mm (superficial dermis) versus 4mm (intramuscularly). The investigators hypothesize that no difference exists between the two depths as the 150kD botulinum toxin molecules can easily diffuse to the target at the muscle. If this is validated, patients can be treated with more superficial depths, which will result in less pain and bruising."

Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness characterised by periods of illness and recovery, which can cause significant psychosocial impairment and disability. It affects more than 1% of the world population regardless of demographic characteristics such as ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status and is one of the leading causes of global disability. Bipolar disorder can cause serious cognitive and functional impairments and maintaining life with this disorder involves some difficulties for the individual. Functional impairments such as deterioration in family relationships, problems in work life and incompatibilities in social relationships negatively affect both the well-being and quality of life of the individual. Many individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder have functional disorders that can cause low quality of life. Quality of life is recognised as an important outcome measure for the effectiveness of treatment of mental disorders. Compared to healthy individuals, the quality of life of patients with bipolar disorder is significantly impaired in both the euthymic and symptomatic periods. The ability to cope with difficulties is assumed to be a protective factor for quality of life. However, individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are exposed to more stressful events due to their illness and experience coping problems, including in the euthymic period. For these reasons, developing coping skills is among the targets in the treatment process of bipolar disorder. The stress coping strategies of these individuals may even affect the risk of suicide. Bipolar disorder is a serious illness that causes increased mortality, including death by suicide. Approximately 10-20% of these individuals end their lives and approximately one third of these individuals attempt suicide at least once. Patients with bipolar disorder and previous suicide attempts have a worse quality of life. One of the most important factors associated with suicide and morbidity in bipolar disorder is impulsivity. Impulsivity, which can be defined as a predisposition to unplanned reactions to internal and external stimuli regardless of negative consequences and the absence of behavioural inhibition, is one of the clinical features of bipolar disorder. Although it is more common during manic episode, it can also be found in other mood phases. Bipolar disorder is characterised by high impulsivity even during recovery periods. Increased impulsivity is not only associated with suicide attempts but may also lead to functional impairment. Impulsive behaviours may cause long-term negative consequences in bipolar disorder that may affect quality of life. In the literature, it has been revealed that high impulsivity is associated with poor quality of life. In the light of this information, this study aimed to determine the predictive effects of impulsivity and coping skills on quality of life in patients with bipolar disorder. METHOD Sample The descriptive study is planned to be conducted in Adıyaman Besni State Hospital between October 2023-February 2024. The population of the study will consist of individuals who applied to the Psychiatry Outpatient Clinic of Adıyaman Besni State Hospital on the dates of the study, who received outpatient treatment with the diagnosis of bipolar according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 and who were in the euthymic period according to the doctor's control. G* Power programme was used to calculate the sample size. The confidence interval α=0.05, the power of the test (1-β) 0.95, the effect size dz= 0.5 were calculated as a total of 54 people (presented in the appendix). The data will be collected by researcher Kubra Tohumcu through face-to-face interview technique. The patients constituting the sample of the study will be directed to the researcher by the outpatient clinic doctor. The data were planned to be collected by applying the Personal Information Form, Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale, Barratt Impulsivity Scale -11 Short Form and Coping Attitudes Evaluation Scale prepared by the researchers. Individual Information Form: This form, organised by the researchers, included 17 questions to determine the demographic information of the participants. Brief Quality of Life in Bipolar Disorder Scale: Developed in 2010 by Michalak and Murray, the Turkish validity and reliability study of the scale was conducted by Gümüş et al. It is a 5-point Likert-type scale (1=Strongly Disagree, 5=Strongly Agree) consisting of a total of 7 items. The total score range that can be obtained from the scale varies between 12-60.

The elbow being a highly constrained synovial hinge joint has a high propensity for degeneration and stiffness. There could be functional losses seen with even less severe loss of range of motion (ROM) at the elbow. The stiff or contracted elbow is defined as an elbow with a reduction in extension greater than 30 degrees, and/or a flexion less than 120 degrees. Although supination and pronation are often reduced as well, this will not be considered further as contracture of the elbow is not related to forearm rotation. The elbow is more prone to stiffness because Brachialis muscle lies directly over the anterior capsule, the anterior capsule tends to tear more frequently than posterior, all 3 elbow articulations exist in 1 capsule, the elbow is prone to development of Heterotrophic Ossification. Loss of terminal extension is less disabling than loss of the same degree of terminal flexion. It was a randomized, controlled trial, conducted among post-traumatic stiff elbow patients. Sample size was 32 by using G Power Calculator. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group after a baseline assessment with a lottery ticket and an opaque envelope. All participants in both groups were evaluated on two occasions: (i) baseline (ii) After 4 weeks of intervention."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The study will be conducted in two phases. In the first phase, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in a small number of patients. In the second phase, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy in a larger number of patients.
The combination therapy consists of nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs), anti-PD-1 antibody, and pegylated interferon (Peg-IFNα). NAs are commonly used to suppress HBV replication. Anti-PD-1 antibody is a new type of immunotherapy that can enhance the immune response against HBV. Peg-IFNα is a type of interferon that can stimulate the immune system to fight against HBV.
The investigators hypothesize that the combination therapy can achieve a higher rate of sustained HBsAg loss compared to NAs alone. Sustained HBsAg loss is defined as HBsAg loss for at least 6 months after the end of treatment. The investigators also hypothesize that the combination therapy can achieve a higher rate of sustained HBsAg loss compared to Peg-IFNα alone.

In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and other muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of manual performance. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) remain the method of choice in diagnosing CTS. However ultrasonography (US) is increasingly used along with or instead of NCS. Most frequently, the increase of the cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the inlet to the carpal tunnel is regarded as the marker of CTS. A number of other measurements such as median nerve mobility, volar bulging of flexor retinaculum and others were also studied to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In this study the investigators aim to assess the utility of measurements made at the point of the maximal stenosis of the median nerve in the tunnel to diagnose CTS. So far, there were only few studies, which visualized the maximal nerve stenosis, which is the essential pathological feature of CTS. In general, the group of patients with CTS and controls will undergo NCS of symptomatic median and ipsilateral ulnar nerves and US of the symptomatic median nerve with measurements of the cross-sectional area, diameter and echogenicity at various points, including the point of the maximal stenosis. The location of the maximal stenosis with respect to external (distal crease) and internal (wrist and hand bones and thenar musculature) will also be evaluated. Subjects will also be asked to fill out the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) and a demographic questionnaire. US measurements will be compared between patients and healthy volunteers. US measurements, especially those made at the point of stenosis will be correlated among patients with clinical severity of CTS, reflected by the score in BCTQ and with the grade of electrophysiological severity as introduced by Padua et al. [1]."

Archery can be described as a comparatively static sport requiring strength and endurance of the upper body, in particular the forearm and shoulder girdle. Skill in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow to a given target in a certain time span with accuracy. The discipline is described as a three-phase (the stance, the drawing and the sighting) movement. Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and follow-through. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. An archer pushes the bow with an extended arm, which is statically held in the direction of the target, while the other arm exerts a dynamic pulling of the bowstring from the beginning of the drawing phase, until the release is dynamically executed. The release phase must be well balanced and highly reproducible to achieve commendable results in a competition. The bowstring is released when an audible impulse is received from a device called clicker that is used as a draw length check. Each arrow can be drawn to an exact distance and a standard release can be obtained using the device. The clicker is reputed to improve the archer's score and used by all target archers. The archer should react to the clicker as quickly as possible. In particular, a repeated contraction and relaxation strategy in the forearm and pull finger muscles should be developed for this reason. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization and stabilization-related parameters on shooting performance at the cervical, lumbal and scapular levels in archery athletes. A total of 40 archery athletes aged between 10 and 18, who have been professionally engaged in archery for at least 1 year were included in the study. Demographic information and musculoskeletal system evaluations of the athletes were done. Performance of the athletes via Upper Extremity Closed Kinetic Chain Stability Test, Hand Grip Strength test; presence of scapular dyskinesia was evaluated via the Lateral Scapular Slide Test. Cervical region stabilization was evaluated via Craniocervical Flexion Test, scapular level stabilization was evaluated via Scapular Muscle Endurance Test, lumbar region stabilization was evaluated via Abdominal Drawing-in Test and Sahrmann's Core Stability Test. As the parameters related to stabilization, postures via Corbin Postural Rating Scale; balances via Stork Balance Test, Upper Extremity Y Balance Test; pain was evaluated via the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. Shooting performances were evaluated with 72 target shootings and a total of 720 points. ."

The investigators will characterize communication content and styles of pediatricians (residents, fellows, attendings) and adolescent-mother dyads on contraception discussions with 50 real-life clinical encounters. Through separate post-encounter surveys of each pediatrician-adolescent-parent triad using validated scales, the investigators will describe the overall quality of the interactions (concordant contraception plans, satisfaction), communication (confidence, comfort, self-efficacy, confidentiality) and decision-making (perceived autonomy, ownership, and power) to determine ideal, moderate and poor communication interactions. Then, separate group interviews (n = 15, with adolescents, mothers and physicians) will review recorded vignettes to identify optimal culturally tailored communication strategies. In Stage 2 (development), the investigators will upload de-identified and anonymized vignettes to an AI communication training tool to develop and refine the tool through prompt engineering and performance evaluation with adolescent, parent and pediatrician advisory boards. Then, the investigators will iteratively test the acceptability and feasibility of the tool on 10 pediatrician learners. In Stage 3 (proof-of-concept), the investigators will test how an AI communication intervention tool can improve reproductive health encounters by comparing evaluation results of 50 pre-training and 50 post-training real encounters. This study will advance pediatrician communication training, empower adolescent sexual health, support mothers' priorities, and test how AI communication training chatbots can improve triadic interactions."

Vitiligo is a common skin condition that affects approximately 1% of the population. It is characterised by the loss of pigmentation in the skin, which can be distressing for patients. The condition is more common in people with darker skin, and in people from more deprived backgrounds. There is a lack of data on the burden of vitiligo in the UK, and how this burden is distributed across different sociodemographic groups. This study will provide estimate of the cumulative lifetime risk of vitiligo in the population overall, and by important sociodemographic groups, including age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation. These approaches allow creation of cumulative lifetime risk plots which provide an excellent and accessible way to display the relative disease burden across groups. The cumulative lifetime risk of vitiligo will be estimated at age 80 years (approximate lifetime expectancy in the UK) using survival models, with age as the timescale and accounting for competing risk of death. This study will also perform a subgroup analysis in the vitiligo population to identify health-related disparities across people in different deprivation, sex and ethnic groups. The disparities that will be considered are: Mental health conditions; healthcare utilisation; and work impact (time off work and unemployment), The assessment of any associations with baseline characteristics and the outcome of interest will be used using Cox proportional hazards models (time to event outcomes) and generalised linear models."

The investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs. An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia. Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy. In conclusion, nutritional intervention with high energy/high protein nutritional supplements, especially if enriched with nutrients known for their immune- or microbiome-modulation properties, may have a positive impact on several mechanisms underlying cachexia-induced PD-1 ICI efficacy impairment."

The investigators will be recruiting 10 patients with MDD-AD and 10 HC, following the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Each participant will be evaluated by a team of experienced psychologists and clinicians, administering structured clinical interviews to assess the presence/absence of axis I and II psychiatric disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II) (first visit). Furthermore, in all subjects the degree of depressive/manic dysintomatology will be measured through the use of clinical scales and psychopathological tests such as:the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery- Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating scale (BPRS)(second visit; within one week of the first screening visit). Moreover, additional clinical data will beextrapolated from medical records and interviews with psychiatrists (if available). The investigators will also evaluate the suitability of each participant to undergo the multimodal acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data with a 7T GE scanner. The neuroimaging session, performed during the third visit (within one month of the second visit) will include: T1-weighted image acquisition: to study the volumetric differences of white and gray matter between subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. fMRI: to assess functional connections between prefrontal cortex and limbic system. 1H-MRS: to study glutamatergic neurotransmission within the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The sequences will be optimized thanks to the 32-channel brain coil (NovaMedical), to reduce artifacts and inhomogeneities in images. The second part of the study will involve murine models. More specifically, to assess whether Pcdh9 deficits affect the number and morphology of excitatory synapses, electron microscopic analyses will be performed in Pcdh9-knockout mice. Glutamatergic signaling will also be studied at the biochemical level: the expression levels of all major glutamate receptor subunits (ionotropic and metabotropic) will be investigated by analyzing cortical protein lysates (total lysates) in adult mice (3-4 months). In addition, to identify finer changes in glutamate receptor expression, their intracellular and surface expression will be analyzed using the BS3 crosslinking assay. The investigators will also proceed in the characterization of the interaction between integrin β3 and Protocadherin9 using co-immunoprecipitation analysis from mouse brain: in case of positive results (at least 3 replicates), further analysis will be conducted to study whether the two proteins bind directly. Electrophysiological characterization of Itgb3 and Pcdh9 murine patterns in the medial prefrontal cortex at both synaptic and local network levels will also be performed and, lastly, an evaluation of functional recovery of behavioral and electrophysiological deficits mediated by CRISPRa will be conducted. In this case, experiments on murine models will be perform to determine whether overexpression of integrin β3 or protocadherin9 could compensate for defects in synaptic glutamatergic transmission caused by deficiencies in CAMs."

Pembrolizumab has been approved for first-line locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50% for PDL1, based on the results of KEYNOTE-024. However, even with a positive PDL1 status, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy. In the KEYNOTE-024 study evaluating pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥50%, the response rate in the pembrolizumab arm alone was 45%. This result led to the approval of pembrolizumab for first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥ 50%, which nevertheless represents only 22% of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Early identification of biomarkers for patients unlikely to benefit from first-line pembrolizumab is therefore a crucial step in selecting suitable candidates. Furthermore, in cancer, genomic alterations in NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 result in constitutive activation of NRF2-dependent gene transcription, which promotes cellular resistance to oxidative stress, xenobiotic efflux, proliferation and metabolic reprogramming. Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 are found in 3.5-15% and 12-17% of NSCLC patients respectively. NFE2L2 is a transcription factor that directs the expression of free radical defense genes that may interfere with radiation-induced DNA damage. KEAP1 is an adaptor protein that targets NFE2L2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction as part of normal homeostasis. These new biomarkers are of clinical interest, as KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations predict radiation resistance in patients with localized NSCLC treated with radiotherapy but not surgery. Some data also suggest a role for the KEAP1/NFE2L2 axis in response to immunotherapy. Establishing a predictive model for the presence of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutation would provide a tool for predicting survival (progression-free and overall), even before the patient starts immunotherapy."

The study will test the effectiveness of dietary counselling promoting adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, as an adjuvant treatment of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), to decrease depressive symptoms in adults diagnosed with MDD and having elevated inflammation biomarkers (CRP, IL-6). The study will be a 12-week multicentre randomized parallel-group open controlled trial, with a follow up assessment at 6- and 12-months after baseline data collection, with two parallel groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Participants will be individuals diagnosed with a first episode of MDD, according to the F32 Depressive episode (F32.0; F32.1; F32.2) classification of the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), under treatment with antidepressant medication for a period of time less than or equal to 6 months, attending to outpatient consultations. Potential participants will be invited to enrol by their medical doctors from the participating recruitment centres. The invitation will be made at regular medical appointments including primary care consultations and outpatient psychiatric consultations in one of the participant centers. After signing the informed consent, CRP and IL-6 levels will be tested. Participants with increased inflammatory biomarkers, meeting all other inclusion criteria will be randomized to (a) the intervention arm or (b) the control arm of the study, in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-generated list of random numbers stratified by center in variable blocks of size 2, 4 and 6. Treatment allocation will be concealed from the researchers, using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The study will use a convenience sample from patients diagnosed with MDD attending to outpatient consultations in one for the participating clinics. Considering a 2-sided significance level of 5 percent and a power of 80 percent and having into consideration an attrition of 40 percent at the end of the intervention, the minimum sample size estimated is 190 (95 per arm). Estimating a prevalence of elevated inflammation in 30 percentage of MDD patients and 10 percentage of patients that don't meet other inclusion criteria, the number of recruited participants estimated is 700. Participants allocated to the intervention group will attend six nutrition consultations, performed by a register nutritionist in weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. The intervention will be personalized to each participant and will promote adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, ad libitum, without calories or macronutrients restriction or recommendation for weight change. The intervention will follow a similar approach to the one proposed by Estruch et al. in the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet study. The intervention will contemplate the following recommendations: Positive recommendations (promotion of the intake of the following foods): Use of olive oil as main fat, both for cooking and dressing; 2 or more servings of vegetables daily (200g of vegetables per serving); 2-3 servings of fresh fruits per day; 3 or more servings of legumes per day; 3 or more servings of fish per week (100 - 150g of fish per serving or 200g of shellfish); 3 or more servings of nuts a week (30g of nuts per serving); Meat consumption mainly from poultry (without skin) or rabbit; Home cooked meals with tomato, garlic and onion, at least twice a week; Negative recommendations (eliminate or drastically reduce the following foods): Cream, butter and margarine; Cold meats, paté and duck meat; Carbonated and/or sugared beverages; Pastries and industrial baked products (cakes, donuts or cookies); Industrial deserts; French fries and potato chips; Pre-cooked cakes and sweets; If alcohol is consumed should be limited to 300ml of wine per day (150cc at meals for men and 100cc for woman, during meals); Training of the nutritionists delivering the intervention will be provided prior to the beginning of recruitment and during the duration of the trial in MDD, therapeutic relationship, trauma and Mediterranean Diet.

Heart failure is a common disease with a poor prognosis. The heart is unable to pump enough blood to the body. The heart muscle is weakened and the heart is enlarged. The heart muscle is also not able to contract properly. The electrical signals that control the heart muscle are not properly transmitted. This is called dyssynchrony. Dyssynchrony is accompanied by cardiac remodeling with dilatation of the left chamber. Whether dilatation is an effect or a cause of dyssynchrony is unclear and likely different for different patients. Cardiac resynchronization therapy, CRT, is a pacemaker with an extra electrode that will stimulate the right and left ventricle simultaneously, resulting in resynchronization. We have started a clinical study to collect blood samples, heart tissue and clinical data (echocardiography, ECG, medical records) from heart failure patients eligible for CRT and a control group of heart failure patients on medical therapy. Patients will be assessed before CRT implantation or early after initiation of medical treatment, at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A subset of the patients in the CRT group will also also be subjected to a heart biopsy before CRT implantation and at 3 months. At each time point all patients will be assessed with echocardiography, ECG and blood sampling. The blood samples will be analyzed regarding proteins and exosomal miRNA. The heart tissue will be frozen and analyzed regarding proteins, RNA and contractility. Endothelial function is also known to play a crucial role in heart failure and will be evaluated at inclusion, 3 and 12 months using EndoPAT. Red blood cells (RBCs) are collected to determine whether they may affect endothelial cell function."

Routine PRO monitoring is an evidence-based practice that improves patient outcomes. Patients with cancer commonly experience symptoms which go unrecognized by clinical teams up to half of the time. PROs are a powerful tool to bridge this gap, amplifying the patient experience and improving communication between patients and clinicians. A seminal clinical trial was conducted in which weekly PRO symptom assessments with care team alerts led to reduced care utilization, improved quality of life, and lengthened overall survival among patients receiving active treatment for advanced solid tumors. Subsequent randomized trials have corroborated the quality of life and survival advantages of PRO monitoring in other cancer populations and practice settings. Real-world adherence to PRO monitoring is lower than in seminal clinical trials, with potential racial/ethnic disparities. Multilevel barriers to PRO implementation exist at the patient, clinician, practice, and system levels. While patient adherence to PRO monitoring in seminal trials ranged from 70 to 90 percent, real-world adherence is much lower and more variable. Our preliminary research demonstrates that in a large, multi-site rollout of PRO monitoring, mean patient-level adherence was less than 50 percent. Moreover, compared to non-Hispanic White patients, Black and Hispanic patients were 9% and 4% less likely to complete PRO questionnaires, respectively, but more likely to report more severe symptoms. These results highlight that historically marginalized subgroups may benefit less from current methods of PRO administration, potentially reinforcing existing disparities in symptom management if not remediated. This will be the first study to apply behavioral economic strategies to align clinicians and patients in achieving sustained patient-level PRO adherence, and addresses limitations of current PRO approaches. Current approaches to PRO collection are limited by: (1) suboptimal clinician engagement, (2) encounter-based assessments which preclude longitudinal monitoring of PROs outside of the clinic, and (3) insufficient automated effectors actively linking reported symptoms with clinical response. This proposal addresses these limitations by employing behavioral strategies directly targeting clinician engagement, utilizing novel electronic remote monitoring methods to maximize real-time PRO capture, and linking these with pathway-driven automated effectors."

Background: Prognostic awareness among patients with life-limiting diseases has been shown to be associated with less depression, better quality of care and earlier referral to palliative care. Moreover, accurate understanding of their illness may support patients to make informed decisions about their future in alignment with their preferences, values or needs. Supportive care in cancer is the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. This includes management of physical and psychological symptoms and side effects. Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) is a relatively new initiative implementing early supportive care in patients with advanced cancer. Although studies have shown that a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer remain unaware that their disease is not curable, research regarding prognostic awareness in patients referred to Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) services is still scarce. A deeper knowledge of the factors and patient characteristics associated with prognostic awareness is an important first step to develop interventions to improve prognostic communication and thereby to facilitate delivery of high-quality ESC. General aim: The ESC team at University College London Hospital is embedded within the oncology outpatient service, providing specialist symptom control and Advanced Care Planning to patients with advanced cancer. The primary aim of this study is to better understand the prognostic awareness of patients referred to the ESC service. A secondary aim is to evaluate the relationship between patients' prognostic awareness and levels of psychological distress, quality of life, trust in medical professionals and perceived quality of care. Patient population: Consecutive adult patients with advanced cancer referred to the ESC service will be eligible to participate. Patients unable to complete questionnaires due to cognitive impairment such as dementia will be excluded. Patients who have already been referred to community palliative care services will also be excluded. Methods: This will be a cross-sectional prospective study. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by members of the ESC team and will be informed about the study. Interested patients will then discuss the study with the research team and will be invited to participate. After informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete a questionnaire which will cover their level of prognostic awareness, psychological symptoms, and quality of life). The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire can be completed online via RedCap. Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is the level of patients' prognostic awareness, which will be assessed by the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire. This questionnaire has previously been successfully used in research to assess patients' information preferences, perceptions about their prognosis and the goals of therapy and communication preferences about end-of-life care. Secondary endpoints will be (a) patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information assessed through the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire (b) symptoms of depression evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), (c) symptoms of anxiety evaluated through the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2), (d) quality of life and (d) patients' trust in their medical team and (e) other aspects of perceived quality of care, rated on a visual analogue scale (NRS) from 0-10. Sample size and statistics: The investigators will conduct univariable and multivariable regression analyses to evaluate associations between sociodemographic or clinical variables and outcomes. The investigators aim to include 100 patients. This will give us at least 10 degrees of freedom to assess association of potential risk factors with outcome and to evaluate confounders in a multivariable analysis. Discussion: This will be the first prospective study to assess prognostic awareness among cancer patients referred to ESC services in a British setting. Identifying covariates for prognostic unawareness and psychological burden among patients with advanced cancer will inform the future development of strategies to improve care and communication with this patient group."

Arterial hypertension remains one of the most important risk factors in developing a cardiovascular disease. While medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications should always be included. Besides physical activity and a balanced diet, there are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine. One very important part in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended. Even though hydrotherapy has been a part of complementary medicine for more than a century now some therapeutic approaches lack of scientific evidence - especially when it comes to their effect on arterial hypertension. This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual). All 50 participants will be monitored with three 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure measurements (24h ABPM) at the beginning of the trial after randomization, at 8 weeks and at 6 months. The intervention group will be advised to perform the armbaths on 5 of 7 days per week for 8 weeks total. Each participant will get a detailed instruction how to perform the armbath and will be handed a diary to document their performance. After 6 months, each participant of the control group will be offered to be instructed on performing the armbaths as well. Within the active period of 8 weeks, participants of both groups will be called regularly to ask about their health and whether they have questions regarding the trial."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of an air-polishing device in preventing white spot lesions (WSLs) and gingivitis among patients undergoing multi-bracketed fixed orthodontic treatment. The investigators will compare the performance of the air-polishing device with the conventional ultrasonic device in preventing WSLs and gingivitis during orthodontic treatment. The study will be conducted on 60 patients attending the Division of Orthodontics for treatment. Half of the participants will be randomly assigned for treatment with the air-polishing device in every orthodontic appointment, meaning once per month, the other half will be treated with a standard ultrasonic scaler every six months. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 2 years. The investigators will then analyze the prevalence of WSLs using the Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) method. Gingivitis will be evaluated throughout the study by using standard clinical parameters; the antimicrobial efficacy against several known periodontal pathogens and the host-response (inflammatory markers in GCF) will be measured by the qPCR assay and the multiplex immunoassay, respectively. Clinical evaluation and collection of samples for microbial and host response analysis will be performed every 6 months. Incidence of bracket debonding we will be calculated and compared."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia in the UK, affecting over 1 million people. It is associated with a 5-fold increase in the risk of stroke and a 3-fold increase in the risk of death. The risk of stroke is related to the presence of a clot in the left atrial appendage (LAA), which is a small pouch of the left atrium. The LAA is the most common site of stroke in patients with AF. The current treatment for stroke prevention in patients with AF is anticoagulation with warfarin or newer anticoagulants. However, these treatments are associated with a risk of bleeding. Surgical exclusion of the LAA is a well-recognised part of routine surgical practice for patients with AF. During cardiac surgery, a randomised trial has shown that surgical exclusion of the LAA is associated with a 2.2% reduction in ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism. Therefore, surgical exclusion of the LAA, which in the latter study was most commonly achieved by excision, is a well-recognised part of routine surgical practice for patients with AF. During lung resections for malignancies, irrespective of a history of AF, along with the part of the lung being resected, the pulmonary vein and surrounding portion of the left atrium are also removed. These operations therefore provide tissue which is known to be of great importance in promoting and sustaining AF, but which is normally discarded. In the current study proposal, we will obtain this tissue and analyse it histologically. In the first instance, as a pilot study of up to 10 patients to assess the feasibility of such an analysis. This sample size is informed by our previous basic science studies of cardiac and lung fibrosis and will inform the design of a future full study. We aim to obtain samples from patients in sinus rhythm (thoracic surgical patients) and varying durations of AF (all surgical cases) to encompass tissues with different degrees of fibrosis. Design of research Up to 10 patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHS) will be recruited. In all cases, the patients would be undergoing surgery where the tissue being studied in the protocol would normally be removed. In the case of thoracic surgical patients, this would be those undergoing lung resections where an ostial pulmonary vein segment will be excised. Here the aim will be to have at least one patient with no history of atrial fibrillation, paroxysmal AF and persistent AF. Cardiac surgical patients included will be those where surgical left atrial exclusion will be performed as part of the procedure, in this case at least one patient with paroxysmal and one with persistent AF."

Liver transplantation is the transplantation of the liver, which is completely or partially removed by surgical intervention, from a living or brain-dead cadaver to the recipient. Today, organ transplantation procedures are carried out successfully in many centers in our country. Liver transplantation has become the most effective treatment method for acute and chronic liver failure due to different reasons. The life expectancy of individuals with advanced liver disease, which was limited to months before liver transplantation, was extended with liver transplantation and the quality of life was improved with this treatment method. However, since most of the organ transplants are made from genetically different donors, tissue compatibility between the donor and the recipient remains a problem. Therefore, the recipient's immune response to donor graft antigens should be considered. In recent years, the application of advanced surgery and new immunosuppressive approaches has made it possible to successfully transplant almost any vital organ or tissue. However, due to both infection and genetic factors, an immune response to the donor organ may develop and cause organ rejection. At this point, we think that early diagnosis and discovery of immune response parameters that distinguish infection from rejection may be important. In our study, some inflammatory Interleukin-2 , Interleukin-6, Interferon-γ, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α and anti-inflammatory Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 cytokine genes expressions and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1, which contributes to the pathology of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases; Human Leukocyte Antigen-G5, which suppresses the immune response; the expression levels of transcription factor Forkhead box-P3 expressed in regulatory T-lymphocytes and Cluster of Differentiation (CD)14 genes, which are thought to be biomarkers in various infectious diseases and expressed in monocytes, will be measured from peripheral blood samples obtained from liver transplant patients before, 1 month and 6 months after the operation. In addition, the classical liver markers Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Platelet Count (PLT), Alpha Feto Protein (AFP), Direct Bilirubin (Bilirubin D), Total Bilirubin (Bilirubin T) and C- Levels of biochemical parameters such as Reactive Protein (CRP) will be measured. In the light of the data to be obtained, it is aimed to find biomarkers with high predictive value for rejection and infection after liver transplantation."

Acute heart failure (AHF) is a common cause of hospitalization and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. AHF is characterized by fluid overload, which is associated with poor outcomes. Diuretic therapy is the mainstay of treatment for AHF, but it is often ineffective due to the development of diuretic resistance. The RenalGuard System is a device that allows the delivery of a matched volume of replacement solution to the patient in an amount matched to the volume of urine produced by the patient. The RenalGuard System has been shown to be effective in reducing fluid overload in patients with AHF. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the RenalGuard System in reducing fluid overload in patients with AHF and overt fluid overload to standard diuretic therapy."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of supplementation with the flavonoid diosmin on DOMS in humans (athletes from the women's five-a-side soccer team from the city of Londrina, Paraná State, Brazil), using the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. The study will consist of two experimental groups, made up of healthy individuals, who will perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol, as follows: 1) control group that will receive placebo supplementation (corn starch tablets at a concentration of 750 mg); and 2) intervention group that will receive supplementation with diosmin (tablets at a concentration of 750 mg). Treatment of study participants will occur orally, and everyone will ingest identical opaque capsules containing placebo or diosmin with water. The treatment protocol will be applied before the start (pre-treatment) of the intense dynamic exercise sessions, once a day, during the two days before, and on the day (immediately before) the execution of the exercise protocol. Each experimental group will consist of approximately 20 participants. The project is approved by the Research Ethics Committee (CEP) for Human Beings/Brazil Platform(protocol number 64025122.2.0000.0108). The selected participants will be informed about the objectives and methodology of the study and when there is agreement with the proposed design, the agreement to voluntarily participate in the study will be registered by means of an Informed Consent Form. The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed (concentric and eccentric contractions) for the study will follow the following approach: participants will perform a standardized muscle injury protocol that will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until fatigue of bilateral muscle contractions on a leg-press machine with a 45° angle. Each The participant will have their load previously defined through the 1 repetition maximum (1RM) test, and 70% of the defined weight will be used during the intense dynamic exercise protocol. During each action, the load will be resisted with the legs placed on the leg-press supporter from full knee extension to the 90° knee flexion angle, lasting approximately 3-5 seconds. Between each series, participants will be able to take a 1-minute rest period. The intense dynamic exercise protocol that will be carried out by all participants will be supervised by the project manager and/or collaborators duly trained for such assessments. Participants' clinical signs will be monitored frequently during the activities and in case of discomfort, the activity will be stopped immediately. Analyzes of clinical and blood parameters will be carried out before the start (baseline) and after the end of the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol (24 and 48 hours) aiming to investigate the possible effects of diosmin on DOMS and related pathological events."

Background/rational: Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood disability with a prevalence of 2.11 per 1000 live births in high income countries. CP enfolds a group of developmental disorders of movement and posture, attributed to non-progressive disturbances which occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. An advanced treatment option for individuals with severe CP is Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) treatment. This treatment can be considered when other options, such as oral medication, are insufficient or cause side effects. Previous studies have shown mostly low level evidence for the effect of ITB on spasticity in children with spastic CP. For children with dyskinetic CP, The Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC previously conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial, which provides evidence for the effect of ITB on attaining personal treatment goals after three months of ITB treatment. It was furthermore found that after one year of ITB treatment, personal treatment goals were at least partially achieved in 97% of children and adolescents. Not all children show similar response to ITB: some benefit more than others in attaining treatment goals. The investigators previous research on the effect of ITB in children with dyskinetic CP, found that a higher level of dystonia prior to ITB and reduction of pain during ITB were associated, for a small part, with attainment of treatment goals. Sample size was not sufficient to look at specific factors associated with specific types of treatment goals. For example, goals on the level of personal care could be influenced by other factors than goals related to sitting or transfers. Long-term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with spastic and dyskinetic CP have not yet been described in literature. Furthermore, knowing which factors influence outcome on the long term, preferably related to specific types of treatment goals, can be used to inform and select children and adolescents with CP better before initiating ITB. In order to accomplish these goals prospectively, real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals. The overall aim of the register is to provide personalized, value-based care for children with CP. In the Netherlands CP register, a follow-up registration program is combined with treatment registration. Prospective data collection in the treatment registration will allow us to implement standardised assessment protocols in the two academic medical centres in the Netherlands where baclofen pump implantations are performed, the Amsterdam University Medical Center (Amsterdam UMC) in Amsterdam and Maastricht UMC (MUMC)in Maastricht. Objectives: The primary research question of this study is: 1. What is the short- (3 months), medium- (1 year) and long-term (2 years) effect of ITB in children with CP on personal treatment goals? Secondary objectives are: What is the association between the effect on personal treatment goals and on spasticity and/or dystonia? Which factors are associated with treatment success of ITB in children with CP? Study design A prospective observational study will be conducted in Amsterdam UMC and the MUMC using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. It is anticipated that in these centres 15 to 20 pumps will be implanted in children and adolescents annually. Over the total study period of 4,5 years, we aim to include a total of 67 to 90 children. The Medical Ethics Review Committee (MEC) of the Amsterdam UMC, location VU University Medical Center (IRB00002991) has stated that the Medical Research Involving Human Subjects Act (WMO) does not apply to the study and that further official approval by the MEC is waived. Participants Inclusion criteria All children with CP Who start ITB treatment in the Netherlands under the age of 16 Exclusion criteria no consent is given by the patient and/or caregiver for participation. Subject follow up schedule In the investigators previous randomised controlled trial (the IDYS trial) on the effect of ITB in dyskinetic CP, we found that after three months of ITB most goals were, at least partially, attained. A study by Albright et al, additionally implies that dosage increases mostly in the first months, then shows some increase between 12 to 24 months and is fairly stable thereafter.

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common condition among pregnant women with metabolic implications for both the mother and offspring. Studies have suggested a potential role of vitamin D status in GDM risk, but evidence from randomized controlled trials is inadequate and inconclusive. A research has been planned to investigate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM development among high risk pregnant women through a well-designed RCT. Pregnant women at a risk to develop GDM with low vitamin D levels (<30 ng/mL) at 07-11 weeks of gestation will be recruited and randomly assigned to receive either vitamin D3 supplementation (2 00,000 IU/Week) for 04 -06 weeks or placebo. Randomization will be achieved using a computer-generated random sequence or a randomization table. The allocation will be done in a 1:1 ratio, with equal numbers of participants assigned to the vitamin D and placebo groups. The primary outcome will be the incidence of GDM based on the International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups Criteria after 75 g OGTT. This study will contribute to the understanding of the relationship between vitamin D and GDM risk through a well-designed RCT with integrated approaches. The findings may inform clinical practice and public health recommendations for vitamin D supplementation during pregnancy."

Fibercolonoscopy, as a terminal examination method for lower digestive tract diseases, often brings different degrees of pain and discomfort, tension and anxiety to patients. Therefore, at present, intravenous anesthesia is often used in clinical practice to reduce discomfort, and intravenous propofol combined with fentanyl is the most widely used in clinical practice. But intravenous general anesthesia can lead to hemodynamic fluctuations and an increase in anesthesiation-related complications such as longer stays in the hospital after surgery. Complications related to sedation and analgesia have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Studies have shown that most of the adverse events in endoscopy are related to the sedation and analgesia drugs used. With the successful application of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in the field of postoperative analgesia, this technique has also been used in the sedation and analgesia of gastroenteroscopy in recent years. Propofol has the characteristics of quick action, short time of action and rapid recovery, so it is very suitable for the anesthesia and sedation of painless abortion and painless gastroenteroscopy. Remifentanil, as an opioid μ receptor agonist, is easily hydrolyzed rapidly by non-specific esterases in plasma and tissues due to the ester bond contained in its chemical structure. Therefore, it has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics such as rapid intravenous injection, small volume of distribution, rapid clearance after drug withdrawal, no accumulation, metabolism is not affected by liver and kidney function, and has been widely used in various surgeries in recent years, especially in the anesthesia of short surgeries.
The purpose of this study is to compare the sedation and analgesia effects of propofol and remifentanil mixed solution and intravenous combined anesthesia in fiber colonoscopy.
The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled study. The subjects are 100 patients who need fiber colonoscopy. The patients are divided into two groups: the controlled analgesia/sedation group and the intravenous combined anesthesia group. The controlled analgesia/sedation group is given a mixture of propofol and remifentanil, and the intravenous combined anesthesia group is given intravenous fentanyl, midazolam and propofol.

Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis. The early clinical symptoms lack specificity, and they are often found in late stage with poor prognosis. CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially way to detect CIN in the cast-off cells from the bile samples for diagnosing and monitoring biliary tract carcinoma patients. BileCAD is a new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from bile, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of biliary tract carcinoma patients. The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing bile samples from gallbladder cancers and cholangiocarcinoma patients and control groups that without any tumor in the Bile duct and gallbladder or other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of BileCAD test for diagnosing biliary tract carcinoma to other modalities, such as pathological diagnosis. At the same time, the consistency of BileCAD microbial analysis results and clinical microbial culture results was compared, so as to provide more reference for clinical diagnosis."

Schizophrenia is one of the leading causes of disability due to mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as India, with this burden disproportionately impacting lower income individuals who primarily access health care services through publicly run facilities. In 2017, it was estimated that there were over 3.5 million people in India living with schizophrenia, with an increasing prevalence of schizophrenia observed from 1990 to 2017 as the population ages and disease burden shifts to chronic conditions experienced in adulthood. Importantly, the burden of disability due to schizophrenia is often underestimated as many epidemiological studies do not adequately account for the added burden of chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes that disproportionately impact individuals living with schizophrenia. Globally, the dramatically reduced life expectancy observed among individuals living with schizophrenia is largely due to preventable and treatable medical conditions. Recent epidemiological studies in India have further observed a mortality rate among individuals living with schizophrenia that is twice the rate observed in the general population, with calls for greater efforts to address this significant health disparity. In addition to recognizing the need to address the alarming care gap, where in India it is estimated that upwards of 75% of individuals living with schizophrenia do not have access to essential mental health care, urgent attention is also needed towards responding to the medical and physical health needs of this vulnerable patient population. Psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness and integration of task shared delivery of the evidence-based COPSI (Community care for People with Schizophrenia in India) program in primary care. We will build on important preliminary work led by project collaborators to support our aims to evaluate whether a novel digital platform can enhance the clinical effectiveness (Aim 1) and the integration (Aim 2) of an evidence-based psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India."

Cardiac transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with an inexorably progressive clinical course and poor prognosis. The disease is caused by misfolding of the liver-derived precursor protein transthyretin as a result of an acquired wild-type variant (ATTRwt) or as a hereditary mutant variant (ATTRm). Application of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides greater anatomic resolution, enabling the assessment of amyloid burden within individual left ventricle segments. This study aims to describe the pattern of regional myocardial distribution of 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanedicarboxylic acid (DPD) SPECT uptake among patients with ATTRwt and ATTRm. It will investigate the clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic, including left ventricle longitudinal strain profile in ATTRwt and ATTRm. Moreover, we will evaluate the presence and extent of DPD cardiac uptake among asymptomatic ATTRm variants carriers. This is a prospective multi-center observational study. The study, after obtaining prior written informed consent, will include consecutive patients who have Grade 1-3 cardiac DPD retention in scintigraphy. In addition, first-degree relatives of patients with ATTRm are going to be enrolled. Patients are going to undergo TTR gene sequencing to assess the presence of pathogenic variants associated with ATTRm. Both planar scintigraphy, SPECT and speckle-tracking echocardiography will be reviewed and interpreted using visual and quantitative approaches. The collected data will be analyzed statistically to verify research hypotheses. Approval from the local Bioethical Committee will be obtained before carrying out the study. All procedures performed are going to be in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments, or comparable ethical standards."

The study will also evaluate the Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) Assessed by European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (QLQC30) Score. EORTC QLQ-C30 was a questionnaire which included 30 questions that rates the overall quality of life in cancer participants. The first 28 questions use a 4-point scale (1=not at all to 4=very much) for evaluuating function (physical, role, social, cognitive, emotional), symptoms (diarrhea, fatigue, dyspnea, appetite loss, insomnia, nausea/vomiting, constipation, and pain) and financial difficulties. The last 2 questions use a 7-point scale (1=very poor to 7=excellent) to evaluate overall health and quality of life. Scores are transformed to a range of 0 to 100 using a standard EORTC algorithm. A high score for a functional scale represents a high/healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status/quality of life (QoL) represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item represents a high level of symptomatology/problem."

Hip fractures are a common cause of hospital admission in the elderly. The investigator has found that low blood pressure (hypotension) is very common during surgery (occurring in at least > 30%, depending on the definition of hypotension), and appears to be significantly linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery ( 3% rise in mortality/5 mmHg fall in SBP). There are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture, including fluid overload with heart failure, and cardiac/kidney/gut ischaemia. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. UK national guidelines recommend that lower doses are given (< 2mls 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine), but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately (i.e. invasively) or often enough (i.e. > every 5 minutes). The ASAP 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.44 mls 0.5% hyperbaric/normobaric spinal anaesthesia is administered, and the investigator has been using this amount (1.5mls) in Brighton since 2011. Recently, it has become possible to transfer vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (eg in Coroner's investigations - approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery). However, analyzing such observational medicolegal data should also allow accurate description of how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (eg the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, it should be possible to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery. By merging individuals' data with that held on the Brighton Hip Fracture Database, it should be possible to determine whether prevalence (and/or depth+duration of hypotension) are correlated with outcomes (survival, length of inpatient stay) after hip fracture repair."

The investigators hypothesize that malaria and intestinal parasitic diseases may result in enhanced or tolerogenic innate immune responses that decrease the risk of symptomatic COVID-19. On the other hand, these conditions and deficiency of micronutrients may decrease the acquisition and longevity of antibodies induced by natural infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, increasing the risk of re-infection and breakthrough infections to vaccination. To test these hypotheses, up to 200 symptomatic individuals (index cases)will be enrolled, their household contacts (anticipated  700), and up to 600 vaccinees. The specific innate immune phenotypes that differentiate uninfected Malawians from Western controls (based on samples from blood banks) and whether those responses are protecting Malawians from infection and/or progression of disease will be assessed. Infected participants and vaccinees will be followed for up to 1.5 years to assess acquisition and longevity of Ab responses and memory B cells."

Orthopedic surgery is a surgical treatment method based on the correction of the functions of bones, November muscles, tendons, and ligaments in the body. Arthroplasty (hip, knee, shoulder), arthroscopy (meniscopathy, rotator cuff rupture), limb fractures, structural (hallux vagus, hallux rigidities, carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger finger), and developmental (hip dysplasia) dysfunctions are the interventions in which the orthopedic surgical procedure is performed. In orthopedic surgeries, the need for surgical treatment increases every day as a result of degeneration in the musculoskeletal system with a decrease in mobilization due to advancing age, November illness, trauma, or technological developments. In the United States, 30% of major surgical interventions involve orthopedic surgeries performed on elderly individuals); in Turkey, it is reported that 33.5% of orthopedic surgeries are performed due to trauma, and about 48% are performed on the lower extremities. Orthopedic surgeries are practices that risk serious complications, as with any treatment option. Complications such as nausea, vomiting, headache, hypotension, and postoperative urinary retention (PUR), especially due to spinal anesthesia, may be observed in patients receiving treatment due to orthopedic surgery. While the prevalence of PUR in orthopedic surgeries is 6-40% in the literature, it is stated that this rate is higher (6-60%) after spinal anesthesia. Due to PUR after orthopedic surgery, there is an increase in hospital stay times, susceptibility to infection, deterioration in the quality of life, and associated cost increases. Postoperative urinary retention is a complication that manifests symptoms with problems such as suprapubic pain, bladder spasm, and/or inability to urinate after surgical treatment. The etiology of PUR includes factors caused by the patient (advanced age, male gender, anatomical problems, comorbidity, neural transmission disorders), due to the surgical process (failure to empty the bladder during the preoperative period, surgery lasts longer than 2 hours, emergency surgery, opioid-NSAID-atropine use, amount of fluid taken) and due to anesthesia (epidural/spinal anesthesia). 2-6 of the postoperative period. it gives symptoms as a result of the absence of the first urine decrement between hours. As a result, serious problems such as increased urinary pressure and acute kidney injury and/or dysfunction due to bladder distension occur in patients. Management of PUR can be achieved by using physical examination (globe monitoring), bladder catheterization, and ultrasonographic (USG) methods to diagnose these problems at an early stage. Field health professionals, who have an important place in the conduct of health services, offer the greatest contribution to the surgical treatment process with their understanding of quality health care. In particular, nurses who are actively involved in the perioperative process are the professional staff with the greatest responsibility for positively managing health care. Nurses help to ensure the patient's comfort as soon as possible by providing multidisciplinary cooperation in the management of complications that develop during this process. For this purpose, nurses need to carry out the necessary practices and precautions against the risk of developing PUR, which is one of the postoperative complications. In the recently published Nursing Regulation, the nurses' authority to manage PUR is clearly stated as interventions to be implemented by a nursing decision as A nurse can decide independently or jointly with a physician to insert and remove a urinary catheter if she cannot eliminate urinary retention with the interventions she can apply, Hot-cold application intervention definition is clearly stated. Therefore, nurses evaluate the patient by reviewing the existing risk factors of the patient and surgical process during the perioperative period, providing emotional support for surgical stress, questioning perioperative fluid intake, informing the patient about the consumption of caffeine-containing drinks and plenty of water, monitor urine postoperatively, prefer non-invasive methods (listening to water sound, relaxation, bladder massage, mobilization, hot-cold application, ko mot/duck/sliders) primarily in case of PURE development, and invasive methods as a last resort (urinary catheterization, ensuring the necessary cooperation with the physician for interventional applications is one of the important responsibilities in"

The number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after acute illness is increasing. Their long-term outcome is poor and has not improved significantly over the past 20 years. The symptom burden for patients is considerable, and family members often suffer from significant physical and emotional strain. Long-term survivors report lasting physical limitations, but their emotional health is generally good. Care for many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is shifting t post-intensive care unit settings. While this trend has resulted in cost savings for hospitals and payers, it has not had a major impact on patient outcomes. Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources and clinician time. Measurement and knowledge of their outcomes will guide efforts to improve their care. This study will be conducted in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from August 2023 to January 2024. A retrospective cohort study will be conducted. Data will be checked, coded, entered, and analyzed using SPSS version 22 software. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data, tables, and figures for display results. Bivariate and multivariate analyses will be used to see the effect of the independent variable on the outcome variable. Variables that are significant on bivariate analysis at a p-value less than 0.2 will be taken to multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, a p-value of less than 0.05 will be used as a cut-off point for the presence of association. The strength of the association will be measured by 95% confidence interval and odd ratio."

The purpose of this study is to compare the pharmacodynamic effects of two bleeding reduction approaches in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) who have been on maintenance treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) composed of low-dose aspirin (81mg od) and prasugrel (10 mg od) or ticagrelor (90 mg bid) for at least 30 days. The two strategies are: 1) DAPT de-escalation (i.e., switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel while maintaining aspirin) and 2) potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (i.e., maintaining prasugrel or ticagrelor and dropping aspirin). The study will be conducted in patients with chronic coronary syndrome or acute coronary syndromes who have been on maintenance DAPT for at least 30 days. The primary objective is to compare the thrombus formation defined as AUC measured by T-TAS between the two strategies."

This research is centered on the comparative effectiveness of Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization techniques in the treatment of Adhesive Capsulitis, addressing a significant void in current literature. Prior studies have individually showcased the efficacy of both techniques in enhancing pain relief, expanding range of motion, and improving functional outcomes among patients. However, a direct comparative analysis between Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization is conspicuously absent, prompting this study to unveil potential distinctions in their impact on shoulder pain, range of motion, and functional mobility. The research design involves the random allocation of participants into two groups: Group A, receiving Gong's mobilization, and Group B, undergoing Kaltenborn's mobilization. This allocation will be done through a lottery method, ensuring a fair and unbiased selection process. Participants in both groups will also receive routine physical therapy, including 15 minutes of electrical muscle stimulation with heat therapy. This approach, supported by existing literature, aims to create a standardized baseline for assessing the additional impact of mobilization techniques. The study's duration is projected to be nine months, with data collection points at baseline, the end of 1.5 weeks, and the conclusion of the 3rd week. Outcome variables include pain assessment using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, evaluation of function through the Shoulder Pain & Disability Index, and measurement of range of motion using goniometry. Data collection will be performed by an assessor at specified intervals, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the interventions' effects over time. Ultimately, this research aspires to contribute evidence-based insights into the relative effectiveness of Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization techniques, aiding clinicians in making informed decisions for optimal patient outcomes in the context of Adhesive Capsulitis."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. HBV-related HCC is the most common type of HCC in Asia and Africa. Radiotherapy (RT) is a standard treatment for HCC patients with intermediate-stage disease. However, the residual tumors and early recurrence/metastasis after RT compromise the patient survival. Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies. The investigators will first use our previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status. The investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns. The true value of this novel HBV chimera vh-DNA will be revealed. The results will also support the consolidative use of personalized vh-DNA for earlier evaluating treatment response after RT, for post-RT disease monitoring, and for differentiating clonality at recurrence to design future clinical trial on combinational treatment."

Intracranial aneurysms (IA) are the most common vascular malformation in the central nervous system, and the incidence of IA is increasing year by year. The incidence of IA in China is 0.3%-0.5%, and the incidence of rupture is 0.01%-0.02%. The mortality rate of ruptured IA is 20%-30%, and the disability rate is 50%-70%. The treatment of IA is mainly divided into two methods: surgical clipping and endovascular treatment. Endovascular treatment is a minimally invasive treatment method, which has the advantages of less trauma, less bleeding, and faster recovery. However, the use of antiplatelet drugs is an important part of endovascular treatment. The use of antiplatelet drugs can reduce the incidence of thrombosis and stent thrombosis, but it can also increase the risk of bleeding. Therefore, the use of antiplatelet drugs in endovascular treatment of IA is a dilemma.
The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of guided antiplatelet therapy and standard antiplatelet therapy in the treatment of IA with stents. The investigators will conduct a cluster randomized controlled cohort study. The investigators will compare the incidence of ischemic events and bleeding events between the two groups. The investigators will also compare the incidence of ischemic events and bleeding events between the two groups in different subgroups."

Cerebral palsy (CP) is primarily a neuromotor disorder that affects the development of movement, muscle tone and posture. The underlying pathophysiology is an injury to the developing brain in the prenatal through neonatal period. Although the initial neuro pathologic lesion is non-progressive, children with cerebral palsy may develop a range of secondary conditions over time that will variably affect their functional abilities. The prevalence of CP varies between 1.5 to more than 4 cases per 1,000 live births worldwide. The motor impairments associated with CP can range from mild to severe, affecting different muscle groups and leading to difficulties in activities of daily living and participation in social and recreational activities. Children with CP often experience motor impairments that affect their gross motor function, leading to limitations in activities and participation. These motor impairments can also have a negative impact on bone health, resulting in reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of skeletal complications. Gross motor function refers to the ability to perform coordinated movements using large muscle groups, such as walking, running, and jumping. It is a key aspect of physical ability and independence in daily activities for children with CP. Previous research has shown that gross motor function is closely associated with bone health in this population. However, further investigation is needed to explore the specific nature of this correlation and its implications for intervention strategies. Gross motor function is commonly assessed using standardized tools such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical, psychological, and social well-being. In the context of cerebral palsy, understanding the impact of gross motor function on quality of life is crucial for comprehensive care and intervention planning. Children with CP may face limitations in mobility, participation in activities, and social interactions, which can significantly affect their overall quality of life. Exploring the relationship between gross motor function and quality of life can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the holistic well-being of children with CP. The quality of life in children with CP is not only influenced by their motor function but also by their overall health and well-being. Bone health plays a crucial role in maintaining the physical abilities and independence of individuals, as well as their overall quality of life. Impaired bone health in children with CP can lead to limitations in mobility, increased pain, and reduced participation in activities, which can have a significant impact on their overall well-being. Bone mineral density, on the other hand, is an important measure of bone strength and overall skeletal health. Children with CP often exhibit lower BMD compared to typically developing peers due to factors such as reduced weight-bearing activities, muscle weakness, altered biomechanics, limited mobility, and hormonal imbalances. This reduced BMD increases their susceptibility to fractures and skeletal deformities, further impacting their functional abilities and quality of life."

The prevalence of hypertension in adolescents has progressively increased in the last decades, generating a significant public health issue and considerable amount of research. The aim of the study was to establish a link of specific polymorphisms of Adducins and EO-related genes with selected phenotypes (hypertension, Na+ and K+ intake). Adolescents will be enrolled for the study in high schools in the north (Milan), center (Livorno) and south (Grottaglie) of Italy, to obtain a sample that could be representative of the italian adolescents. During the visit at the high school investigators obtain questionnaires to have some information about eating habits, lifestyle and family history, two (or three in they were very discordant) blood pressure measurements, weight and height of the students, a sample of urine and a sample of saliva to extract DNA. Genotyping: On the basis of our previous genetic studies carried out in adult patients with hypertension and cardiovascular and renal related diseases, 15 SNPs located in 13 candidate genes have been selected: rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs4343 in ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme), rs4961 in ADD1 (alpha-adducin), rs4984 in ADD2 (beta-adducin), rs3731566 in ADD3 (gamma-adducin), rs11638442 in CYP11A1 (cytochrome P450 family 11 subfamily A member 1), rs1799998 in CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase), rs2236780, rs6203 and rs10923835 in HSD3B1 genetic region, rs9536314 in KL, rs2254524 in LSS, rs4149601 in neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4-like, NEDD4L (E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase), PRKG1 (protein kinase, rs1904694 in cGMP-dependent, type I), rs4238595 in UMOD (uromodulin). Analysis of Urines: Na+, K+, albumin, and creatinine were measured on a first fasting morning urine sample. The Kawasaki formula was used to estimate 24-hour urinary sodium (24h UNa) excretion expressed as mEq/24 h. In a subgroup a urine spot sample for each student will be immediately frozen for protein analysis. Investigators plan to measure simultaneously IL1β, IL6, IL10, IL12p70, TNF-α, MCP1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein), PTX3 (pentraxin-3) by ELISA test using LXSAHM Human Magnetic Luminex Screening Assay. Soluble α- Klotho, 8-Oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine will be measured by Elisa kit assay. Nitric oxide (NO) was measured by the colorimetric Nitric Oxide Assay kit. Advanced Oxidation Protein Products will be measured using the colorimetric OxiSelect Advanced Oxidation Protein Products Assay Kit."

Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroid patients have a thyroid hormone deficiency characterized by a shortage of thyroid hormone (TH) in the circulation and at the organ level and are normally treated with a synthetic form of thyroid hormone (L-T4 or levothyroxine). Thyroxine (T4) is a prohormone, produced by the thyroid gland and converted into the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. A minor percentage (20%) of circulating T3 is directly produced by the thyroid gland. Although L-T4 treatment accounts for all patients with hypothyroidism, the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism differs. Most patients suffer from primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), which is an auto-immune disorder, but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease are commonly seen. Currently, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are measured in serum to monitor the treatment efficacy of L-T4. TSH is produced by the pituitary to stimulate the production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland and due to the negative feedback loop considered as a good reflection of thyroid hormone status. Target concentrations of TSH and fT4 differ depending on the cause of hypothyroidism. In patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, TSH concentrations are measured to monitor treatment and TSH levels within the reference intervals are pursued. TSH is measured to monitor treatment in patients with hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma as well, although a suppressed TSH is warranted in this group. The extent of TSH suppression is determined based on the type and stage of the carcinoma. In patients who are hypothyroid due to therapy of Graves' disease, other target values apply. Patients who are just diagnosed with Graves' disease start with thyroid suppressive therapy together with thyroid hormone supplementation (L-T4) and show a prolonged suppressed TSH; therefore, fT4 is initially used to monitor therapy. TSH is used to monitor treatment again when TSH starts to normalize. Nevertheless, TSH shall always be slightly suppressed due to the TSH receptor antibodies produced during Graves' disease, which means fT4 concentration is still taken into account during follow-up. Finally, it is not possible to monitor treatment by using TSH concentrations in patients with central hypothyroidism, which means fT4 concentrations are leading in this group. In conclusion, TSH cannot always be used to assess thyroid function in which cases fT4 is assessed as well. It is known that patients using L-T4 can show a combination of fT4 values above the upper reference limit and non-suppressed or only slightly suppressed TSH levels. The most likely explanation for this is twofold. First, thyroid hormones are supplemented by L-T4, which only replaces T4, whereas the production of the active thyroid hormone T3 by the thyroid gland is lacking and the patients depend on peripheral conversion of T4. Literature showed that these patients need a higher L-T4 dosage to obtain a normal, or even somewhat lower, concentration of T3. TSH is regulated by changes in T3 rather than T4, clarifying the lack of pituitary feedback to increased fT4 concentrations if fT3 concentrations are not increased simultaneously. Second, previous studies showed that fT4 levels peak two until four hours after L-T4 intake and gradually decline until the next dosage is taken. Sometimes, this peak increases above the upper limit of the reference interval. This pattern is not seen for TSH levels. Looking at aforementioned outcomes, it seems that fT4 levels are higher in patients using L-T4 compared to healthy controls, thus not reflecting thyroid hormone status adequately. In clinical practice, the largest group of hypothyroid patients are monitored by measuring TSH as mentioned above. Therefore, these high fT4 levels will only rarely cause problems. However, these high fT4 levels can have treatment consequences in patient groups wherein therapy is monitored via fT4 levels (e.g. central hypothyroidism), which could lead to unwarranted dose adjustments (leading to a too low dose of L-T4)."

The purpose of this study is to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, a physiological CTV will be generated for each patient in addition to the standard CTV. Treatment for each patient will be according to the current standard in which the standard CTV is used. Initial analysis will include comparing both CTVs in terms of volume and location. Patient follow-up will occur according to the clinical standard, including the standard MRI scan protocols, for a maximum of 2 years. Pattern-of-failure analysis will be done to compare the standard CTV and physiological CTV. It is hypothesized that the physiological CTV will be smaller than the standard CTV, whilst having the same pattern-of-failure."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in systemic sclerosis (SSc) patients treated by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) and to compare it to SSc patients who did not undergo AHSCT.
SSc is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. AHSCT is a treatment that can be proposed to SSc patients with severe organ involvement. AHSCT is associated with a high risk of infections, including COVID-19.
The investigators hypothesize that SSc patients treated by AHSCT are at higher risk of COVID-19 infection and have a lower humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than SSc patients who did not undergo AHSCT.
The investigators will compare the cumulative incidence of asymptomatic or symptomatic COVID-19 infection after AHSCT as compared to non AHSCT SSc patients. They will also assess the proportion of SSc patients who refused vaccination during the study period, the cumulative incidence of symptomatic COVID-19 infection in SSc patients previously treated by AHSCT and in non-transplant controls, the time of onset of first COVID-19 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic) diagnosed during the study period after completing at least 2 vaccines injections in SSc patients previously treated by AHSCT and in non-transplant controls, the severity of symptomatic COVID-19, the proportion of SSc patients with at least 1 grade≥3 adverse event after COVID19 vaccination, and the humoral response in SSc patients treated by AHSCT and in controls after messenger RiboNucleic Acid (mRNA) vaccine against SARS-CoV."

Background: Improving diet quality is an essential component for the treatment of adolescent obesity. Pediatric providers are recommended to incorporate nutrition recommendations as part of adolescent obesity treatment, but time and knowledge are barriers. Digital-based interventions have been shown to improve fruit and vegetable intake in adolescents. However, it is unknown if a digital-based diet quality intervention is feasible or effective for adolescents with overweight or obesity. Objectives: (primary and important secondary objectives) The overarching objective of this pilot study is to demonstrate if a digital-based diet quality intervention for adolescents with overweight or obesity is feasible and if there is preliminary effectiveness that diet quality and meal timing traits improves as assessed by 24-hr dietary recalls, a novel urine biomarker, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Study Design: A two-arm pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) falling under the preparation phase of the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) framework. Setting/Participants: This is a single site study. Adolescents (N=14, aged 14-17 years) at risk for diet quality that is low or in need of improvement (Healthy Eating Index (HEI) < 80) and with a history of having overweight or obesity (body mass index (BMI) between the 85th and 99th percentile on at least two occasions six months apart in the medical record in the last five years) will be invited to participate. Clinical measurements will be acquired at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP). Diet, urine, blood glucose, physical activity, and sleep data collection will take place in the home setting. Study Interventions and Measures: Adolescents and their parents will be randomized to receive a) usual care or b) a nutrition intervention with personal goals, meal timing, nutrition skills, and home food environment intervention components. The content for each component will be delivered through text messaging. Three 24-hr dietary recalls and the first morning urine void on two separate occasions will be collected at baseline and follow-up. HEI-2020 scores will be calculated and change in HEI-2020 will be the primary outcome. The urine Na:K will be quantified and change in Na:K will be the secondary outcome."

A diagnosis of cancer reverberates throughout the family. Family caregivers take on a wide range of responsibilities, such as monitoring medical symptoms, communicating with the patient's medical team, managing insurance claims, providing transportation, and assisting with activities of daily living. Psychological distress is common. Caregivers often feel unprepared for their role, and socially isolated from others. Physical impacts have also been documented, from fatigue to sleep disturbance to immune dysfunction. To alleviate some of these difficult sequelae of cancer caregiving, we propose to test the utility of a brief, low-cost, non-pharmacologic, behavioral intervention for persons providing care for a loved one with cancer. Specifically, we will test the effects of an expressive writing (EW) intervention. The basic paradigm asks participants to write for 20 minutes on four separate occasions about a trauma or stressor. Initial work conducted with undergraduate samples showed benefit of EW. Since then, EW studies have been conducted across a variety of populations including persons coping with chronic illness. Benefits have ranged from better lung function among asthmatics to fewer physical symptoms among women with breast cancer. One meta-analysis of 146 studies across 10,994 participants reported positive effect sizes (mental or physical health benefits) for 102 of the studies (70%). Notable gaps in this literature include testing with cancer caregivers (with some exceptions) and use of novel delivery formats. Specific aims are: (1) To examine the effects of a group-based, videoconference-delivered EW program on emotional, social, and physical well-being among informal caregivers of persons diagnosed with cancer; (2) To identify social and linguistic mechanisms by which participation in the group-based EW intervention may improve distress; and (3) To identify potential moderators of benefit including age, gender identity, relationship to the patient, and baseline social constraints."

This is a prospective, randomized, controlled single-surgeon trial performed at the University of California San Francisco that investigates the use of IV TXA in patients undergoing Gender Affirming Mastectomy. All patients who meet WPATH guidelines for GAM, undergo GAM, ASA I-III, and are >18 years old will have the opportunity to be enrolled. Patients will be randomized by a random computer generator and will be notified after randomization as to which group they are assigned. The investigators will enroll patients into this prospective trial investigating the effect of IV TXA on postoperative bleeding, hematoma, seroma, drain output, and time to drain removal. Patients will be randomized into two groups, an experimental group receiving IV TXA and a control group that will not receive IV TXA. Patients will be excluded if they are <18 years old, have a history of prior chest surgeries, coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, and have a history of thromboembolic events including deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. Patients will also be excluded if they are chronically anticoagulated, are on antiplatelet medications or have ever had an adverse reaction to IV TXA. All patients who are being scheduled to undergo bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction will be recruited to participate in the study. Patients will be consented to participate in the preoperative visit. Experimental Group: Patients in the experimental group will receive a loading dose of tranexamic acid (TXA) at a concentration of 1g/10ml over a period of 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Postoperative care will be standard and based on established UCSF guidelines. Control Group: Patients in the control group will not receive any TXA intraoperatively and will undergo a traditional GAM. Tranexamic Acid is available as a sterile, single-dose. This 1g vial is readily available in the anesthesia cart in the operating room. Immediately following induction, the anesthesia team will administer 1g of TXA intravenously. After obtaining hemostasis and irrigating as per standard practice, anesthesia shall not use any other hemostatic agents. Post-procedure, each patient will be provided with standard postoperative instructions which will include a chart to record daily drain outputs for the right and left sides. At subsequent postoperative visits, drain output will be assessed at each clinic visit to determine timing for removal. The total drain output will be measured by the patient and later logged into our chart for later analysis. Drains will be removed per standard practice at our institution which is when they have produced < 30cc/day for at least 3 days. At each clinic visit, the investigators will assess for clinical signs of hematoma and seroma, and objectively measure aggregate drain output. Demographic data, surgical characteristics, and postoperative outcomes such as hematoma, seroma, drain output, wound complications, surgical site infections, and thromboembolic events will be recorded and analyzed. These outcomes will be evaluated in the immediate 3-month postoperative period, with a 1-year follow-up review of patient charts. The primary outcomes will include the presence of hematoma, seroma, and drain output, and time to drain removal, while the secondary outcomes will consist of thromboembolic events and wound complications. Patients will be managed for hematoma and seroma as per standard procedure, whether with ultrasound, clinic aspiration, IR drain placement, or return to the operating room as deemed necessary by the senior surgeon."

Sudden smell loss (SL), a hallmark feature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-coV-2/COVID), frequently persists well past the initial recovery; rates of unresolved anosmia (total loss) are 21%, with unresolved hyposmia (reduced smell) or parosmia (distorted smell) higher at nearly 50%. SL is now recognized as a core symptom of long COVID (LC), which also includes other impairments in mood, cognition, and sleep. Given that SL itself can negatively impact many of the same problems being recognized in the symptomatology of LC, it is likely that SL is both a symptom of LC and a contributing factor that worsens other LC symptoms. As such, successful treatment of SL could also help to improve these other LC symptoms. Smell/olfactory training (ST) is currently being studied as a treatment for COVID-related SL. Classic ST requires twice daily practice of sniffing odorants over the course of 3 months to regenerate olfactory neurons, engage smell-related cognitive functions, and retrain the brain to smell. ST is promising as a stand-alone treatment. However, its limitations include the burden of many months of daily practice that often leads to sub-optimal compliance and dropout. The current study aims to determine whether the benefits of ST can be accelerated and enhanced by using a novel, adjunct neuromodulatory intervention to conventional ST. Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) is a non-invasive, pain-free, method of neuromodulation that delivers low levels of electrical stimulation to the trigeminal circuit, having potential to enhance smell function through activation of the highly connected olfactory-intranasal trigeminal brain circuits. Prior work demonstrated TNS-enhanced psychophysical detection of odorants. Yet the effects of TNS are extensive, i.e. improved executive functioning (e.g. attention), sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness, as well as therapeutic efficacy across a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, TNS-as an adjunct to ST-may not only improve overall efficacy and speed of recovery of SL, but may help to treat some of the other symptoms of LC that ST, and improvement in smell function, may not fully resolve. This randomized, controlled trial (RCT) of ST and combination TNS and ST in adults with COVID-related SL will use a 3- group design: Group 1) Active ST (N=60), Group 2) Placebo ST (PBO, N=60), and Group 3) Active TNS plus Active ST (N=60). Our primary objectives are to 1) determine the efficacy of ST versus potential natural gains in function, 2) determine the TNS-enhanced effects of ST on SL, and 3) determine whether TNS+ST is more efficacious than ST in treating the other symptoms of LC."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP) in preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. PCAP is a three-year, intensive case management intervention for pregnant and postpartum individuals who have used substances during their current or most recent pregnancy. PCAP provides mothers with a case manager with whom they meet biweekly, in the home or in other community settings. Case managers coach mothers in setting their own goals and taking steps to achieve them, provide practical assistance, serve as role models, and offer emotional support and encouragement. They connect mothers to community resources and recovery supports tailored to the participant's needs and goals. On average, case managers carry a caseload of 16 mothers/families, receive at least biweekly individual clinical supervision by a master's-level clinician, biweekly group supervision, and individual consultation with their supervisor whenever needed. Case managers work with the mother and the child with prenatal substance exposure and other family members in support of the participant's goals and recovery. This project seeks to evaluate a one-year version of PCAP (PCAP-1), aligned with the time frame of the FFPSA federal matching funds for prevention programs with evidence of effectiveness for purposes of prevention of the need for foster care and promotion of reunification. The specific objectives of this project are to: Establish causal evidence of effectiveness of PCAP-1 in preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification Establish causal evidence of the effectiveness of PCAP-1 in achieving other key goals: (a) Parent achieves and stays in recovery, (b) Parent accesses comprehensive services to meet needs to achieve and maintain a healthy family life, and (c) Subsequent substance-exposed pregnancies are prevented. Estimate cost savings associated with PCAP-1 from the perspective of the agency administering a state's child welfare system. Lay the groundwork to be rated by relevant federal registries according to strength of the program's evidence of effectiveness for purposes of sustainability, spread, and replication. In 2021, PCAP and a rigorous randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the benefits of the program was implemented in Oklahoma. Two Oklahoma sites began enrolling clients in late 2022. Each site will enroll 100 participants, randomly assigned to the experimental groups: treatment and control (services as usual). The project proposed herein will complement the ongoing RCT but offers the important additional benefit of adapting and extending PCAP to a third study site and evaluating a one-year version of PCAP. This adaptation is important because client and case manager mindsets and priorities may be very different when faced with a one-year time frame rather than a three-year time frame. Furthermore, a one-year version of PCAP is more consistent with the Adoption and Safe Families Act timelines for permanency hearings to start to establish the permanency plan for a child in foster care. Using the recruitment strategies described above, 40 eligible people will be recruited into PCAP-1 at a third PCAP site. The one-year intervention will take place over the three-year project period, with enrollment into PCAP-1 occurring on a rolling basis over the first two years of this study. Two case managers will each be assigned 20 PCAP-1 participants over the study period to avoid the n=1 confounding problem. This quasi-experimental design incorporates a control group to compare one-year outcomes with the PCAP-1 participants. The approximately 40 people making up the control group will come from the original PCAP study. As such, all control group participants are placed in that group based on random assignment in the original, ongoing trial, while all new referrals for PCAP-1 will receive PCAP-1 services. The control group will complete the same surveys, and at the same time period, as the PCAP-1 participants for direct comparisons between groups. This will involve adding a new data collection period for current control participants in the original trial. Although the control group is enrolled in a three-year study, their experiences during the first year likely suffice as a suitable control group for the proposed study, particularly as recruitment strategies and study eligibility are the same in both studies. The control group will be matched with the PCAP-1 treatment group based on characteristics such as age, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. The long- and short-form Addiction Severity Index (ASI) and the investigator-created Self-Administered Survey (SAS) will capture outcome data about individuals in both the PCAP-1 and control groups.

Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects 1 in 54 children in the United States. Autism is characterized by social communication deficits, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. Autism is a lifelong disorder that affects the individual's ability to function in daily life. The prevalence of autism is higher in Hispanic/Latino children than in non-Hispanic/Latino children. Hispanic/Latino children are also less likely to receive early intervention services, which can result in poorer outcomes, decreased quality of life, and increased parental and financial stress. Many autism interventions were developed and tested with only White participants, assuming they could be transferable to minority populations. However, research has found that this is not the case and that interventions that are not adapted to an individual's culture and ethnicity do not work as well and are not used as frequently. In this project, we compare two methods of stakeholder engagement, Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG), to determine which is better at getting input on the facilitators and barriers to access therapy for autistic children. We focus on Hispanics and Latinos as this is the largest minority group in the US, with one of the fastest-growing groups of autistic children. Our long-term objective is to improve the functional skills and health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and their families by improving access to an occupational therapy intervention designed to improve daily living skills, socialization, and quality of life. Occupational therapy using Ayres Sensory Integration (OT/ASI) is the only evidence-based intervention that addresses the sensory symptoms in autism. We will use input from these engagement sessions to adapt two versions of the OT/ASI manual: one using DT data and the other using FG data. Outcomes are evaluated following each step. Following the completion of this project, the planned outputs of the study are data on the most effective minority stakeholder engagement method and a culturally adapted OT/ASI manual for Hispanic and Latino autistic children for clinicians and researchers. This information can support future researchers who are engaging Hispanic/Latino individuals or other minority groups in research. Methods: A randomized mixed methods design is used to evaluate stakeholder engagement methods. Phase one will compare two stakeholder engagement methods (Design Thinking -DT, and Focus Group - FG) and evaluate stakeholder engagement based on the PCORI areas of stakeholder engagement which are operationalized in the Stakeholder-Centric Engagement Evaluation and qualitative data. Phase two utilizes data from phase one to culturally adapt the intervention (two separate intervention protocols will be adapted - one based on FG data and another based on DT data as described below), and obtain stakeholder input on acceptability and feasibility for the Hispanic/Latino autistic population. This provides a second way to measure the effectiveness of each stakeholder engagement method as we will have data to indicate which method (DT or FG) resulted in the highest-rated protocol. The data provided by this study will be used as a basis for a later comparative effectiveness study that will study the culturally adapted protocol's outcomes. All sessions will be held in Spanish and/or English based on the groups' preferences. Since our intent is to hear the voices of Hispanic/Latino stakeholders, it seems valuable to hold focus groups in Spanish when the participants are Spanish as first language speakers (hereafter referred to as Spanish-first) with audio recordings and later transcription into English for analysis. To accommodate those who prefer English, we will make every effort to group these participants together. When, and if, the Spanish-first groups include participants who prefer English, we will have a Spanish to English translator available. In other words, we will be respectful of each participant's language to optimize their comfort in the engagement sessions. This project addresses an urgent need to engage stakeholders as part of the research process from conceptualization to dissemination and the need for culturally sensitive evidence-based interventions for Hispanic/Latino autistic children. This project is being developed by a skilled and experienced team of investigators."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different harm reduction products (Nicotine Pouch and ENDS) as a second line intervention for adult smokers who do not quit with NRT.
The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will be a 4-week run-in period where all participants will be provided with NRT (Nicoderm patch, Nicorette gum, and Nicorette lozenge) to use as needed. Participants will be instructed to use the NRT as directed in the product label. Participants will be asked to complete a daily diary to record their NRT use. Participants will also be asked to complete a weekly survey to report their smoking behavior.
The second phase of the study will be a 5-week intervention period. Participants who successfully quit smoking during the run-in period will be randomized to continue using their current NRT or switch to one of the other two options (Nicotine Pouch or ENDS). Participants who were unsuccessful in quitting smoking during the run-in period will be randomized to switch to one of the other two options (Nicotine Pouch or ENDS). Participants will be instructed to use the assigned product as needed. Participants will be asked to complete a daily diary to record their product use. Participants will also be asked to complete a weekly survey to report their smoking behavior.
The primary outcome measure is the change in expired air CO at week 10 compared to baseline. The secondary outcome measures include complete smoking abstinence rates for NRT non-responders and smoking abstinence rates for NRT non-responders."

The flipped learning model offers students and faculty members the opportunity to teach a course other than the traditional one. It is a blended teaching method in which the activities carried out in the classroom are integrated outside the classroom and the teaching activities carried out outside the classroom are integrated into the classroom. In this model, students can access videos, presentations or recordings prepared as course materials before coming to class, through technological devices such as computers, tablets and smartphones. Students have the opportunity to watch and listen to the prepared course content wherever and whenever they want, as many times as they want. Watching as many resources as they want according to their own learning speed brings about effective and easy learning. Afterwards, when the student comes to the classroom, the information learned is reinforced by the instructor, and the areas that are not understood are solved with questions and answers. Lesson hours for students who take an active role in the classroom are also important in terms of using time effectively. The student is at the center of this learning method and the student assumes individual learning responsibility. Considering nursing education within the scope of all these beneficial results, it is obvious that effective learning will be achieved. This study aimed to help students easily adapt to the principles of asepsis. Videos containing the principles of asepsis will be presented to the experimental group students 2 weeks before the infection control course (11/11/2023). Normal lecture and practice periods will begin between (11/11/2023-12/12/2023) and the education will last 4 weeks in total. When the study period ends, students will be given a knowledge test and then again 2 weeks later. The implementation period of the study will last until 20/12/2023. Control group students will be educated only during the normal course. The research will be conducted with first-year students of Bilecik Şeyh Edebali University Nursing Department."

Appalachians die more frequently and at younger ages from obesity-related conditions than those living elsewhere. High prevalence of overweight, obesity, and extreme obesity in Appalachian children increases the severity of diabetes. In rural Appalachia, the diabetes mortality rate is 11% higher than the national rate. Over the course of two years, this study will test the effects of the Mentored Planning to be Active + Family intervention on physical activity outcomes (MVPA, exercise bouts, sedentary behavior) and health outcomes (body composition: BMI, body fat, % body fat, weight) among rural Appalachian 7/8th grade children suffering from overweight and obesity. Having teens deliver the content via structured peer mentoring increases social support, motivation, and self-regulation to sustain PA behaviors to improve health outcomes as children enter high school. Using local residents for intervention delivery leverages rural Appalachians' preference to receive health information via established social networks and extends delivery of the program into the community. This study is a community-based randomized controlled trial targeting 7th grade students in rural Appalachia. Half (n = 144) will receive MPBA+F; the other half (n = 144) will receive self-guided (usual care) modules. Tenth-grade (n = 73) students from the same rural Appalachian counties will serve as peer mentors delivering MPBA for the peer mentoring group. Parents will provide a family reinforcement program during 8th grade and provide assessments of child behaviors and health outcomes. The long-term goal is to reduce the high rates of OW, OB/EO and type 2 diabetes in Appalachia youth through effective, sustainable interventions. Improving self-regulation, self-efficacy, and social support to increase intentional exercise and MVPA among underserved youth suffering from early-onset OB/EO builds healthier lifestyle behaviors at a critical development time."

Spatial neglect (SN) is a common and disabling condition after right brain stroke. SN is a form of brain damage that causes people to ignore or be unaware of objects and events on the left side of space. SN is a major cause of functional disability after right brain stroke, and is associated with increased risk of falls, longer hospital stays, and increased caregiver burden. Despite the high prevalence of SN, there is no standardized approach to SN rehabilitation. The investigators have developed a treatment called prism adaptation therapy (PAT) that is effective for SN. However, the investigators do not know who will benefit most from PAT. The investigators will use brain imaging and behavioral measures to identify people who are most likely to benefit from PAT. The investigators will then test whether the brain imaging and behavioral measures can predict who will benefit most from PAT.

The investigators want to start a pilot study of liquid biopsy in patients with brain lesions compatible with a glioma-like tumor. The main aim of the study is to analyze the blood samples obtained from these patients in order to detect and quantify the circulating DNA (ctDNA) of tumor cells on it. These DNA fragments are expelled into the bloodstream by mechanisms still unknown as a result of numerous processes of apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells. By analyzing them through a ddPCR, the investigators will try to detect the specific mutations present in this tumoral ctDNA, allowing the team to confirm the presence of a glioma-type tumor, and providing real-time information of its classification as astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma."

The scientific literature points to the beneficial properties of probiotics in the process of regulating metabolism, yet at the same time, some scientific papers question the effectiveness and the safety of probiotics. In turn, postbiotics and metabiotics are preparations of inanimate microorganisms and / or their components, which are directly identified with the safety of their use and the health benefits of the host. Due to the chemical structure of postbiotics and metabiotics, it is found that they have many health benefits; in particular, they have a local effect on certain tissues of the intestinal epithelium, and influence on many other organs and tissues. It is postbiotics metabolites and metabiotic structural cell fragments that create the appearance of a therapeutic effect of probiotics, which, in turn, limits the risk of introducing living microorganisms into a weakened immune defence. It should also be pointed out that postbiotics and metabiotics are more stable and have a longer shelf-life. The practical use of probiotics and the study of the mechanism of their action made lately to find that a certain level of biological activity is preserved by dead probiotic cells and even their lysates, which are the natural mixes of metabiotic and postbiotic substances; a biological activity which is strongly oriented toward gut health and immune system regulation. Because probiotic lysates demonstrated biological activity without any of the potential adverse side effects associated with live bacterial cells, one of the future goal is research of the novel postbiotics and metabiotics substances, their individual structures and biological characteristics for understanding their way of communications with host cells and microbiota representatives. Considering the high biological activity and safety of postbiotics and metabiotic substances, it can be concluded that such a treatment vector will be promising in the near future. That's why our investigation will concentrate on postbiotic, a supplement containing dry fermented cell lysate and DNA fragments of the probiotic strain L. rhamnosus DV - NRRLB-68023. Recent scientific animal studies on the stated issues point to the benefits of some postbiotics in treating metabolic disorders. TThe current study aim was to conduct placebo-controlled randomize clinical trial to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of postbiotics on hepatic fat content as measured by MRI-PDFF and ultrasonography, transaminases activity, biochemichal hepatic steatosis indeces and chronic systemic inflammatory markers in NAFLD patients. The study will include 3 periods. Screening period of up to 1 weeks to assess the eligibility to inclusion/exclusion criteria. Treatment period for 3 month where the participants will receive a twice daily oral dose of postbiotics (cell lysate and DNA fragments of the probiotic strain L. rhamnosus DV - NRRLB-68023) at the assigned dose of 100mg or placebo in capsules. All capsules will be identical with similar organoleptic characteristics (e.g., taste and appearance).. Follow-up period of up to 3 month. The pre-randomization period will be designed to minimize the effects of dietary changes on metabolic markers. For this purpose, 2 weeks before the study start, after inform consent signed, patients were instructed in one-on-one sessions with a dietitian to follow a therapeutic lifestyle-change diet as classiﬁed by the NCEP. In addition, participants were instructed to continue with stable anti-hyperglycemic treatment and received standardized mild physical training for 1 hour per day. Patients who underwent the study were instructed to take the trial medication as prescribed. Throughout the study, weekly phone follow-up visits were provided for assessment of compliance, adherence to the protocol, as well as the recording of adverse events. The effectiveness of therapy was compared and evaluated separately in the two groups."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that affects red blood cells. People with SCD have red blood cells that are crescent-shaped instead of round. These red blood cells can get stuck in small blood vessels, which can cause pain. Sickle cell crises are episodes of pain that can last for hours or days. The pain can be severe and can happen in different parts of the body.

The purpose of this study is to see if virtual reality (VR) can help reduce pain in children and young adults with sickle cell disease who are having a sickle cell crisis. VR is a technology that uses a headset to create a virtual world. The study will compare the use of VR with standard medical therapy to standard medical therapy alone.

Participants will be children and young adults ages 6 to 21 years with sickle cell disease who are having a sickle cell crisis. They will be asked to complete a questionnaire about their pain and how it affects their daily life. They will also be asked to rate their pain on a scale of 0 to 10.

Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The first group will receive standard medical therapy alone. The second group will receive standard medical therapy plus VR. The VR group will be given a VR headset with guided meditation software. They will be asked to use the VR headset for 30 minutes.

The study will last for 1 year. Participants will be followed for 1 year to see if VR helps reduce pain and improve quality of life."

The main purpose of this project is to investigate the accuracy of pocket-sized ultrasound (PsUS) in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures. The primary research objective is to determine the test performance characteristics of PSUS performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians compared to radiography for the detection of pediatric elbow fractures. The project will consist of two parts, first involving a feasibility study and followed by an active study. This project will consist of two parts, involving first a brief feasibility phase followed by a pilot study conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department (Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago, IL). For the feasibility phase, the purpose is to demonstrate that novice PsUS users are able to obtain accurate and adequate imaging for interpretation. This phase will initially involve the study providers receiving the elbow PsUS exam training. Once trained, each study provider will obtain 3 elbow exams of participants between the ages of 1-16 years old. Providers will use the standardized views reviewed in the ultrasound training to perform the exam, with verbal consent obtained from each participant's parent for inclusion in the feasibility study. These images will be reviewed by study staff to ensure US examiners are obtaining the correct standardized views. Once the feasibility exams are completed, the study providers are able to begin active study recruitment which will involve recruiting children between the ages of 1-16 years old with isolated acute elbow pain. Parents will initially be approached in the emergency department (ED), with written consent obtained if interested and eligible. Once consented, patients will undergo bilaterally standardized elbow exams using the pocket-sized ultrasound. All images will be stored on a password protected, cloud-based imaging database with all identifying information removed. After the exam, a basic assessment of the images will be made by the bedside ultrasound provider, as positive, negative or equivocal for signs of elbow fracture, but before reviewing any radiographic imaging. A positive PsUS will be defined as the presence of signs of elbow fracture, either as direct signs including cortical discontinuities or indirect signs including posterior fat pad with or without lipohemarthrosis on ultrasound exam. Following the ultrasound exam, patients will undergo standard clinical care for acute elbow injury per primary ED team which may consist of Xray or possible bedside nursemaid reduction. When applicable, study investigators will review the final blinded radiology readings of the initial or subsequent x-ray images after the patient encounter. Additionally, research staff will also attempt to follow up with participants after their ED visit for their elbow injury to determine if any additional radiographic imaging or care was obtained and if subsequent occult fractures were discovered on later imaging that may have been missed on the initial evaluation. The primary aim of the feasibility portion of the study is to determine acceptability of the PsUS study training to obtain adequate elbow images. The primary aim of the active study is to compare the initial test performance characteristics of PSUS performed by bedside physicians compared to standard radiography in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures."

Hallux valgus is a common foot deformity that affects the big toe. It is a progressive disease that causes pain and discomfort in the foot. The aim of this study is to compare the effects of two different orthoses on individuals with hallux valgus. The two orthoses to be used in the study are the toe separator orthosis and the dynamic orthosis. The study will be conducted on 30 individuals with mild to moderate hallux valgus deformity. The individuals will be randomly divided into two groups: those using the toe separator orthosis and those using the dynamic orthosis. Foot pressure analysis after the participants use the toe separation orthosis and dynamic orthosis for 1 month will be evaluated. Pressure analysis evaluation will be performed 3 times; before using the orthosis, when first wearing the orthosis, and 1 month after using the orthosis. Individuals participating in the study must first sign the informed consent form. Individuals who agree to participate in the study will fill out the socio-demographic evaluation form. According to the Manchester Scale, the individual's hallux valgus deformity will be classified according to its severity. Hallux valgus angle measurement will be made with a goniometer. In order to understand the effect of deformity on individuals, the Foot Function Index Evaluation Form will be filled out by individuals. For the pain, function and alignment evaluation of individuals, the evaluation form prepared by the American Orthopedic Foot-Ankle Society (AOFAS) will be answered by individuals. The Manchester-Oxford foot questionnaire will be administered to assess standing, walking and quality of life. The orthoses to be used during the study will be randomly distributed to the individuals participating in the study. Plantar pressure analysis will be performed without orthosis, with orthosis and 1 month after the use of orthosis. At the end of the 1-month period during which individuals use the orthoses, patient orthosis satisfaction will be evaluated. Socio-Demographic evaluation will include physical evaluations such as individuals' name, surname, age, weight and body mass index. For social evaluation, individuals' education level, profession and job status will be asked. Questions that are important for the research are included in the socio-demographic evaluation. For this study, individuals will be asked about their shoe choice, average number of steps per day, average standing time per day, presence of hallux valgus, and presence of hallux valgus in the family. Additionally, the foot will be evaluated and the presence of pes planus will be examined. It is a scale developed by Garrow to classify hallux valgus deformity. It deals with hallux valgus deformity at 4 levels; none (1), mild (2), moderate (3), severe (4). The classification is evaluated by comparing 4 different photographs containing the hallux valgus deformity between individuals with the deformity. A universal standard goniometer will be used to measure the hallux valgus angle. To measure the hallux valgus angle, the pivot part of the goniometer is placed in the 1st Metatarsophalangeal joint. One arm of the goniometer is placed parallel to the 1st Metatarsal bone and the other arm is parallel to the proximal phalanx, the angle between them is measured and the hallux valgus angle is found. Hallux valgus angle is classified as normal (<15°), mild (15-20°), moderate (20°-40°) and severe (>40°). Foot function index is a widely used form that can be filled out by the person himself, developed to measure the effects of foot pathologies on pain, disability and activity limitation. Foot function index is used in research on children, adults and older adults to determine the effectiveness of treatment for various foot and ankle problems such as congenital, acute and chronic diseases and injuries, as well as after surgical interventions or orthosis use. Foot function index; It consists of 23 items with 3 subgroups: pain, disability and activity limitation. While the nine-item pain subscale measures the level of foot pain in various situations, the 9-item disability subscale determines the degree of difficulty in performing various functional activities due to foot problems. With the activity limitation subscale, which includes five items, activity limitations due to foot problems are evaluated.Foot function index is a widely used form that can be filled out by the person himself, developed to measure the effects of foot pathologies on pain, disability and activity limitation.

Gambling addiction has often been conceptualized as the result of reward processing dysfunction in the brain, particularly in the striatum, a key structure of the reward system. Although a number of studies have provided support for this hypothesis, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction. The investigators will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively. The investigators will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of Ophiochepalus striatus extract on serum IGF-1 and IL-6 levels in elderly patients with sarcopenia.
Sarcopenia is a syndrome characterized by the loss of muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance. It is a common problem in the elderly.
Ophiochepalus striatus is a plant that has been used in traditional medicine for centuries. It is known to have anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties.
In this study, the investigators will recruit 30 elderly patients with sarcopenia. They will be randomly assigned to receive either Ophiochepalus striatus extract or placebo for 14 days.
The investigators will measure the serum IGF-1 and IL-6 levels, muscle mass, muscle strength and physical performance before and after the treatment.
The investigators hypothesize that Ophiochepalus striatus extract will increase serum IGF-1 levels and decrease serum IL-6 levels in elderly patients with sarcopenia."

Background: Non-purulent cellulitis is a bacterial skin and soft tissue infection of the subcutaneous tissue. Group A streptococcus (Streptococcus pyogenes), beta-hemolytic streptococci and methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacteria causing non-purulent cellulitis. Patients typically present to the emergency department (ED) with pain, redness, swelling and induration (skin hardening due to inflammation) of the affected skin. A minority of patients may have fever or tachycardia. The diagnosis of cellulitis is clinical. Once the diagnosis is made, antibiotic treatment is initiated. The emergency physician must select the appropriate agent, oral versus intravenous (IV) route, dose, frequency and duration. Rationale: For ED adult patients with cellulitis, how does high-dose (1000 mg) cephalexin compare with standard-dose (500 mg) cephalexin with respect to antibiotic treatment failure, adverse events and health service utilization (i.e., need for IV antibiotics, unscheduled return ED visits and hospitalization)? Hypotheses: Treatment with high-dose cephalexin will lead to lower rates of oral antibiotic treatment failure than using standard-dose cephalexin. Methods: Study Design & Setting: The investigators will conduct a multicentre, parallel-arm double-blind, individually randomized trial comparing high-dose (1000 mg) cephalexin to standard-dose (500 mg) cephalexin to treat ED adult patients with cellulitis. This is a superiority trial. The trial will be conducted at 8 Canadian EDs. A total sample size of 446 patients (223 per group) will be required. Study Population: Inclusion Criteria: The Investigators will include adults (age ≥18 years) diagnosed with non-purulent cellulitis and determined by the treating emergency physician to be eligible for outpatient oral antibiotics. Trial Intervention: The study interventions are two accepted doses of oral cephalexin. The interventions will begin following randomization. High-dose cephalexin: Patients randomized to this arm will receive a seven-day medication package of cephalexin 1000 mg (two 500 mg tablets per dose) to be taken four times daily. A duration of seven days was selected as this was the most common prescription duration in a survey of Canadian emergency physicians.32 The antibiotic pills will be provided in a dosette organized by dose and day. Standard-dose cephalexin: Patients randomized to this arm will receive a seven-day medication package of cephalexin 500 mg (one 500 mg tablet and one placebo tablet per dose) to be taken four times daily. Blinding: Both cephalexin and placebo will be encased in identical capsules, prepared and packaged independently by an external pharmacy. The patients, treating physician and research team (including outcome adjudicators) will be blinded. Primary Outcome: Oral Antibiotic Treatment Failure: The primary outcome is outpatient oral antibiotic treatment failure, defined as a change in antibiotic (change in class of oral antibiotic or step up to IV therapy) within 7 days due to worsening infection. Secondary Outcomes: Clinical cure, defined as absence of treatment failure criteria, evaluated at day 8 and 30 Clinical response, defined as a reduction in lesion size ≥20% compared to baseline, evaluated at the day 3 and day 8 follow-up assessments Unplanned visits to a healthcare provider (ED, family doctor) within 30 days Unplanned hospitalization within 30 days. Adverse events will be classified as serious or other and will be assessed at day 30 follow up. Serious adverse events will include anaphylaxis to study medication, development of Clostridium difficile colitis or unexpected deaths related to the infection or treatment. Other adverse events include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and rash. Antibiotic intolerance, defined as change in treatment due to adverse events. Antibiotic allergy, defined as change in treatment due to skin, respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal symptoms requiring treatment with an antihistamine and/or"

The purpose of this study is to compare the amount and type of biofilm on zirconia versus titanium implants. The study will be carried out in the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology of the Faculty of Dentistry of the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain). The study will be carried out in accordance with the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki and will be conducted under the approval of the Clinical Trials Committee of the Hospital Clínico San Carlos of Madrid. The selection of subjects with indication for osseointegrated implant placement will be based on a previous oral and radiological examination by means of a periapical radiograph and a panoramic radiograph and/or Cone Beam Computed Tomography , together with the completion of a clinical questionnaire. For implant placement, a linear incision of the edentulous ridge and an intrasulcular incision of the adjacent teeth will be made using a #15 scalpel blade and a #3 Bard Parker scalpel handle. Once this is done, a full-thickness flap will be raised and the alveolar ridge will be reamed, following the manufacturer's indications, to place a titanium implant (Phibo® Aurea Evolution) of adequate dimensions in the control group or a zirconia implant (Z system®) in the test group, checking that there is an adequate insertion torque of 30Ncm or more and a cover screw will be placed. Once the implant is in place, simple stitches with supramid monofilament 4/0 suture (Proclinic®) will be placed until the wound is closed. Finally, antibiotic treatment (Amoxicillin 750mg/8hours/7 days), analgesic and anti-inflammatory (Dexketoprofen 25mg/8hours/5 days and Metamizole 575mg/8hours/if pain persists) will be prescribed to all patients. Physical anti-inflammatory measures (intermittent local icing for at least 30 minutes) and salt and water rinses 3 times a day for 7 days will be prescribed. Three months after implant placement in the mandible and four months in the maxilla, the final screw-retained metal-ceramic crown will be loaded with a transepithelial abutment made of titanium for titanium implants or zirconia for zirconia implants. Study visits In both groups, paper-tip samples will be taken from the peri-implant sulcus before the placement of the final crown (basal visit), at 6 months (visit 2) and 1 year (visit 3), to perform a culture of the type and quantity of bacteria present in the placed implants. The survival of the placed implants, the probing depth of the implants, the bleeding on probing of the implants, the plaque index of the implants and the amount of keratinized gingiva from the midpoint of the vestibular gingival margin to the mucogingival line on the day of crown placement will also be evaluated at 6 and 12 months. Finally, after final crown placement, a periapical radiograph with parallelizer will be taken and repeated at 6 and 12 months to evaluate marginal bone loss, mesial and distal to the implant, using Vistasoft® 3.0.22/2023 software, calibrating the image with the length of the implant, since its dimension will be known. Sample size: Because the data to be analyzed do not coincide with data reflected in studies analyzing biofilm accumulation on the surface of zirconia versus titanium implants, we will conduct a pilot study with 30 subjects (15 in each group), so as to ensure robustness of the results. Based on these results, means and variances, we will perform a sample size calculation for future more comprehensive investigations. Randomization: The randomization of this clinical trial will be carried out before the start of the study using the block method, to ensure a periodic balance in the number of subjects assigned to each intervention group and to guarantee the equality of the sample size in the two groups being compared, for this purpose 6 blocks of 5 subjects each will be used. The computer application IBM® SPSS Statistics version 28.0.1.1 and the macro RNDSEQ will be used for this purpose. The sequence of intervention assignment will be ignored by the data examiner and by the surgeon"

Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing fast access in transactions, ease of use and sometimes a status indicator, can pose a risk for addiction when used uncontrolled. Smartphone addiction, although not yet clearly defined; It can manifest itself with symptoms such as constantly checking the phone, feeling restless when staying away, withdrawing, mood changes, not being able to control the duration of use, disruption in daily life due to problematic use, constant desire to use and pleasure from use. According to the behavioral approach, if a person takes pleasure from a behavior or avoids negative emotions with this behavior, this situation turns into a habit in the individual. Uncontrollable and frequently repetitive habits carry a risk for addiction. Smartphone addiction, in addition to being a behavioral disorder, can cause many physical, social and psychological problems. Problematic use of the smartphone; decrease in sleep duration and quality, height, wrist, thumb and shoulder pain , dry eye syndrome, and eye fatigue, decreased physical activity, as well as depression, social phobia, loneliness, and decreased academic performance can bring along many psychological and social problems. It can be said that poor sleep quality is one of the primary problems that may occur in the problematic use of the smartphone, and it negatively affects both daily life and the health of the individual. Especially at night and in the pre-sleep period, the use of smartphones adversely affects sleep quality as it causes arousal due to the blue light it emits, shortens the sleep duration and disrupts the circadian rhythm. A study stated that exposure to blue light 1 hour before sleep reduces the duration of deep sleep and causes sleep quality to deteriorate. Another study stated that leaving smartphones out of the bedroom improved sleep quality. It is stated that poor sleep quality negatively affects the individual physically and psychologically, causes performance losses and increases the risk of accidents. In studies conducted with students, it was stated that poor sleep quality negatively affects academic performance, while good sleep quality increases academic performance. A study conducted with adolescents stated that poor sleep quality was associated with low self-esteem and increased levels of anxiety and depression. Nurses, who serve almost all of the society, have an important role in defining risky health behaviors and planning and implementing appropriate interventions for behavior change. For this reason, nurses need to make an effort to find the most appropriate behavior change approaches for the individual. Today, the Transtheoretic Model (TTM) is widely used to improve the behavior change process in the individual and to achieve the most effective health behavior change. TTM, which aims at the initiative suitable for the change phase of the individual, is used as a guide that facilitates behavior change. TTM is a cognitive-behavioral model that accepts that any behavioral change in an individual does not happen all at once, but that behavior change includes different stages and processes. The model, which was first used in smoking cessation programs, was later used in many areas such as exercise, sun protection, reducing the amount of excess fat in the diet, weight control, condom use, supporting mammography screening, widespread drug use, coping with stress and quitting substance abuse. Traditional behaviorist approaches; In this model, change focuses on helping individuals willingly make behavioral change and understanding the change process. In other words, it does not classify individuals only according to whether they can perform a certain behavior, but also according to the stages passed in the behavior change process. While TTM creates a roadmap in change, there are also approaches that contribute to and accelerate this change and support the individual who thinks about change. One of these approaches, which is used more frequently in addicted individuals, is the motivational interview method. Motivational interviewing is very effective in gaining positive health behaviors and changing negative health behaviors and can be an effective communication technique for nurses in providing behavior change. Motivational interviewing as defined by Miller; It is a client-centered interview form in which suggestions are made to provide behavior change by helping individuals discover and solve their problems. In motivational interviewing, the expert is the consultant, but the consultant does not assume the role of the knower, is not ready before the"

Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects the face and is characterized by erythema, telangiectasia, papules, and pustules. The pathogenesis of rosacea is not fully understood, but it is believed to be multifactorial, involving genetic, environmental, and microbial factors. The treatment of rosacea is based on the severity of the disease and the presence of specific symptoms. The first-line treatment is topical therapy with metronidazole or azelaic acid. In more severe cases, oral antibiotics are used. Laser therapy is also used in the treatment of rosacea, especially for the reduction of erythema and telangiectasia. The most commonly used laser is the potassium-titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser, which emits a wavelength of 532 nm and is absorbed by hemoglobin and melanin. The KTP laser is effective in reducing erythema and telangiectasia, but it does not have a significant effect on papules and pustules. Ivermectin is a drug that is used in the treatment of parasitic infections, but it has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties. Ivermectin has been used in the treatment of rosacea, but its efficacy has not been fully evaluated. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of KTP laser therapy alone versus KTP laser therapy combined with ivermectin 1% cream in the treatment of facial erythematous rosacea or mild papulopustular rosacea with permanent erythema. The study will be conducted as a randomized split-face trial. The participants will be treated with KTP laser therapy on one side of the face and with KTP laser therapy combined with ivermectin 1% cream on the other side of the face. The efficacy of the treatments will be assessed by clinical evaluation and patient-reported outcomes."

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of different NMES protocols applied to the triceps surae muscle for evoked torque, muscle fatigue, sensory discomfort, and peripheral oxygen extraction. The effects of the types of neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) protocols on the aforementioned outcomes will be evaluated in the same participant by randomizing the sequences of interventions for each visit in the laboratory. The study is considered double-blind, as individuals will not know the sequence of the protocols applied. The evaluator will also not know which protocol will be used at the time of the intervention. It will consist of a total of 5 sessions with seven days between them. In the first session, anthropometry, the maximum intensity level for each electrical stimulation protocol as well as the protocol sequence for each individual will be evaluated. From the second to the fifth session, the following will be considered: voluntary and evoked maximum joint torque of the triceps surae muscle, muscle fatigue through the evaluation of the H-reflex, M-wave, fatigue index, torque-time-integral and recruitment curve, peripheral oxygen extraction, electromyographic signals through RMS (root mean square) and median frequency, and level of sensory discomfort with the Visual Analog Scale (VAS).

The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of FitnessGenes' platform, with a follow-up after 3 months, on the health and wellbeing of NHS staff. The study will assess changes in subjects' well-being, as evaluated by the 5-item World Health Organisation Well-being Index (WHO-5). The investigators will adopt a repeated measures analysis, collecting raw WHO-5 scores from the same subjects at three discrete time points: baseline (i.e. before genetic analysis), 3 weeks after receiving genetic results and at 3 months after baseline. The investigators will also assess the internal consistency of the WHO-5 by performing a Cronbach's alpha test at the three time points. To assess changes in well-being, raw WHO-5 scores (ranging from 0 to 25) will be multiplied by 4 and transformed into final scores of 0 - 100 for each subject. Descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) will be calculated for the 5 individual items of the WHO-5 and the final WHO-5 scores (0-100). The main dependent variable to be evaluated will be the final WHO-5 Score (ranging from 0-100). The investigators will use repeated measures analysis to assess changes in mean final WHO-5 score across the three different time points. Briefly, the investigators will assess the distributions of the WHO-5 scores and perform basic tests of normality (including Q-Q plot and performing a Shapiro-Wilkes test) and sphericity/equal variances (Mauchly's test). Depending on the distributions of this data, the investigators will select the appropriate statistical test to assess changes in mean final WHO-5 score. Assuming normality and sphericity of data and no outliers, the investigators will perform a repeated measures (within-subjects) ANOVA to assess whether the mean final WHO-5 score is statistically significantly different across the three time points. Post-hoc tests will include paired T-tests to make pairwise comparisons in mean final WHO-5 score between the time points, with P-values adjusted using the Bonferroni multiple testing correction method. Depending on the demographic make-up of the subjects, the investigators may include other moderator variables (e.g. gender) to assess for interactions with time point. If the assumptions behind these parametric tests are violated, a non-parametric alternative (e.g. Friedmans test) will be used to assess changes in mean WHO-5 score. All statistical analysis will be performed using R. Repeated measures analysis will be used to evaluate the secondary outcomes related to user experience and perceptions of genetic testing."

Multiple Sclerosis is the most common cause of neurologic chronic disability in young adults. Fatigue is one of the principal symptom in this disease. Fatigue in a subject with MS is present every day, gets worse as the day progresses, with the heat and humidity, it is sudden and more severe than normal, it interferes with physical performance. Fatigue is prevalent in the MS population and is a significant health problem, negatively impacting activities of daily living, ability to work, social life and quality of life. In 1963 it was demonstrated how mechanical vibration, applied to a single muscle, at suitable amplitudes and frequencies, was capable of selectively and differentially activating primary (Ia), secondary (IIb) or GTO spindle afferents, depending on the characteristics of the stimulus. So with appropriate frequencies and amplitude of vibration, it is possible both to select the activated afferents, and to determine the frequency of action potentials sent to the Central Nervous System. The purpose of this study is to verify how the use of vibrations can induce positive effects on the mobility and postural control of patients with MS, as well as reduce fatigue. The study is an interventional type. The subjects are undergoing to baseline examinations (T0) including 3D gait analysis (using a BTS system), stabilometric analysis, and a battery of neuropsychological assessments. Subsequently, eligible subjects are undergoing to intensive multidisciplinary training for a total of 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks, with a total of 20 treatment sessions. The experimental group receive additional vibration treatment. At the end of the treatment cycle (T1), the patients will undergo the same evaluation tests as at baseline. The Clinical and instrumental exams used for this study (as per normal clinical practice) are: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), Borg Scale, Medical Research Council Scale (MRC), 6 minutes walking test. The Psychological Assessment Battery used are: Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54) scale, Beck Depression Inventory-II, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE). Sample size: The sample consist of patients with MS admitted to the C.A.R.E.N. or Casazza facilities of the IRCCS Centro Neurolesi Bonino-Pulejo in Messina. Twenty eligible subjects recruited and treated with traditional rehabilitation approach plus vibrational therapy. The results will be compared to those obtained from a group of 20 patients who have undergone a traditional rehabilitation treatment without the application of vibrations and who will represent the control group. A descriptive analysis of the two groups will be performed for clinical and socio-demographic variables. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be applied to assess the distribution of variables. Subsequently, continuous variables will be expressed as mean±sd or median and I-III quartile, while categorical variables in frequency and percentages. An intra-group analysis will be carried out to compare both clinical and instrumental scores between T0 and T1 in each group using either T-Student or Wilcoxon for paired data, and a Pearson correlation or Spearman rank correlation to evaluate the relationship between clinical scales and instrumental data. The inter-group analysis will be applied to compare both clinical and instrumental scores between the groups at T0 and T1 using either a parametric test (T-Student for unpaired data) or a non-parametric test (U-Mann Whitney). The analysis will be performed using the open-source software R3.0. A confidence interval of 95% with a 5% alpha error will be considered. Statistical significance will be set at p<0.05.

There are important unresolved challenges on a diagnostic level and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of sFGR have not been fully clarified. The current diagnostic classification system based on three different umbilical artery flow patterns has no increasing scale of severity and the observed flow patterns may be volatile in nature. This hinders optimal diagnostic management and complicates outcome prediction as the survival outcome differs per umbilical artery flow type. Consequently, parents encounter a great deal of uncertainty during the pregnancy. Since there is no treatment available for sFGR, predicting fetal deterioration is key in preventing single or double demise. By testing several predictors, the investigators are aiming to improve outcome prediction at the time of sFGR diagnosis. The investigators furthermore hypothesize that additional ultrasound parameters could be of benefit in making the current classification system more accurate and less variable. Extensive histological placental examinations will shine a light on microscopic abnormalities which can increase our knowledge of the pathophysiology. Examining neurodevelopment of sFGR twins at two years of age will additionally be of great value for our understanding of the impact of sFGR and contribute to adequate patient counselling. Our study will evaluate the impact of a sFGR pregnancy on parental mental health and parent-to-infant(s) attachment, which has not been carried out this extensively before."

The purpose of this study is to develop and test a digital platform for transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth and their caregivers. The platform will provide educational modules and interactive features to improve mental health outcomes and reduce suicidal ideation. The study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, we will conduct a needs assessment to identify the educational needs of TGD youth and their caregivers. In Phase 2, we will develop and test the digital platform. The study will be conducted in two arms: an Immediate Access Arm and a Deferred Access Arm. Participants in the Immediate Access Arm will have access to the digital platform immediately after enrollment. Participants in the Deferred Access Arm will have access to the digital platform at 6 months. Both arms will receive usual care, which includes access to published resources and community support organizations, if available. The study will be conducted over 18 months, with assessments at baseline and every 3 months thereafter. The primary outcome is the change in suicidal ideation, as measured by the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Secondary outcomes include changes in depression, anxiety, perceived family acceptance, family communication and acceptance, and self-harm. We anticipate at least 80% retention across 12 mo of follow-up. This will allow us to detect a reduction in suicidal ideation (primary outcome) from 40% at baseline to 26.3% or lower at 12-mo follow-up, as well as changes in the rate of psychological distress and anxiety (secondary outcome). We will also assess changes in perceptions of caregiver support and communication, as these are key mechanisms by which we propose to improve mental health outcomes. Data analysis will be performed according to intention to treat."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on fronto-striatal resting state functional connectivity in healthy individuals. The study will use a randomized, sham-controlled, crossover design to assess the effects of tFUS on the brain's reward network.

The study will include 20 healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 65. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: an active tFUS group or a sham tFUS group. The active tFUS group will receive two 10-minute sessions of active tFUS targeting the nucleus accumbens (NAC), while the sham tFUS group will receive two 10-minute sessions of sham tFUS. The order of the active and sham tFUS sessions will be counterbalanced across participants.

The study will use resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) to assess the effects of tFUS on the brain's reward network. rsFC is a statistical dependence between time series of electro-physiological activity and (de)oxygenated blood levels in distinct regions of the brain. Functional connectivity strength calculation determines whether the activity between a pair of brain regions covaries or correlates over time. We will investigate the strength of the functional connectivity between the stimulation target (Nucleus Accumbens) and connected areas, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and sensory areas of the brain at baseline, and then will determine whether tFUS increases or decreases the resting-state connectivity between these regions after the NAC has been stimulated.

The study will also use a behavioral task to assess the effects of tFUS on reward processing. Participants will complete a monetary incentive delay (MID) task, which involves making choices between immediate and delayed rewards. The task will be administered before and after the tFUS sessions.

The study will be conducted in the MRI scanner, and participants will be monitored for any adverse effects of tFUS."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the biological basis of the observed stroke reduction with semaglutide by demonstrating semaglutide can improve intracranial blood flow condition and reduce bloodbrain barrier (BBB) permeability. Our working hypothesis is that it is known that semaglutide has beneficial effects on T2D, therefore, it improves endothelial function for a better cerebral flow condition. However, semaglutide may also improve cerebral flow independently from glucose lowering. Together, the improved cerebral flow condition results in stroke reduction. In order to investigate the independent effects of semaglutide on intracranial blood flow condition and BBB permeability, we will have a designated diabetes care specialist unblinded to the study randomization to carry out glucose management to achieve HbA1C<7.5% for both treatment groups."

Depression is the leading mental health contributor to the Global Burden of Disease. The World Health Organization's mhGAP initiative advocates the use of brief psychological therapies such as behavioral activation or antidepressant medications as first-line options for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in primary care settings, but not all patients will fully remit on either treatment. It is likely that different patients will respond to different treatments, but the optimal treatment for each individual remains unknown (and which patients are unlikely to respond to either treatment and should be referred to specialist care). Enhancing our ability to determine the optimal intervention for a particular patient has the potential to enhance the overall effectiveness of mental health care delivery in a more cost-efficient manner. This is a critical gap in knowledge in the treatment of depression across clinical settings globally. The main objective of the OptimizeD study is to determine whether different patients respond differentially to brief psychological treatment or a widely used generic SSRI and, if so, whether one can optimize outcomes in a cost-effective fashion for primary care patients with moderate to severe depression. The study has two specific aims and two exploratory aims: Specific Aim 1 (Clinical and Functional Outcomes): To evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a precision treatment rule (PTR) on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either psychotherapy based on behavioral activation called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) or antidepressant medication (fluoxetine). The study will use machine learning to develop the PTR, using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not. Specific Aim 2 (Cost-effectiveness Outcomes): To assess the costs of optimal vs. non-optimal treatments and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing relative costs and effectiveness between those who were randomly allocated to their optimal treatment with those who were randomly allocated to a non-optimal treatment, based on the PTR developed in Aim 1. The investigators hypothesize that optimizing will be more cost-effective than not. Exploratory Aim 1 (Mediators): To explore whether one can use the PTR to make our tests of mediation more precise. Patients who respond differentially to different treatments adhere to different causal mechanisms, and inclusion of the PTR in interaction terms with the purported mediators should facilitate the detection of moderated mediation among patients who show specificity of response. The investigators will also consider whether treatment-related factors (e.g., adherence, quality) act as mediators of the effects of each treatment on remission and recovery. This exploratory aim will offer insights into mechanisms of action for each treatment. Exploratory Aim 2 (Genetic Predictors): To explore whether polygenic risk scores and other biomarkers can enhance the prediction of both general and differential response to either treatment."

The purpose of this protocol is to determine the frequency and the mapping of unstable coronary plaques highlighted by 18F-Na PET in patients at intermediate and high risk, as well as their evolution under treatment. Aside from traditional risk factors collection and related biological assessments, risk establishment is based on calcium score, a simple non-injected and very little irradiating scanner which measures coronary calcifications, stigmata of healed atheroma plaques and, as a rule, non-evolving. Calcium score, which is interpreted according to age, sex and ethnicity, therefore makes it possible to assign a percentile within the distribution of all the patients and to classify patients in: Group I: absence of atheromatous plaques: Score 0 Group II: patients generating few plaques (low risk): calcium score above zero and classifying the patient below the 40th percentile of a similar population; Group III: patients generating moderate plaques (intermediate risk) with a calcium score classifying the patient equal or above the 40th percentile and less than the 65th percentile; Group IV: patients generating a lot of plaques (high risk): calcium score classifying the patient equal or above the 65th percentile. These are more likely to be patients who will come from the cardiology / check-up sector because of a higher probability of symptoms or of already being treated for primary prevention. Study assumptions are: apart from any hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis, the instability of a plaque can lead to symptomatic but transient micro-thrombotic phenomena which are spontaneously (or under the effect of an anti-aggregation/anticoagulation) resorbable. Regardless of this plaque fate (most frequently scarring, with calcifications, or much more rarely inaugural acute coronary syndrome and therefore infarction), it is a major coronary event which must switch the patient from primary prevention to secondary prevention. On painful thoracic syndromes that are sufficiently suggestive to require immediately to rule out an acute coronary syndrome or secondarily myocardial ischemia (angina), identifying a rapid progression of the coronary involvement (on the basis of calcium score) or the direct demonstration of plaque instability (by 18F-Na coupled with a CT scan) is a major cardiovascular prevention endpoint. In patients consulting for this clinical presentation, determining the frequency of those with rapid coronary evolution and/or instability of coronary plaque(s) represents a fundamental preliminary epidemiological study to modify prevention approach of primary coronary artery disease. The evaluation by non-invasive coronary imaging of secondary prevention treatment impact on these same patients initially diagnosed as rapidly progressive and/or unstable would make it possible to consolidate this strategy if it proves to be effective on the basis of plaque images and clinical follow-up (in terms of events)."

The overall aim is to study how different pathological mechanisms in cerebral SVD influence WMH shape. Primary objective: To study the association of a more complex WMH shape with abnormalities in small vessel morphology. Secondary objectives: To study the association between WMH shape and cognition/other cerebral small vessel disease markers. To study the association of novel MRI markers of glymphatics with cerebral SVD markers and cognition. Study design: Cross-sectional study that will be conducted at the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). Patients will be included from the memory/geriatric clinic that are over 65 years of age. The study contains 3T and 7T MRI scans, as well as neuropsychological assessments. The data will be analyzed by performing association analysis. Study population: Patients of the memory/geriatric clinic that are over 65 years of age. Main study parameter/endpoint: In order to postulate underlying mechanisms related to WMH shape variations the investigators will study the association between a more complex WMH shape and structural and functional markers of cerebral SVD (such as lacunes and microbleeds). WMH shape is assessed as follows: Convexity, solidity, concavity index, and fractal dimension are calculated for periventricular/confluent WMH. A lower convexity and solidity, and higher concavity index and fractal dimension indicate a more irregular shape of periventricular/confluent WMH. For deep WMH, fractal dimension and eccentricity are determined. A higher eccentricity and fractal dimension indicate a more complex shape of deep WMH. Other study parameters: The investigators want to investigate WMH shape parameters and the association with cognition (mini-mental state exam, clinical dementia rating and cognitive domain scores). Another endpoint is to investigate if different WMH phenotypes can be identified (by machine learning models). Moreover, the association between SVD markers/cognition and novel glymphatics markers (such as size of perivascular spaces, CSF mobility and 4th ventricle CSF flow dynamics) will be investigated. Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group relatedness: The participants will not directly benefit from the results of the study. However, their contribution to the study will add important information about the pathophysiology of the cerebrovascular pathology that contributes to dementia. Therefore, it is not possible to study the research question in a different population group. The ultra-high field 7T MRI system is widely used in a research setting and since its first introduction in the 1990s no serious adverse events have been reported. Important temporary side-effects are vertigo, nausea and involuntary eye motion due to forces on ion currents in the semicircular loops. As all MRI scans are performed within a maximum of 60 minutes and without any contrast agents, the participant burden is seen as a non-substantial burden."

The power of music to raise the spirits and to heal the soul should not be underestimated. There is growing recognition of the significance of music as a complementary treatment in palliative care, which is reflected in the growing body of scientific literature on the subject and in the popularly of music therapy among palliative care patients themselves. Palliative care describes the holistic approach in the treatment of patients with advanced or incurable diseases, such as terminal cancer. In addition to conventional medical and nursing care, critical psychological, social and spiritual support is provided in palliative care. To this end, an interdisciplinary team of doctors, nursing staff, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers, psycho-oncologists, chaplains and music therapists is involved. Music therapy is defined as the systematic use of music within a therapeutic relationship which aims at restoring, maintaining and furthering emotional, physical and mental health. The aim of music therapy in palliative care, in contrast, is to relieve symptoms of distress and improve quality of life among patients in the advanced stages of oncological disease. In Germany, national oncological guidelines currently recommend music therapy as a treatment option to alleviate anxiety and existential fear. Music therapy encompasses both active and receptive techniques. Active techniques involve the patient in the production of music, such that they sing or play a musical instrument, possibly making planned gifts of songs to loved ones or for memorial services, whereas receptive techniques guide the patient in listening to music, both prerecorded as well as performed for them live. In cancer patients, the focus is placed primarily on music-assisted relaxation, generation of imagery, songs and improvisation. This heterogeneity of approach studied in the literature on music therapy precludes an understanding of precisely what aspects of music therapy are most beneficial. Despite a diversity of approach, findings are promising, which in itself may be an indication as to whether the whole of music therapy is perhaps greater than the sum of its parts. To practice music therapy according to the standards of evidence-based medicine, it is necessary to specify the intervention performed as well as the musical instrument(s) used. Moderators such as individual patient preferences and experience with music also may play an appreciable role; however, these are rarely systematically investigated. Music therapy is conventionally administered by a trained music therapist and individual therapy sessions typically last 20 minutes. Training backgrounds of therapists vary, whereby in the United States a bachelor's degree in music therapy is the minimum requirement and board certification must follow in order for professional practice. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of music therapy in palliative care patients. An emerging body of scientific literature in this clinical population suggests that music therapy may alleviate physical pain as well as psychological, social and emotional suffering. Spiritual needs may particularly benefit from music therapy. Furthermore, a meta-analysis could show significant positive effects of music therapy on psychological well-being, physical symptoms and overall quality of life. Music therapy may favour various routine overarching themes in palliative care as well, such as pain management, relaxation, joy, hope, intensified spirituality and improved quality of life and may reduce anxiety and depression. Music therapy may outperform verbal exercises in inducing relaxation and reducing fatigue but not pain. Despite the generally promising findings suggesting a benefit to psychological well-being assessed by subjective methods (e.g., visual analog scales, questionnaires, etc.) there is scant evidence derived from experiments utilizing objective outcome measures (e.g., autonomic response, etc.) with rigorous study design to support the efficacy of music therapy. Findings derived from autonomic data suggest a benefit of music therapy characterized by increased parasympathetic tone accompanying improved subjective ratings of relaxation. Boosted high-frequency heart rate (HR) oscillations coincided with subjective relaxation score from visual analog scale after music therapy. In addition, blood volume pulse amplitude (BVP-A) was increased from baseline to post-therapy, indicating heightened vascular dilation due to greater parasympathetic activation, although just below the threshold of statistical significance (p = 0.07). In another analysis in the same sample, during music therapy higher levels of parasympathetically-mediated HR variability (HRV) were observed. Resting HR and blood pressure (BP) were reduced, whereas relaxation, comfort and happiness were increased. Increases in distal body temperature was observed in a sample of individuals undergoing chemotherapy. Anxiety related to chemotherapy was reduced by music therapy in this sample. The present study seeks to assess differences in feasibility and acceptability of music therapy played live and listening to a recording thereof at the palliative care ward of the University Hospital Zurich.

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a serious mental illness with a high mortality rate. The pathogenesis of AN is complex and multifactorial, and the current treatment is not satisfactory. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is closely related to the core symptoms of AN, and the abnormal functional connectivity of ACC is the neuropathological mechanism for the onset of AN. The purpose of this study is to explore the efficacy and safety of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) targeting ACC in the treatment of adult AN. A randomized controlled study design was adopted, in which patients with AN were divided into the dTMS treatment group and the pseudo-stimulation group by 1:1 randomization, followed by 6-week intervention and half-year follow up, to clarify the near-term and long-term efficacy and safety of the dTMS treatment. Psychometric and fMRI examinations are performed at baseline in both groups. The rest of the time follow-up of symptoms and psychometrics and side-effects questionnaires are performed at week 2, 4, and 6 (during treatment) as well as at week 4, 12, and 24 ( after completion of treatment). Meanwhile, baseline fMRI data were extracted and combined with clinical features to establish an efficacy prediction model. We will explore factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group, divided into two groups according to whether dTMS was effective or not at the end of treatment (week 6) (effective is defined as BMI increasing by ≥1.2 kg/m2 at the end of treatment), using pre-treatment (baseline) demographic information, psychological assessment questionnaires, and neuroimaging data in the two groups. This will provide theoretical and practical basis for the pioneering ACC-targeted dTMS treatment in China, helping to establish a new type of intervention program for AN, with expected results of innovation."

Background: Two landmark trials have led to the FDA approval of two different CD19 directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell (CAR19) products in the United States for the treatment of relapsed or refractory (RR) large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy: tisagenlecleucel (Kymriah™) and axicabtagene ciloleucel (Yescarta ®). In the ZUMA-1 registration trial for axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel), 42% of the 101 treated patients achieved a complete response (CR), and with a median follow up of 15 months, the projected 1year progression free survival (PFS) was 70%. In a recent updated analysis, the CR rate was 58% with about 40% of patients having durable remissions at 2 years of follow up. Similar results were seen in the JULIET registrational trial for tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel) with an overall response rate (ORR) of 52%, and a CR rate of 40% in the 93 patients evaluable for response; with a median follow up of 14 months, the estimated 12-months relapse-free survival was 65% (79% among patients with a CR). Tisagenlecleucel is also approved for the treatment of acute B-lineage lymphoblastic leukemia in patients up to the age of 25 years. Unfortunately, in both trials patients with known HIV infection were excluded. Therefore, no safety or efficacy data for treatment with CAR19 in PLWH exists, and access for PLWH in the US to this potentially curative treatment has been limited. This has to be contrasted with the fact that malignancies, and specifically lymphomas, remain a major contributor to early mortality in PLWH. With a lifetime risk of cancer ranging between 24-40%, the leading cause of death in PLWH in economically developed countries is cancer, and the most common cancer in PLWH in the US remains Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). While early during the HIV epidemic, outcomes for PLWH and aggressive B-cell lymphomas were significantly worse compared to immunocompetent patients, this is no longer the case for the majority of PLWH, owing mainly to effective antiretroviral therapies leading to better tolerance of myelosuppressive chemotherapy and a consequent paradigm shift in aggressive therapies for HIV-associated lymphoma. It has been repeatedly demonstrated that PLWH have been able to safely tolerate aggressive high-dose chemotherapy, as well as autologous and even allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant.

Objectives: The primary objective of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy of CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy in PLWH with B-cell lymphoid malignancies.

Eligibility: Patients with a history of HIV infection who received CD19-directed CAR T cell therapy for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, high-grade B-cell lymphoma, transformed follicular lymphoma, or primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma between August 30, 2017 and August 31, 2021 will be eligible for this study.

Design: This is an observational study. Patients will be followed for 12 months after CAR19 therapy.

Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is the rate of toxicities related to CAR19 therapy. Secondary outcome measures include the change in CD4 count, absolute lymphocyte count, HIV viral load, overall response, and complete remission."

This is a UK-based observational study that aims to discover novel predictive biomarkers with the potential to guide treatment decision making and prolong PFS and OS in patients with advanced TNBC. Patients will undergo a mandatory, study-specific core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour or metastasis before commencing their next line of therapy. The research sample will be run on Pear Bio's test whilst the patient receives therapy as per their physician's choice. This study will not use Pear Bio's tool to inform the choice of treatment, with the treating oncologist being blinded to the test results. Treatment response data will be collected at multiple timepoints to conduct analyses on the study's secondary and tertiary objectives. Fresh tissue resections that arrive at Pear Bio's lab will undergo processing, cell culture and various drug dosing and omics assays (depending on extracted cell numbers). Tumour samples will be processed using a cell isolation kit to retrieve a viable single-cell suspension. A minimum of 100,000 cells (10,000 viable cells per chip) will be used for staining with live and dead cell-tracking dyes. In parallel, blood vials will be processed for PBMCs and further effector cell extraction (flow cytometry, Dynabeads, etc). The remaining cells will be used for sequencing (DNA/RNA), fixed for immunofluorescence characterisation of biomarkers/receptor status or used for further omics assays (if cell numbers allow). This may include tumour mutational burden and microsatellite instability testing. The stained cells will be cultured in a biomimetic hydrogel within Pear Bio's organ-on-a-chip to provide a physiological 3D environment for drug dosing experiments. Using a microfluidic device, samples in each chip will be exposed to approved therapies (either as monotherapy or combination therapies, as outlined below) over multiple days. In parallel, PBMCs will be extracted from whole blood, characterised and sorted via flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic beads selection. Cells of interest (e.g. CD8+ T cells) will be used for culture in Pear Bio's chips jointly with cells isolated from the matched tumour sample. To test immunotherapies, tumour cells will be co-cultured with immune cells in a modified organ-on-a-chip architecture. Chips receiving immunotherapies may be tested for tumour mutational burden and/or microsatellite instability. Confocal microscopy will be conducted daily to collect 3D image data of the cells and track their position and behaviour over time. At the end of the assay, the 3D cell cultures will be fixed for further 3D immunofluorescence analyses or used for embedding, sectioning and assessment of spatial transcriptomics. For targeted therapies, RNAseq, IF and other omics data will be integrated to confirm drug MoA and identify other potential therapeutic targets. Concurrently, 3D image data is processed through a computer vision pipeline to measure functional metrics of the ex vivo 3D cell cultures, including cell viability, cell culture width and cell migration, both at a bulk tumour level and at a single-cell resolution. For immunotherapies, additional metrics such as immune cell infiltration and immune cell killing will be recorded. A patient report is then generated to outline an individual patient sample's response to each therapy tested."

In recent years, immune-based therapies have revolutionized the field of oncology by significantly improving survival of cancer patients. Despite sustained responses, only 20% to 40% of cancer patients respond. It has become clear that the immunosuppressive environment induced by tumor through cellular and/or soluble pathways critically contribute to hinder efficient antitumor immunity. The inhibition of these immunosuppressive networks thus represents an essential prerequisite for the improvement of responses to anticancer immunotherapies. Several immune cell populations have been identified as key actors of tumor-induced immunosuppression, among which are myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). However, in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the prognostic role of these cells, the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive functions, their non-immunological protumoral functions and their role in dampening the efficacy of immunotherapies in clinical practice are less characterized. The aim of this project is to better characterize the non immunologic functions of MDSC. We propose to assess in vitro the non-immunological pro-tumor functions of MDSC isolated from lung cancer patients."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the early wound healing after the utilization of NOVOSYN® Quick versus MONOSYN® Quick suture material in resective periodontal surgery.
The study is a randomized, monocentric, double blinded, prospective study.
The primary end point in order to evaluate the primary objective of the study will be the determination of early wound healing score (EHS) in patients undergoing resective periodontal surgery. The EHS will be evaluated in 3 parameters: clinical signs of re-epithelization (CSR), clinical signs of haemostasis (CSH), and clinical signs of inflammation (CSI). Zero, 3 or 6 points have been used to evaluate the CSR, whereas 0, 1, or 2 points have been used for both CSH and CSI (Table 3). The summation of these 3 parameters generated the EHS. The EHS for ideal wound healing was 10 points, while the worst possible score was 0 points. An EHS of 0 points was assigned in the presence of suppuration, independently of the ratings for the 3 single parameters.
The secondary end points include the incidence of postoperative wound dehiscence, dentinal hypersensitivity, oral candidiasis, angular cheilitis, swelling, bleeding, infection, systemic complications, pain assessment, satisfaction of the patient, bacterial contamination of the thread (optional), and assessment of the handling of the suture material.

The purpose of this pilot project is to identify the most common mutations in the AGXT gene and in the HOGA1 gene. The study population includes newborns whose parents wish to participate in the pilot project and have provided written informed consent. Parent information and consent Before screening is performed, the newborn's parents are comprehensively informed about the possibility of screening for the various diseases by the physician responsible for NBS (gynecologist, pediatrician). An additional information and consent sheet for cystinosis and PH screening is inserted into the information brochure already available for regular NBS. Consent must be documented with the signature of at least one parent and the signature of the informing physician on the consent form. The consent form for the pilot project also includes consent for the transfer of contact data and findings to a specialized center in the event of an abnormal screening result. The laboratory must receive the consent form for the project prior to analysis. Sampling The molecular genetic screening is performed using the same dried blood spot card as the routine NBS. In general, for all invalid results (i.e., if the control reaction fails) as well as all abnormal results (Cystinosis: homozygous or heterozygous for the 57-kb deletion and/or c.18_21delGACT, p.T7Ffs*7 ; PH1, c.508G>A, PH3, C700+5G>T, homozygous and/or heterozygous) the test will be internally repeated for confirmation using the existing blood sample. Measurements and methods A real-time quadruplex PCR is performed for the four mutations described above. Cystinosis: Detection is carried out by detection of the binding or by melting analysis of fluorescence-labeled probes. In samples with a positive result due to heterozygosity mutations, the exons of the cystinosin gene (CTNS) are sequenced using next generation sequencing (NBS) in an amplicon-based method. This ensures that only the desired exons and no other DNA areas are examined. DNA already extracted for real-time multiplex PCR can be used for NBS. With NEBNext Direct Genotyping Solution all analyzable areas of CTNS gene are covered (partial overlapping), which preserve a completely sequence information of all exons and specific introns. Therefore, the DNA will be enzymatically fragmented and then ligated with illuminable adaptors. The adaptors contain individual indices. Afterwards the biotin beads will be used for the target enrichment. They will be augmented with streptavidin beads. Afterwards off-target sequences will be removed, and the libraries will be amplified by PCR. The actual sequencing is carried out using a device from Illumina (MiniSeq). The sequences are evaluated using a software that performs an automatic comparison with a reference sequence, thereby detecting mutations. PH: The detection will be done through heat analysis with fluorescent tagged leads. In case of positive results (also due to heterozygotic constellations) a clarification is planned in collaboration with the German hyperoxaluria center. Therefore, spot urine will be tested for oxalate and further parameters in the glyoxylate metabolism. Examination results Cystinosis: If the most frequent mutations of CTNS are detected as homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations, the cystinosis screening is considered positive. Using next-generation sequencing, an additional 175 mutations recorded in the literature will be detected. In all other cases, even those involving heterozygous status, cystinosis screening is normal. PH: The hyperoxaluria screening is positive, if PH1 (AGXT-Gen:c508G>A) and/or PH3 (HOGA-gene: c.700+5G>T) is homozygote detected. In heterozygote genetic carrier with positive screening, a subsequent urine test performed in the Wisplinghoff laboratory in Cologne (Köln) will clarify the finding. Detection rate, false positive and false negative results An overall detection rate of above 95% is assumed for both diseases. False negative screening results are unlikely. For cystinosis, false negative results due to previously unknown rare mutations or patients carrying neither of the two most frequent mutations are possible. False positive screening results are also very unlikely. With cystinosis, a heterozygous sample due to allelic dropout (PCR failure of"

This study is a randomized controlled trial, double-blinded and performs in the patient who underwent intra-abdominal surgery. The investigators collect the data at the department of surgery, Ramathibodi hospital. This study randomized the volunteer patient into 2 groups as follow: the patient with placing negative pressure drainage within the surgical wound and the patient without placing negative pressure drainage. Randomization To minimize the study bias, the investigators random patient into two groups by the unassociated personnel opens an enclosed envelope after the surgical procedure is completely performed and before the beginning of closing the skin layer. Blind process This study does not conceal information about surgical technique and drain placing method. However, the investigators have controlled various surgical procedures to reduce inequality in assessment and bias. Negative pressure drainage is a drainage catheter which is placed in surgical wound for draining fluid such as hematoma, seroma, and pus. In this study the drainage the catheter will be placed in the wound for 5 days and/or removed if fluid content is less than 20 ml per day. Jackson-Pratt or Redivac catheter is used in this study because it is cheap and widespread in all hospitals. The drainage catheter is placed after completion of surgery and before skin closure. Surgical site infection (SSI) is infection at surgical wound which happens within 30 days post operatively and in this study will use in term of superficial SSI (pus oozing, cellulitis and wound culture positive) If patients have SSI, the investigators remove the drain from the patients (intervention group) and may total stitch off suture then wet dressing combine with antibiotic. the investigators evaluate and collect data by physical examination at post operation day 3, day 5,day 7 and the day that patient is discharged from hospital. Then investigators follow up the patients at 14 days and 30 days after discharged from hospital.The complication of SSI is seroma, hematoma and wound dehiscence. Seroma is the retention of clear fluid in the cavity of the body such as a surgical wound. Typical clinical presentation is fluid oozing from the wound. Hematoma is the retention of bloody fluid in the cavity of the body such as a surgical wound. It can be infected which is possible to prevent by stop bleeding intraoperatively and evaluate surgical wound every day. Wound dehiscence is partial or total separation of previously approximated wound edges, due to failure of proper wound healing. In patient case with infected wound and the investigators give antibiotics along with dressing, but does not stitch off suture, we do not include as SSI in this study."

The 3 FDA-approved CDK4, 6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemciclib, all provided progression-free survival benefits when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. But, not all of them provided overall survival benefit in the same setting. One of the proposed mechanisms that influence the overall survival difference is from the different influence of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors on tumor microenvironment and/ or immune system. However, there was no head-to-head comparison of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors in the same study. Neoadjuvant therapy provides a window to obtain tissue samples before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment. We aim to compare the immune modulation effects of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib with letrozole in neoadjuvant treatment for ER+/HER2- early breast cancer. We will collect tumor tissue, blood, and stool samples prospectively before treatment, at 2 weeks after treatment, and after 12 weeks of treatment at the time of surgery. Immune modulation effects will be compared between 3 treatment groups from breast tumor RNAseq analysis."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of Diosmin/Hesperidin combination on the clinical outcomes in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
PCOS is a common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo-ovulation and polycystic ovaries. The prevalence of PCOS is estimated to be 5-10% in women of reproductive age.
The pathogenesis of PCOS is multifactorial and includes insulin resistance, hyperandrogenism, and inflammation.
The treatment of PCOS is based on the use of oral contraceptives, metformin, and lifestyle modifications.
The investigators hypothesize that the addition of Diosmin/Hesperidin combination to the standard therapy will improve the clinical outcomes in patients with PCOS.
The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
The study will include 120 patients with PCOS.
The patients will be randomized to one of the following three groups:

The additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment after pancreatoduodenectomy is undetermined as previous research reported conflicting results regarding infectious complications. Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis (formally pre-emptive antibiotic treatment) after pancreatoduodenectomy might reduce the rate of surgical site infections in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile (predominantly patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy). Current national and international guidelines lack clear recommendations regarding pre-emptive antibiotic treatment leading to substantially varying antibiotic prophylactic regimes between institutes.

Objective: This trial evaluates the additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment on clinically relevant organ/space surgical site infections (OSIs) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile.

Study design: This multicenter, randomized controlled, superiority trial compares perioperative versus pre-emptive antibiotic treatment during five postoperative days after pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile.

Study population: Adult patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile (patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy). Patients with a contraindication for the study antibiotics or a preoperative indication for antibiotics (e.g. cholangitis of preoperative abscesses) are excluded.

Intervention: Participants will be randomized to either perioperative prophylaxis (cefazolin, metronidazole and a single dose of 5-7mg/kg gentamicin, control arm) or additional cefuroxime and metronidazole for five postoperative days (experimental arm).

Main study endpoints: The primary endpoint are organ/space infections (OSIs) within 90 days after surgery requiring a therapeutic intervention. Secondary endpoints are OSIs, isolated OSIs, wound infections, postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile or enteric anastomotic leakage, post pancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, major morbidity (Clavien-Dindo ≥III), reintervention, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, readmission, and in-hospital and 90-day mortality. Besides, switch of postoperative antibiotics, antibiotic sensitivity patterns and concordance between perioperative bile and postoperative surgical site cultures are analyzed.

Sample size: The sample size is calculated for superiority to achieve an OSI difference of 15% (40% vs 25%). With a 80% power (1-β) and a two-sided significance level (α) of 5.0%, a sample of 304 evaluable patients is required for superiority. Assuming a 3% non-resection rate due to metastatic disease and a 3% loss-of-follow-up rate, an expected number of 322 included patients are needed to reach the sample size of 304 evaluable patients to demonstrate superiority for the intervention."

Pragmatic trials stand in contrast to randomized controlled trials (RCT's), which instead examine causal relationships and are characterized by rigorous designs, featuring randomization, blinding and allocation concealment, to eliminate bias. Despite yielding results with high internal validity and statistical credibility, RCT's are not always generalizable to real life practice. Perhaps to address this, pragmatic trials are growing in popularity. Pragmatic trials aim to test interventions in routine clinical settings to maximize applicability and generalizability as well as to determine whether an intervention works under real life conditions. As a complement to our previous feasibility trial, the goal of this work is to understand the effectiveness of SEGT upon mental health outcomes among individuals with limb loss. Hence, the objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of a pragmatic trial using a SEGT intervention for addressing anxiety and depression for inpatients with limb loss. This two-arm pragmatic trial will evaluate if SEGT leads to better mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety) for inpatients with limb loss compared to those patients who receive treatment as usual (TAU). Over a 2 year period, 130 inpatients will be recruited for this trial, with 65 being assigned to the SEGT arm and 65 to a TAU condition who receive standard care only (which may include an individual psychiatric consultation). The proposed intervention is based on the evidence-based supportive-expressive (SEGT) approach and was designed by an interprofessional team from psychiatry, social work, physiatry and occupational therapy, along with patient advisors. The SEGT approach fosters mutual support, promotes openness and emotional expression. It has been shown to yield improvements in anxiety, psychosocial functioning, health literacy, and social support in breast cancer survivors. This SEGT approach has been modified, in both content and process, to specifically address the needs of limb loss inpatients. SEGT will be delivered and co-facilitated by either a psychiatrist and/or two allied healthcare professionals supervised by a psychiatrist on a rolling basis - which means it will be offered once a week, and participants may join the sessions at any time as the sessions will follow a similar framework over a six-modules. As infection control protocols allow, inpatient participants will participate in a large room setting at St. John's Rehab seated at least six feet apart and masked, with staff facilitators. SEGT groups will be capped to having 8 participants per session. If the pandemic conditions do not enable us to have an in-person group event, the investigators will explore delivering the intervention via Zoom onsite at St. John's Rehab (delivered by tablets), where patients can log in private rooms across St. John's Rehab to participate. The six sessions are based on a current inpatient psychosocial group therapy program being offered to their inpatients, and will be adapted by our investigation team (PI: Dr. Steinberg - Psychiatrist), and is based on a program being run at West Park Healthcare Centre for their limb loss patients. The sessions will involve facilitated discussion by two allied healthcare professionals or one psychiatrist and an allied healthcare professional, and will focus on guided discussions on coping with limb loss, managing sequelae associated with limb loss (e.g., pain), goal setting and strategies for community living. Based on participant interest, the investigators may also suggest exercises related to mindfulness and relaxation (e.g., breathing exercises, etc.). All activities are not physically strenuous and can be done sitting or standing (depending on participant preference and ability), and combine information sharing by the group facilitator as well as creating opportunities for group dialogue. It is hoped that SEGT will influence coping self-efficacy (a belief in one's ability to cope with post-traumatic stress demands, and affects various aspects of human functioning through four processes: cognitive, motivational, affective and environmental selection.). Self-efficacy is a modifiable construct, and is tied to positive outcomes (less pain, improved quality of life). Hence, in theory, if our patients develop higher levels of coping self-efficacy, they will be better equipped in preparing themselves for hospital discharge, will enhance their self-care and ability to correct maladapt"

Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide, despite major advancements in reperfusion therapies. While neuroimaging modalities have expanded patient eligibility for reperfusion therapies by estimating ischemic core and salvageable tissue, their assessments are mostly single-timed. Currently available clinical algorithms lack the capacity to continuously track the dynamic evolution of how the primary core progresses to a final infarct, which, however, is a major determinant of functional outcome. Monitoring infarct trajectories could support therapeutic decision-making in patients with large-vessel occlusion stroke and unveil determinants of stroke progression, aiding in patient selection for trials evaluating cytoprotection11 and targeting clinically ineffective reperfusion.12 Previously studied blood-based biomarkers such as Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL),13 neuron-specific enolase (NSE),14 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),15,16 and S 100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B)17 either failed to capture the extent of brain injury within the acute phase of stroke or lack specificity. Plasma levels of brain-derived tau (BD-tau) were recently found to show high value for monitoring brain injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke: In 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome.18 While informing on the relation of BD-tau with imaging-based metrics of brain injury, this large cross-sectional study was restricted to BD-tau assessments upon admission (median time from onset: 4.4 hours) and at day 2 (median time from onset: 22.7 hours) and could not inform on key characteristics of the evolution of plasma BD-tau, including when exactly it starts to rise, how long it continues to rise, and how it is determined by infarct characteristics as well as comorbidities. That knowledge would be of great value to determine the responsiveness of plasma BD-tau to brain injury after onset and to evaluate whether BD-tau plateaus at different time points after onset indicating no further infarct progression. PROMISE-BD-100 will thus assess BD-tau levels every hour from admission to 48 hours from stroke onset in patients that present with the clinical diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke due to a large- or medium-vessel occlusion within 9 hours from symptom onset."

The investigators will perform basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH) designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. These experiments will follow standard procedures for collecting behavioral data, and involve simple perceptual tasks (e.g., signal detection, object recognition) and behavioral tasks (e.g., walking towards a goal location). The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when using an external computer to directly specify pulse trains (e.g., for Argus II, a 1s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12). These direct pulse trains are then sent to the VPU. This VPU contains software that makes sure that these pulse trains are within FDA-approved safety limits. For example, these pulses must be charge-balanced (equal anodic/cathodic charge) and must have a charge density below 35 microCoulombs/cm2. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. Sometimes the investigators will directly send pulses to the VPU by directly specifying pulse trains (e.g., send a 1 s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microAmps to Electrode 12 of an Argus II implant). Important parameters for safety include a) pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), b) charge density should be limited. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust to extremely high rates of stimulation and high current levels. However, high frequency pulse trains or high amplitude pulse trains can produce discomfort in patients (analogous to going from a dark movie theatre to sunlight) due to inducing large-scale neuronal firing. The investigators will normally be focusing on pulse-train frequencies/amplitudes that are in the normal range used by the patient when using their device. If the investigators use parameters that might be expected to produce a more intense neural response (and therefore have the potential to cause discomfort), they will always introduce them in a step-wise function (e.g. gradually increasing amplitude) while checking that the sensation is not 'uncomfortably bright', and the investigators will immediately decrease the intensity of stimulation if patients report that the sensation approaches discomfort. The PI has experience in this approach and will train all personnel on these protocols. In response to the stimulation/image on the monitor, subjects will be asked to either make a perceptual judgment or perform a simple behavioral task. Examples include detecting a stimulus ('did you see a light on that trial'), reporting size by drawing on a touch screen, or walking to a target location. Both patient response and reaction time will be recorded. In some cases, the investigators will also collect data measuring subjects' eye position. This is a noninvasive procedure that will be carried out using standard eye-tracking equipment via an infra-red camera that tracks the position of the subjects' pupil. Only measurements like eye position or eye blinks will be recorded, so these data do not contain identifiable information. Subjects are encouraged to take breaks as often as needed (they may"

The overall goal of this study is to reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and pre-diabetes in Asian women and their children by focusing upon a major high-risk group - women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) in Singapore. GDM is diabetes diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy and has traditionally been considered a benign condition because typically glucose levels return to normal after delivery. Women with pregnancies complicated by GDM often progress to develop T2D later in life. There is evidence that holistic lifestyle modifications that include strategies to improve dietary intake, physical activity, and mental well-being can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. The use of digital health interventions can also assist in the prevention of T2D. However, limited studies have been conducted with Asian populations. This study aims (1) to identify post-GDM women from large community settings in Singapore and to assess the efficacy of a holistic lifestyle digital intervention (focusing on diet, physical activity, sleep, and mental well-being) on glucose regulation with those identified women. Secondary objectives are: (a) to examine the potential impacts of the proposed intervention on the health and well-being of subjects' family members (e.g., children); (b) to determine the diabetes risk of the subjects over a 3-year follow-up period; (c) to explore potential economic impacts of the proposed intervention (e.g., healthcare expenditures); (d) to study the importance of gut microbiota and epigenetic factors in relation to changes in glucose metabolism, and (e) to ascertain the safety of the proposed intervention. The study is a 1-year randomized controlled trial with three years of follow-up. The primary outcomes involved the incidence of Type 2 diabetes confirmed by a 2-hr 75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) over a 4-year period. Secondary outcomes are (1) incidence of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance; (b) changes in cardiometabolic variables (e.g., body weight, HbA1c, insulin, blood lipids, blood pressures) in the women; (c) changes in women's body composition; (d) changes in women's mental well-being (e.g., defined by BDI-II, STAI, WHO-5, PSS-4); (e) changes in the health and wellbeing of their children, and (f) a composite of major adverse events (MAE) comprising fatal and non-fatal events associated with Type 2 diabetes. Eligible women will be randomized at baseline to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (Control) for 1 year. Group 1 (Intervention) consists of several virtual coaching sessions about healthy lifestyle delivered by a conversational agent (chatbot) embedded in the LvL UP App within 24 weeks (weeks 2 to 26) to complete three levels of health literacy. Additionally, individuals will receive an Oura ring at baseline, as well as the HAPPY App Follow-up Period Upon completion of the one-year RCT period, both groups will be followed-up for 3 years.

Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, thus being the focus of extensive research. The primary treatment goals of this disease consist in controlling local disease, reducing the risk of distant metastases, and avoiding enucleation whenever possible. Plaque brachytherapy is currently the standard treatment for small and medium-sized uveal melanomas. In clinical practice, ruthenium (Ru-106) or iodine (I-125) are the most commonly employed radioisotopes. Ruthenium is the most utilized radioisotope in Europe and South America due to its availability and good clinical outcomes. It is currently the only available option in Brazil's public health system (SUS). However, its use for large tumors (greater than 10 mm in thickness and/or 22 mm in diameter) is limited by the inability of delivering an adequate therapeutic dose of radiation without causing further damage to the surrounding retinal tissue. For this reason, researchers in medical physics have been investigating new treatment options in the last decades, including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radiosurgery (gamma knife or linear accelerator), and proton beam therapy. Although gamma knife radiosurgery and proton beam therapy are effective treatments with reliable tumor control rates, they are associated with poor visual outcomes, inadequate globe retention, and their use is reportedly limited in public health systems of low- or middle-income countries. EBRT carries potential side effects related to a broader radiation field, with an increased risk for complications in ocular and periocular structures, such as eyelids, sclera, lens, and retina. Finally, enucleation is an effective management for very large tumors, but it is usually a last resource. Considering the above-mentioned treatment limitations for large choroidal melanomas, our group explored an alternative approach using intra-arterial melphalan for tumor chemoreduction, aiming to reduce thickness and allow subsequent brachytherapy using a Ru-106 plaque. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan has been used to treat multiple cancers, including liver metastases from uveal and skin melanomas, but it has never been described as a primary tumor treatment. Previous studies have demonstrated a reasonable safety profile of the therapy when used for the treatment of other tumors. This is a phase I clinical trial that assesses the safety profile of chemoreduction with intra-arterial melphalan, followed by ruthenium brachytherapy, performed in patients that would otherwise need enucleation due to tumor size."

Trauma is a leading cause of global mortality or incapacitation in survivors. The population involved is mainly young adult men affected by preventable injuries. Knowing the incidence of injuries, mechanisms of wounds, approaching strategies, and outcomes is essential to review individual interventions and collective policies to improve prevention. Casualties in Colombia had a high incidence in previous decades; injuries and attributable deaths have recently decreased, but they are still the third cause of mortality. Contrary to high-income countries, interpersonal violence is the predominant mechanism involved. Data registries are used worldwide in specialized centers that focus on providing healthcare in trauma. Nevertheless, it is necessary also to know the incidence in community and non-dedicated general hospitals. Determining the characteristics of patients admitted to the emergency ward by injuries will provide essential information on the severity, mechanisms, type of population affected, immediate or consequential care delivered, and outcomes. Such an analysis will give knowledge to prioritize policies, resources, upgrade clinical practice guidelines, and improve results.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is worldwide the second and third cancer-related cause of death in men and women, respectively. For the detection of lesions in the mucosa (premalignant and malignant), colonoscopy has been considered the gold standard. However, up to 25% of lesions can be missed during conventional colonoscopy. Some technical (i.e., bowel preparation) and operator-related (i.e., expertise, and fatigue) factors are related to these missing lesions. During the rapid-growing technological era, new tools were launched to improve the quality and performance of colonoscopies. Through the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) an identification of a pattern can be achieved after a previous training from a large dataset of images. The DiscoveryTM AI-assisted polyp detector (Pentax Medical, Hoya Group, Tokyo, Japan), is a computer-assisted polyp/adenoma detection system based on AI. It detects classic adenomas and flat lesions, distinguished features like mucus cap or rim of debris with the advantage of a real-time and simultaneous multiple polyp detection. It was developed to minimize the missed lesions increasing as a result the polyp detection rate (PDR) and the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Lately, published data evaluating the AI-assisted polyp detectors has demonstrate high sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver agreement. Due to the importance of CRC diagnosis and prompt treatment, and taking advantage of the newly introduced DiscoveryTM AI system, the investigators aim to assess the real-world effectiveness of this AI-assisted polyp detector system in clinical practice and compare the results between expert (seniors) and non-expert (juniors) endoscopists."

People with epilepsy who are planning for pregnancy or are pregnant have concerns about anti-seizure medication (ASM) treatment, as some ASMs increase the risk of major congenital malformations and can negatively influence cognitive outcomes in developing offspring (Tomson et al., 2018, Meador et al., 2021). Non-pharmacologic epilepsy treatments, such as specialized diets like the low glycemic diet or the modified Atkins diet, are not well studied in pregnant people with epilepsy but have proven to be effective in reducing seizures in the non-pregnant population. Dietary influence on seizure control is likely multifactorial, and recent studies have shown that one mechanism of action is to cause changes in the gut microbiome and alter neuroactive downstream bacterial metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (Olson et al., 2018). The low glycemic index (LGI) diet is one of the most flexible dietary therapies for epilepsy, and it appears to be safe in pregnancy with positive health outcomes for both the mother and baby (Walsh et al., 2012). Unfortunately, little is known about the effectiveness and mechanism of the LGI diet in pregnant patients with epilepsy. Therefore, the investigators propose this study in which the LGI diet will be initiated in the first half of pregnancy and explore LGI diet tolerability, seizure frequency, and potential underlying mechanisms in the pregnant epilepsy population. Investigators will invite pregnant people with epilepsy up to 20 weeks gestation in the Brigham & Women's Epilepsy-Obstetrical clinic to participate in this study. Participants will choose to go on the low glycemic index diet or continue their standard diet, will a goal of enrolling 21 participants in a 1:2 intervention to control group ratio. Participants in the intervention group will meet will a dietician to initiate the diet and have ongoing dietician support and appointments. All participants will fill out diet questionnaires and provide a maximum of 3 stool samples and 3 blood samples. Dietary intervention will end when pregnancies end, and stool and blood samples will be collected up to 3 months postpartum. The main outcomes will be diet tolerability, seizure frequency, gut bacteria composition, and metabolite alterations."

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The overall 5-year survival rate for pancreatic cancer is less than 10%. Neoadjuvant therapy for pancreatic cancer can in theory control early systemic spread and improve rate of R0 resection (2). In the ESPAC-5 study, neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy did not increase rate of resection who had borderline-resectable disease but appears to improve overall survival (OS) (3). The Charité Onkologie (CONKO-007) trial showed that the addition of radiation to chemotherapy improved R0 resection rate and complete pathological response (pCR) but did not impact on OS (4). Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy may represent a new paradigm in the treatment of pancreatic cancer. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a 40 kDa membrane protein minimally expressed in normal cells, but highly expressed in a variety of cancer cells, such as mesothelioma, lung, breast, ovarian, gastric and pancreatic cancer. MSLN is expressed in about 80% of PDAC. Mesothelin plays a role in tumorigenesis by increasing cell proliferation, migration and S phase cell population. Its limited expression in normal human tissues and high expression in many cancers make it an attractive tumor-related antigen for cancer treatment (6). There are several immunotherapies targeting MSLN for PDAC treatment, including antibody-based drugs (monoclonal antibodies, antibody-drug conjugates, immunotoxins), vaccines, and CART cell therapy. For example, the recombinant protein preparation SS1(dsFv)PE38 (SS1P), which is composed of high affinity Fv (variable fragment) targeting MSLN and Pseudomonas exotoxin A (PE) fusion, has entered clinical trials as a drug (7). There is also an antibody-drug conjugate, Anetumab ravtansine (BAY 94-9343), which is made by conjugating human anti-MSLN antibody with maytansinol tubulin inhibitor (DM4) through a connector containing disulfide bond. In vivo, anetumab ravtansine is specifically localized in tumors that express MSLN and inhibits the growth of pancreatic cancer, ovarian cancer, mesothelioma and other tumors. The safety of CAR-T cells targeting MSLN in the treatment of cancers has also been verified in several clinical trials on lung cancers (NCT01583686, NCT02414269, NCT01355965). Professor Li Peng's group at the Chinese Academy of Science designed third generation CAR-T cells targeting MSLN and validated their use in both human PDAC cell lines, animal models, and in 4 patients with advanced malignancies. In a 42-year-old man with metastatic PDAC, the MSLN targeted CAR-T treatment led to complete response following several hepatic artery infusion and intravenous infusion. These early cases confirmed the safety of these MSLN targeted CAR-T cells. In the current proposed feasibility study, the researcher hypothesize that EUS-guided injection of MSLN targeted CAR-T cells into PDAC can induce a tumor response, improve rate of R0 resection and translate into better patient survival."

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) represents an incurable condition wherein pharmacological interventions are directed towards deferring disease progression and alleviating symptoms, thereby extending survival rates and preserving the quality of life (QoL) and psychological well-being. Clinical advancements in anticancer treatments have notably augmented survival rates among MBC patients. However, accruing evidence reported that adherence to medications is a critical issue in the disease trajectory of breast cancer patients, particularly in the context of oral anticancer treatments (OATs). Emerging evidence indicates that patients with advanced cancer, such as those with MBC, often exhibit significant levels of nonadherence. MBC patients encounter various barriers to the daily management of OATs, including emotional and physical distress associated with side effects, dosage variations, treatment interruptions, and a lack of disease-related knowledge. Prediction models for adherence have been previously developed and tested across diverse scenarios and diseases. Evidence suggested that leveraging of the machine learning models in clinical practice enables the provision of personalized predictions on medication adherence for individual patients, thereby supporting adherence and facilitating targeted interventions. Even so, existing studies have yet to systematically address medication adherence among MBC patients by designing and implementing a decision support system (DSS) that integrates risk predictive models alongside educational and training tools. The current protocol aims to assess the efficacy of the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application (TREAT - TREatment Adherence SupporT), and a machine learning web-based application in promoting adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a sample of MBC patients. This protocol is part of a project titled Enhancing Therapy Adherence Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients (Tracking Number 65080791). The overarching goal of this project is to develop a predictive model of nonadherence, an associated DSS, and guidelines to enhance patient engagement and therapy adherence among MBC patients. The web-based DSS was developed in the first year of the Pfizer Project (65080791) using a patient-centric approach and comprises four sections: i) Metastatic Breast Cancer; ii) Adherence to Cancer Therapies; iii) Promoting Adherence; iv) My Adherence Diary. Moreover, a machine learning web-based application was designed to focus on predicting patients' risk factors for adherence to anticancer treatment, specifically considering physical status, comorbid conditions, and short- and long-term side effects. This machine learning web-based application was developed through a retrospective study employing physiological, clinical, and quality of life data available in the European Institute of Oncology (Milan, Italy) (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Specifically, multi-modal retrospective data has been retrieved from the Patient Electronic Health Records (EHR) using natural language processing (NLP) in a sample of 2.750 MBC patients (from 2010 to 2020). Methods/Design Main objectives Evaluating the effectiveness of the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application (TREAT - TREatment Adherence SupporT) in fostering adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a cohort of 100 Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) patients over a three-month period. Adherence is assessed by calculating the number of pills taken divided by the prescribed amount. Secondary Objectives Identify clinical factors (comorbidities, pain presence, tumor type, treatment type), psychological parameters (personality traits, anxiety, depression, self-efficacy for coping with cancer, sense of coherence, and risk perception), and QoL variables that serve as predictors for patients' adherence to OATs. These predictors are utilized to assess nonadherence to OATs among MBC patients and enhance the initial version of a machine learning model developed in the retrospective study (R1595/21-IEO 1704). Data for the secondary endpoints are collected using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-C30), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer 23-item Breast Cancer-specific Questionnaire (EORTC-QLQ-BR23), and the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI).

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairment in communication and social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. 1%-1.5% of children in developed nations has ASD, This rate is said to range between 0.15% and 0.8% in low- and middle-income countries. Over the past decades, the prevalence of ASD has increased worldwide. Scientists have been trying to explore the molecular mechanisms behind the pathology of ASD. Several evidence suggests that genetic factors such as chromosomal abnormalities and environmental factors like diet and stress are involved in the pathogenesis and advancement of ASD. Accumulating research has demonstrated the gut-brain axis or multiple biochemical signaling pathways that take place between the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the central nervous system (CNS), and its possible association with ASD. Mounting evidence explains that gut microbial dysbiosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), coeliac disease (CD), and ASD. A Recent Egyptian study showed that an evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of ASD children compared to the unrelated controls. However, the microbiome profile of siblings was more like that of autistic children than that of unrelated controls. These observations may highlight the importance of the interplay between environmental and host genetic factors in shaping the gut microbiome. The study also emphasized the importance of identification of microbiome and specific microorganisms' changes that can be targeted for diagnosis as well as for treatment of ASD. This study aims to investigate clinical risk factors of autism and to elucidate the changes in gut microbiome in Egyptian autistic children and their possible correlation with clinical outcomes and the severity of the disease."

Money management is necessary for people with severe mental illness (SMI) to live safely in the community. Collective evidence has suggested that mental disorder leads to drift into poverty, is strong. Most of them struggle to meet basic needs with their existing income. Financial instability has been consistently linked to an increased risk of relapse. This experimental study aims to develop an internet-based self-help money management program that improve financial self-efficacy and its associated adverse outcomes among adult population with severe mental illness. Its efficacy will be compared with the wait-list control group. We hypothesized that (1) participants who received a money management program will improve financial self-efficacy after the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls; (2) participants from the money management program will have better financial well-being after the intervention as compared with the wait-list controls. The online money management program course will consist of 4 weekly modules, incorporating the key components of money management and the Model of Human Occupation (MOHO), including the concept of money management, money management skill, and risk of financial exploitation. Each module will consist of the main component presented in video format, quiz, and homework. Materials will be presented interactively to facilitate engagement."

The investigators propose to 1) perform a rigorous randomized controlled trial during tasks of functional significance (Aim 1), and 2) assess the capacity of START training to generalize to untrained tasks (Aim 2). Aim 1: Evaluate the capacity of START to enhance training outcomes in individuals with stroke (iwS). The objective of this aim is to demonstrate that START can enhance tasks of clinical and functional significance like those performed during therapy. The investigators propose a randomized, single-blind, parallel, controlled trial evaluating the impact of START on training outcomes of a functional reaching task in iwS. Hypothesis 1: The rate of learning and retention will be larger during training with START compared to control (training without START). Aim 2: Evaluate the generalizability of START training to untrained tasks. To be viable as an adjuvant clinical tool to enhance activities of daily living, training benefits attributable to START must translate beyond the specific tasks trained during therapy. The investigators propose to evaluate skill transference using sorting and dressing tasks. Hypothesis 2: Training with START will show higher skill transfer (e.g. time to complete sorting/dressing task) compared to training without START. SIGNIFICANCE & IMPACT Imagine the transformative impact of an inexpensive tool that could be implemented not only in well-funded, metropolitan hospitals but also in small, rural, and socioeconomically disadvantaged hospitals enhancing recovery for iwS regardless of disability severity, socioeconomic status, or location. Every year, $43,000,000,000 is paid for care and therapy of the 7,000,000 stroke survivors living in the US but six months post-stroke 65% of patients cannot use their impaired hand during activities of daily living (e.g. feeding, toileting) and 63.5% of stroke survivors will never achieve a total Fugl-Meyer score greater than 90/226 - i.e. severe disability. These statistics are worse for individuals with low SES. A recent, 2018 study demonstrated that patients from low SES backgrounds received less in-patient and out-patient care and were discharged more quickly leading to higher levels of disability and mortality. If successful, this study will revolutionize treatment for stroke survivors because START is non-invasive, inexpensive, and mobile making it accessible to rural and socioeconomically disadvantaged populations. START's application is a loud, acoustic stimulus timed with planned motor activity and can be administered via headphones. Unlike many new rehabilitation devices/techniques, START represents an extremely safe intervention (the application is a loud sound well beneath OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) regulations with no reported adverse reactions since its discovery. Thus, clinical staff training and safety protocols are minimal further decreasing application costs. Finally, it is mobile and easily packaged, so it can be administered via the increasing number of telemedicine programs designed for rural populations. Finally, START allows severe stroke survivors to participate in and benefit from therapy. The benefits of START are not contained to severe stroke survivors (e.g. improvement of hand extension in mildly disabled patients) but the capacity of START to work in severe patients significantly increases the potential of this tool to assist patients across all levels of disability."

Endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) is a new technique for the treatment of hyperinflated COPD patients. It is based on the insertion of endobronchial valves in the most hyperinflated lobe. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of ELVR on diaphragm function and conformation.
The study will include 20 patients with hyperinflated COPD without collateral ventilation. The patients will be evaluated before and 3 months after the unilateral valves setting. The diaphragmatic function will be assessed by the transdiaphragmatic pressure measured at the functional residual capacity (FRC) after magnetic phrenic stimulation. The diaphragm conformation will be evaluated by measuring diaphragmatic fibers length in several planes, diaphragmatic area and radius of curvature, also at the FRC.
The results of this study will provide valuable information on the effects of ELVR on diaphragm function and conformation, which are important factors in the management of COPD patients."

The investigators propose a prospective, multicenter, observational study to evaluate the feasibility of organ preservation in early rectal cancer (cT1N0M0) with no adjuvant treatment. The main hypothesis is that exclusive local excision is insufficient for in situ rectum preservation in ≥20% of the patients treated with this approach in real everyday´s clinical practice. A database will be design recording demographics, tumor details, type of intervention, complications, histological details and further necessity of treatments and rectal preservation along time. It will be hosted online through the REDCap system. Data entry will be done baseline, after surgical procedure, and at different follow-up periods, at 30 postoperative day and at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 months after surgical intervention. Sample size calculation: Previous evidence states that most patients would be willing to assume a recurrence risk of 20% (IQR 10-35%) in locally advanced rectal cancer after chemo-radiotherapy in order to join the watch and wait strategy for organ preservation. In the project the investigators propose a salvage TME rate of less than 20% at three years to be acceptable. With this approach, accepting a risk α of 0.05 and a risk β of 0.2, a two-tailed test would require a total of 145 patients to identify a difference of 0.1 units. A proportion in the reference group of 0.2 and a loss rate of 5% has been estimated."

This is an observational cohort study using MRI to measure gastrointestinal (GI) function, lung structure and function and liver endpoints in children with CF aged 6 to 11 years. The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study (NCT04618185) to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint. In total, participants will be asked to remain in the MRI scanner for approximately 30 minutes at a time. For comfort, participants will be able to watch multimedia programmes through the use of a specially adapted television while in the scanner. Participants will also be asked to complete validated gastrointestinal questionnaires throughout the study day and recall their GI symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and complete a 3 day food diary. The study will be split into two phases. The first will be a pilot phase where 3 children with CF aged 6 to 11 years and 3 healthy age and gender matched controls undergo MRI scanning. These scans will be assessed to determine whether the scan protocol can be completed by the participants and assess the quality of the images obtained. If successful, the trial will progress onto the main phase. In the main phase, the 12 additional children with CF will be recruited and undergo the above scanning protocol, prior to starting ETI. We will then ask participants to return for a repeat scans approximately 6 months after starting ETI."

Hypospadias repair surgery is an invasive surgery that results in significant postoperative pain. pain alters the quality of life and satisfaction of the patients and results in manipulation of wounds, infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence leading to unfavorable surgical outcome . As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedtomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting. A vast majority of literature supports the efficacy of particulate steroids like methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions. Aim of the work and hypothesis: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of caudal methylprednisolone in pediatric patients. This randomized, double-blind, controlled bi-center study was designed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in caudal block for children undergoing hypospadias surgical repair using the duration of analgesia as the primary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that methylprednisolone will provide superior postoperative analgesia than dexamethasone when added to bupivacaine for caudal block."

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for ROP examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in ROP examination on premature infants. Retinopathy is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for ROP examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the ROP examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The examination success rate was defined as the ability to complete the ROP examination without disturbances caused by infant distress or movement. The study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed ROP examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated ROP examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensory stimulation during ROP examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population."

The project has obtained the approval of the Ethics Committee of the University of Valencia on June 6, 2023 (Id: UV-INV_ETICA-2701990). The intervention will take place in the laboratories of the Physiotherapy Department of the University of Valencia. All the participants, once they have signed the informed consent and, after being randomly assigned to the EG or the CG, will be evaluated before starting the treatment (T0). A post-intervention evaluation will be carried one day after the end of the 24 sessions (T1), and a follow-up evaluation 3 weeks after the intervention (T2). Subjects with unilateral shoulder pain will be recruited through social media and posters posted in primary care centers, hospitals, and other related locations. The study will be triple blind: participants, evaluators and therapists. In order to monitor the possible adverse effects derived from the application of a-TES, the Bruitoni et al. Adverse Effects Questionnaire will be completed in each session. It is a questionnaire that contains 10 possible side effects (headache, neck pain, scalp pain, tingling, itching, burning, redness of the skin, drowsiness, concentration problems, severe mood change).If any of these symptoms occurred, the stimulation would be stopped and the next day would be tried again. If these effects were repeated, especially the headache or were of severe intensity, the patient would be withdrawn from the investigation. The sample size has been calculated with the formula: n = (2 * (Zα/2 + Zβ) / d) ² (significance level of 0.05, Zα/2 = 1.96; Zβ =0.84, d= 0.5). Total, n= 64 subjects. In addition, the sample may be increased by 15% in anticipation of possible losses throughout the study (= 10 more subjects). Classic statistical methods will be used to calculate the mean as a measure of central tendency and the standard deviation as a measure of dispersion. Before carrying out the inferential analysis, the normal distribution of the sample will be checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test, homoscedasticity using the Levene test, and sphericity using the Mauchly test. Regarding the inferential analysis, a mixed ANOVA will be used with an intra-subject factor (time), with 4 categories, corresponding to the assessments made; and a between-subjects (group) factor corresponding to the assigned intervention. For post hoc comparisons, the Bonferroni adjustment will be used. In the event that the assumptions are not met, the corresponding non-parametric tests will be applied: Wilcoxon and Mann Whitney, adjusting the type I error. In the event of losses, the intention-to-treat procedure will be used for the statistical analysis of the data. ."

Knee surgeries are associated with severe postoperative pain. Improper pain management affects patients' psychological status with prolongation of hospital stay time and rehabilitation period, with the possibility of progression of the acute pain to chronic pain (McCartney CJ, Nelligan K., 2014). Many Pain management options following these surgeries are available: non-opioid analgesics, opioids and regional anesthesia techniques (epidural and peripheral nerve block). Multi-modal analgesia is considered the best option for pain management in knee surgeries. As non-opioid analgesics alone are not effective enough while opioids alone are associated with many risk factors: nausea, vomiting, decrease intestinal motility and respiratory depression with possibility of addiction (Goode VM, Morgan B, et al, 2019). Regarding the functional anatomy of the nerve supply to knee joint: The knee is innervated by genicular branches from the nerve to vastus medialis, saphenous nerve, sciatic nerve and the posterior division of obturator nerve. The skin around the knee is supplied by the cutaneous branches from the femoral nerve and the saphenous nerve (Ritesh Roy, Gaurav Agarwal, et al, 2018). The widespread use of ultrasound to advance peripheral nerve block techniques over the past decade has led to enormous growth in the utilization and efficiency of regional anesthesia (Cozowicz, Crispiana & Poeran, et al, 2015). The adductor canal block (ACB) is an interfascial plane block performed in the middle third of the medial side of the thigh. The adductor canal bounded anteriorly by the sartorius muscle, posteriorly and medially by the adductor longus and magnus muscles, and laterally by the vastus medialis muscle. It contains the femoral vein and artery, the saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus medialis, both are sensory branches of the femoral nerve. In some individuals, the obturator sensory branch (also a femoral nerve branch) can be affected by local anesthetic infiltration into this area. It can be noted that this block affect sensory branches and avoid blocking the majority of motor branches. The block is most commonly performed using ultrasound guidance (Thiayagarajan MK, Kumar SV,et al 2019). Ultrasound guided 4-in-1 block technique: a new single injection technique described by Roy R, Agarwal G, et al, 2018 for the combined 4 nerves (saphenous nerve, obturator nerve, nerve to vastus medialis and sciatic nerve) with a single injection point is located at the adductor hiatus where descending genicular artery branches from superficial femoral artery. Bupivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic (max. dose 2.5 mg/kg). Symptoms contributed to local anesthetic toxicity include tinnitus, perioral tingling, visual disturbances and dizziness (Shafiei FT, McAllister RK, Lopez J, 2022)"

The BUNDLE study is a prospective mixed-methods study focused on the early integration of community doula into prenatal care. The investigators will pursue the following aims using a multidisciplinary team of experts in health disparities, community engagement, qualitative research, maternal-fetal medicine, and doula support: Aim 1: Develop an integrated prenatal care model of medical providers and community doulas in Southeastern Wisconsin Approach: The investigators will conduct six focus groups with 30 Black/AA birthing people (currently pregnant or recently postpartum) and 30 prenatal healthcare providers (obstetricians, midwives, doulas, social workers, prenatal care coordinators, nurses, mental health providers, and obstetric unit leaders) to elicit feedback on models of doula/medical provider integration with the overarching aim of building trust and improving maternal health outcomes. Focus group findings will be reviewed with a community advisory panel (CAP) developed as part of the Community Partnership of the MCW U54 center, to gain the CAP's input on intervention development. Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of the integrated prenatal care model to standard prenatal care in improving healthcare engagement and trust and reducing adverse maternal outcomes Approach: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial conducted at Froedtert and MCW, the investigators will randomize 412 Black/AA pregnant people to BUNDLE or standard prenatal care. Primary outcome is healthcare engagement (starting prenatal care in 1st trimester, attending at least 70% of the recommended visits, attending the postpartum visit, and receipt of recommended vaccination during pregnancy). Secondary outcomes include medical mistrust measured by trust in provider scale, perceived discrimination, and frequencies of severe maternal morbidity as defined by the Centers for Disease Control. Aim 3: Disseminate findings to scholarly and community-based forums and actively pursue opportunities for systems- and policy-level change Approach: The investigators will disseminate findings regularly in scholarly (conference, grand rounds) and community-based (listening session, town hall) forums. The investigators will leverage the existing partnerships with policymakers, healthcare organizations, and community leaders to implement strategies to sustain successful program outcomes through policy changes at the system and statewide level by advocating for doula coverage and healthcare system sustainability of the integrated prenatal care model."

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of connective tissue massage and classical massage on pain, functional status and quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain.
                This was a 3-arm randomized controlled trial, parallel-group study with blind outcomes assessor. Ethical approval was obtained from the Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University Health Sciences Ethics Committee (09.01.2020, decision no: 4). Detailed information about the study was verbally provided to participants, and written informed consent was obtained. The study adhered to the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration. The study design adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for rigorous reporting.
                A convenience sample of 30 participants was equally and randomly divided into three groups: the CTM group (n=10), CM group (n=10), and control group (n=10). Randomization was carried out by an independent physical therapist, who was not involved in the assessment or treatment of the participants, 1 hour before the baseline measurements. The randomization process involved using opaque and sealed envelopes, each containing a group allocation number generated from a computer-generated random number table. Block randomization was employed to ensure an equal distribution of participants across the groups. All treatment sessions were administered by the same investigator (C.D) in the study group. The intervention duration was uniform across all groups: 4 consecutive weeks, with 3 sessions per week lasting 15-20 minutes per session. Outcome measurements were taken at the beginning and 4 weeks after the completion of the program. An independent physiotherapist, unaware of the research details and participant groupings, conducted the evaluations.
                The results of the study showed that both connective tissue massage and classical massage were effective in reducing pain, improving functional status and quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. However, there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of these outcomes.
                In conclusion, both connective tissue massage and classical massage can be used as effective treatment options for patients with chronic non-specific low back pain."

The purpose of this research study is to: · Determine the differing pressure lowering effects between OMNI canaloplasty alone versus when combined with HYDRUS microstent. Both surgical study devices are widely used by themselves in conjunction with cataract surgery. While many surgeons have begun combining the two procedures, this will be one of the first studies to randomize (assign by chance) one eye to OMNI canaloplasty alone and the other eye to OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS stent and report the results after one year. About 80 subjects aged 18 years and older will participate in this study. WHAT WILL HAPPEN DURING THE STUDY? Your participation in this study will last approximately one year and will include approximately seven study visits to the study center and two visits to the surgery center. Screening: Before any study-related tests and procedures are performed, you will be asked to read and sign this consent document. The following screening tests and procedures will then be performed to determine if you qualify to take part in this study: Visual field OCT analysis of the nerve and cornea - your nerve and cornea will be measured using optical coherence tomography (OCT) equipment. This is painless, non-invasive (it does not involve puncturing or cutting) and is similar to having photographs taken of your eye. You will be required to sit still during the brief scanning procedure (a few seconds) Slit lamp exam with gonioscopy - a close inspection of the front of the eye using a machine that magnifies the eye and provides a beam of light to light the structures of the eye Eye pressure test - measurement of the pressure inside the eye. The pressure in your eyes will be measured using an instrument known as a tonometer Visual acuity test - a test involving reading letters off a chart to determine how well you can see This study will use competitive enrollment. This means that when a target number of subjects begins the study, all further enrollment will be closed. Therefore, it is possible that you could be in the screening phase, ready to begin the study, and be discontinued without your consent if the target number of subjects has already begun the study. If you qualify to take part in this study and go on to receive the study treatment, then the following will happen: Washout Period: You will be asked to stop taking your eye drops to treat your glaucoma. This is called a washout period, during which the effects of these medications leave your body. Study Treatment: You will be randomly assigned by chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive either OMNI canaloplasty or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. You will have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving OMNI canaloplasty alone or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. This is a not a blinded study, which means that you, the study doctor, study staff and the sponsor will know the study treatment you are given. You will have the following study visits and undergo the following procedures: · Preoperative and postoperative care will be the same as a standard cataract surgery consisting of one day, one week, one month, six month and one year follow-up exams. The only difference for study subjects is they will be asked to stop all glaucoma drops one month prior to their pre-op exam and one year post-op exam. After Study Treatment: Glaucoma is a permanent and irreversible condition that requires lifelong monitoring with an eye care professional. Sometimes additional treatment is required. Your eye specialist will recommend follow-up care based on your personal findings."

The study population consisted of 110 patients (55 patients in each group) with elevated intraocular pressure induced by primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), males and females in the age bracket of 18 to 75 years conforming to the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients randomized: 110 Dropouts: 0 Per protocol population: 110 Safety population: 110 The efficacy was established based on analysis of the parameters as follows: Primary endpoint Mean IOP change from baseline. Secondary endpoints IOP reduction rate to the target level of ≤ 18 mm Hg. IOP reduction rate greater than 20%. IOP reduction rate greater than 30%. Safety evaluation Incidence of other adverse events to a greater or lesser extent linked to the test or reference product, including those evaluated from laboratory test findings. Treatment safety will be assessed from recording adverse events via analysis of complaints and symptoms, evaluation, and interpretation of the findings of instrumental monitoring (biomicroscopy, ophthalmoscopy, IOP measures, perimetry) and laboratory tests. Given that the test product may cause miosis resulting in transient visual acuity reduced, the contribution of the visual acuity parameter 'Vis' is not taken into account when assessing the treatment success. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using Statsoft Statistica Professional 13 and Microsoft Excel 2016 software. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to evaluate the normality of distribution of quantitative attributes. Parametric tests were used for testing statistical hypotheses for parameters with the normal distribution, whereas nonparametric tests were used for parameters with the variance of the distribution. Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for comparing the study groups in terms of quantitative attributes. The comparison of intragroup parameters before and after treatment was performed using the dependent samples t-test or the Wilcoxon test. The intragroup comparisons were also performed using nonparametric repeated measures ANOVA (the Friedman test). Qualitative attributes were analyzed using Pearson's χ2 test or Fisher's exact test (if the attribute incidence rate in at least one subgroup was ≤ 5). Statistically significant are differences with p-values < 0.05. Efficacy analysis of the comparison products provides for a conclusion on • Noninferiority of the test product Dorzotimol, eye drops (JADRAN - GALENSKI LABORATORIJ d.d., Croatia) vs. reference product Cosopt®, eye drops (Laboratoires Merck Sharp & Dohme-Chibret, France) by the primary endpoint: No statistically significant intergroup differences have been observed regarding a mean intraocular pressure change from baseline either in the treatment or control group (p = 0.0939; Mann-Whitney U test). The efficacy differences between the test and reference product by the primary criterion do not exceed the noninferiority margin of 1.5 mm Hg. Intergroup efficacy comparisons of the comparison products by the secondary endpoints have also been performed, with statistical significance of intergroup differences evaluated: No statistically significant intergroup differences have been observed regarding the IOP reduction rate to the target level of ≤ 18 mm Hg either in the treatment or control group (p = 0.3061; Pearson's χ2 test), which is indicative of Dorzotimol noninferiority by this parameter vs. reference product. No statistically significant intergroup differences have been observed regarding the IOP reduction rate greater than 20% at visit 6 from baseline either in the treatment or control group (p = 0.6336; Pearson's"

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Screening colonoscopy is the most effective method for detecting CRC and pre-cancerous polyps. However, adherence to repeat colonoscopy is suboptimal, with only 50-60% of patients completing the procedure. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a text message intervention can improve adherence to repeat colonoscopy in the Veterans Affairs (VA) hospital.

The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial of 100 patients at the VA hospital in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Participants will be randomized to receive either a text message intervention or no intervention. The text message intervention will consist of a series of instructional and motivational text messages, which will be sent starting 7-14 days before and until the day of the colonoscopy procedure. The primary outcome will be the National Annie Colonoscopy Survey Score, which assesses participant satisfaction with the Annie text intervention. Secondary outcomes will include the percentage of participants who attend scheduled colonoscopy appointments and the percentage of participants who have adequate bowel preparation at colonoscopy appointments."

Incomplete miscarriage is defined as early miscarriage with persistent intrauterine material on ultrasound. Intrauterine retention of trophoblastic debris is not an uncommon phenomenon. These retentions may initially be asymptomatic but are often responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis. This symptomatology often accentuates the psychological distress of patients mourning the pregnancy. Incomplete miscarriages are mainly managed by the gynecological emergency department. The recommendations of the Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care. The choice between the two is left to the discretion of the doctor and the patient. there are no clear recommendations as to the choice between hysteroscopy and aspiration. Within the teams, the choice is often made according to the habits and protocols of the service, according to the equipment available and the skills of the gynaecologists. Aim: The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound. The secondary objectives are: the comparison of the rate of complications of the two techniques, during and after surgery the comparison of the rate of recourse to a second line surgical management between the two arms, the comparison of the rate of synechiae diagnosed by hysterosonography between the two techniques at 6 weeks after surgery, the comparison of the time to conception in the two arms during the 2 years after surgery the comparison of the fertility rate at 2 years after surgery in the two arms. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arms, parallel therapeutic clinical trial comparing hysteroscopy versus aspiration for the management of trophoblastic retention after spontaneous miscarriage. Patients will be randomized (110 per arm) after verification of eligibility criteria and signature of consent, on the day of the operation: Arm A: 110 patients treated by operative hysteroscopy Arm B: 110 patients treated by endo-uterine aspiration Randomization will be stratified by center, age (<35 years, 35 years and over), size of trophoblastic retention (<30mm, 30mm and over) and scheduled by random size block. It will be centralized (Ennov-clinical software) and parameterized by the Unité́ de Recherche Clinique & Biostatistiques of the Montpellier University Hospital. Statistics: The effectiveness of operative hysteroscopy is expected to be 100%, and that of aspiration 90%. To show this difference with an alpha risk of 5%, and with a power of 90%, 98 patients per arm will have to be analysed (exact binomial distribution calculation, epiR package of R implemented in biostatgv). To take into account a 10% loss of sight rate, 220 patients will be recruted. Patients will be included in the study on the morning of the procedure, after verification of the selection criteria. The expected number of lost to follow-up is estimated at 10%; in fact, the main criterion is evaluated relatively early (6 weeks), in patients having a desire for pregnancy and therefore relatively compliant, the rate of lost to follow-up will be a fairly low. A flow-chart will be constructed to describe the evolution of the populations during the study. It will detail the causes of non-inclusion and the causes of loss to follow-up. All study data will be described according to the randomization arm, in the randomized population: mean, standard deviation, median and quartiles, extrema and number of missing data for quantitative variables, numbers and percentages of each modality for qualitative data. The clinical comparability of the randomized population and the ITT population for the primary endpoint will be assessed. Primary analysis: The uterine vacuity rate will be compared between the two arms in the ITT population for the primary endpoint by a Chi-square test or by a Fisher exact test if the conditions for Chi-square validity are not met. The significance level was set at 5%, two-sided. Secondary endpoint analysis: The rates of complications, use of second-line surgical management, synechiae, and fertility at 2 years after surgery will"

The goal of this study is to investigate how people make inferences about the environment. We will use a computer-based task to measure how people make inferences about the environment. The task will involve looking at two jars, each filled with a different number of red and blue balls. The jars will be switched between trials, and participants will be asked to make inferences about the jars based on the number of balls they see. The task will be divided into three blocks: short-term inference, long-term inference, and multi-timescale inference. In the short-term inference block, participants will be asked to identify which of the two jars is currently in use. In the long-term inference block, participants will be asked to predict which jar will be used on the next trial. In the multi-timescale inference block, participants will be asked to both identify the current jar and predict the next jar. The task will be completed on a computer, and participants will be asked to draw balls from the jars as many times as they wish with replacement. The study will be conducted online using the Prolific platform."

Background & Rationale: Insomnia is a highly common, chronic disorder that is distressful for the patient but also for caregivers and can give rise to a heavy burden on the healthcare team. Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults. Some patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty. Lemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other traditional sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events. While lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with dementia and insomnia. Understanding the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of lemborexant will be helpful in an N of 1 trial to understand the details of effect and effectiveness in individual patients living with dementia and insomnia. Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that lemborexant will be effective and safe in the treatment of insomnia in adults living with both early-onset dementia and concomitant sleep difficulty. Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate lemborexant for efficacy and safety as a sedative medication for insomnia in adults living with both early-onset dementia and insomnia. Methods: This is an investigator led N of 1 trial for adults with early onset dementia and insomnia. While this trial is designed for a particular patient case the investigators anticipate that there may be opportunities in the future for this N of 1 trial to be redeployed additional times to other adults living with early onset dementia. Study Procedures: Patients identified to have early onset dementia and insomnia by a co-principal investigator during routine patient care will be considered for the N of 1 trial. The other co-investigator will then meet the potential patient, review of the project details and study objectives. There will be a discussion of risks and benefits and the consent form will be reviewed. There will be an invitation for the patient to provide informed consent with support from a substitute decision maker if necessary, the patient will be considered enrolled in the study and will be provided with (1) Study medication and (2) Study reporting tool. (1) Study medication will be provided for an 8 week period. Medications will be dispensed in an ABiBABAAB sequence where each letter represents 7 days of treatment, A represents placebo, Bi represents lemborexant 5mg and B represents lemborexant 10 mg. This doubly counterbalanced design to defends against both linear secular trends and nonlinear trends. Medication will be provided in 7 day packs (plastic or cardboard dosette) marked to correspond to the assigned treatment week and assigned as follows. Week 1 = placebo Week 2 = lemborexant 5mg Week 3 = lemborexant 10 mg Week 4 = placebo Week 5 = lemborexant 10 mg Week 6 = placebo Week 7 = placebo Week 8 = lemborexant 10 mg Medications will be placed inside an opaque capsule to minimize the difference"

Breathing exercises are the most important part of pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD patients. It helps patients to increase their lung capacity, allowing them to breathe more easily. At the same time, since the patient can easily do breathing exercises by himself, it is also beneficial to provide disease control and self-management. Although breathing exercises are simple and easy to apply, difficulties in the disease process can prevent the individual from doing this. For this reason, there is a need for applications that will attract the attention and interest of patients or direct them, but that will not create commitment to the hospital. In this sense, it has been reported that breathing exercises to be applied through virtual reality glasses will attract the attention and interest of the patient, increase their motivation and make breathing exercises more regular. Therefore, this study was planned to determine the effect of breathing exercises applied with virtual reality glasses on dyspnea, anxiety and quality of life in COPD patients."

Neck pain is one of the most common and painful musculoskeletal conditions. Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition. The symptoms of nonspecific neck pain are similar to those of whiplash associated disorders (WAD) grade I and II but there is no traumatic event involved. Nonspecific neck pain (NP) is defined as pain in the posterior and lateral aspect of the neck between the superior nuchal line and the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra with no signs or symptoms of major structural pathology and no or minor to major interference with activities of daily life as well as with the absence of neurological signs and specific pathologies. Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as cervical pain without a known pathological basis as the underlying cause of the complaints. Some symptoms are limited cervical spine mobility and neck muscles weakness, which may be often related to other problems, such as, vertebral, neck or shoulder impaired function, and mental and physical stress at work. The natural course of non-specific neck pain remains unclear. While it is often self-limiting within a few weeks of onset, it can severely limit daily functioning, induce substantial medical consumption and result in prolonged sick leave and disability leading chronic nonspecific neck pain if pain duration is more than three months. As a consequence, it places a heavy burden on individuals, employers and health care services. Nonspecific neck belongs to the group of musculoskeletal disorders, which include diverse conditions affecting muscles, bones, and/or joints of the limbs or the spine. As for most other musculoskeletal disorders, nonspecific neck pain is multifactorial. A variety of different types of exercise have been explored to treat chronic nonspecific neck pain, including low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise, high intensity aerobic exercise, stretching exercise and muscular strength exercises and isometrics. However, the most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain is unknown reflecting its complexity and more research is require. The rationale of the study is to compare the effects of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy on pain, range of motion and functional disability in chronic nonspecific neck pain. The main purpose of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy is to release the cervical trigger points, improving end ranges and lengthening of muscle. MDT helps draw toxins out of the muscles and to the superficial veins to be removed by the body. This leads to decreased pain and tension in the tissues. The ultimate goal is to achieve pain free end ranges and flexibility of muscle in nonspecific neck pain patients."

The purpose of this study is to compare the Dumpling suture method with the traditional suture method in rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma. The Dumpling suture method is a new method of stoma suture, which may reduce stoma complications by progressively reducing the incision and realizing the effect of hiding the skin incision. The traditional suture method is the most commonly used method of stoma suture. The investigators hypothesize that the Dumpling suture method may reduce the incidence of stoma complications compared to the traditional suture method.
The investigators will conduct a randomized parallel-controlled study. The investigators will recruit 100 patients who are scheduled for rectal anterior resection surgery with specimen extraction via stoma. The patients will be randomly assigned to the Dumpling suture method group or the traditional suture method group. The investigators will assess the stoma complications, stoma DET score, stoma pain score, and quality of life scale score for patients with stoma at 30 days after surgery.

The purpose of this study is to determine the median effective dose of rocuronium for the prevention of myofibrillation caused by the injection of succinylcholine.
The study will be conducted on 120 patients who are scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia. The patients will be randomly divided into three groups according to age: 18-44 years old, 45-59 years old, and 60-80 years old. The initial dose of rocuronium for pre-injection was set at 0.04mg/kg according to previous literature and preliminary test results. The dose of rocuronium was according to the patients' myofibrillation level. If there is no myofibrillation (negative reaction), the dose of rocuronium in the next patient will be reduced until the patient has myofibrillation. If there is myofibrillation (positive reaction), the dose of rocuronium will be increased in the next patient until the patient is no fibrillation.
The appearance of myofibrillation will be observed and recorded. The median effective dose of rocuronium for the prevention of myofibrillation caused by the injection of succinylcholine will be determined."

The investigators will enroll 300 consecutive patients with asymptomatic disease. All patients will undergo a baseline clinical examination, with computed tomography or MRI to assess cerebral lesions, and health records will be collected. Clinical variables will be measured with standard procedures after overnight fasting. Patients with evidence of heart failure, valvular defects, malignant neoplasms, or secondary causes of hypertension will be excluded. Specimens of the portion of carotid bifurcation that showed maximum disease will be obtained from atherectomy and will be cut in two halves and frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in in 10% buffered formalin for subsequent analyses. Plaque specimens will be then used to assess the presence and the amount of volatile organic compounds and microplastics through pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To corroborate these findings, plaque specimens will be also observed with transmission electron microscopy to visually identify microplastics within the atheroma and obtain further evidence and structural insights. Plaques will be also analysed through immunohistochemistry, ELISAs, and Western Blot to quantify inflammatory, i.e. NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, IL-6, TNFα, NF-kB, and CD68, and plaque stability markers, i.e. MMP-9 and collagen, in order to explore whether the presence of microplastics is associated with a poorer plaque phenotype. The groups (composed post-hoc) of patients with polluted plaques vs non-polluted plaques will be compared for the expression of all these markers. After carotid endarterectomy, patients will be followed-up and monitored for the incidence of a composite outcome constituted by non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, and all-cause mortality, which represent the main and the only hard endpoint of the study. Patients will be categorized (post-hoc) as having polluted plaques (having detectable levels of at least one pollutant) or non-polluted plaques. Cox regression analysis will be used to examine the association between the presence of microplastics and the incidence of the composite outcome, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and smoking. Among those with polluted plaques, the abundance of pollutants, i.e. the sum, will be used to categorize patients into terciles. Cox models, adjusted for the same variables, will be run to explore the relationship between the burden of microplastics and the outcome. P values < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant."

The study aimed to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). The telemonitored group used the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smartwatch for remote monitoring, while the control group followed standard care protocols. The study was conducted in a single center and divided into six phases. The first phase involved outpatient preoperative care, where patients underwent a comprehensive anamnesis during the preoperative consultation and were informed about the study. In the second phase, patients were hospitalized and provided with the Informed Consent Form (ICF) if they met the inclusion criteria. Demographic data were collected during this phase. During the surgical phase (third phase), intraoperative data were collected after cardiac surgery. The fourth phase focused on postoperative care, where patients were evaluated, and health measures such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were collected using the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smartwatch and reference devices. After discharge, the fifth phase involved a 30-day telemonitoring period, where patients were remotely monitored using the smartwatch. Health data, including BP, HR, ECG, and SpO2, were collected three times a day during this phase. The medical team provided clinical interventions when alerts were received via the FAPO SI³ platform. In the final phase, patients returned for an outpatient visit at InCor, where health measures were collected again using the smartwatch and reference devices. Additionally, a World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) questionnaire was administered to assess patients' quality of life. ECG reports issued by the smartwatch were also reviewed. The control group consisted of patients with heart disease who underwent surgical procedures and received standard outpatient and post-surgical follow-up according to institutional routines and protocols. Overall, the study aimed to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with POAF. The telemonitored group used the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smartwatch for remote monitoring, while the control group followed standard care protocols."

The program involves coherent groups of motivated participants in smaller groups of 7-10 persons. Participants are adults with body mass index (BMI) in the range of overweight or obese and are motivated to change their lifestyle. During the five days of the program held outside the medical facility positive interaction and mutual support of the participants develop in the group together with education and an informal approach, along with practical workshops on nutrition, daily physical activity and psychological support, patients receive practical recommendations for life. Follow-up continues in the form of short additional educational lectures, support, and body weight measurement after one month, three months, six months and after a year. Participants are encouraged to stay in contact between the meetings using the same instant messaging platform in a form of a closed group, and a leader of the program is sending inspirational messages and advice regularly. Initially, after 3 and 6 months a metabolic parameter evaluation is performed (fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile) as well as blood pressure is measured. Individual anthropometric measurements of the participants are carried out on the first day of the program and continued at every visit. The parameters taken are body height (cm), body mass (kg), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm), BMI (kg/m2), the proportion of fat tissue (%) and muscle tissue (%), basal metabolism (kcal) and visceral adipose tissue. On the first day of the program, an initial questionnaire is filled out exploring sociodemographic and health data, data on eating habits, physical activity and psychological. Education During the 5-day participants have lectures explaining in a simple short interactive lecture a different topic related to obesity followed by discussion. Topics explain concerns about obesity as a disease, the background of obesity, metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of obesity, nonverbal communication and obesity, the plateau phenomenon and the epidemiology of obesity. Nutrition The program helps participants to make healthier food choices by acquiring knowledge of nutrition basics and meal planning. During the program, the participants learn how to prepare easy and healthy meals for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snack, read food labels and measure portion sizes with their hands. Physical activity Participants wear accelerometers before the beginning of the program. During the program, they are going to have daily 10' physical exercises (exercise and explanations) in a form of a complex of exercises designed for all adults, especially for the working population. The set of exercises consists of stretching and mobility exercises that are performed with light, moderate movements and can be performed without hindrance in everyday work clothes. They are going to be educated on how and how much to be physically active and how to choose the appropriate physical activity and activity intensity. Psychological support Daily support involves behavioural change that is working on goal setting and recognizing the advantages and disadvantages of changing behaviour. Nex workshop works on recognizing the difference between emotional hunger and physical hunger, identifying personal triggers, and finding alternatives to emotional eating. Participants identify the key distortions in the negative thoughts of dieters that prevent them from reaching and maintaining their desired weight and learn how to correct these distortions. Also, they learn what it means to have a positive or negative body image, how body image affects mental and physical health, and what we can do to improve our body image. Evaluation At the end of each lecture/interactive workshop, participants fill out an evaluation questionnaire. At the end of the education, on the 5th day of education, the participants fille out the final questionnaire (outcome evaluation)."

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP); It is a disease characterized by incomplete vascularization of the retina seen in premature and low birth weight infants, the etiology and pathogenesis of which are unknown, causing vision loss. There is an increase in the incidence and severity of ROP development in direct proportion to the decrease in the week of birth and birth weight. While ROP is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The incidence of ROP was found to be 6.1%, and advanced ROP was reported in 6 per thousand. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams, and severe ROP was reported in 19 of these babies. Thanks to the increasing frequency of preterm birth in recent years and scientific and technological advances in neonatology, life expectancy is extended up to the 23rd week of gestation. However, this increased the incidence of retinopathy. Therefore, it is of great importance for neotologists, pediatricians and nurses who care for preterms to know the pathophysiology, staging, risk factors and principles of appropriate care for them in reducing the incidence, possible complications and mortality rates of ROP. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. These physiological changes observed after the examination continue for 24 hours. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce pain. As a pharmacological method, there is no other routine method used to reduce pain other than the administration of local anesthetic drops before the examination. Because of this situation, nurses apply various non-pharmacological methods to alleviate pain. These methods are; breast milk, sucrose use, oral dextrose use, non-nutritive sucking, positioning, listening to music and mother's voice. In the literature review; In a study evaluating the effectiveness of sucrose combination with non-nutritive sucking, they reported that pain was moderately reduced and more studies are needed. In another study (2015), it was concluded that topical anesthesia and oral dextrose were not effective in reducing pain in both groups. In a study comparing the effectiveness of breast milk and sucrose, it is recommended to use breast milk because of the rapid recovery of the baby after the ROP examination. In the comparison of the position, which is another non-pharmacological method, with the routine practice in the study conducted in 2019; It has been concluded that the frock position is more effective in relieving pain. In another study, it was stated that the mother's voice as music therapy also showed an analgesic effect and accelerated the recovery after the ROP examination. In the light of this information, when we look at the literature, no specific study was found in which a rain stick and The Happiest Baby music were used to reduce pain and increase the comfort level during the ROP examination. Therefore, this research will be carried out to determine the effect of different music played on the pain and comfort level of premature babies during the retinopathy examination."

Dry eye disease (DED) is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface and the tear film, which is characterized by a loss of homeostasis of the tear film, and accompanied by ocular symptoms, in which tear film instability and hyperosmolarity, ocular surface inflammation and damage, and neurosensory abnormalities play etiological roles. The prevalence of DED is increasing worldwide, and it is estimated that 5-30% of the general population is affected by DED. DED is a chronic disease that can cause significant discomfort and impairment of vision-related quality of life. The management of DED is challenging, and the current treatment options are limited.

The purpose of this study is to assess the management of DE by combining IPL and DQS eye drops.

Sleep is one of the basic physiological needs of man and is necessary for the normal functioning of the body. Sleep disorders can impair cognitive function, decision-making ability, exercise capacity, and immune system. Sleep disorders, which may occur in the perioperative period as short-term or long-term, affect many patients. Studies have shown that approximately 8.8-79.1% of patients experience perioperative sleep disorders, and this situation can continue for a long time after surgery. According to animal and human studies, anesthetic agents may cause sleep disturbances in the postoperative period. Anesthetics can disrupt the normal sleep-wake cycle and thus cause sleep insufficiency and poor sleep quality. Since postoperative pain and emotional changes will also cause sleep disturbances, the view that general anesthesia impairs postoperative sleep quality has not yet been proven. Pain is the most important risk factor for sleep disturbance in the perioperative period. There is a very serious interaction between pain and sleep. Pain can exacerbate sleep disorders. At the same time, sleep disorders can make the pain worse. Perioperative pain accompanies physical discomfort and is very common, especially in osteoarthritis patients. The goals of total hip arthroplasty (TKA) include relief of these pains and improvement of physical function. Different types of surgery have varying effects on sleep quality. Patients report that they experience more sleep disruption due to pain after orthopedic surgery. Depending on the greater trauma caused by major surgery, the sleep quality of the patients may be worse. The elderly and female gender are more likely to experience sleep disorders. Environmental factors and healthcare practices in the hospital may contribute to sleep disorders. Postoperative environment change, inadequate beds, noise and lights in the ward, medical staff, night treatment and nursing controls, machine noises, postoperative diets and warnings from the urinary catheter are additional factors that affect patients' sleep. Evaluation of sleep disorders is mainly based on clinical symptoms (difficulty falling asleep, early awakening, night terrors, nightmares or abnormal behavior during the sleep period) and auxiliary objective scales. Subjective sleep quality assessment mainly scales: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale (PIRS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Athens Insomnia Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS). It is in the form. The most commonly used assessment in clinical studies is the PSQI. PSQI has high reliability and validity, but evaluates over a one-month period. The PIRS_20 scale, which is a self-assessment survey, is a scale created by the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh and evaluates the participants' sleep quality in the last week. It generally consists of a questionnaire with a total of twenty items, including subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, and sleep disorders. Scoring ranges from 0 to 60. A score of 20 and above indicates poor sleep quality, while as the score increases, sleep quality deteriorates. As another assessment of sleep quality, the ISI is a self-rating scale that measures insomnia symptoms and consequences. Substances include difficulties in initiating sleep and maintaining sleep; It is designed to assess satisfaction with current sleep patterns, disruption in daily life, cognitive impairments, and the degree of anxiety or worry caused by sleep disturbance. The severity of insomnia is also determined by the total score of these items. Additionally, ESS is used to evaluate the tendency to sleep during the day. Sleep disorders can negatively impact patient recovery, contributing to higher rates of postoperative complications such as neurological and cardiovascular morbidity and delayed postoperative recovery. They are also risk factors for the development of delirium. Despite posing a significant threat to public health, sleep disorders remain poorly understood, underdiagnosed, and poorly managed, especially in perioperative patients. The potential negative consequences of sleep disorders indicate that more attention should be paid to this issue. Risk factors that increase sleep problems include postoperative pain, depression, anxiety, and physical disabilities. Sleep problems experienced the night before surgery may affect postoperative pain due to various other factors. has an even more significant effect. Sleep quality assessment is not a part of the pre-anaesthesia routine evaluation of patients and adequate attention is not paid to perioperative management. The type of anesthesia is also one of the factors on sleep quality. It is known that the anesthesia process ("

Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an emerging breast imaging modality that is based on dual-energy mammography and the injection of iodinated contrast agent. A typical CEM study consists of a low-energy image (equal to a FFDM image) and a recombined image (in which areas of contrast enhancement can be appreciated). However, the situation can occur that lesions are visible only on the recombined (contrast) images (in this protocol defined as 'recombined-only lesions' or ROLs). In these cases, we need to perform 'contrast-enhanced stereotactic biopsy' (CESB), in which CEM is used as a targeting modality. However, experiences with CESB are still limited and one of the most urgent questions that need to be answered is the amount of tissue sampling that is required to reach a final diagnosis. We aim to study where the cut off will be in terms of tissue sampling volume needed (i.e., number of biopsies) for a reliable diagnosis."

Osteoarthritis is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in adults. It is a degenerative joint disease affecting 15%-40% of people more than 40 years of age. The term osteoarthritis was authored in 1886 by the English doctor, John Kent Spender. Clinical assessment to recognize OA from RA and other comparable conditions turned out to be broadly acknowledged by the main decade of the twentieth century enormous because of the endeavors set forward by Archibald E. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition that causes other joint tissues to lose gross cartilage and to experience morphological damage. Pathological changes seen in knee osteoarthritis joints include progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage, thickening of the subchondral bone, formation of osteophytes, variable degrees of inflammation of the synovium, degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee and hypertrophy of the joint capsule. Biomechanical factor that is assumed to contribute to the etiology of OA is laxity of knee joint, which is described as the rotation or displacement of femur from tibia. One research found that Varus-valgus laxity in patients with unaltered knees and unilateral OA is wider than in stable healthy participants, indicating knee joint laxity may be disease predisposing. the progress of the lateral and medial knee OA, as defined by narrowing of joint space and a degradation of physical activity, was found to have been linked with lower limb valgus-Varus alignment. The main focus in OA management is on promoting self-management, reducing pain, optimize function, and modifying the disease process and its effects. The primary treatment for OA knee conservatively is physiotherapy which includes strength training, modalities, knee bracing, resistance training and Kinesiotaping. Resistance exercise can reduce knee pain severity and leg strength in participants with symptomatic knee OA. Exercise interventions using free weights or machines have generally focused on movements with concentric muscle contractions. Previous interventions were developed based on loads lifted during the concentric phase. Kinesiotape (KT), is an elastic woven-cotton strip with a heat- sensitive acrylic adhesive structure.

The study aims to evaluate the potential superiority, from the point of view of therapeutic efficacy in depression, of the approach of combined administration of tDCS and MCT, compared with interventions based tDCS alone or MCT alone. The study is interventional, nonpharmacological, using medical devices, nonprofit. The intervention involves the use of a neuro-stimulation technique, the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS), combined with a psychotherapy intervention, metacognitive therapy (MetaCognitive Therapy, MCT). TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique involving the transcranial application of a low-amperage electric current at a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been demonstrated how such stimulation has a neuromodulating effect on synaptic plasticity, with efficacy in unipolar major depression. The technique also has a good safety, as it is not associated with major side effects. MCT is based on the metacognitive model, according to which psychopathological processes are consequent to a cognitive style characterized by repetitive forms of thinking (such as rumination) and maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and thought suppression. The MCT, through attention training techniques, detached mindfulness and behavioral interventions on metacognitions, has shown effectiveness in major depressive disorder comparable to that of psychotherapeutic interventions considered, within psychotherapies, to be first-line such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. The experimental design will be that of a randomized, double-blind study with three arms of treatment, each consisting of 8 sessions, involving the administration of 1) the neurostimulation intervention (tDCS), 2) of the psychotherapeutic intervention alone (MCT), 3) of both techniques in consecution (tDCS-MCT). This design is aimed at evaluating a potential additive/synergistic effect of the two interventions when combined. During the tDCS sessions, each lasting 20 minutes, the patient will apply the technique of attention training, aimed at further activating the region stimulated by neurostimulation, so as to so as to amplify the plasticity stimulated by tDCS, achieving a synergistic effect. To follow, a 40-minute MCT session will be carried out. The effectiveness of these interventions will be assessed by heteroadministered and self-administered at time zero, after treatment, at two follow-ups of 6 and 12 months. Before and after the treatment cycle (tDCS sessions and MCT sessions), a subgroup of patients will be explored, in the context of a pilot study, the TMS-EEG correlates of the change in symptomatology depression, which can be correlated with the different proposed therapeutic interventions."

CRLBP of the lumbosacral region is a disorder that is closely linked with socioeconomic consequences. The incidence of lower back pain among workers is approximately 13%. Out of which, CRLBP is responsible for 11%. In the lumbosacral region, radicular pain has an occurrence rate of 10 % to 25%. Key interventions by physical therapists involve pain relieving modalities, stretching, muscle conditioning, lumbar traction, and awareness about correct postures that lead to useful exercises. As the reason behind the radicular low back pain is the spinal nerve compression due to the spinal canal impingement, the lumbar traction lightens the pain through vertebral separation producing decompression on the pressed nerve. Radicular low back pain shows diverse symptoms, it can be self-limiting, staying only for a short interval with no aftereffects, or can be a key concern behind long-term disability and work loss. The narrative on the effectiveness of vertical traction as a component of physical therapy modalities is contradictory. Despite the fact that lumbar traction has been preferred over other methods for the treatment of lumbar disk disorders, it is usually not advised in the treatment of acute low back pain because of the efficiency of more active treatment options. The aim of the study is to determine the effects of vertical sitting versus supine lying traction on pain, range of motion, and function in patients with radicular low back pain. This study may help physiotherapists to have an estimate of the best possible position for applying traction in patients with radicular low back pain. The conclusion of this study might provide therapists with an optimum traction treatment protocol for CRLBP."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting 1-2% of the population. It is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of stroke, accounting for 15-20% of the 50,000 strokes suffered by Canadians each year. The annual stroke risk in untreated patients is 4.5%, but varies 10-fold based on risk factors captured in clinical prediction tools. Given that oral anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk by 65%, the majority of AF-associated strokes are potentially preventable. All current Canadian and international AF guidelines strongly recommend use of clinical prediction rules to assess stroke risk, and anticoagulation of high-risk patients. However, population-based studies continue to document significant rates of risk-discordant stroke prevention therapy. Addressing this care gap is a major knowledge translation challenge. Patient decision aids are knowledge translation tools that can facilitate a process of shared decision-making to improve patient knowledge and decision quality. These tools have the potential to improve both initial therapy selection and adherence, ultimately reducing the risks of AF-associated stroke and unnecessary bleeding. We have developed and performed initial user testing for a new, web-based decision aid, called Risk Assessment and Personal preferences to Improve Decisions for Atrial Fibrillation (RAPID AFib). The tool has 3 sequential functions: (1) it estimates an individual's risk for stroke and for bleeding using published risk scores; (2) it allows them to interactively compare OACs to select one or more therapies that best matches their risk profile and individual preferences ; and (3) it summarizes the risk information and their selected therapy to facilitate discussion with their physician in a Summary Report. This study represents the next step in this program of research, by performing a formal evaluation of the performance of this tool in a real-world clinical setting. Primary Objective: To conduct a pilot study to establish the acceptability of the RAPID AFib tool and its impact on the process of shared decision-making for stroke prevention therapy in patients with recent onset AF Hypothesis: The RAPID Afib decision aid will be acceptable for both patients and clinicians, and will lead to more effective shared decision-making than standard care among patients with AF who are considering OAC. Methods: Study Design: Prospective, randomized pilot study. Study procedures: Clinic staff will screen referred patients, then the research team will approach them to confirm eligibility, request informed consent for participation, and collect baseline demographic and clinical data. Consenting patients will be randomized 1:1 using a web-based application linked to the study database to receive the study intervention or control. Randomization will be stratified by clinic site. All patients will be invited to review an evidence-based website providing information about AF and its management. Intervention group: Patients randomized to the RAPID AFib intervention will be sent a link to the decision aid website and asked to complete the decision aid before their upcoming visit. They will also be asked to bring the Summary Report to their upcoming clinic visit. A copy of the Summary Report will be added to the patient chart for clinician review. Control group: Patients randomized to the control group will attend their clinic visit as scheduled, with no further direction from the study team. Follow-up: Study participation will end after completion of a post-visit survey."

Kienbock's disease is a common cause of wrist pain in young adults. It is a disease of the lunate bone in the wrist. The disease is caused by a lack of blood supply to the lunate bone. This can cause the bone to collapse and become deformed. The disease can cause pain, stiffness, and weakness in the wrist.
The goal of this study is to compare two different surgical techniques for treating Kienbock's disease. The two techniques are radial shortening and capitate shortening.
In radial shortening, a small amount of bone is removed from the end of the radius bone in the forearm. This helps to take pressure off the lunate bone and reduce pain.
In capitate shortening, a small amount of bone is removed from the end of the capitate bone in the wrist. This helps to take pressure off the lunate bone and reduce pain.
The study will compare the two techniques to see which one is more effective in relieving pain and improving wrist function."

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. The majority of patients are diagnosed with locally advanced or metastatic disease, and only 20% of patients are eligible for curative resection. The remaining patients are treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. The prognosis of PC is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 8% for patients undergoing surgery.
The main risk factors for PC are age, smoking, obesity, diabetes, and chronic pancreatitis. The majority of patients with PC are elderly and have comorbidities, including malnutrition, sarcopenia, and frailty. These conditions are associated with a higher risk of postoperative complications and poorer outcomes.
Prehabilitation is a multimodal intervention aimed at improving the patient's physical, nutritional, and psychological status before surgery. Prehabilitation has been shown to reduce postoperative complications and improve patient outcomes in patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-week preoperative multimodal intervention in patients with localized PC undergoing surgery. The intervention will include exercise training, nutritional therapy, and anxiety reduction techniques. The primary outcome will be the reduction of postoperative complications as determined with the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) score at 90 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes will include functional capacity, nutritional status, generic and disease-specific health-related quality of life, and the levels of circulating cytokines and cancer cachexia-related factors."

The study uses a longitudinal, within-person design with two parallel conditions. In one condition, youth receive a 6-week canine therapy intervention. The other condition consists of treatment as usual. The subject population are youth that are in a full-time residential treatment facility in Lawrence Hall. All studies activities take place in Lawrence Hall. Please note that per Lawrence Hall policy, youth are selected by Lawrence Hall staff to participate in the Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy program while in residence. A group of closely-matched youth will also be selected by Lawrence Hall staff to serve as the waitlist control (treatment-as-usual) group. The Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy intervention is a 1.25 hour structured curriculum that will occur weekly across a period of 6 weeks. The program will be delivered by the Canine Therapy Corps (CTCorps). Youth will work with CTC-affiliate staff, including trained dog-handler teams, a canine behavior expert, and a clinical supervisor to engage in a series of structured activities progress throughout the intervention. Week 1 is a meet-and-greet session where youth are introduced to all dog-handler teams participating in the program and will be asked to select a team to work with for the following sessions. Each youth is assigned their own dog-handler team. Weeks 2 cover activities regarding dog obedience, building from mastering basic commands which the dog already knows (such as sit, stay') to the introduction of new tricks that the dog has not yet learned. In Weeks 3, youth will continue to work on mastering the new tricks with their dog-handler team and will also begin dog agility training. The agility training session progress in terms of complexity of number and types of obstacles. Week 4 is for proofing all skills (obedience, trick, agility) learned in previous sessions. Week 5 continues proofing all skills and is discussion of the graduation structure and dress rehearsal, and Week 6 is a graduation ceremony where family and friends are invited to observe the progress each youth has made with their dog-handler team. In Weeks 1-5, the goals of each session are outlined at the beginning of the session and brief education is provided regarding the session goals. Weeks 2-5 also include a review of the skills/activities covered in prior weeks. At the end of sessions 1-5, youth are asked to reflect on what they did during the session, including discussion of what they did really well, what they wanted to work on further, and goals for the next session. Research staff will be present during all sessions to record fidelity measures. The Positive and Negative Affect Scale will be administered on-site by research staff at the beginning and end of each intervention session.

Early pregnancy loss is very common, approximately one in four women will experience a miscarriage in their lifetime. The etiology of pregnancy loss remains largely unknown, although genetic, anatomical, endocrinological and immunological abnormalities have been implicated. It is known that embryonic/fetal chromosomal aberrations contributed to approximately 50% of early pregnancy loss, among which 60-70% were aneuploidies, largely can be detected by the current gold standard karyotyping approach recommended by various international societies. However, the drawbacks of conventional karyotyping include the risk of culture failure, maternal cell contamination (MCC), limited detection resolution (5-10 Mb), and differential growth of specific cell lineages which could hinder the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities, particularly mosaicisms. Additional genetic factors beyond the resolution of karyotyping are not well studied. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has brought genetic testing to new frontiers, expanding the scope of detectable genomic variants. Moreover, its significant reduction in costs over the years has facilitated the implementation of genetic diagnostic testing. Our customized shallow read-depth genome sequencing analytical pipeline, namely low-pass genome sequencing (GS), enables efficient and cost-effective detection of genome-wide copy-number variants (CNVs, >50 kb) and low-level chromosomal mosaicisms (as low as 10%). Furthermore, the roles of cryptic structural rearrangements, absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) were less understood in current studies. Various versions of sequencing platforms targeting at different variants were already established and validated in the Prenatal Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, including FetalSeq, ChromoSeq, and 30xWGS. Human endometrial and decidual tissues, containing a myriad of immune and inflammatory populations, are immunologically dynamic. In the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, T-cells are the most abundant leukocyte population in the endometrium, but they decrease to 20% of all stromal leukocytes during early pregnancy. Macrophages are also present in endometrial tissues during all phases of the menstrual cycle, but are most abundant in late secretory endometrium and in decidual tissues during early normal pregnancy. The most abundant population (70%) of stromal leukocytes observed in late secretory endometrium and in the decidua during early normal pregnancy are large granular lymphocytes (LGL) bearing the unique phenotype: CD56++, CD16-, CD57-, CD2±, CD38±, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-. Increased mean numbers of CD56+ cells have been reported in secretory endometrium of women with recurrent miscarriages. The hypothesis that the balance between T-cell subsets (i.e. CD4+ and CD8+ cells) plays a role in maintaining successful pregnancy is controversial. Some studies have reported no difference between the proportions of T-cell subsets in either secretory endometrium or first trimester decidua from women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss compared with normal controls; while others have described a shift towards a higher ratio of CD8+ T-cells in endometrial biopsies from women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss. The activation status of T-cell populations may provide another indicator of cellular immunity potentially involved in pregnancy loss. The IL-2 receptor has been reported to be absent on T-cells in normal first trimester decidual tissues using immunohistochemical techniques; however, using flow cytometry, CD3+CD25+ activated T-cells have been identified in decidual tissue. CD69 is another early activation marker expressed on the surface of T-cells. A proportion of T-cells constitutively expresses this marker throughout the menstrual cycle and in normal early pregnancy. Approximately 60% of spontaneous abortions are attributable to numerically abnormal chromosomes in the developing conceptus, yet limited data to date addressing immunological phenomena in the decidua of miscarried women has compared their data relative to well-defined chromosomal abnormalities belonging to conceptuses. This is important since the chromosome abnormality trisomy 16, which occurs in 2"

This study will use a real-world study design drawing on routinely collected data to compare outcomes for patients recruited to a Hybrid PR Intervention with a propensity-matched Control Group that has previously received Standard PR. Additional data will be collected from the Hybrid PR group (via Active+me REMOTE / Trial Surveys) to provide supporting evidence relating to uptake, adherence, clinical outcomes (not routinely recorded in standard practice), and usability/acceptability of the Hybrid PR programme. Patients with chronic respiratory disease who are referred to the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme will be screened for eligibility to participate in the Hybrid PR Trial. Informed consent will obtained in eligible patients who wish to take part. Recruited participants will follow a hybrid PR programme (Intervention Group). The Control Group will be patients that have previously received a standard pulmonary rehabilitation programme and are matched on specified criteria including age, sex, measure of respiratory disability, index of multiple deprivation, exercise capacity and hospital vs community location. Following their informed consent the Hybrid PR Intervention Group will attend an onboarding session where a member of the clinical research team will i) download the Active+me REMOTE App onto patients' smartphone (or provide patients without a smartphone, one on which the App is preloaded), and ii) connect the patients' Active+me REMOTE account to the clinical team via a secure clinical portal. The clinician will also assign appropriate monitoring devices (e.g. BP monitor, Inhaler tracker, smart (weight) scale, pulse oximeter, peak flow monitor) to the participant. After saving the participant's details the patient's App dashboard will be displayed and (as required) the clinician will demonstrate exercise/ educational content of the App. Participants will have a preliminary in-person assessment with a member of the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Team (as part of routine care). The participant will then follow the 8-week Hybrid PR intervention involving two exercise classes per week. While this is an 8-week programme, this may be extended to up to 12 weeks for some patients (for example, if the patient is not able to attend 2 sessions per week). After completing the Hybrid PR programme, the participant will have a discharge assessment (as part of routine care). Demographic data from routine medical records and data on service location (i.e. hospital vs community setting) will be collected at baseline for the Hybrid PR Intervention and the Control Group.

The effect of a 2-week home-based training program with a 4-week follow-up will be examined by including 36 PD patients, who will be randomized (strata: age, H&Y stage) in the experimental or control group. Sample size was based on the pilot study using the SSP-task showing an average movement time of 7.4s ± 3.43 in PD for sequence swiping at baseline in ST. Based on literature, the researchers assumed an improvement of 20.2% following training at retention. For the control group, the researchers expect a deterioration in performance of 5.6% after a period without training based on the changes observed in the control groups of recent studies investigating manual dexterity parameters over time. Using an α = 0.05 and β = 0.20, a sample size was calculated for repeated measures ANOVA analysis with a within-between factor interaction design (within: pre - post - retention; between: experimental group - control group). Consequently, total sample size was estimated at 30 participants. Taking a 20% dropout rate into account, this resulted in a total of 18 participants in each group. The experimental group will train the SSP task for a duration of two weeks, whereas the control group will not receive any intervention. On day 1 (T0), all participants will undergo an extensive screening session, including motor and non-motor screening. Testing can be performed at the subject's home or in our laboratory according to patients' preference. The average slide duration (in ms) and the accuracy (as the number of correctly formed patterns in %) on the SSP-task will be recorded as the main digitised outcomes, objectively recorded via the tablet. In addition to evaluating the immediate effects of touchscreen training, the investigators will also test retention effects after four weeks without training as a secondary outcome. Further, consolidation of learning will be assessed using secondary outcomes such as the SSP-test in ST and DT conditions to assess automaticity of learning, the mobile phone task to test transfer of learning (MPT, typing a predefined telephone number on a smartphone). As tertiary outcomes, specific questionnaires to capture motor and cognitive performance will be administered. Following the baseline session, the experimental group will receive 10 training sessions of the SSP-training (5 days/week, 10 min/session) over a period of two weeks. The training is home-based and unsupervised but is extensively explained by an expert trainer. The control group does not receive training. Both immediately after training (T1) and after a four-week retention period (T2), touchscreen motor skills will be re-assessed at home. The most appropriate linear mixed models will be used to analyse SSP performance, with group (intervention - control) as between-subject factor and time (baseline - post - retention) as within-subject factor. LEDD and other confounders will be included as covariates. PD is a highly heterogeneous disorders, not only affecting motor but also cognitive functions. In fact, up to 80% of patients develops dementia over the disease course. Previous studies have identified global cognitive function as important determinants of training success. Therefore, cognitive function will be assessed extensively during the baseline session to investigate the association with training responsiveness. A global cognitive screen will consist of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Moreover, 2 specific tests will be used to assess each cognitive subdomain. Attention and working memory will be assessed using a digit and visual span forward and backward. The trail making test and alternating names test will be used for executive function. Visuospatial function will be examined using the short form of the Benton's judgement of line orientation and the Rey Osterrieth Complex figure. The 30-min recall of the latter test will also be used to assess memory, together with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning test. The Boston naming test and"

Postpartum blues, depression, and psychosis are frequent, burdensome disorders acknowledged by WHO. Investigations into their mechanisms, possible causes, and treatments are strongly needed. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of intensified tactile contact with a newborn on the emotional transformation of women after physiological delivery. The experimental group received an intervention in the form of intensified tactile contact of a mother with the newborn. The control group received no intervention similar to experimental intervention. The results showed that the intervention had a positive effect on the emotional transformation of women after physiological delivery. The level of depression and anxiety decreased, and the level of positive affects and parental competence increased. The results of the study may be useful in the development of new, non-pharmacological methods of postpartum depression prevention and treatment."

Frostbite injury has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for as long as humans have experienced cold winters. When frostbite occurs, there are two primary mechanisms through which tissue damage occurs, though the main mechanism focused on here is systemic cooling. Frostbite is a multiphase process that starts with systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury, but it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities that have been used is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. At Regions Hospital, the main diagnostic method that has been used for over 20 years is conventional angiography. This clearly demonstrates the microvasculature of the tissues and allows the intra-arterial catheter directed sheaths to be placed to start thrombolytics, heparin, and vasodilators to treat the tissue ischemia. Other diagnostic modalities used elsewhere include Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT imaging, and indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography. All of these imaging modalities demonstrate the perfusion of the affected tissue but do not allow for directed delivery of thrombolytics. In institutions that use these imaging techniques, thrombolytics are typically delivered in an intravenous fashion rather than intra-arterial. ICG microangiography is a technology that has had rapidly expanding applications in recent decades. These have included retinal imaging, determining perfusion of colorectal anastomoses, biliary imaging, and assessing the blood supply of tissue flaps. It has recently been used in diagnosis of frostbite with good correlation with severe final amputation levels. It is easy to use, non-radiating, can be performed at the bedside, and cheaper than other imaging modalities. Given that every hospital has different diagnostic and treatment algorithms, these different imaging modalities have rarely been compared in the same patient. The current best metric is comparing the imaging modality with the amount of tissue that is amputated as demonstrated in prior studies cited here. This research application provides a unique opportunity to compare two imaging modalities head-to-head in the same patient and determine their concordance or discordance."

The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has antioxidant (vitamins, flavonoids, phytosterols, minerals, terpenes and phenols) and anti-inflammatory (oleic acid, polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids) properties that are thought to be effective in improving oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers. The MIND diet can also reduce intestinal permeability with its abundant fiber content (prebiotic effect). It has been reported that the supplementation of some nutrients (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, etc.) that have an important place in the composition of the MIND diet in this group of athletes has a positive effect on some of these biomarkers. However, the studies in the literature are limited, and there is no study involving the MIND diet in American football players. This study was planned considering that the MIND diet may have positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players, who are exposed to repetitive head impacts as a nature of this contact sport. American football players playing in the pro league will be included in this study. The sample size was calculated using the G*Power V. 3.1.9.6 program. This study will include two groups and two measurements. Accordingly, a total of 30 athletes, 15 in each group, with 95% confidence (1-α), 95% test power (1-β) and f=0.6 effect size; with 80% confidence (1-α), 80% test power (1-β) and f=0.6 effect size, a total of 20 athletes, 10 in each group, should be included. At the beginning of the research, a face-to-face questionnaire will be used to question the athletes' American football history and player positions, socio-demographics, general health and nutritional habits. Before the start of the study, a 7-day food consumption record will be taken from the athletes. MIND scores will be questioned before the study and every week till the end of the study according to the frequency of food consumption in the MIND composition scale. It will be used to assess participants' adherence to the MIND diet. Accordingly, the MIND diet components include ten food groups (green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, bean types, whole grains, seafood, poultry, olive oil, and wine) that are healthy for the brain. There are also five food groups (red meat, butter and margarine, cheese, pastries and sweets and fried / fast food / fast food) that are considered unhealthy. Frequencies of food consumption (daily, weekly, monthly) are questioned according to whether these 10 food groups specified in the template are preferred based on portion and meal or as a primary, and as a result, scoring is made as 0, 0.5 and 1 points for each food group. The highest score is 15 points. Because the MIND diet template does not have specific scores for diet adherence, below the median score (7.5) will be considered low adherence. According to the MIND diet composition scale, those with a MIND diet score of <7.5 points will be included in the study, while those with a score of ≥7.5 will be excluded from the study. At the beginning of the study, body composition measurements (anthropometric measurements and bioelectrical impedance analysis) will be taken from the athletes along with the Pittsburgh sleep quality index scale scores, diet inflammatory index, and the World Health Organization quality of life scale-short form. Oxidative stress, inflammation, neurodegenerative risk and other associated biomarkers will be analyzed in blood samples. Athletes will be randomized into two groups; MIND diet and control group. The players in the control group will sustain their habitual nutrition, while the current nutrition of the players in the MIND diet group will be adapted to the MIND diet according to the food groups in the MIND diet components and their consumption frequencies. In this context, the players will be informed about the general characteristics of the MIND diet and its importance in terms of their health. To help the participants in this regard, information will be given about the changes in the size and amount of foods and their portions in general with the Meal and Food Photo Catalogue.

This research aims to develop an AI algorithm that can differentiate between benign and malignant soft tissue masses. While an algorithm can be developed using existing routine data the researchers would like to investigate if adding quantitative MR images could make it more accurate. Patients who are already having a scan for sarcoma will be asked if they consent to extra MR images being acquired. These images will be used to provide extra information to the AI. The extra images will add a maximum of 10 minutes to the patients' standard MRI scan, meaning patients will not need to make an extra trip or undergo any extra procedures. Study participants will not need to receive MR contrast as part of this research. The extra images will not be used to make a diagnosis during this research. A small subset of patients will be asked if they would be willing to come for a second scan so that the researchers can see how reliable the measurements are, but this will be entirely optional."

Gingival phenotype refers to gingival thickness (GT) and keratinized tissue width (KTW). Gingival phenotypes can be classified as scalloped and thin or flat and thick gingiva. Thin gingival phenotype are very friable and might be prone to recede in response to traumatic insults, such as plaque-related inflammation and traumatic toothbrushing. Studies have believed that HA accelerates the wound healing process, and promotes regeneration, as it maintains the viability of oral fibroblasts, increases their proliferative and migratory abilities, and enhances the expression of genes encoding type III collagen and transforming growth factor-β. Study has shown a statistically significant increase in gingival thickness when microneedling was performed along with i-PRF in comparison to standalone i-PRF. Given these characteristics,this study will be conducted to comparative evaluation of microneedling alone and along with hyaluronic acid on thin gingival phenotype. The present randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in the department of periodontics and oral implantology,Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences,Rohtak.Study design is of 24 months. Total 20 patients will be recruited on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria with thin periodontal phenotypes who had consulted to the Department of Periodontology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak. 20 systematically healthy patients having thin gingival phenotypes will be included in this split-mouth randomized controlled trial. For each patient, each side of the anterior mandible will be randomly allocated to one of the two procedures (MN or MN with Hyaluronic acid)using chit system. In the MN group microneedling will be done 1 mm below the gingival margin with 30-gauze lancet needles. In the HA with MN group, the selected sites of the gingiva will injected with cross-linked HA using a 30-gauge microneedle followed by microneedling. This described procedure will be repeated in both groups three times with intervals of 10 days. The GT, KTW, and periodontal indices: gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), and probing depth (PD) will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 9 months."

Migraine is a neurological disease/disorder originating in the central nervous system with difficulty modulating responses to common sensory stimuli. It is characterized by being unilateral, frontotemporal, pulsatile, of moderate or severe intensity, nausea and/or vomiting, sensitivity to movement, visual, auditory, and other afferent stimuli may appear. In addition, other symptoms such as fatigue, neck stiffness, decreased concentration, mood swings and yawning may appear, and the headache may be anticipated up to 48 hours. It has been hypothesized that the possible relationship between the eyes and the pathophysiology of migraine is due to the trigeminal-cervical complex, since if there is an alteration it would be established by a nociceptive impulse that can trigger central sensitization in the trigeminal nuclei. Today, the quintessential treatment is pharmacological where the excessive use of medications can trigger possible side effects such as depression, anxiety, weight gain, fatigue and drowsiness, among others, causing an alteration in the patient's quality of life more than of the migraine attack. Several studies show that there are other non-pharmacological treatment options such as manual physiotherapy and therapeutic exercise for migraines, and that it is effective for reducing the intensity and frequency of attacks, the use of medication and improving the quality of life. Being preventive treatments in order to avoid the frequency and intensity of these attacks. At present, the role of oculomotricity in headache, although it may be promising, has not been extensively studied. In the literature that the investigators have reviewed, the investigators have found very few studies that investigate manual therapy directly on the eyeball, despite the great relationship of the trigeminal-vascular nerve with migraines and how it influences the different variables. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the impact and possible additional benefits of adding an oculomotor treatment to a manual therapy protocol of the cervical region in patients with migraine."

The incidence of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in men significantly increases with age and is estimated to impact over 80% of men 70 to 80 years of age. HoLEP is one of many treatments for BPH and associated lower urinary tract symptoms. Compared to other minimally invasive surgical techniques for treatment of BPH, HoLEP has been found to have superior outcomes and is a prostate size-independent procedure with excellent durability, high efficacy, and low complications rates. However, transient stress urinary incontinence (SUI) following HoLEP may last for several months after surgery and can lead to diminished patient quality of life during the recovery period. Measures to prevent or reduce post-operative SUI following HoLEP, including PFPT, may improve patient outcomes. SUI is also commonly documented after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. The mechanism for incontinence in both RP and HoLEP is thought to at least partially be related to temporary weakness of the external urinary sphincter, which is part of the pelvic floor musculature. While it is unclear if post-operative PFPT alone reduces SUI for patients who have undergone RP, there is evidence that PFPT started pre-operatively and continued post-operatively can decrease SUI following RP. The utilization of pre-operative PFPT for patients undergoing HoLEP to reduce post-operative SUI is currently not well documented. To date, only one study has demonstrated evidence that PFPT prior to HoLEP may improve continence at 3 months. However, the study included patients with a BMI significantly lower than average in the United States, utilized an unclear PFPT program, and had a relatively small median prostate size ( 60 mL), which is important as studies have shown that prostate size can affect post-operative incontinence. We propose a prospective randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of standardized pre-operative PFPT in reducing SUI and improving patient QoL following HoLEP. This study will help determine the role of pre-operative PFPT in the management of HoLEP associated SUI."

The study hypothesis is that a lower starting dose of anticancer tablet treatments can lead to better treatment tolerability in older patients, while the benefits of treatment can be the same. The trial population consists of 30 patients aged 65 years or older, who are starting treatment with one of these anti cancer tablet treatments: pazopanib, olaparib, lenvatinib, sunitinib or palbociclib. This is a randomized study with 1:1 randomisation, stratified by type of anti-cancer treatment. The control group (half of the participants) will be treated with the standard-of-care, that means with the recommended starting dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose can be adjusted (lowered) if this is necessary, for example because of side effects, based on the judgment of the treating physician. The interventional group (half of the participants) will start with the lowest dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose will be increased every two weeks in case of good tolerability. Results of this pilot study will be used to inform the design of the larger randomised phase 2 trial, for example the primary endpoint, the amount of investigations and the size of the study population. Study visits are planned every 2 weeks for a total study duration of 12 weeks, the time point for analysis of the primary endpoint. Blood samples for PK analysis are collected every 2 weeks.

Background: Standard first line treatment for patients with follicular lymphoma and symptomatic disease is immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The most commonly used treatment regimens are rituximab plus bendamustin or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), rituximab plus lenalidomide or rituximab monotherapy. The long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24 months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for progression of disease within 24 months), and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line treatment, and they are in need of improved treatment options. Mosunetuzumab is a new, bispecific, T-cell engaging antibody that has shown very high response rates and long response duration in B-cell lymphoma patients with multiple relapses or lack of response to standard salvage regimens. It is therefore possible that mosunetuzumab will benefit patients with POD24. The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients. Objectives: The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24. The secondary objectives are to investigate safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab patients´ self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab resource usage related to mosunetuzumab Interventions: Mosunetuzumab is administered SC as described below. Patients are followed for at least 2,5 years and a maximum of 5 years in the trial. Study-specific sampling of peripheral blood for exploratory research amounts to 330-380 mL (depending on the number of treatment cycles) collected over 3 years. Study-specific tumor samples for future research will be collected by fine needle aspiration before the start of treatment and after the third treatment cycle. Ethical considerations: Previous studies have shown that mosunetuzumab is highly effective and well tolerated in heavily treated B-cell lymphoma patients. The safety profile is favourable compared to standard immunochemotherapy. Mosunetuzumab can be safely administered to older patients with co-morbidities, and there is no upper age limit for participation in the trial. The potential beneficial effect of mosunetuzumab in a population of follicular lymphoma patients with POD24 outweighs the risk for rare and undiscovered serious adverse events. The total volume of blood samples is considered acceptable for patients in clinical trials. The extra tumor samples for research purposes will only be collected if deemed safe and not to cause unreasonable discomfort for the participating subject. The extra number of CT scans is 2-3 compared to standard practice and represents a minimal increase in radiation exposure. In total, the benefit to risk balance is deemed positive for this trial."

ASCVD remains a significant burden in the Australian population. Moreover, based on recent local data, it is clear that there are still opportunities to improve the management of this condition in Australia. In collaboration with leading experts in the field, analysis of the gaps in management of cholesterol in Australia has been undertaken. Key areas identified include Lack of regular lipid testing in general practice, Limited access to full range of management tools, current therapies aren't achieving clinical guidelines and poor medication adherence. To address these pain points, the ASCERTAIN study will implement a new model of care that has been co-created with leading cardiologists in Australia and feedback has been provided by a General Practitioner (GP) Advisory Committee. As the primary purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a new model of care implementation strategy compared to usual care, inclisiran and its approved Product Information will be made available in both arms to be used as per the treating physician's discretion. Participants taking part in this study will receive maximally tolerated statin and/or ezetimibe therapy with or without other LDL-C lowering therapies as per the treating physician's discretion. The primary clinical question of interest is: What is the effectiveness of a new model of care implementation strategy compared to usual care in patients who have not reached their LDL-target? In the usual care arm: 1- The GPs will be educated on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and Guideline Directed Management therapy (GDMT) In the new model of care arm - The GPs will be educated on the ESC guidelines and Guideline Directed Management therapy (GDMT). The Participants enrolled in this arm will be receiving monthly short message service (SMS) messages with regards to regarding cardiovascular health and appointment reminders (low touch engagement nudges). In addition, Participants will receive telephone-based support calls from a study nurse trained in motivational interviewing. These telephone calls will cover diet, exercise, medication, and where necessary smoking cessation. A summary of any recommendations will then be sent to the primary care physician via email or letter. However, ultimately the primary care physician is responsible for the management of their patient. The study will include male and female participants ≥18 years of age with a history of ASCVD (coronary heart disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease or peripheral arterial disease) or ASCVD-risk equivalents who have elevated LDL-C (≥1.8 mmol/L). A total of approximately 600 participants will be included in the study and will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio at approximately 20 sites across Australia. For the purposes of defining the ASCVD-risk equivalent group, the Guidelines for the Management of Absolute Cardiovascular Disease Risk (2012) in Australian adults will be used. As per these guidelines, the online calculator www.cvdcheck.org.au (which is based on the Framingham Risk Equation) will be used to calculate an individual's estimated 5-year absolute CVD risk. High risk corresponds to >15% probability of CVD within the next 5 years. As this study will utilise Electronic Health Records (EHR), only clinics using Medical Director (MD) Clinical software will be able to participate in this study. Potential sites may be identified by running a search of the practice databases. From a recruitment and practicality perspective, in the first instance, those clinics that have a high volume of potential patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be considered. Additional formal feasibility assessment will be completed by the Sponsor to ensure clinics are suitable for participation in the study. Study sites may receive a list of patients who could qualify for the study. This list will be generated by a search of the practice database running a query for patients that satisfy the inclusion criteria. Alternatively, the sites may identify patients who could qualify for the study independently. The study sites will contact participants who meet the eligibility criteria.

The investigators propose to pair neurocognitive assessments with in-vehicle kinematic driving data to conduct essential formative work to develop data-based insights into driving behaviors of older adults with ICU-acquired cognitive declines. The investigators aim to determine protocol feasibility and acceptability of neurocognitive assessments and in-vehicle sensor deployment (Aim 1). The investigators will enroll a cohort of older ICU survivors (n=24) with risk factors for ICU-acquired cognitive impairment to complete neurocognitive measures and participate in driving data collection via in-vehicle sensors over a 6-month post-hospital discharge period. Next, the investigators will evaluate the relationship between neurocognitive assessments and driving behavior and safety in older ICU survivors (Aim 2). Lastly, the investigators will conduct stakeholder advisory panels on the priorities and data presentation needs of driving assessments for older ICU survivors (Aim 3). The stakeholder advisory panel insights will provide scientific justification and protocol feasibility to evaluate recruitment, acceptability and attrition for future full-scale implementation. As the population of older drivers grows, almost doubling in size from 2012 to 2040 there is an immediate and critical need to address this impactful issue. This work is designed in response to the NIA Strategic Plan (Goal C-1-9 Safety of Older Drivers) to contribute to a critical gap in health promotion to develop an evidence-based, in- vehicle driving assessment system to provide actionable driving safety data and rehabilitation strategies tailored to ICU survivors, the participants' care partners and clinicians."

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and surgery is the preferred treatment method for primary resectable GIST. The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors. Existing studies have explored the drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection assisting patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to use TKI. Therefore, this one-arm prospective observational clinical study will assist some high-risk GIST patients who have been treated with imatinib for 3 years after surgery and have achieved disease control to adopt the treatment mode of drug holiday based MRD detection, aiming to evaluate the value of MRD detection in monitoring postoperative recurrence of high-risk GIST, investigate the effect of drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection on disease recurrence and patient survival, and to explore whether it can delay the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations."

The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a multilevel, comprehensive physical literacy (PL) program in increasing children's physical activity (PA) and physical literacy (PL). The study will be conducted in 8 elementary schools in New York City. The intervention will be the Rising New York Road Runners (RNYRR) program, which is a school-based physical education curriculum with a family engagement component. The RNYRR program provides lesson plans covering fundamental movement skills that are intended to build competence, confidence, and motivation to be physically activity. Family engagement materials (emails, text messages, videos, social media) complement school materials to communicate what children are learning at school related to physical activity and what activities families can do at home together to reinforce these concepts. The study will use a 2-arm, group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with n=400 3rd-5th grade students from low-income schools receiving either the multilevel RNYRR program (n=4) or delayed-intervention control (n=4). The study will assess the impact of the RNYRR program on children's PL and PA (total daily volume and moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA)) over one school year. The study will also examine whether RNYRR program effects on children's PL and PL subdomains (e.g. ability, confidence, motivation) mediate changes in daily total PA volume or MVPA."

Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy are performed for many reasons such as recurrent tonsil and adenoid infections, sleep apnea, symptomatic adenotonsillar hypertrophy, halitosis, peritonsillar abscess, and it is one of the most performed surgeries in the world. During these operations, there may be fluid and blood accumulation in the stomach. Investigators wonder whether the amount of blood and fluid accumulated in the stomach after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in children will increase the risk of aspiration. For this purpose, the aim is to compare the results with values considered risky for aspiration by evaluating the pre- and postoperative gastric volume with ultrasound in children who underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. This study will include ASA 1,2,3 patients under the age of 18 who will undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in the operating rooms of Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, after the approval of the ethics committee. All the patients will be given oral midazolam at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg as standard in the preoperative preparation room. After standard monitoring (ECG, NIBP, SpO2) is performed in the operating room, gastric volume will be evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position before the operation. After induction of general anesthesia (sevoflurane + 02 + NO2 inhalation, 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium) patients will be intubated. After intubation, gastric volume will be re-evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position. anesthesia will be maintained with a mixture of sevoflurane + 40%/60% O2/NO2 for a MAC of 1.0. At the end of the surgery, before the patient is extubated, the gastric volume will be evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position. Afterwards, the patients will be extubated and taken to the postoperative recovery room. Nausea and vomiting of patients during awakening and for the next 24 hours will be recorded. Patients' age, gender, height, weight, duration of surgery will also be recorded in the follow-up form."

Cardiac surgery is the most important treatment for serious coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease and other heart diseases. Its postoperative mortality and serious complications have also been widely concerned, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The persistent pulmonary hypertension and systemic vascular paralysis during the perioperative period are the main causes of early postoperative death and serious complications such as organ failure.
Catecholamine vasoactive drugs commonly used in cardiac surgery may aggravate the condition of pulmonary hypertension, while the use of drugs to reduce pulmonary hypertension, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may worsen the state of systemic vascular paralysis. Vasopressin and oxytocin are two effective components in pituitrin, and vasopressin is the main component that exerts strong vasoconstrictive effect.
Vasopressin binds to receptors distributed in vascular smooth muscle, pituitary and kidney, and exerts its effects by regulating adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel function, nitric oxide production and enhancing vascular response to catecholamine.
In addition, oxytocin can also bind to the receptors distributed in the heart and vascular endothelium, and play a role by releasing atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide.
Therefore, pituitrin can not only constrict systemic circulation vessels and increase systemic circulation pressure, reduce pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, but also protect the heart and kidney. Therefore, this study intends to explore whether pituitrin has an impact on the prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery, so as to provide reference for its clinical application."

Children with medical complexity (CMC) are increasingly prescribed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) for chronic respiratory failure. In our clinical experience, patients and families would prefer NiPPV initiation in the home environment but this is not standard of care. This proposal will evaluate the feasibility and safety of an innovative model of care for NiPPV initiation in the home environment utilizing remote telemonitoring compared to usual care which is in-hospital polysomnography (PSG) laboratory-based initiation. The incidence of CMC requiring NiPPV is exponentially growing. NiPPV effectively corrects abnormal gas exchange, improves sleep quality, and reduces symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. The use of NiPPV has been associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To ensure effectiveness, NiPPV must be used for all periods of sleep and settings must be individually-titrated. Unfortunately, poor adherence results in many CMC being undertreated for chronic respiratory failure. Successful NiPPV initiation is critical because early negative experiences are commonly reported barriers to adherence6 and early usage predicts longer term use. Standard of care is the initiation and titration of NiPPV during a one-night in-hospital PSG. A PSG is challenging for CMC and families due to their medical fragility and lasting effects of travel and a disrupted routine, the significant amount of equipment and supplies that must be brought to the study as well as the financial implications and additional psychosocial stress for caregivers. In addition, negative experiences with NiPPV may be exacerbated by introduction of the therapy in an unfamiliar PSG laboratory with burdensome monitoring. Furthermore, a one-night PSG provides limited sleep data that may not be representative of dynamic and variable sleeping patterns that occur in the comfort of one's home. Recent technological advances in remote NiPPV monitoring coupled with a shift to virtual care models has enabled a patient and family centered opportunity to bypass the PSG laboratory and initiate NiPPV at home. Remote NiPPV monitoring extends data collection beyond discrete health care encounters and provides real-time data on adherence and efficacy that can be wirelessly transmitted to facilitate setting adjustment by clinicians. Home NiPPV initiation is increasingly being requested by patients and caregivers. The potential benefits of this innovative care model include increasing patient and family empowerment, improving the delivery of high quality patient-centred care at home, and optimizing NiPPV use. Although there is growing data in the adult population to support home NiPPV initiation via telemonitoring, this cannot be simply extrapolated to CMC. There are key differences in the etiology and manifestation of chronic respiratory failure in CMC compared to adults. Furthermore, family caregivers play an important role in NiPPV acceptance and adherence. Canadian guidelines acknowledge the lack of evidence for the setting in which NiPPV is initiated. Home NiPPV initiation in CMC is a novel model of care that may result in large health system impacts, but requires a feasibility study before embarking on a large-scale trial."

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) is a common systemic vasculitis in children. The gastrointestinal tract is the most common site of involvement, and the most common clinical manifestations are abdominal pain, hematemesis, and bloody stools. The pathogenesis of HSP is not clear, and the treatment of HSP is still controversial. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical features of refractory GI HSP and the clinical outcome of mycophenolate mofetil in these patients.
                A total of 100 patients with refractory gastrointestinal HSP were enrolled in this study. The patients were treated with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) 10mg/kg/d for 6 months. The clinical features of refractory GI HSP and the clinical outcome of MMF were analyzed.
                The incidence of abdominal pain, hematemesis and bloody stools in the MMF group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). The count of red blood cells in stool in the MMF group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of renal involvement in the MMF group was significantly lower than that in the control group (P<0.05).
                Mycophenolate mofetil is effective in the treatment of refractory gastrointestinal HSP. It can reduce the incidence of abdominal pain, hematemesis and bloody stools, and reduce the incidence of renal involvement. It is a safe and effective treatment for refractory gastrointestinal HSP."

The ACHIEVE (Advancing Community and Clinical Care for Childbirth-related Hypertension Through Implementation, Engagement, and Valuing Equity) Initiative was developed to support outpatient clinics in providing more effective care to pregnant individuals with high blood pressure. Adapting this bundle for community clinics providing pregnancy care has the potential to reach more birthing people outside the hospital setting who are most vulnerable to complications. In the initial phase of ACHIEVE, the study team partnered with three rural Piedmont Health Services (PHS) clinics that serve mostly White and Latinx patients. The inpatient HTN bundle was adapted to fit their setting and re-named the Outpatient Hypertension (O-HTN) bundle. Additionally, a coalition was established to engage patients, clinic providers/staff, and the broader community to: (a) understand factors influencing maternal health including economic stability, education, health care access, and community context, (b) assess what makes it easier or harder to implement the O-HTN bundle in community outpatient clinic settings, (c) adapt the O-HTN bundle to fit those settings and populations, and (d) select and tailor changes to clinic practices using continuous cycles of learning, measuring and adapting to be the most effective and sustainable for the organization. Building on this formative work, the goal of the clinical trial is to determine the impact of three implementation strategies (training, coaching, facilitation) in 20 outpatient clinics in central North Carolina. Usual clinic care for severe hypertension will be compared to the care provided after a practice has 12 months of implementation support from the ACHIEVE Nurse Coordinator. ACHIEVE partners include healthcare leadership, clinic providers and staff, community-based organizations, and individuals with lived experience who will work together on this project. If the project succeeds in improving care, the ACHIEVE model will be shared across the state and nationally to support healthier birthing people and communities."

Background: Recently, more and more total pancreatectomy (TP) has been performed for pancreatic ductal cell adenocarcinoma (PDCA) which abuts or involves both gastroduodenal and splenic arteries. Warshaw's procedure (spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with excision of splenic vessels) has been safely performed for years. Likewise, both pancreatic tail and spleen can be preserved after excision of splenic vessels for leftward extension of pancreatic parenchyma transaction line during Whipple (WOTSA). In that case, TP can be replaced by WOTSA. This uncontrolled before and after study assesses the safety and efficacy of a new technique Whipple over the splenic artery (WOTSA) as a treatment for PDAC which traditionally requires total pancreatectomy (TP). Methods: The study group comprised 40 consecutive patients who underwent WOTSA for PDAC. Their clinicopathological characteristics and survival were compared with those of a historical control group comprising 30 consecutive patients who underwent TP between.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social communication and restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. Sleep disturbances are common in children with ASD, with up to 80% of children with ASD experiencing sleep problems. Sleep spindles are a type of brain wave that are important for sleep quality and are disrupted in children with ASD. Melatonin is a hormone that regulates sleep and has been shown to improve sleep quality in children with ASD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of melatonin on sleep spindles in children with ASD.

Participants will be children with ASD between the ages of 12 and 18 years old. Participants will be asked to wear a portable EEG device for five nights of sleep. On two of the nights, participants will take a 5mg melatonin gummy 30 minutes before bedtime. The EEG device will measure sleep spindles during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The study will also assess sleep quality using a questionnaire.

The results of this study may provide insights into the relationship between sleep spindles and sleep quality in children with ASD and the potential benefits of melatonin in improving sleep quality in this population."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is markedly increasing in prevalence amongst older adults. Older adults with MS present with poor health status and functioning, cognitive and ambulatory difficulty, dependence for activities of daily living, and reduced physical activity participation. The common approach for managing MS involves disease-modifying drugs, yet this first-line approach for medical management has little efficacy in older MS age groups (i.e., those 50+ years of age). Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for maintaining and/or restoring physical and cognitive health in older adults from the general population and younger adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. The current study proposes a remotely-delivered exercise training program for improving cognition and mobility among older adults with MS. The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach (via telerehabilitation) with rigorous design for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based exercise intervention program in older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful aging with MS."

This is a pilot study, non-interventional research involving the human subjects, category 3, aimed at measuring the clinical and biological the clinical and biological effects of using the oXiris hemofiltration hemofiltration membrane. As part of the treatment: oXiris membrane hemofiltration with Prismaflex system, Phoxylium or Hémosol B0 dialysis solution, upper or lower dialysis catheter. Anticoagulation with heparin, citrate or none in case of severe haemostasis disorders. Treatment volume of 35 ml/kg/h maximum. For research purposes: collection of additional blood tubes (2 x 5mL heparinized tube) added to the usual samples, at the following times: Baseline (before starting treatment), under hemofiltration at 24h +/- 6h of treatment and at 72 hours +/- 12 hours. These samples will be analyzed by liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry / mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) by Attoquant diagnostics®, a laboratory specialized in analyses of the Renin-Angiotensin system. The angiotensins assayed are Angiotensin I, II, III and IV, as well as the intermediate peptides (1-5, 1-7, 1-9, 2-10, 2-7 and 3-7) and regulatory enzymes (renin, angiotensin converting enzyme, angiotensin 2-converting enzyme and neprilysin). Angiotensin metabolites have a very short half-life. Their depends on enzyme activity and degradation by circulating proteases. Two techniques are used to determine circulating concentration rapid treatment with protease inhibitors or the equilibrium technique. For the equilibrium technique, samples are incubated again to restore metabolite concentration prior to analysis. The samples at 3 time points (Baseline, H24 and H72) are analyzed using the equilibrium. The H24 sample will also be analyzed with a protease inhibitor pre-treatment. Patients will be monitored for 3 months (90-day mortality) using data collected collected in the course of care. Data from medical records and biological analyses will be entered into an eCRF. Data management will be carried out throughout the study, to enable baseline freezing and statistical analysis as early as possible after the end of the last patient's follow-up."

Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed gynecological operations. It is carried out because of a variety of indications, such as presence of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, myoma uteri, adenomyosis and adnexal mass. Hysterectomy can be performed using abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic or robotic methods. According to the results from a study performed in the United States, the incidence rates for hysterectomies using abdominal, vaginal and laparoscopic methods are 66%, 22% and 12%, respectively. There is still no consensus on which of these approaches is the optimum surgical method for hysterectomy. Abdominal hysterectomy is the most frequently performed approach, but current clinical practice mandates that, when appropriate, the surgical method should be vaginal rather than abdominal, since the former is associated with better outcomes and lower complication rates. Moreover, when vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible or not indicated, the surgical method should be laparoscopic, because total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) provides a faster return to normal activity, shorter hospital stays, lower intraoperative bleeding and fewer wound infections, compared with abdominal hysterectomy. However, longer operating times and higher incidence of urinary system damage are seen in laparoscopic hysterectomies. Cesarean section (CS) is the most commonly performed surgery on women and has increased significantly in the last 15 years. Various reasons account for the increase in CSs over the last two decades, including an increase upon maternal request, changes in maternal demographics (e.g., increasing maternal age), changes in physician practice patterns, more conservative practice guidelines, and mounting legal pressures. Because of the gradually increasing rates of cesarean sections (CSs) over the last two decades, the number of hysterectomized patients with previous CSs has increased. In a recent review article, previously performed CSs were demonstrated to be an important risk factor for lower urinary tract injuries, and the recommendation that abdominal hysterectomy might be preferable for these patients was emphasized. TLH may be technically difficult in patients with previous CSs, due to surgical adhesions, and is associated with a higher risk of perioperative complications. Mobilization of the urinary bladder off of the cervix is an important step in total laparoscopic hysterectomy, and is always performed before dealing with the uterine pedicle. If the uterus is unscarred, bladder mobilization may not be technically difficult. However, if the uterus is scarred, there can be adhesions not only between the uterus and the bladder but also to the anterior abdominal wall, which can make dissection challenging. Studies of the effects of closure or nonclosure of the peritoneum during cesarean delivery on adhesion formation have concluded that insufficient data are available and that adequately powered and designed trials are needed. As regards the lateral approach, this space was first described by Dr. Shrish Sheth utilizing the utero-cervical broad ligament in post cesarean cases during vaginal hysterectomy. He described that the lateral area; the two leaves of broad ligament remains free and allows easy possibility for entry to dissect whether vaginally or abdominally.While in medial approach, a metal catheter was then inserted in the bladder. The catheter was rotated so the tip was pointing upward, to stretch the bladder pillars. The bladder was dissected with monopolar scissors with the catheter in place.

The gut microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that reside in the gastrointestinal tract. The gut microbiome plays a crucial role in maintaining human health by regulating metabolic processes, immune function, and brain function. The gut microbiome is also involved in the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which are important for maintaining gut health and regulating metabolic processes.

The gut microbiome is influenced by dietary factors, such as the consumption of herbal tea infusions. Herbal tea infusions are a popular beverage consumed worldwide. The consumption of herbal tea infusions has been associated with various health benefits, including improved gut health and reduced inflammation. However, the effects of herbal tea infusions on the gut microbiome and metabolic processes are not well understood.

The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of herbal tea infusions on the gut microbiome and metabolic processes in healthy individuals. The study will involve the consumption of three different herbal tea infusions: a rhubarb root tea, a senna tea, and a green tea. The study will be conducted in a double-blind, randomized, controlled manner.

The study will involve 100 healthy individuals who will be recruited from the local community. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: a rhubarb root tea group, a senna tea group, or a green tea group. Participants will be asked to consume one cup of herbal tea infusion per day for 21 days. The herbal tea infusions will be prepared using 2.5g of tea infusion in 250ml of boiling water. Participants will be asked to consume the herbal tea infusion after their last meal of the day.

During the study, participants will be asked to complete a dietary questionnaire and a stool sample collection questionnaire. Participants will also be asked to provide blood samples and stool samples at various time points. The blood samples will be used to measure various metabolic parameters, such as lipid composition and short chain fatty acids concentrations. The stool samples will be used to analyze the gut microbiome composition.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a cancer of the plasma cells in the bone marrow. Patients with MM often require frequent visits to the hospital for treatment and monitoring. These visits can be burdensome for patients, especially those who live far from the hospital. To address this issue, the Siteman Cancer Center has opened satellite locations in rural areas to provide care closer to home. The purpose of this study is to determine if patients with MM who receive care at a satellite location have better outcomes than those who receive care at the main hospital.

Participants will be enrolled in the study if they have MM and are receiving care at the Siteman Cancer Center. They will be asked to complete questionnaires about their treatment burden, satisfaction with care, and financial toxicity. They will also be asked to provide information about their decision to receive care at a satellite location or at the main hospital.

This is a prospective, randomized controlled, interventional therapy utilizing virtual reality goggles as a method of distraction. Data will be collected during and after the procedure on the type of behavior displayed and the child's response to standardized questions. Pediatric patients aged 4-12 years who only require nitrous sedation to complete painful dental treatment which necessitates anesthesia will be included in this study. These patients exhibit Frankl 2-3 behavior, requiring behavior guidance in order to complete the procedure. Frankl 1 or 4 children, those who do not need behavior guidance at all, or children with heavy behavior guidance who would not be able to complete the procedure, will be excluded. Participants will be recruited in the clinic, during a new patient exam, routine hygiene or operative dentistry appointment. Following the Frankl behavior score diagnosis, an evaluation of behavior will happen during the beginning of the appointment, specifically watching for acceptance of treatment plan, openness to conversation, and any defiant behaviors or crying. The parent and child being recruited for the study will be informed of the nature of the study, the possible risks benefit and alternatives, and written consent will be obtained from the parent or legal guardian. Assent from child 7 to 12 will also be required as well. The qualifying patient will enter the operatory and be admitted into the study. Participants will be briefed on how the study will proceed, and will be randomized into a control group or treatment group. The groups will be selected at random prior to treatment in the study. Both Groups will use of Faces, Legs, Arms, Crying Consolability(FLACC) Scale, WongBaker FACES, and Houpt Behavior scales to access the pain or discomfort of subjects. Patients will rate their pain using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale by indicating which face best depicts the pain they are experiencing. Each face has a corresponding number: 0 = doesn't hurt at all to 10 = hurts as much as you can imagine. Patients will be observed during injection and assessed by the operator using the Faces, Legs, Arms, Crying Consolability (FLACC) scale. Each category will be rated from 0 to 2. Zero indicating normal positions and no sign of discomfort and 2 indicating discomfort in movements or unable to console/comfort. Patients will be observed during the procedure using the Houpt Behavioral Scale. Each category is scored on the 0-2 scale which results in a total score of 0-10. Assessment of Behavioral Score: 0 = Relaxed and comfortable, 1-3 = Mild discomfort, 4-6 = Moderate pain, 7-10 = Severe discomfort/pain. Patients receiving N2O during their visit will follow the standard of care procedures. The VR goggles will be placed on the head and in front of the eyes. Patients using the goggles are automatically set to start media as soon as the wearer dons them. The patient will be reclined, and placed in an ideal setting, and the goggles will be calibrated to the patient's current view. The dental procedure will then follow. Most procedures require a local anesthetic injection, and if the patient receives this injection, participants will be graded with FLACC score during the injection. At the end of the procedure the child will be evaluated using the Wong-Baker FACES scale, the Houpt Crying and Movement Scales, and a survey will be given to the patient to be completed. Participants will participate in the study during two restorative dental appointments, however, some patients may need more than two visits. Participants who require multiple restorative treatments will only being include in the study during first two visits and no other research activities will occur after. Most appointments are projected to last a maximum of 1 hour. The limiting factor in all treatment in this study, will be the participant's willingness to participate in future appointments."

The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people with Parkinson's disease (PD) manage their physical activity and exercise participation with different levels of support from their communities and clinicians. We will evaluate exercise and physical activity every 3 months in a cohort of people with PD from two clinics in the Chicagoland area: Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest and University of Chicago Medical Center. During this study, we will evaluate differences in 12-month physical activity trajectories between groups enrolled during each of three conditions: (1A) standard care (condition 1, year 1), (1B) written exercise guidance (condition 2, year 2), and (1C) Consultative PT (condition 3, year 3). People with PD will be enrolled each year into an activity and exercise tracking study. Participants will be tracked using a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos) and commercial grade activity trackers. Research-grade actigraphy and patient reported outcome measures will be monitored every 3 months for the first year. All participants will be enrolled in an exercise and physical activity tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. The platform allows for synchronization of patients' activity data from their fitness tracker or smartwatch to the secure cloud-based platform. The platform can summarize steps per day, activity intensity, minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day based on target heart rate zones (including an ability for physical therapists to customize the target heart rate zone). At the 2 sites of care (Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital and University of Chicago), participants will be recruited based on contacting consecutive patients who meet the inclusion criteria based on scheduling and EMR screening prior to their visit with their neurologists. Contacting consecutive patients will ensure greater potential equity of enrolling participants rather than only patients engaged in support groups and exercise classes. However, after 3 months of recruitment, we will conduct a preliminary analysis of the numbers, recruitment rates, and characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, disease duration, education) of the enrolling participants compared to the demographics of each clinic as a whole. We will then determine if we should use targeted recruitment strategies to increase reach to specific groups or recruitment rates by doing one or more of the following: (1) sending measures through MyChart to potentially eligible patients targeting or oversampling for higher socioeconomic, race, or ethnicity diversity or (2) reaching out to local community exercise classes or support groups using emails to community advocates and flyers to increase sample size more rapidly. Consecutive patients meeting the eligibility criteria will be approached by a site study team member. The first contact may occur before or during a medical (physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner) visit. The electronic health record system will be used to screen participants for eligibility in the few weeks before their visit through an institutional review board-approved electronic data warehouse data waiver. Attempts will be made to contact potential participants before their appointments, with a research coordinator attempting contact at their visit if there is no response to early contacts. If time is limited during the patient's session, we will use patient portal communication and/or phone calls after their visits depending on the preferences of each site (which will be determined during the pre-implementation barrier assessment). Screening for eligibility will occur via a combination of data available in the EMR for existing patients and a quick screening questionnaire that can be done in person or over the phone. After identifying that the participant is interested and satisfies the inclusion criteria for the study, they will be sent an e-consent. Once consent is obtained, they will work with the study team to set a time for the baseline assessment period which will include ensuring the participant has their own -wrist-worn activity tracker and is able to get commercial grade activity tracker from the research team. At baseline and every 3-months throughout the 12-month (baseline, 3-months, 6-months, 9-months, 12-months) study, participants will complete online survey assessments including demographic questionnaires, habits and perceptions of physical activity and exercise, and healthcare and exercise resource utilization. Participants will, also, wear a research-grade physical activity monitor on a belt clip around their waist for 7-consecutive days at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months. In addition to research-grade physical activity monitoring, participants will be asked to a personal commercially available activity"

Perioperative stroke is a significant complication after surgery. Unfortunately, covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline. Further, perioperative overt stroke is associated with an 8-fold increase in perioperative mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay, and decreased quality of life. For shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position, due to systemic hypotension and reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral desaturation events and impaired cerebral autoregulation can occur in up to 80% of patients. Most perioperative stroke in non-cardiac surgery is ischemic and is related to brain hypoperfusion. Importantly, brain hypoperfusion is potentially modifiable with simple measures such as increasing systemic blood pressure (BP) if brain ischemia is identified early enough. However, deliberate hypertension is not devoid of risk and there is currently no effective monitor that can detect brain hypoperfusion during surgery. Cerebral oxygenation has been used clinically as a measure of adequate brain perfusion during surgery. An early clinical trial at Western found that monitoring cerebral oxygenation was associated with fewer cases of major organ dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients. Despite this promising initial finding, current commercial cerebral oximeters have a number of limitations that prevent reliable perioperative neuromonitoring, including non-specificity due to signal contamination from extracerebral tissue, especially during administration of vasoconstrictors or hypothermia. In addition, current commercial cerebral oximeters only have two channels to monitor the frontal lobe regions (i.e., anterior cerebral artery territory). This monitoring strategy assumes that cerebral oxygenation is homogenous across different brain regions so that measurements from the frontal regions can be used clinically to represent the adequacy of global brain oxygenation. Such a limited spatial coverage may result in undetected stroke, despite the patients having apparently normal cerebral oxygenation in the frontal regions throughout surgery. The current research project employs multi-channel tr-fNIRS to address these limitations, with the goal of timely detection and prevention of ischemic brain injury. Multi-channel tr-fNIRS (time-resolved (tr) functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (tr-fNIRS)) is an emerging brain-imaging technology that was originally developed to explore changes in cerebral oxygenation generated by cortical neuronal activity during various cognitive tasks such as speech, sensory and motor functions, and emotion. This is because tr-fNIRS can measure such subtle cerebral oxygenation changes in milliseconds (up to 100 ms) that accompany neuro-activation such as finger-tapping. The investigators has built several tr-fNIRS devices and has the expertise of adapting the full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to perioperative neuromonitoring. Furthermore, tr-fNIRS operate by sending short (picosecond) pulses of light into the head and precisely measures the time of travel of each photon in the tissue. Since there is an equivalence between time and distance, photons that are detected right after the pulse have only probed the extracerebral layers (scalp and skull) while photons that are detected long after (1-2 ms) the pulse have travelled deep into the brain tissues. The investigators have recently shown that this approach reduces the signal contaminations of the extracerebral layers from 80% with current commercial NIRS devices to less than 8% with tr-fNIRS. In this study, the investigators will employ a state-of-the-art full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to monitor the entire brain, as opposed to only select regions (such as the limited capabilities of the current cerebral oximeters) in the perioperative setting. Together with in-house analysis algorithms, the full head coverage tr-fNIRS can detect specific brain regions at-risk of ischemic injury with a high degree of certainty because of greater spatial resolution (in cm) and less signal contamination from extracerebral tissue. All study participants will be recruited and consented adhering to the local ethics guidelines. For all study participants, the surgical and anesthetic management of the patients will be conducted in a standard fashion and will not be altered in this study. The exception is that tr-fNIRS will be used to monitor regional brain oxygenation from anest"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) in critically ill patients. MI-E is a device that can be used to help patients with respiratory failure to clear their airways. The investigators want to find out if MI-E can be used safely and effectively in critically ill patients.
The investigators will compare the use of MI-E with the usual care given to critically ill patients. The investigators will also look at the impact of MI-E on the patients' recovery and the length of time they need to stay in the hospital."

Functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) develops due to functional and structural alterations related to heart failure (HF), mitral valve disease and atrial fibrillation. An increase in cardiac filling pressure due to left ventricular (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction leads to left atrial, right atrial (RA) and right ventricular (RV) remodeling, which causes tricuspid annular dilatation and TR. The development of significant functional TR causes RV dysfunction and further dilation of RV, which deteriorates TR. Functional TR may occur with HF with preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF), and the prevalence of moderate-to-severe functional TR is around 19% in patients with HF. Regardless of LVEF or pulmonary artery pressure, presence of moderate or severe functional TR is associated with more symptoms, reduced cardiac output, and worse renal function. A vicious cycle of significant TR, RV volume overload, adverse remodeling of RA, RV, and tricuspid annulus, and consequent aggravation of TR is suggested as a pathophysiologic mechanism of the poor clinical outcomes of patients with TR, and the presence of moderate or severe functional TR is a strong independent determinant of mortality in patients with HF. Because functional TR has a strong prognostic impact and plays an important pathophysiologic role in patients with HF, functional TR is suggested as a therapeutic target in HF. However, there have been no proven medical therapies for TR and only loop diuretics are cautiously recommended for relief of congestive symptoms in patients with severe TR and signs of RV failure. In patients with functional TR associated with systolic dysfunction, medical therapy for HF with a reduced EF may diminish functional TR by improving LV systolic function. Otherwise, the morbidity and mortality of patients with functional TR remain high and a novel therapeutic agent is needed to improve clinical outcomes of HF patients with functional TR and a preserved LV ejection fraction. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors induce urinary excretion of glucose and sodium by blocking the SGLT2 transporter in the proximal tubule (8). SGLT2 inhibitor-induced natriuresis lower cardiac preload and reduce pulmonary congestion and systemic edema. SGLT2 inhibitors also restore tubuloglomerular feedback and lower the intraglomerular pressure by vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles and consequently reduce hyperfiltration-related renal damage. The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart and kidneys may halt the vicious cardiorenal cycle in patients with functional TR (9), which results in deterioration of renal function, hospitalization for heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. Accordingly, the Enavogliflozin Outcome Trial in Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation (EVENT) will test the hypothesis that, compared with placebo, therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor enavogliflozin for 18 months would improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in HF patients with functional TR and preserved LVEF."

The Accelerating Medicines Partnership® Schizophrenia (AMP SCZ) program is a multi-continent consortium that aims to develop a deep biomarker-informed functional characterization and longitudinal clinical profiling of study participants at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis. The data will support the development of algorithms of clinical and biological measures to predict the trajectories and outcomes of CHR individuals to identify enriched CHR patient populations to enable proof of principle intervention studies for early intervention in schizophrenia. These tools will allow the assessment of biomarkers and outcome measures as early indicators of pharmacologic treatment efficacy. The AMP SCZ Observational Study: PREDICT-DPACC is one of three research projects supported by the AMP SCZ program. The AMP SCZ Observational Study: PREDICT-DPACC works with two Clinical High Risk (CHR) research networks (described below) to meet the following goals: Capture data from the research networks in a uniform manner. Build flexible infrastructure to accommodate multiple data types. Develop and refine pipelines that provide rapid data processing (in close to real-time) and quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC). Provide data coordination, management, and monitoring of data. Develop powerful and robust stratification tools to identify & validate biomarkers and predict individual outcome trajectories. Assist in archiving data and making it publicly available in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). Please see (https://nda.nih.gov/ampscz/). Disseminate information, including tools developed, to the general research community, and provide outreach to the community via a website. MGB institutions do not provide or enroll participants for this study but serve as the AMP SCZ DPACC for two CHR Research Networks (RNs) where consent and all clinical testing and data collection occur. MGB is a data recipient only, not a data provider. The two CHR research networks (RNs) that also make up the AMP SCZ program are: The Psychosis-Risk Outcomes Network (ProNET) is based out of Yale University, which serves as the hub for this network and consists of a network of sites in the US, Canada, Europe, and Asia. Northwell Health is the IRB of record for all US sites in the ProNET RN. All foreign ProNET sites submit to their local IRBs. The Trajectories and Predictors in the Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Population: Prediction Scientific Global Consortium (PRESCIENT), is based out of the Center for Youth Mental Health at the University of Melbourne and at Orygen, Melbourne, Australia, which serves as the hub for this network, and consists of a network of sites in Australia, Europe, and Asia. The Melbourne Health Research Governance and Ethics Office for Research is the IRB of record for all Australian sites in the PRESCIENT research network. European and Asian sites submit to their local IRBs. Acquisition Sites collect the data and transfer it directly to Brigham and Women's Hospital, which is the main site for the Data Processing Analysis and Coordination Center (DPACC).

Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the individual has difficulties in reading, written expression, and/or mathematics, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5 (DSM-V). SLD; According to DSM-5, the academic difficulties experienced are explained in detail by dividing them into three subgroups. These are dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The incidence of SLD is approximately 33% in girls and 67% in boys between the ages of 6-12. The ethology of SLD is multifactorial. It is associated with multiple genes and environmental risk factors. Structural imaging studies in children with SLD have revealed that grey matter is reduced. As a result of low grey matter, early literacy education seems to be negatively affected, and fine motor skills such as writing play an important role in this influence. Writing is a complex activity that includes perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Writing activities require a high level of fine motor coordination, postural control, adjustable grip strength, visual perception, and language skills. Considering the studies, it is stated that children who go to primary school spend 31%-60% of their academic days with tasks involving fine motor skills, and most of them do activities such as writing and painting. In addition to their academic and writing performances, children with SLD perform differently in daily life compared to their healthy peers. In general, they have difficulties during self-care activities such as tying shoes, clipping their nails, buttoning/zipping, shaving, and performing activities that require sequencing. At the same time, children with SLD have difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control. Difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control seen in children with SLD affect proximal stability. When proximal stability is poor, distal movements cannot be performed in good quality. Therefore, adequate postural control and proximal stability are essential prerequisites for many activities of daily living. In the literature, it has been shown that grip strength and anthropometric characteristics of the upper extremity affect distal fine motor skills. In a study by Anakwe et al., it was shown that grip strength increased as the forearm circumference measurement value increased. In a study examining the relationship between hand grip and finger strength and anthropometric measurements, it was concluded that grip strength increased as arm and forearm measurements increased. It has been proven that grip strength increases as arm and forearm measurements increase. In the light of our current knowledge, no study has been found that comprehensively examines the fine motor functions, hand grip strength, and hand and forearm anthropometric characteristics of children with SLD. The primary aim of this study is to examine the fine motor skills, hand grip strength, and hand and forearm anthropometric characteristics of children with SLD compared to those of healthy children and to investigate their relationships with each other. The second aim of our study is to examine the effect of fine motor skills on quality of life and participation in activities at home, school, and community environment of children with SLD compared to their healthy peers."

The current standard approach to the management of extremity STS is a combination of radiotherapy and limb preserving surgery. Currently guidelines recommend preoperative conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, which involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. Preoperative hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) is an approach that can shorten the duration of treatment. Clinical outcomes with preoperative HFRT in STS have been reported from retrospective case series, prospective institutional registries and phase I-II trials. However, preoperative HFRT has not been compared in a prospective randomized trial to CFRT and due to the rarity of extremity soft tissue sarcoma, attempts to develop such a trial would face feasibility challenges. Therefore, single arm trials of preoperative HFRT will be critical to defining the feasibility, toxicity, efficacy, and potential improvement in access to care associated with this approach. Radiation therapy combined with wide local excision in the preoperative or postoperative setting optimizes local control for extremity STS. Preoperative radiotherapy confers a higher rate of wound complications but a lower rate of irreversible sequela such as fibrosis and lymphedema compared with postoperative radiotherapy. Resultantly, preoperative radiotherapy is the preferred approach in most cases. Preoperative radiotherapy with CFRT given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. The burden of daily travel and time away from work or care giving can be a barrier to utilization of radiotherapy. A recent analysis of the National Cancer Database demonstrated that farther distance to treatment was a negative predictor for receipt of radiotherapy in extremity STS. Sociodemographic factors such as female sex, older age (>70 years), Black race, and noncommercial insurance coverage were also negatively associated with receipt of radiotherapy. The authors summarized that radiotherapy is underutilized in the treatment of STS and that sociodemographic disparities exist in access to radiotherapy. Receipt of radiation therapy and surgery within a high volume (HV) sarcoma center has been associated with improved overall survival, while Black race and non-metropolitan residents were negative predictors for treatment within such centers. To address disparities in access to radiation therapy, the American Society for Radiation Oncology Committee on Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion has proposed studying novel HFRT schedules. As validation of this strategy, Kalbasi et al. increased retention of extremity STS patients within a HV sarcoma center by 3-fold with the utilization of preoperative HFRT. Further, the decreased time and travel associated with HFRT, can address an established barrier to clinical trial participation, particularly for those living remote from clinical trial sites. Clinical trial participation is particularly low in rural areas which results in these populations being underrepresented in the clinical research. A survey of South Carolina based medical researchers, identified rural residents as a group that are difficult to find and recruit to clinical trials. In a survey of urban and rural South Carolina residents, there was no difference in reported willingness to participate in clinical trials, but rural residents were more likely to perceive limited access to clinical trial sites. Investigating cancer treatment approaches that decrease the economic and logistical burdens incurred by patients, such as preoperative 5-day HFRT, may increase clinical trial participation by rural South Carolina residents and ultimately address disparities in representation of these populations in cancer research. HFRT, using >2.2 Gy/fx, has resulted in equivalent oncologic outcomes to CFRT in other tumor sites such as breast, prostate and rectum. For STS, HFRT may confer a radiobiologic advantage in that the linear-quadratic model predicts larger doses per fraction provide better tumor control for tumors with a lower α/β ratio. For liposarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, their α/β ratio ( 4 Gy) is similar to breast and prostate cancer, malignancies in which HFRT has been widely adopted. While histologic variability certainly exists, most STSs have estimated α/β ratios lower than 10, suggesting increased sensitivity to larger fraction size. Clinical outcomes with preoperative HFRT in STS have been reported from retrospective case series, prospective institutional registries and phase I-II trials. Comparing oncologic outcomes across these series is hindered by heterogeneous clinicopathological features, surgical"

Tang poems are not only for language learning but also induce people's positive emotions. Traditionally, some Chinese parents teach the very young kids to recite Tang poems even before the kids know how to read and write. Reciting Tang poems resembles singing a song without understanding the verses, and some kids can do so better than adults. Tang poems sound musical and should be easier to remember and recite than other texts. Learning and reciting poems at home could be happy and fun family activities in Chinese families. Whether using fun activities on small groups of kids in a community setting to promote Tang poem reciting and happiness could have the same effects of Tang poem reciting in Chinese kids is unknown for non-Chinese. This is a pilot pre-intervention trial with no controls, with 10-20 South Asian children in primary schools (Grades 1-2, age 6-9) being recruited. In most primary schools, grades 1-2 students have not started learning Tang poems. Students and their parents will be actively approached by Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS). An information sheet will be provided to the parents of eligible children, and their contact information will be asked. Parents give written consent if they agree for their children to participate. Parents will be invited to join the intervention sessions to show support for students' participation but they will only sit at the back of the room without active interaction and learning requirements. The intervention comprises three 1.5-hour sessions of Tang poem reciting and one session for participant performances. Experienced instructors from Bestreben Drama Association Limited will lead each session, and adherence to the protocol will be assessed by independent reviewers. Participants will recite two poems per session, with adjustments based on performance. Body language, sound, images, and videos will be used, along with engaging games, to enhance motivation and memory. Participants will receive stamp/sticker collection books and be rewarded for their achievements. Parents are invited to attend the sessions to show support, their role will be passive, sitting at the back of the room without active interaction or learning requirements. A final session will include a 15-minute assessment of poem recitation skills, followed by a performance session where participants can recite any Tang poem. Family members are encouraged to participate, and awards will be granted to motivate and appreciate participants and their families. Assessment will include pre-session assessments (T0, T2, T4, and T6) and post-intervention assessments after each session (T1, T3, T5, and T7). A follow-up assessment (T8) will be conducted 12 weeks after the baseline to evaluate the sustainability of outcomes approximately one month after program completion. Parents will complete questionnaires for themselves (Part II) and assisting their children (Part I). Parental presence and support will be acknowledged through supermarket coupon incentives. The feasibility outcomes will be reported descriptively and narratively, including the recruitment rate, duration, and retention rate. Descriptive statistics, mean (standard deviation) for continuous outcomes, will be reported for the secondary outcomes. The investigators will use content analysis method to analyze the qualitative data from the in-depth interviews. It is expected that those fun activities for reciting Tang poems may help promoting happiness and enjoyment in primary school ethnic minority students in Hong Kong."

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth. Digital tools, especially personal smartphones, are promising avenues to address these issues and can be used to provide a unique understanding of risk factors, including psychological distress, anhedonia and behavioral withdrawal, and sleep disturbance among high-risk individuals. This project aims to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of preventative health care to youth at risk for suicide by developing a comprehensive digital platform that allows practitioners to integrate mobile sensing data and HIPAA-compliant client communication tools into their management of these young people. Specifically, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) based at the intensive outpatient services (Intensive Adolescent and Family DBT Program (Columbia Doctors)) to test the impact of using the Vira platform for patients versus treatment as usual control (TAU; i.e., not using Vira). This project will include adolescent patients (n = 200) aged 13-18-years-old randomized to: (a) Vira group (n = 100) and (b) treatment as usual control group (n = 100). Participants will include current patients receiving treatment in the intensive outpatient program, and all treatment decisions will be overseen by practitioners within the program. The overarching goal is to test whether using the Vira platform in the context of an intensive outpatient setting improves clinical outcomes.

The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of sex and age on the response of the eye pupil to different wavelengths of light and the effect of light on the timing of the body's internal clock and hormone production. The study will also examine the relationship between pupil response and hormone production.

The study will be conducted in 2 phases. In Phase 1, participants will have their pupil size measured using a pupillometer. The pupillometer will be used to measure pupil size in response to different light stimuli. In Phase 2, participants will be exposed to different wavelengths of light (red and blue/green) using a light box. The light box will be used to produce different wavelengths and intensities of light. Participants will be exposed to red light on Night 1 and blue/green light on Night 2 to determine circadian timing and suppression of hormone (melatonin) production.

The study will include 100 participants, 50 men and 50 women, between the ages of 18 and 85. Participants will be randomized to one of 8 different light stimuli within the pupillometry.

The study will help us understand how different wavelengths of light affect the eye pupil and hormone production, and how these effects may differ between men and women and across different age groups."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a new parent training program for parents with ADHD (Improving Parenting Skills adult ADHD; IPSA). The program is designed to improve parenting skills and reduce parental stress and child behavior problems. The study is a randomized controlled trial with parallel groups, where eligible individuals are block randomized on each clinical site to one of two groups (ratio 1:1): Treatment (IPSA directly) or Control (continued routine services; offered IPSA approximately six months later). The study is carried out by the Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, in collaboration with an ADHD Center run by the publicly-funded Habilitation & Health, Stockholm Health Care Services, Region Stockholm, Sweden. The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm, Sweden (dnr. 2017/2435-31/5, 2019-06362, and 2023-03871-02). The study is primarily concerned with the efficacy of IPSA, secondarily with the feasibility of the program. In addition, the investigators will explore the potentially moderating or mediating effects of baseline variables and levels of active participation on efficacy outcomes. The effect of IPSA is examined using self- and parental report scales administered before (pre; T1) and immediately after (post; T2) IPSA, as well as approximately 1.5-3 months after program completion, in connection with an IPSA booster session (follow-up; T3). Specifically, the investigators examine whether participation in IPSA is associated with positive treatment outcomes with respect to the study's primary outcome (parental self-efficacy) and secondary outcomes (parental stress, levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child). In addition, parents' time management and organizational skills are followed from pre to post IPSA. The feasibility of IPSA is evaluated based attendance records and parental reports. The investigators assess whether IPSA is an acceptable intervention (i.e., treatment satisfaction, treatment credibility), examine levels of active participation (i.e., program completion rates, levels of homework completion, use of introduced parenting skills, and management of a targeted parent-child interaction situation), and monitor potential harms (including parental reports of general perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety/depression and adverse events). Treatment integrity (assessed in terms of facilitator adherence/fidelity) is examined in 20% of group sessions (randomly selected), using checklists covering program elements and content."

The Substance Use and Health Risk Intervention (SUHRI) is a technology-based application designed to address the interrelated topics of substance use and risky sex practices, within the context of personal relationships. The intervention is designed as 4 sessions administered on a tablet as a self-directed approach (requiring an onsite proctor) for addressing factors that increase risk for significant health problems. The study will examine preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention. Youth aged 14 to 18 who are disposed to community supervision (deferred adjudication or probation) and meet eligibility requirements (1+ indicator of substance use, under community supervisions, English-speaking, no indication of suicide risk or thought disorder) will be sampled from a large urban Texas juvenile probation department. Protocol administration will be proctored by a TCU research assistant at a private space within a juvenile justice office or mutually agreed upon location of participant's choosing. Youth will be asked to complete all assessments and participate in the 4 individualized technology-based intervention sessions where youth will receive information and engage in decision making scenario-based games about substance use, sex risk practices, and related health-risk. The study will examine the impact of the intervention on problem recognition, decision making, intention to reduce personal risk, service initiation, substance use, and sexual/STI risk."

Remote Ischemic conditioning (RIC): Ischemic-preconditioning entails inducing short periods of cyclical tissue ischemia that confers subsequent protection against ischemia-reperfusion-injury. The rationale is that short periods of ischemia do not cause irreversible injury, but instead induce an endogenous protective environment. This short period of ischemia is not injurious, and it triggers endogenous protective signals (such as anti-inflammatory and antioxidant molecules) that reach distant organs, such as the heart, liver or the CNS. As an endogenous, non-specific response, the mechanisms involved in RIC are complex and include inflammation, oxidative stress, changes in endothelial function, cell survival etc. Current treatments for progressive Multiple Sclerosis (the immune-modulators Siponimod and Ocrelizumab) are only modestly effective and primarily benefit people with active inflammatory disease activity (recent relapses and/or enhancing lesions on MRI). Progression free of inflammatory activity is characterized by slow accumulation of disability, greatly affecting quality of life in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The investigators believe RIC is ideally suited to be tested as a therapy for progression in MS. Recent clinical trials in vascular disease have shown that daily RIC can be performed for up to a year and suggested an all-cause mortality benefit. In a recent (RICAMIS trial, 2022) multicenter, randomized trial of people with acute ischemic stroke (> 1,000 participants), 14-day RIC treatment led to improved functional outcomes at 6-months. No serious side effects were reported, and tolerability was good. This important study was the first phase III trial to find a protective effect for RIC in neurological disease, and highlights the timeliness and potential for re-purposing RIC as a therapy for MS. In this trial, the investigators will investigate whether RIC treatment can prevent disability worsening in people with Primary Progressive MS (PPMS). The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-futility of RIC for reducing progression of disability, as measured with the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), in people with PPMS. This is a phase II open-label, single-center, single-arm futility trial. The study will follow the Simon-2-stage MiniMax design for futility studies."

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe form of liver disease that can lead to liver failure and death. Corticosteroids are the only treatment that has been shown to improve survival in patients with severe AH. However, the response to corticosteroid treatment is highly variable, and it is difficult to predict which patients will benefit from this treatment. The investigators have recently shown that the prothrombin time (PT) at diagnosis is a simple and inexpensive test that can predict the response to corticosteroid treatment in patients with severe AH. The investigators hypothesize that the PT at diagnosis can be used to identify patients who are likely to respond to corticosteroid treatment and those who are not. The investigators will enroll 100 patients with severe AH who are eligible to corticosteroid treatment. The investigators will measure the PT at diagnosis and assess the response to corticosteroid treatment at day 7 using the Lille score. The investigators will also measure the PT at day 7 and assess the response to corticosteroid treatment at day 28 using the Lille score. The investigators will compare the PT at diagnosis with the PT at day 7 and the response to corticosteroid treatment at day 7 and day 28. The investigators will also assess the occurrence of complications such as infection and liver transplantation.

Plantar Fasciitis (PF) is a common cause of heel pain. It is a condition that affects the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot and connects your heel bone to your toes. PF is often caused by repetitive stress on the plantar fascia, such as from running or jumping. The condition can be very painful and can make it difficult to walk or stand.

Currently, there are no effective treatments for PF. The most common treatments include rest, ice, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications. However, these treatments are often ineffective and can take months to years to resolve the condition.

Recently, a new treatment called Photobiomodulation Therapy (PBMT) has been shown to be effective in treating PF. PBMT is a non-invasive treatment that uses low-level laser or light-emitting diode (LED) therapy to stimulate cellular activity and promote healing. PBMT has been shown to be effective in treating a variety of musculoskeletal conditions, including PF.

The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of PBMT in treating PF. The study will compare the effectiveness of PBMT to a sham treatment (a placebo treatment that looks like the real treatment but does not have any therapeutic effect). The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of PBMT in treating PF.

The study will be conducted at the Naval Medical Center San Diego (NMCSD) and will include 100 active duty military personnel with PF. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: usual care + PBM therapy, or usual care + sham (placebo) PBM therapy. Participants that are assigned to the PBM therapy group will receive active treatment with PBM 3 times a week for 3 weeks for a total of 9 treatments. Participants that are assigned to the sham PBM therapy group will receive Sham PBM therapy 3 times a week for 3 weeks for a total of 9 treatments. Sham PBM treatment time will be calculated in the same way as the PBM treatment group, with the time of treatment dependent on the size of the treatment area. The sham-PBMT will be administered by rolling the massage ball over the plantar surface of the foot and dorsal aspect of the calf in contact with the participants' skin. Because emission of photons at the selected treatment parameters may cause participants in the treatment group to feel warmth, the massage ball will be warmed in the sham-PBMT. The device will be turned on, so the red aiming beam will be visible, but the operator will not activate the switch to emit photons.

The study will assess the effectiveness of PBMT in treating PF using a variety of outcome measures, including pain levels, functional ability, and ultrasound measurements of plantar fascia thickness. The study will also assess the safety and tolerability of PBMT in treating PF."

Phase 1: Cross-Sectional Study A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare hepcidin levels, iron status and inflammatory markers in people living with and without obesity. Upon obtaining signed consent, participants will undergo a medical history assessment, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), body composition analysis (% body fat, % skeletal muscle mass, % fat-free mass), and blood samples will be collected to determine serum hepcidin levels, iron status, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, lipopolysaccharides), and oxidative stress markers (MDA). Additional blood samples will be taken for biochemical tests (glucose, lipid profile, creatinine, urea, liver function tests), insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and, optionally, DNA isolation for polymorphisms determination and those associated with iron metabolism and obesity. Participants will also complete a food frequency questionnaire (SNUT). Phase 2: Open randomized controlled clinical trial This phase will be conducted to assess the impact of weight loss on hepcidin levels, iron status, and inflammatory markers in individuals living with obesity. Participants recruited for this phase will be selected from those identified in the first phase who exhibit iron deficiency (serum iron < 50 mcg/dL). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups, both of which will undergo a 60-day follow-up period with a calorie-restricted diet, reducing caloric intake by less than 25% of the resting energy expenditure determined by indirect calorimetry. The intervention groups will be as follows: Calorie-restricted diet with macronutrient distribution: 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight in protein (including red meat), 50% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fats.

Blood samples will be collected to determine various biochemical parameters in the blood, including lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), liver function tests, glucose, insulin, creatinine, urea, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharides), and iron status markers. Furthermore, stool samples will be collected to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota and metabolomics. To assess treatment adherence, participants will be provided with a food logs to record their daily food consumption during the initial visit. The participants will also receive a pantry containing protein-rich foods every week to facilitate the nutritional intervention. Also, 2 phone calls will be made each week to evaluate adherence to treatment. The adherence will be determined with the % of adherence to the dietary treatment as obtained in the analysis of the food logs."

Pregnant women in need for maternal and/or fetal monitoring are hospitalized at the obstetric high care (OHC) of Máxima Medical Center (MMC). They are monitored for up to three times a day with conventional cardiotocography (CTG). In the meantime they reside at the OHC, but the status of the fetus and uterine activity (UA) is not monitored. Nemo Healthcare developed a wireless abdominal electrode patch for measuring fetal heart rate (FHR) and UA: The Nemo Fetal Monitoring System (NFMS). Previous research on non-invasive electrophysiological CTG (eCTG) has yielded promising results in monitoring FHR and UA both during pregnancy and labor. With the use of eCTG technology, safe continuous 24/7 monitoring is possible, which is not possible with conventional cardiotocography. The investigators hypothesize that by introducing continuous antepartum eCTG monitoring perinatal and maternal outcomes will improve. The investigators aim to include 1911 pregnant women ≥18 years old with a singleton pregnancy between 23+0 and 32+0 weeks of gestation requiring hospitalization on the OHC for maternal or fetal surveillance (including 1400 historical controls). Additional objectives: The collected NFMS and demographic data will be used to develop and verify a mathematical model for the prediction of time until (preterm) birth, which may be used in clinical practice to reduce unnecessary OHC admissions and facilitate a better timing of interventions. Furthermore, data collected in this study (NFMS, accelerometric, annotated ultrasound) will be used for the development and verification of a mathematical model for the automated detection of fetal movements in NFMS data. This latter model might provide new opportunities in non-invasive monitoring of fetal health."

Urinary incontinence (UI) is involuntary urinary leakage. This condition causes physical, psycho-social, and economic problems. It is more prevalent in women than in men. It occurs in women during pregnancy, childbirth, or menopause. It can also be triggered by factors such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus, chronic urinary infections, hysterectomy, and obesity. While urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening condition, it significantly impacts the quality of life for women. It leads to social phobia, social isolation, reduced self-confidence and self-esteem, embarrassment, psychological issues, as well as individual and societal costs. Urinary incontinence represents a growing burden in numerous countries. Investigators believe that the prevalence of UI may be underestimated because many women either seek healthcare assistance late or not at all due to perceiving it as a natural consequence of aging or childbirth or because they feel embarrassed about the issue. Furthermore, only a small fraction of women who are diagnosed with UI receive effective treatment. More than half of women with UI (66.4%) take approximately three years to seek medical assistance due to fears of stigmatization and a lack of information about treatment. The treatment and care for UI necessitate a multidisciplinary approach due to the complexity of the condition and the various issues it involves. However, before women are willing to seek medical assistance for UI, they must first recognize it as a medical issue. Hence, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of UI, raise awareness among women about the condition, and provide ongoing support for those affected by it. By taking these steps, we can effectively manage and prevent this condition, as well as create opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, this study investigated the prevalence, type, and risk factors of UI in married women and its effect on their quality of life."

We hypothesize that the use of 1% ropivacaine for ultrasound guided ankle blocks will result in a significantly faster onset time and a longer sensory block duration, and thus analgesia, compared to the use of 0.25% and 0.5% ropivacaine in patients having forefoot surgery. The primary outcome is the difference in the duration of the sensory blocks. The secondary outcomes are the difference in onset time of the sensory block, the postoperative pain scores, and the opioid consumption."

Lumbosacral spine surgeries are commonly performed under general anesthesia. Perioperative pain following spine surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal analgesia can be effectively given preemptively to alleviate pain and facilitate early mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pre-emptive caudal epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in lumbosacral surgeries and to compare the effect of adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine with respect to quality of analgesia, duration of analgesia, hemodynamic effects and associated side effects. Patients will be allocated in one of the two groups, I and II, consisting of 30 each, using a lottery based random number. A box containing 60 chits, with 30 labelled as group I and other 30 as group II, will be given to each patient and will be asked to take out 1 chit. The group allocated will be written in separate paper by an anesthesiologist, who will also prepare drugs. Decoding will be done later after completion of all data collection. The patient in Group I will be given caudal epidural injection with 0.25% ropivacaine 20 ml containing dexamethasone 8 mg (0.5% Ropivacaine 10 ml + 8 mg/2 ml Dexamethasone + 8 ml NS) and group II will be give 0.25% ropivacaine 20 ml. All the data collection will be done by another anesthesiologist, not involved in group allocation, drug preparation and administration. At preoperative visit, all patients will be made familiar with VAS score for pain assessment and will be recorded. At operation theatre, standard American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) monitoring, including electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, pulse oximetry and endtidal carbon dioxide, will be applied and measured. Patient's vitals will be recorded at preinduction, induction, postintubation, after caudal injection, time of incision, and at 15 min intervals till half an hour after completion of surgery. Intravenous (IV) line will be secured, and inj. Ringer Lactate (RL) 500 ml will be administered. Anesthesia will be induced with inj. Midazolam 0.04 mg/kg, inj. Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, inj.

The investigators will conduct formative research to inform development of the P-KIDs CARE intervention. The investigators will enroll 100 children into the pediatric injury registry and conduct capacity assessments of the two study facilities using the WHO Health Emergency Unit Assessment Tool. The investigators will conduct in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 15 family members of pediatric injury patients who were referred and made it to Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), and 15 family members of pediatric injury patients who were referred but did not make it to KCMC. The investigators will conduct 2 focus group discussions (FGDs) with approximately 10-15 healthcare providers of pediatric injury patients at each of the 2 the study facilities. In Aim 2, the investigators will use this formative data to develop the P-KIDs CARE intervention during a 2-day intervention development workshop with an interdisciplinary study team. The investigators will then perform a pre-implementation assessment and refinement by convening focus group discussions with healthcare providers and a community-engaged panel. This step will enable us to obtain feedback and refine the intervention. In Aim 3, the investigators will pilot the intervention in 2 study facilities in the Kilimanjaro Region. The investigators anticipate 10 total healthcare providers will be enrolled across the 2 study facilities. The investigators expect to enroll approximately 200 pediatric injury patients, 100 in the pre-intervention period and 100 in the post-intervention period. The investigators will conduct post-surveys and exit interviews for healthcare providers using the intervention, assessing implementation outcomes including feasibility, healthcare provider acceptability, and fidelity. The investigators will also conduct interviews with family members of 12 patients referred to KCMC and 12 patients not referred, assessing acceptability and satisfaction with the disposition decision.

The administration of intravenous anesthetics in the elderly population requires adequate titration to avoid deleterious effects derived from overdosing or underdosing. Older patients show greater sensitivity to similar doses of propofol compared to younger patients. In addition, there is extensive interindividual variability among older patients, which would also explain the different responses to the same dose of drugs. This variability would be secondary to differences in comorbidities and physiological age, in contrast to chronological age, which would not explain the differences found in response to anesthetics in these patients. One way in which an attempt has been made to make the doses of anesthetics in different patients comparable is the use of models that predict what infusion rate is required to maintain a given concentration at the site of drug action. The relationship between a propofol effect site concentration (Ce) with a given effect can be represented by pharmacodynamic (PD) models. Recently, Eleveld et al. created a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for the administration of intravenous propofol in a population of wide ages, including neonates to older patients. However, the pharmacodynamic parameter used in this model was the BIS index, which has been questioned for its use in older adults. In addition, the creation of this PD model only included 3 patients older than 70 years, so the underrepresentation of this age group in the construction of the model could affect its performance, making it even more difficult to correctly predict the effect in this population. Anesthetic drugs exert their desired hypnotic effect on the brain. Brain electrical activity can be monitored non-invasively by recording electrical potential on the cranial surface using electrodes. The electroencephalographic (EEG) changes observed with the administration of anesthetics are usually systematic across different patients. These have been described and have been used to identify different phases of anesthetic depth or hypnosis. In addition, the representation of the EEG signal by means of a spectrogram has facilitated the incorporation of this information into commercial EEG monitors that previously only included highly processed indices such as the BIS. Within the EEG patterns of the spectrogram described for anesthetic maintenance with propofol, the alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations stand out. However, the power of alpha oscillations decreases with age and with other changes that are associated with age, such as decreased cognitive ability, increased comorbidities and brain vulnerability. Therefore, guiding our administration of propofol based on obtaining a pattern of alpha predominance appears to be difficult in this aged population. The general objective of this work is to build a PKPD model that uses the pharmacokinetic parameters of the Eleveld model and new pharmacodynamic parameters derived from the frontal EEG in a population older than 65 years of age. Our hypothesis is that the Eleveld PKPD model, modified with this new pharmacodynamic parameter, will predict better the hypnotic effect of propofol than the original Eleveld PKPD model, in adult patients older than 65 years. The creation of a PKPD model of propofol for the population over 65 years of age would allow a better titration of this drug to avoid possible deleterious effects secondary to its under or overdosage."

Acute cholangitis is an infection of the biliary tract which is managed with biliary drainage and antibiotic therapy (ABT). Currently the international Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) recommend 4 to 7 days of ABT after source control. The national SWAB guideline of 2020 suggests a course of one to 3 days after biliary drainage. There are no randomized studies to guide the duration of ABT for acute cholangitis. Our recent retrospective study in the Netherlands showed that a short course of ABT seems safe and more evidence is available showing that other bacterial infections, including abdominal and bloodstream infections, can be treated with a short antibiotic course than previously assumed. Hence, the hypothesis is that a very short-course of ABT for acute cholangitis is non-inferior to a course of 4 to 7 days after adequate biliary drainage. This study is designed as a multicenter non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (one day of antibiotic therapy after ERCP) or the comparator group (4 to 7 days of antibiotic therapy after ERCP)."

The aim of this study is to optimize the fractionation schedules for radiotherapy in the treatment of heel spurs (HSS, plantar fasciitis) through a prospective randomized open-label trial conducted at Department of Radiation Oncology at Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute Brno (MMCI). Low-dose external beam radiotherapy (LD-EBRT), known for its anti-inflammatory effect, offers effective pain relief for HSS patients. Currently, the standard LD-EBRT regimen consists of six fractions of 1 Gray (Gy) administered twice weekly, resulting in a total dose of 6 Gy. This study posits the hypothesis that very low total doses of orthovoltage radiotherapy, delivered in a single fraction, may provide pain relief comparable to that achieved with higher doses of fractionated radiotherapy. The primary goal of this research is to determine whether one-day irradiation (a single fraction) is non-inferior to fractionated radiotherapy over a three-month period in terms of pain relief for HSS patients. This study was supported by grant of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic AZV NU22-10-00479. All patients signed informed consent."

Gastroparesis is a chronic disease of the stomach that causes delayed gastric emptying without stenosis. It is a chronic alteration of gastric motility that leads to a delay in stomach emptying. It is an underdiagnosed condition. The prevalence is estimated at around 3% in the United States (mean age of 37.7 years, with an F: M ratio of 4:1. It is mainly an idiopathic condition; however, it can also be caused by diabetes mellitus and post-surgical conditions, such as fundoplication, vagotomy, bariatric surgery, and esophagectomy. Less frequently by conditions like post-infectious gastro-paresis, neurological or autoimmune diseases. The clinical symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, post-prandial fullness, bloating, belching, and upper abdominal discomfort. The gastroparesis cardinal symptoms index (GCSI) is a reliable, reproducible, and valid instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. It is based on three sub-scales (post-prandial fullness/early satiety-4 items; nausea/vomiting-3 items; bloating-2 items), and each item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (severe). GCSI is not a diagnostic tool, but it is helpful to measure the severity of the disease and the post-treatment improvement. Though the prevalence of gastroparesis has significantly increased over the last decade, management is still challenging. Patients with mild symptoms can be referred for dietary modifications coupled with medical therapy with prokinetics, especially metoclopramide. However, the response to prokinetics decreases over time. Moreover, these drugs have side effects, such as extrapyramidal symptoms and amenorrhea. Surgical approaches have been proposed; however, the invasive nature of those procedures and the low rate of clinical success have made them less favorable. Endoscopic interventions have also been described, including intra-pyloric injection of botulinum toxin, endoscopic gastrojejunostomy, and transpyloric stenting. For patients with refractory (persistent symptoms for >6 months refractory to medical therapy) and severe gastroparesis based on GCSI > 2, gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy can be considered. In 2013, the first human gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) was performed. It was inspired by the per-oral endoscopic myotomy technique, with a similar dissection method, that allows pyloromyotomy. The technical steps of G-POEM involve mucosal incision about 5 cm from the pylorus with the creation of access to the submucosal plane after detaching the planes by injection of lifting solution; creation of the submucosal tunnel with dissection technique up to the duodenal bulb and exposure of the pylorus; verification of the integrity of the mucosal surface; pyloromyotomy and closure of the mucosal flap with multiple endoclips. In the single pyloromyotomy group, a selective circular pyloromyotomy is performed at the 6 or 7 o'clock position after identifying the pyloric ring. In the double pyloromyotomy group, another selective cut is performed at the 4 or 5 o'clock position to keep at least 1 cm between the two pyloromyotomies. Only one retrospective case-controlled study compares single versus double pyloromyotomy at G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis. It showed a higher clinical response rate with double pyloromyotomy when compared with single pyloromyotomy in a 3- to 6-month follow-up period. In this randomized controlled prospective multicenter study, we aim to compare clinical outcomes and the efficacy of single versus double pyloromyotomy in G-POEM for refractory and severe gastroparesis. Prospective subjects will be approached regarding study inclusion either during a pre-endoscopy visit or shortly before their planned endoscopy procedure. If the latter, the prospective subject will be approached during intake and before being brought to the back for the procedure. The study will be explained in detail and,"

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use of a substance despite its harmful consequences. People with SUD have an intense focus on using a certain substance(s) such as alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs, to the point where the person's ability to function in day-to-day life becomes impaired. People keep using the substance even when they know it is causing or will cause problems. Drug use brings with it the likelihood of several negative health consequences. These can include a wide range of physical and mental health disorders, foremost of which are dependence, HIV infection, hepatitis-related liver diseases, overdose and premature death. The problem of substance use is becoming one of the most serious and rapidly growing phenomena all over the world. It accounts for substantial global morbidity, mortality, and financial and social burden. According to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, there were an estimated 494,000 drug-related deaths attributable to the use of drugs in 2019. In 2020, 1 in every 18 people aged 15-64 worldwide - an estimated 284 million people (5.6 per cent of the population) - had used a drug in the past 12 months. However, the coverage of interventions for the treatment of drug use disorders remains low overall. Implementation of scientific evidence-based drug prevention interventions remains low as well, especially in middle- and low-income countries. In Egypt, SUD is a serious public health threat. Recent studies have demonstrated increases in the prevalence of the use of tobacco, illegal drugs, and over-the-counter drugs, particularly among youth. Drug treatment registers are often used as a proxy indicator of treatment demand. This information is useful for analysis of service utilization and can be used as an indicator of trends in prevalence and patterns of high-risk drug consumption. Assiut University Hospital is the biggest hospital in Upper Egypt, and it provides health services for Assiut city and most of the neighboring governorates. Addiction management unit of Assiut University Hospital contains 16 beds, based on paid service and about 400 patients have been admitted per year. SUD is a dynamic process that changes constantly over time with new trends of drug dependence emerge every now and then, thus timely information about trends in psychoactive substance use could yield tailored interventions and reduce potential harms. Identifying personal, social, and demographic characteristics of patients with this disorder at the local, regional, and national levels helps physicians, health authorities, and policy-makers detect early emerging trends and enable them better plan and implement prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs. This study aims to identify sociodemographic, personal characteristics, as well as patterns of illicit drug abuse in patients admitted for addiction treatment."

Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most intractable primary malignancies in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic tract with a poor overall survival worldwide. Surgery in the form of hepatectomy or liver transplantation provides the best chance of cure for early-stage disease. Unfortunately, the vast majority of hepatocellular carcinoma patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. On the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models. However, a robust and concrete evidence of abscopal effect with combinational immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation or external radiation therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still lacking. This phase 2 single-arm study will investigate the efficacy and safety of combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation for previously untreated metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma."

The extremity artery is the peripheral blood vessel of the whole body, and it is often involved early in the diseases that are easy to damage the small vessels, such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases. Early lower limb atherosclerosis mainly occurs in the dorsal foot artery, which is commonly seen in people with diabetes and long-term smoking. Connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus also mainly involve small blood vessels, and vascular lesions may appear earlier than those of other specific organs such as heart and lung. Because of its shallow location, the extremity artery can be better used as a screening site for vascular diseases, and it is the window for early reaction of vascular diseases. However, the early stage of extremity artery disease is easy to be ignored, and patients often have pain and numbness of the affected limb. When the disease is severe, it can lead to ulcer not healing, and even limb gangrene and amputation, which greatly affects the quality of life and brings huge troubles and economic pressure to the patients. Therefore, early diagnosis of extremity arterial lesions is of great significance for early diagnosis of microvascular injury diseases such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases, reducing the incidence of complications, and reducing the rate of amputation and mortality. Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in clinic. In recent years, with the development of ultrasound technology, the frequency of ultrasonic probes has been increasing. Because of its higher resolution, high-frequency ultrasound can clearly display the superficial vascular structure and blood flow, detect vascular lesions early, and accurately quantify the degree of stenosis, providing a new and beneficial tool for clinical observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities. The purpose of this multi-center clinical study was to establish the normal value of high frequency ultrasound for the structure and blood flow of the extremities of Chinese Han adults, and to explore its influencing factors, so as to provide a quantitative reference for the early diagnosis, degree evaluation and curative effect observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities."

The purpose of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of STERIFY GEL in promoting healing of periodontal pockets following SRP, compared with treatment with SRP alone. With specific visco-elastic and mucoadhesive properties, STERIFY GEL easily penetrates into the deepest and hard-to-reach areas of periodontal and peri-implant pockets, adhering to the gingival tissue and alveolar bone, providing complete coverage of the pockets. The effect of STERIFY GEL is promoted by a physical mechanism of action. After SRP, the gel is applied into the gingival pocket, where it acts primarily as a filler to restore volume, physically preventing bacteria from entering and reinfecting the pocket. STERIFY GEL can thus mechanically protect treated pockets and bone defects, promoting tissue healing. The occluding action at the level of periodontal and peri-implant gingival pockets, in synergy with the accessory action of hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, prevents bacterial recolonization and promotes subsequent tissue regeneration. Although SRP surgery is considered a gold standard treatment for periodontitis, it may in some cases be insufficient to decontaminate the pocket allowing bacteria to recolonize the tissues promoting new inflammation that can worsen the clinical picture.STERIFY GEL may find useful application in cases of moderate to severe chronic periodontal disease as an adjunctive treatment following SRP to improve and accelerate healing parameters and prevent recurrent inflammation and infection.In addition, antimicrobial control action prevents antibiotic use and the risk associated with antibiotic resistance.Such control of periodontal disease also allows for the maintenance of patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment (e.g., patients on bisphosphonate therapy, defected etc.)."

The upshot is not only amnesia, but also difficulty in memory integration in the context of time and location, and the feeling that the traumatic event is present all the time and everywhere. Improved hippocampal function may contribute to better access to memories of a traumatic event and to memory contextualization and neutralization. Memory processing is essential for PTSD recovery. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding one atmosphere absolute. HBOT has been applied worldwide, mostly for chronic non-healing wounds. Our team demonstrated that HBOT induced hippocampal neuroplasticity in veterans with long-standing treatment-resistant PTSD; this led to enhanced memory recovery and significant improvement in PTSD symptoms. The investigators also demonstrated effects of HBOT on memory recovery among women with fibromyalgia due to childhood sexual abuse. Both physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, and cognitive training were shown to support neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate whether hippocampal training, induced by physical and cognitive training, will augment the hippocampal neuroplasticity effect of HBOT and further enhance recovery of inaccessible memories in veterans with PTSD. The protocol will include forty male veterans aged 25 to 60 years, with combat-associated PTSD and peritraumatic amnesia, who will receive either HBOT alone or HBOT and hippocampal training. The HBOT protocol will consist of 60 daily sessions, 90-minutes each, five days a week. Hippocampal training will combine physical and cognitive training 3 times per week, prior to HBOT sessions. Detailed psychological evaluation, anatomic and functional MRI, electroencephalogram and autonomic nervous system data will be obtained at baseline, and during and after treatment. The proposed study offers a new approach of biological treatment for memory manipulations. The findings will help elucidate the mechanism of PTSD-related memory impairment, and is expected to contribute to the development of biological memory manipulations for treating PTSD and other memory-related conditions."

Cardiac involvement is considered a serious condition and a frequent cause of death in patients with sarcoidosis. 18F-FDG PET/CT is currently used as part of the diagnostic criteria for cardiac sarcoidosis, but it has shown limitations in the evaluation of cardiac sarcoidosis due to the high physiological uptake of FDG in normal cardiac muscle. Elaborate preparations are required for patients including either a low-carbohydrate diet followed by long fasting or heparin loading before FDG-PET. In heparin loading, the rare adverse effect of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be considered. Therefore, it is of interest to find a PET/CT tracer that displays high sensitivity and specificity without requiring thorough patient preparation and minimizing any adverse effects. A potential tracer is the somatostatin-based tracer 64Cu-DOTATATE, which is routinely used for the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Inflammatory cells, including macrophages that are found in sarcoid granulomas, express somatostatin receptors on their surface, whereas normal cardiomyocytes do not. This allows for the potential use of macrophage imaging in cardiac sarcoidosis. In the CuDOSIS trial, groups A and B (suspected and confirmed cardiac sarcoidosis, respectively) will be scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT in addition to the routinely performed 18F-FDG PET/CT. Further, to examine whether the macrophage infiltration pattern is different in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and other inflammatory heart diseases, a group of patients with confirmed or clinically suspected myocarditis will be included (group C); this group will only be scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT. Finally, data from a group of patients with neuroendocrine tumours (negative controls) who have previously been scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE will be included."

The purpose of this study is to compare the outcomes of different treatment modalities for massive rotator cuff tears. The study will include patients with massive rotator cuff tears aged between 50 to 80 years. The study is conducted in Tartu University Hospital Sports Traumatology Centre and rotator cuff repair procedures will be done by three orthopaedic surgeons with long experience in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. It is determined intra-operatively whether the tear is reparable or not. If possible, the tendon(s) will be anatomically repaired. For irreparable tears intra-operative urn randomization takes place - either partial repair or partial repair with SCR using the LHBBT. Surgical techniques will be standardized. Patients who refuse operative treatment, will be followed as conservative treatment group. The primary objective of the study is the functional status of the included subjects in different treatment groups. The secondary objective of the study is to confirm whether the tendons are intact on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after operation using Sugaya classification (2007). The post-operative therapy regimen will be the same for each study group. Subjects will come for scheduled visits at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month timepoints. Assessment tools consist of range of motion (ROM), strength measurements, preoperative radiography measuring acromio-humeral index (AHI), critical shoulder angle (CSA), acromion type and shoulder arthrosis (Hamada), functional scores: The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), The Constant-Murley score (CMS), The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and visual analogue scale (VAS), also including Tampa kinesiophobia score and emotional well-being (EEK) score. Goutallier classification (1994) will be used pre- and postoperatively to measure muscle fatty infiltration."

Achalasia is a rare disease that causes dysphagia and regurgitation of undigested food. Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a minimally invasive procedure that has been widely used for the treatment of achalasia. However, hemodynamic instability during the procedure is a common problem. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of autonomic dysfunction on hemodynamic instability during POEM in achalasia patients.
In this prospective observational study, we will include 100 patients who are scheduled to undergo POEM in Gangnam Severance Hospital. Patients will be divided into two groups: patients with autonomic dysfunction and patients with normal autonomic function. The autonomic dysfunction will be evaluated by heart rate variability (HRV) test. The hemodynamic instability will be evaluated by the wobble of systolic arterial pressure (SAP) during the procedure.
The primary outcome is the wobble of SAP during the procedure. The secondary outcomes are the incidence of hemodynamic instability, the incidence of hypotension, the incidence of bradycardia, the incidence of tachycardia, the incidence of arrhythmia, the incidence of hypoxemia, the incidence of hypercapnia, the incidence of hypothermia, the incidence of hypoglycemia, the incidence of hypocalcemia, the incidence of hypomagnesemia, the incidence of hypokalemia, the incidence of hypophosphatemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoosmolarity, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypoalbuminemia, the incidence of hypo"

The study was designed by including children aged 2-5 years, who needed inhaler treatment (salbutamol) between 10.11.2022 and 01.04.2023, whose families gave consent for the study. This age group (preschool) was chosen because it is the age group that presents the most difficulties to families and physicians during inhaler treatment and screen exposure does not cause problems up to a certain point. The study was conducted as a prospective, single-blind, randomized, controlled study in the Pediatric Emergency Department of the Health Sciences University Haseki Training and Research Hospital. Children with neuromotor retardation, visual and auditory problems, underlying chronic diseases (bronchiolitis, chronic lung diseases other than asthma, congenital heart diseases, neurological diseases such as epilepsy), obesity or malnutrition (to equalize the effectiveness of the drug dose), adrenaline, budesonide or those who receive ipratropium bromide treatment, Those who will receive inhaler inhaler treatment for the first time, Those who have received inhaler treatment in the last 72 hours, Those who have a previous operation or sedative history, Those who have a fever above 37.5°C, Those who have used VR before, Patients with a saturation value below 92% at the time of admission, Those presenting with severe asthma attack, Those with respiratory failure symptoms, Patients with a score of 5 and above according to the bronchiolitis severity score Those under 2 years of age to avoid screen exposure patients (infants) and patients over 5 years old (school period) were excluded from the study. Children with a score of 5 and above according to the bronchiolitis severity score were excluded from the study. The children included in the study were divided into 3 groups by randomization method: VR audio-visual users (Roller Coasters, group 1), VR audio-visual users (Wild Dolphins, group 2) and those who did not use any additional equipment (group 3). 3D Roller Coasters and 3D Wild Dolphins videos were used as VR images via Youtube application (Google LLC. California, USA; Youtube®). VR glasses were integrated into the tablet and given to the accompanying parent, so that the parent could see what their child was watching at that moment. Children in all groups were given 'salbutamol' inhaler treatment for 15 minutes, and equality was achieved between the groups in terms of treatment active substance and duration. Salbutamol was given to each child as 2.5 mg/2.5 ml. The children were observed during their 15-minute inhaler treatment, and the crying times were compared with the anxiety scoring made by the same doctor before and after the treatment, and the minute respiratory rate (RR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), heart rate change (HR) and the duration of inhaler treatment were compared. In addition, families filled out questionnaires about their children's mental state before and after the treatment. The FLACC (Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, consolability) Pain Assessment Scale was used for the anxiety scoring made by the physician, and the Yale Modified Anxiety Scale (MYPAS), which was thought to be appropriate for our study, although it was designed to measure pre-operative anxiety. For families, a form consisting of eight 'yes-no' questions called the Parents' Pain Measure (MPPM), modified by us and normally used for post-operative anxiety/pain measurement, was used. In addition, Wong Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale (WBS) was also used to evaluate the anxiety of the children for convenience to the family. The children to be included in the study were determined by a single researcher. The first investigator identified the children who met the inclusion criteria, noted the FLACC and MYPAS score, as well as the RR, SpO2, and HR values, and referred the child to the other investigator. The second investigator divided the child into his group using the randomization method, and determined the duration of crying and effective treatment, along with the duration of treatment, with a double chronometer during treatment. At the end of the treatment, the family and the child were re-directed to the first researcher on the condition that they did not tell the first researcher which group they were in. Thus, it was ensured that the first investigator did not know which group the child belonged to while filling in the"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of high flow nasal oxygenation (HFNO) on oxygen saturation and heart rate during the induction of anaesthesia in infants and small children.
The investigators hypothesize that HFNO will improve oxygen saturation and heart rate during the induction of anaesthesia in infants and small children.
The investigators will perform a randomized controlled pilot trial.
The investigators will include 100 infants and small children (age 1-6 years) indicated for rapid sequence induction (RSI) and preoxygenation.
The investigators will randomize the patients into three groups: 1) RSI + face-mask preoxygenation, 2) RSI + HFNOC preoxygenation and 3) RSI + face-mask and HFNOC preoxygenation.
The investigators will observe the demographic data, type of surgery and vital signs.
The investigators will evaluate the impact of HFNOC preoxygenation on oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and heart rate during the induction of anaesthesia.
The investigators will also evaluate the safety of the RSI protocol, Cormack-Lehane score, incidence of difficult airway management, number of the intubation attempts and episodes of regurgitation/aspiration.
The investigators will perform the RSI according to our protocol.
The investigators will check the equipment and an i.v. line will be checked/started and then a bolus of ketamine will be given (0,2-0,5 mg/kg intravenously,) for the face-mask/HFNOC tolerance and the table will be tilted to anti-Trendelenburg position.
In case of difficult or unable of intravenous line insertion, intramuscular bolus of ketamin (1-3mg/kg i.m.) could be used prior to another attempt.
Afterward, the preoxygenation will start according to the randomization result - group 1) face-mask preoxygenation (flow 2 L/kg/minute, max 6 L/minute), group 2) HFNOC preoxygenation (flow 2 L/kg/minute, max 6 L/minute) and group 3) HFNOC (flow 2 L/kg/minute) + face-mask preoxygenation (flow 2 L/kg/minute, max 6 L/minute) - with 100 % oxygen for three minutes.
Then a bolus of anaesthetic and myorelaxant agent will be given (propofol 2,5 mg/kg in haemodynamically stable, ketamine in haemodynamically unstable and rocuronium 1 mg/kg or suxamethonium 1,5 mg/kg if sugammadex bolus was given in last 24 hours).
The neuromuscular blockade will be monitored, first intubation attempt will start as soon as single twitch will be bellow 10 % or train-of-four (TOF) bellow 1 or after 60 seconds, whichever comes first.
After that, the first intubation attempt will take place, a video laryngoscopy will be used and Cormack-Lehane score will be documented photographically.

To continue to participate in games, users must subscribe to a six-month membership ($69 USD total). In general, users can join up to ten games at a time. The app has a game directory (explore tab) that includes 60+ games each week in three categories: fitness, nutrition, and mindset. New games start on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Each game lasts between 1-4 weeks and requires players to achieve a specific behavioral goal (e.g., 5K Steps Per Day requires that they walk at least 5,000 steps per day on at least 4 days per week for 2 weeks). Upon joining a game, players have an option to make a deposit, called a financial commitment of $10-30, depending on the game. Multiple methods are used to validate goal achievement. Some games require players to verify their physical activity data by connecting their WayBetter app account (i.e., syncing) to a wearable device or step tracking app. Other games require participants to verify their behavior by submitting photos (e.g., photo from their wearable device or step tracking app showing that they met the game's daily step goal; photo of meals they ate). Each game also has a social feed, where users can view each other's posts and photo submissions and share anything related to their fitness journey (e.g., progress, inspiration, something they are proud of). All players who achieve the game's goal are declared winners. Winners who made deposits are rewarded by splitting the total pot of deposits evenly, such that they earn back their original deposit plus addition profit, dependent on how many users 'lost'. The app incorporates an additional gamification aspect by introducing levels; players are required to win 3 games to advance a level (one from each category; they can choose any games they want) WayBetter will send out a recruitment email to WayBetter users five days after they enter into a seven-day free trial. In the email, participants will be invited to complete a study survey via the Qualtrics link provided. After clicking on the link, participants will first be prompted to read and respond to the study LOI. Thereafter, participants will be asked to complete the survey which will aim to collect information about individual-level socio-demographics (i.e., household income, rural or urban living status, gender, age, race, and ethnicity), previous health behaviours (i.e., previous fitness, nutrition, stress, weight loss), determinants of behavioural intentions to use health and fitness apps, and behavioural/personality traits (i.e., risk taking traits, healthy behaviour self-efficacy, personality traits). Participants who complete the survey will earn a $10 USD e-gift card, distributed directly to participant provided email via the Tango Card rewards platform (https://www.tangocard.com). Any games that did not utilize deposit wagers (i.e., accountability partners or no motivational booster) will not be included in the analysis. Our primary outcomes are rates of (a) initial six-month subscription and b) subscription renewal rates at six months, for the WayBetter app. User"

This study utilizes the Near-Infrared Functional Imaging System (fNIRS) as a biological marker for psychotherapy. The investigators propose the following scientific hypothesis: In patients with depression, levels of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin in different brain regions may fluctuate at different stages of the disease progression and treatment, along with changes in the activation levels of different brain regions. Neuroimaging studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of depression suggest a reduction in gray matter volume in emotion processing areas such as the limbic system, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Previous neuroimaging studies have found that successful cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) accompanied changes in gray matter volume in the brain, as observed through fMRI. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), which is a component of the third wave of CBT, is expected to exhibit more significant expression in cognitive task-based fNIRS during IPT treatment for depression. In this project, the investigators will implement medication therapy, psychotherapy, and a combination of medication therapy with psychotherapy, specifically utilizing IPT, in patients with depression. Simultaneously, the investigators will conduct comprehensive fNIRS assessments on all patients to evaluate changes in their brain function and determine the level of effectiveness of psychotherapy. The investigators will also employ standardized psychological assessments to evaluate patients, allowing for a comparison of the effectiveness of fNIRS assessments and providing clarity on the efficacy of psychotherapy in patients with depression, as the investigatorsll as the differential efficacy of different treatment approaches, and establishing the biological markers of psychotherapy. Additionally, the investigators will collect blood samples, cranial magnetic resonance images, and electroencephalograms from patients before and after treatment, which will contribute to further exploration of treatment mechanisms in the future."

Lacrimal drainage obstruction can manifest as epiphora or recurrent infections with mucopurulent discharge and may even cause social embarrassment. Obstruction can occur at any level along the lacrimal drainage system: punctum, canaliculus, nasolacrimal duct, or nasal ostium. It is seen more often in females, especially in postmenopausal women. The etiopathogenesis of lacrimal passage obstruction appears to be multifactorial. Chronic inflammation has been suggested to be the most causal. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a standard surgical procedure used to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), with a reported success rate of more than 90%. Knowledge concerning the morphological characteristics of lacrimal passage obstruction using traditional diagnostic methods (e.g., lacrimal irrigation, probing, dacryocystography) is limited. Dacryoendoscopy was originally described in 1979 and has recently matured for use in lacrimal drainage system imaging. It has been proved to be a useful instrument not only for understanding differences in the etiology of obstructions but also for treating LD obstructions. On the other hand, semiconductor diode laser can achieve more effective tissue dissection than direct probing technique with minimal hemorrhage and improved intraoperative view. Hence, dacryoendoscopic-assisted laser dacryoplasty with silicone intubation (DLDI) offers direct therapy to the obstructed site, leading to minimal collateral damage external to the target zone. In addition, this procedure can be performed under local anesthesia as an outpatient procedure in the office, and it has advantages such as short surgery time and less risk of bleeding during surgery, resulting in its increasingly widespread use in China. Although the silicone intubation using dacryoendoscopy has increased the success rates, the success rates vary from a low of 51% to a high of 90%. The difference in success rates seems to depend on the site of obstruction, differences in the surgical technique, stringency of definitions of success, and duration of follow-up. A greater understanding of factors associated with treatment failure may allow us to glean insights regarding patient selection and ultimately improve treatment outcome. The aim of our study was to report the results of DLDI for the management of NLDO, and to identify factors associated with DLDI failure."

Stroke is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in the neck or brain becomes blocked. Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis). The general prevalence charge of stroke is round 2-25 according to thousand population. The chance of recurrence over five years is 15-40%. Ischemic stroke is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in the neck or brain becomes blocked. Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis).Hemorrhagic stroke is because of bleeding into the brain through the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemorrhagic stroke can be in addition subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The concord symptom is abrupt numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body. Sudden disorientation or difficulty speaking or understanding language. sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes; sudden difficulty walking, lightheadedness, or loss of balance or coordination; sudden severe headache of unknown cause.The most common risk factor for stroke is hypertension.Upper motor neuron lesion due to stroke outcomes in a constellation of sensorimotor impairments which includes muscle weakness, impaired selective motor control, spasticity, and proprioceptive deficits that intervene with normal gait.Gait is one of the most important aspects of a stroke rehabilitation program. Patients with stroke are characterized by decreased ankle dorsiflexion during the swing, which leads to a decrease in gait ability. Hemiparetic gait is characterised by using particular spatiotemporal styles, along with decreased cadence, prolonged swing period on the paretic aspect, prolonged stance duration on the nonparetic side, and step length asymmetry.Post-stroke hemiplegic gait is a combination of deviations and compensatory movement dictated by way of residual functions.Decreased functional mobility is a well-known residual disability after stroke and is associated with the ability to move (e.g., get in and out of a bed or chair), walk a certain distance, and turn. , is related. while remaining independent. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a stretching technique used to improve muscle flexibility and has been exhibited to have a positive effect on active and passive range of motion. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is a very powerful healing exercise for the improvement of muscle thickness, dynamic stability and gait and broadly used in medical settings to improve the bodily functioning of stroke patients.Some of the techniques of Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation are contarct-relax, hold-relax, rhythmic initiation etc.PNF techniques are done in diagnol pattern involving flexion and extension, abduction and adduction, internal and external rotation. Kinesiotape is an elastic therapeutic tape used for the treatment of various disorders.Kinesiotapingis theorize to have numerous features (1) restoring muscle characteristic by assisting weakened muscles,(2) reducing c ongestion through improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing ache by way of stimulating neurological system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm. Depending on the direction of application and tape tension increasing proprioception and increasing or inhibiting muscle recruitment can be obtained. The effect and positive result of Kinesio Tape greatly centers on increase in neuromuscular recruitment.RCT was conducted by S.Choi et.al in 2020 on immediate effects of ankle nonelastic taping on balance and gait ability in patients with chronic stroke. 30 patients with stroke more than the duration of 6 months, both genders were included in this study. Non-elastic ankle taping is applied first, start at the bottom of the first metatarsal head and wrap the tape diagonally toward the fifth metatarsal head. Primary Outcome measure tools for static and dynamic balance measured by balance system SD and changes in gait parameters measured by GATErite system. Their study demonstrate that non-elastic ankle taping has a beneficial effect on static and dynamic balance ability scores, gait velocity, step length, and stride length in patients with chronic stroke.

Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence as well as morbidity rates are high in older patients. Surgery is the standard of care. About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk clinico-pathologic features that can increase risk of local recurrence (LR). Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence. Despite the lack of high level evidence, ART is indicated in patients according to unfavorable prognostic factors. ART benefit is generally questioned in regard to the potential degradation of the patient's quality of life (QoL). Currently there is no prospective trial or recommendations that take into account geriatric patients' evaluation and profiles during the management of NMSC. In addition, there is no data that could help to define the subgroup of elderly patients who will benefit from ART in tumors with unfavorable prognostic factors. In terms of ART, multiple fractionation schedules are available, ranging from standard fractionation (45-60Gy in 5-6 weeks) to the extreme hypofractionation delivering 16-18Gy in one fraction. In routine practice, HF is mainly preferred in elderly patients for more convenience by reducing the number of transports and increase health related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is no data on the fragility profiles of these patients, nor validating any HF schedule in terms of efficacy, acute toxicity, cosmetic results, and impact on HRQoL. Hypothesis/Objective Main Objective: To evaluate the comparative efficacy of two modalities of Radiotherapy over surgery alone on local tumor control in older patients with Non Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) In current practice, adjuvant radiotherapy is discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence as determined by the existence (or not) of unfavorable prognostic factors. The proposed study will include R0-high risk of CBC and CEC of the skin in elderly patients. There is no risk regarding the design of the trial as the last will respond to two important unknown questions regarding the utility of RT and its fractionation in this population. Moreover, it is an excellent opportunity to collect prospectively geriatric evaluation and HRQoL data that are lacking in the literature for skin cancers. No constraints are seen neither in the design, nor in the potential recruitments. Primary endpoint: Local tumor control at 3-year follow-up in a time-to-event analysis Method This is a multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, comparative 3 arms phase III trial. After inclusion of patient aged ≥ 70 years with performance status OMS 0-3 who had completed surgery (R0) for SCC and BCC with at least one unfavorable prognostic factor, all patientsst will have G8 score and a Geriatric Core Data Set (G CODE) evaluation. Performance of a complete oncogeriatric evaluation and its modalities will be left to the discretion of the investigator. The patients will be randomized in 3 arms with stratification by center, time from surgery to wound healing and perineural invasion. Arm A: Surgery alone Arm B: Surgery + Moderate HF 45Gy in 15 fractions, 3 fractions per week over 5 weeks to the operative bed. Arm C: Surgery + Extreme HF : 30Gy in 5 fractions of 6Gy, 1 fraction per week, over 5 weeks to the operative bed."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US), with 149,500 new CRC cases, and 52,980 deaths expected in 202119; 4,000 Veterans are diagnosed with CRC annually. Screening for CRC reduces incidence and mortality, in part due to detection and removal of polyps such as adenomas. National and VA guidelines recommend surveillance for CRC after adenoma removal (defined herein as polypectomy), but the incremental benefit of surveillance after polypectomy on reducing CRC incidence and mortality are uncertain. For adults age 75 and older (older adults) considering surveillance colonoscopy, these issues are of particular importance. Harms associated with colonoscopy increase dramatically with age, with 3.8% to 6.8% of older adults experiencing an emergency visit or hospitalization within 30 days of colonoscopy. Older vs. younger adults have a 1.5 to 3.7-fold increase in post-colonoscopy complications. Older adults also are less likely to live long enough to benefit from interventions such as surveillance colonoscopy, due to competing, non-CRC mortality risks. The well-established age-related increasing risks for competing causes of mortality and colonoscopy-related harms stand in sharp contrast to major evidence gaps: it is unclear whether CRC risk is clinically significant among older adults with prior history of polyps, and whether exposing older adults to surveillance reduces CRC risk. Yet, the default clinical paradigm is for many older adults to receive surveillance colonoscopy. In the VA, surveillance is a very common indication for colonoscopy among older Veterans, with an estimated >17,400 exposed to surveillance annually. The mismatch between available evidence and current clinical practice, coupled with extreme constraints on colonoscopy resources in the VA, make the surveillance colonoscopy paradigm an ideal focus area for quantifying risks and benefits to optimize health outcomes. The Overarching Aim is to advance knowledge on CRC risks among older adults with prior history of polypectomy and potential benefits of surveillance colonoscopy, with the goal of informing policies and clinical strategies that optimize benefits, risks, and resource utilization. The Specific Aims are to: Aim 1. Compare cumulative CRC risk after age 75 in a cohort of older adults with history of normal colonoscopy (n=101,328) vs. colonoscopy with polypectomy (n=29,548) prior to age 75. After normal colonoscopy, US Preventive Services Task Force guidelines note that benefits of repeat screening in older adults are likely minimal and recommend selective screening. Finding no CRC risk difference for older adults with prior normal colonoscopy vs. polypectomy would suggest surveillance guidelines should follow a similar approach. Risk analyses will also be stratified by baseline adenoma type (low vs. high risk). Hypothesis: Cumulative risk for incident CRC (primary analysis) and fatal CRC (secondary analysis) after age 75 will be similar in older adults with normal colonoscopy vs. colonoscopy with polypectomy prior to age 75. Aim 2. Among older adults with polypectomy prior to age 75, assess comparative effectiveness of exposure vs. no exposure to surveillance colonoscopy after age 75 for reducing CRC risk using a case-cohort design. Cases with incident (n=270) and fatal CRC (n=150), and a random sample subcohort with prior polypectomy (n=1,036) will undergo rigorous chart review to ascertain exposure to surveillance. Harms associated with surveillance will be characterized. Risk analyses will also be stratified by baseline adenoma type (low vs. high risk). Hypothesis: Older adults unexposed vs. exposed to surveillance will have similar risk for incident CRC (primary analysis) and fatal CRC (secondary analysis). Aim 3. Obtain multi-level stakeholder perspectives regarding CRC risk and surveillance outcomes to inform future use and VA policy regarding surveillance colonoscopy in older Veterans. The investigators will conduct 44 semi-structured one-on-one qualitative interviews with VA patients (older adults) and providers (primary care, GI, geriatrics) to understand perspectives on CRC risk, and potential benefits and harms of surveillance (Aim 3a). The investigators will then convene an expert panel with key stakeholders including Veterans, primary providers,"

Aplastic anemia (AA) can be divided into severe AA (SAA) and non-severe AA (NSAA), according to the severity of the disease. For SAA patients with o condition of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, guideline recommended ciclosporin A (CsA) + anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) + thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA) as the first-line therapy. Our previous retrospective study showed that for SAA patients who were intolerant to ATG, CsA+ eltrombopag (EPAG) had similar efficacy to CsA+ATG+EPAG. However, the adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and gasrointestinal disorder limit its application in elderly SAA.Compared with EPAG, AVA has no hepatotoxicity and less other adverse effects, but there was few studies for AA. Our previous study demonstrated that AVA was effective in 55% of refractory AA. Since the action mechanism of AVA and EPAG is not exactly the same, and the metabolic level of the elderly is not the same as that of younger patients, it is unknown whether there are predictive factors of efficacy in the treatment of AVA. Thus, we wondered whether CsA+AVA could achieve an efficacy similar to CsA+ATG+AVA in the Elderly."

Liver transplantation is the most effective treatment for patients with liver cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the shortage of donor liver is the biggest problem faced by patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC. In 2015, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment 2-3 transplantation with delayed total hepatectomy (RAPID) . This approach allows transplantation of the left liver (segments 2+3) to an adult recipient, while the remaining enlarged right hemi-liver is transplanted to another adult recipient, effectively avoiding some unsuitable left lateral lobe livers for pediatric recipients to be wasted. Recipients who received right-hemi-liver transplantation had a similar prognosis compared with those who received whole-liver transplantation. Therefore, if the RAPID technique is confirmed to be feasible, it can greatly alleviate the shortage of liver donors. In addition to cadaver sources, living adult donors can also be considered as the source of liver donors. A smaller left lateral lobe donor liver also places less burden on the donor than a left or right hemiliver. To sum up, our center proposed and designed a clinical study of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation (SALT) in the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC based on clinical surgical experience. On the basis of RAPID surgery, the overall survival rate of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC was evaluated by SALT."

Mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection are among the most frequently performed surgeries today, and pain control is an important problem affecting patient comfort in the postoperative period in these patients. Postoperative pain is an acute pain associated with the inflammatory process that occurs due to surgical trauma and gradually decreases with tissue healing. Several analgesic drugs such as opioids are used to prevent this pain, but these agents have many unwanted side effects. Successful postoperative analgesia occurs in the patient due to pain; it is a known fact that it prevents many of the effects such as not being able to breathe easily and delayed mobilization. Regional techniques can be used for postoperative pain control following breast surgery. Ultrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSIPB) is a new interfacial plane block defined by Tulgar et al in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain. The SPS muscle is located at the C7-T2 level. It attaches to the lateral edges of the second and fifth ribs. It is innervated by the lower cervical and upper intercostal nerves. With the SPS block, these nerves are blocked and analgesia is provided. In the cadaveric study of Tulgar et al., it was determined that the spread of serratus posterior superior interfacial plane block; 7-10 intercostal levels on the left side only in the superficial fascia of the trapezius muscle. Spread dye was observed at intercostal levels, absent on the right. There was prominent staining on both the surface and skin of the rhomboid major, while the rhomboid minor was only stained in the skin. SPSP block will provide successful analgesia in procedures involving the thoracic region such as chronic myofascial pain, breast surgery, thoracic surgery, and shoulder surgery. In this study, our aim is to investigate the efficacy of US-guided SPSIPB for postoperative analgesia management after mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection surgery. Our primary aim is to compare postoperative pain scores (NRS), and our secondary aim is to evaluate the need for rescue analgesics, block-related complications, dermatome level, and side effects (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting) associated with opioid use."

Minimally invasive cardiac surgery is necessary surgery that can take steps to improve the quality of life and functional status of patients without sternotomy. However, patients may experience intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, which can lead to inactivity, increased risk of complications, and greater consumption of opioids, resulting in adverse effects and prolonged hospital stays. Pain management is challenging due to a large number of dermatomes covered. The interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block seems to cover the thoracic dermatomes. It has been the subject of many studies in the same surgical group. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery can be excruciating in the postoperative period, just like thoracotomy surgeries. What is aimed of this study is to compare it with erector spinae block in this study. Additional anesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of the multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to manage acute pain better. Inadequate treatment can lead to persistent pain conditions. Although numerous nerve blocks exist for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the thoracic dermatomes or their entire innervation. The central hypothesis of this study hypothesis, interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block, defined in 2012, has been used in many previous studies as part of multimodal analgesia in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Erector spinae block was also described in 2018 with positive results that have been used in both sternotomies (open heart surgery) and minimally invasive procedures. In this randomized clinical trial, the study aims to compare the efficacy of previously known field blocks as part of multimodal analgesia in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. As presented in the literature, these techniques have been routinely performed so much that review articles have been written. Targeted in this study, preliminary results will be postoperative pain scores. At Namık Kemal University anesthesia clinic, It is regularly used as part of multimodal analgesia and resident training. Traditional intravenous analgesia methods cause many undesirable side effects depending on the type of opioid used, and they are insufficient compared to regional anesthesia methods. The main aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of these two methods, routinely used in thoracic surgery."

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric illness that is associated with significant suffering and disability in Veterans. Current treatment options are not fully effective for all Veterans, and even when they are effective in lowering total symptom burden, many Veterans continue to experience significant symptom burden and associated functional impairment. Total symptom burden and associated functional impairment is often particularly high for those with comorbid mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely available psychostimulant medication with a long track record of safety, which has been used to improve cognitive functioning in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has also shown benefit for mood and cognitive functioning in studies of moderate or severe TBI and as augmentation in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. In a small pilot study of the efficacy of MPH for subjective cognitive impairment associated with PTSD and/or mTBI, members of the research team found that MPH resulted in not only a significant improvement in subjective and objective measures of cognitive functioning, but also a significant decrease in symptoms of both depression and PTSD. The investigators propose to follow up this promising initial finding with an aggregated N-of-1 randomized placebo-controlled trial of MPH versus placebo (PBO) for PTSD and cognitive symptoms in Veterans with PTSD, with or without comorbid TBI. N=70 Veterans across two sites will each receive sequential 4-week periods of MPH and PBO, in randomized order and separated by a 1-week washout, for a total of 20 weeks. During this time, they will complete weekly or biweekly assessments. This trial design, which is particularly well-optimized for conditions in which a heterogeneous response to treatment is expected, will let us achieve a number of specific aims. First, the investigators will assess the efficacy of MPH compared to PBO for reducing PTSD and depression symptoms in Veterans with PTSD and neurocognitive complaints. Second, the investigators will assess the impact of MPH compared to PBO on neurocognitive functioning in this same population. And third, the investigators characterize the baseline predictors of treatment response to MPH in this population, including whether Veterans with a history of mTBI show greater average treatment response to MPH versus PBO. Finally, this trial design will also allow a systematic assessment of risks in this population, including the risk of discontinuation effects or loss of efficacy over time."

Invasive study of microvascular function has become highly relevant for the diagnosis of alterations in coronary physiology for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. Currently, the microvascular resistance index (IMR) is considered the gold standard for invasive diagnosis of coronary microvascular function, with a recommendation of 2A in the current clinical practice guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. In recent years, technical innovation has allowed for the measurement of absolute coronary flow (AF) and minimal microvascular resistance (MMR) using continuous thermodilution, enabling the determination of quantitative flow and resistance units. However, the main limitation is the absence of reference values. Objectives: The main objective is to prospectively validate the capacity of CFRflow as a predictor of the presence of angina measured by SAQ7 in patients with INOCA at 3 months. Secondary objectives include identifying hemodynamic factors related to the persistence of angina at 3 and 12 months, identifying clinical factors related to the persistence of angina, establishing the prevalence of patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction within the cohort of INOCA patients, identifying predictors of major cardiovascular events at 12 months, validating the pathological value of MMR and establishing the pathological value of AF measured in ml/min. The study also aims to evaluate the concordance between measures of the coronary microvascular function obtained by continuous thermodilution and bolus thermodilution, as well as their concordance with clinical characteristics."

Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a syndrome characterized by recurrent abdominal pain accompanied by abdominal discomfort, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal bloating. It is a common condition, affecting approximately 10% of the population in Korea, and its chronic gastrointestinal symptoms significantly impact patients' daily life and quality of life. Factors such as changes in the intestinal microbiota and the intestinal ecosystem are crucial in its etiology. Modern individuals, who are often exposed to numerous stressors, frequently experience persistent intestinal hypersensitivity and inflammation. Foods that are not well digested and fermented in the intestines, producing a significant amount of gas - such as those rich in seasonings, dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol - are known to trigger symptoms. Therefore, it is suggested that a controlled environment like a Temple Stay, which provides both dietary regulation and stress control, could lead to meaningful symptom improvement. However, there is currently a lack of objective scientific research on this. Our research team hypothesizes that a Temple Stay experience of more than a week could consistently change the microbiome and stabilize psychosocial factors. This might control chronic intestinal inflammation and hypersensitivity, leading to subjective symptom improvement and enhanced treatment satisfaction for patients. Through this study, we aim to validate the hypothesis that the dietary changes in a Temple Stay environment will drastically alter patients' dietary intake, enrich the composition of the gut microbiome, and consequently reduce the symptoms of IBS, thereby improving the quality of life."

The effects of climate change on population health have considerably increased as the planet warms and is thus subjected to more heat waves, extreme weather events and food insecurity. Paradoxically, healthcare systems are major contributors to carbon emissions. Within the field of respirology, choice of inhaler is a low-hanging fruit to address this issue. Metered dose inhalers (MDI) contain potent greenhouse gases and have been shown to have a significantly larger carbon footprint than dry powder inhalers (DPI). Studies from the United Kingdom have revealed that although patient awareness of the discrepancy in climate impact of inhalers is low, their willingness to change inhalers after being educated on the subject is high. An example of inhaler change is to use the Bricanyl Turbuhaler (terbutaline) instead of Ventolin (salbutamol) as a rescue medication in asthma. They are both short-acting bronchodilators (SABA) and have similar pharmacodynamics. However, use of Bricanyl for one year produces 7,183 kgCO2e or the equivalent of 59.9km by car, whereas use of Ventolin for one year produces 411,720 kgCO2e, the equivalent of 3,431 km by car. The goal of the study is to assess asthma patients' willingness to change inhalers for environmental reasons as well as prescribers' willingness to prescribe a different inhaler for environmental reasons at the patient's request. The study will also be assessing patient awareness of the climate impact of inhalers and the importance that they attribute to this issue as well as other issues (cost and ease of use)."

The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of a coach-led digital platform using an intelligent coaching assistant (ICA) for 6-months. The study will involve a close collaboration between existing partners: the RCSI Centre for Positive Psychology and Health and Empeal in the development and implementation of a coach-led digital support platform augmented by an ICA for 6-months. This digital health platform is a motivational support unit only and is not intended for use or replacement of medical or therapeutic. ICA-augmented coaching has the potential to transform the coaching profession. Having ICA as a partner can facilitate human coaches to improve the quality of their work and has the potential to increase accessibility and availability of coaching through lower costs. The ICA of this digital health platform has been developed to take time-consuming administrative tasks from the human coach so that their time can be maximised for scalability. Administrative tasks that ICA have taken include, on-boarding participants, prompting participants to complete assessments and book coaching session, reporting assessment results, and gathering data for the coach (i.e. short, medium and long-term goals and targets, trackability of goals, along with their readiness to change and feelings of achievability and reality towards goals). All data gathered by the ICA is to be utilised by coaches to augment the one-to-one coaching experience between participants and coaches. Data is the lifeblood of ICA and must be protected and managed. The ICA will only gather data provided by the participants, and this data is completely voluntary. By collaborating with Empeal, the investigators will analyse this real-world data and apply it to the development and validation of an ICA-augmented coaching framework."

Alzheimer's Disease is an insidious onset and slowly progressive disease, characterized by the presence of cognitive, behavioral and general dysfunction. Among the neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms seen in Alzheimer's patients, apathy is the most common symptom. It is also followed by depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) affect up to 90% of people with dementia during the illness. Therefore, it brings great difficulties to both patients and their caregivers and causes low quality of life. In addition, the inability to treat the disease completely worsens this situation. Considering the pharmacological treatment of psychological symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression in AD individuals, the existence of adverse side effects, increased mortality, limited drug efficacy, relatively high cost, and the inability to effectively treat some of the most distressing behaviors, it is recommended to give priority to non-pharmacological interventions. The concept of cognitive stimulation in AD is one of the most popular approaches. It is stated that Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the best evidence-based practice with robust clinical trials, applied according to a specific guideline for individuals with mild and moderate dementia. In addition, CST is the only intervention recommended by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to promote cognition, independence and well-being for people with mild to moderate dementia. It has been determined that CST applied to individuals with Alzheimer's disease contributes to the strengthening of cognitive, psychological and social aspects, but there are different results in studies on the effectiveness of cognitive intervention strategies aimed at reducing cognitive functions, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. To enable the conversion of CST into routine clinical practice, practice research to support the standardization and generalization of cognitive stimulation therapy planned for patients with AD and its impact on improving neuropsychiatric symptoms and daily living skills requires further research. In addition, the absence of a widely used standard guideline for pharmacological methods for patients with AD in our country reveals that the planned study will contribute to practice. It has been confirmed by many studies that CST applied to individuals with AD contributes to the strengthening of cognitive, psychological and social aspects, but there are few studies applied by nurses. It is noteworthy that the studies on the CST program applied by nurses in our country are limited. Therefore, the need for more clinical studies is emphasized by nurses to build and disseminate knowledge in this area, as the intervention has been little studied. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effect of CST application on the levels of apathy, loneliness, anxiety and daily living activities in elderly individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This research was planned in a single center and experimental research design with pretest posttest control group. The research was planned to be carried out between January 2023 and June 202 at the Moral House affiliated to Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality Disabled and Health Services Department.

The research population consisted of 3rd grade students who took the Risky Birth and Postpartum Period course, studying at the Department of Midwifery, Hamidiye Faculty of Health Sciences, in the spring semester of the 2021-2022 academic year (N:82). Students who volunteered to participate in the study were included in the study. In the study, the entire target population was reached, except for the 4 students who were absent from the Risky Birth and Postpartum Period course (N:78). Computer-assisted randomization will be used in the study, and random assignment was made to the intervention (n:39) and control (n:39) groups by entering the number of cases through the program whose URL address is https://www.randomizer.org. An introductory information form was applied to all groups, and informed consent was obtained from the students before the applications. The students were given information about the introduction of the simulator and the model, the flow chart of the training plan, the content of the training plan, the environment, the locations of the materials. Before the application, all groups were given theoretical information about postpartum hemorrhage management for 2 hours with a power point presentation. Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence Scale in Learning and Self-Efficacy Scale were applied as a pre-test after the information. Intervention group students were given practical training on postpartum hemorrhage assessment and management in the basic skills laboratory, accompanied by an adult standard patient care model, with a high-reality Gaumard Scientific brand, product code: S550.100 Noella simulator in the simulation laboratory of the Midwifery department. After the application, Student Satisfaction and Self-Confidence in Learning Scale, Self-Efficacy Scale and Early Postpartum Hemorrhage Management Skill Assessment Form were applied to all students as a post-test, and Scale for Evaluation of Simulation-Based Learning to the intervention group. Four weeks after the training, the Early Postpartum Hemorrhage Management Skill Assessment Form and Self-Efficacy Scale were applied to the students again as a follow-up test. After the research was completed, postpartum hemorrhage management was applied to the control group students with a high-reality simulator, accompanied by a scenario, so that all students could benefit from the benefits of simulation-based education. At the end of the simulation applications, an analysis session was held for the students accompanied by the video recordings taken during the applications. During the debriefing session, it was aimed to help students see their mistakes and organize their practices without judging by using a constructive language."

Chronic pain has long been known as one of the major health concerns, impacting psychological health, functioning, and quality of life. However, its treatment is complex and is challenged by a complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors. Common pain treatments present significant medical and technological limitations, reflected in unspecific drug usage and an extremely high number of medical examinations that patients face regularly, with a huge cost burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, the overall efficacy of pain management is often limited (73% dissatisfaction with treatment), leaving the patient in poor life conditions. Designing individualized targeted therapies requires understanding each subject's multidimensional pain experience, taking into consideration both the physical and emotional aspects involved. However, today, the golden standard measurement for pain is self-reports, which inherently suffer from subjective differences in perception and reporting. Healthcare systems advocate for the discovery of biomarkers and reliable clinical trial endpoints for pain to foster diagnosis, monitor pain progression, assess new treatments, and personalized therapeutic response. Nevertheless, most of the evidence today comes from inpatient settings or controlled laboratory environments. The pAIn-sense study aims at providing a radically novel approach in the monitoring and treatment of pain patients: a novel telemonitoring system allowing to understand the real nature of the pain (emotional vs physical), leveraging the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques and wearable sensing technology collecting biometric data, therefore enabling efficient personalized treatments. To achieve this goal, the investigators will combine real patient data both from a physical and emotional perspective, to characterize the pain nature of patients and provide a tailored continuum-of-care. The system will include: Robotic wearable sensors (Hardware): wearable technology for physiological monitoring (e.g., skin conductance, blood volume pressure and heart rate, activity) Digital platform (Software): a customized application that collects psychological assessments, psychological status, medication, subjective pain level and sleep quality. AI-based engine: advanced AI models take all the previous physical and psychological information and model it to provide an outline of what is the nature of the pain level of the subject. The system will be used to monitor the patient during normal activities (day and night) while collecting physiological, psychosocial, and pain information."

Lymphatic malformations (LMs) are a congenital disorder of the lymphatic system that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. LMs are classified into three types: microcystic, macrocystic, and mixed cystic. Macrocystic LMs are the most common type of LM and are characterized by large cysts that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for LMs is surgical resection, sclerotherapy, or a combination of both. However, these treatments are often ineffective and can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. TARA-002 is a biological treatment that has shown promise in treating LMs in adults. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of TARA-002 in treating macrocystic and mixed cystic LMs in children."

The overall aim of this study is to evaluate the robustness of the Earswitch technology (hardware and software) in detecting voluntary eardrum movements in people with assistive needs. This is a key step to ensure a robust design informed by patients' needs. A secondary aim is to gather information from assistive device users about how well they can perform voluntary eardrum movements, as this knowledge will be used to inform what types of interfaces are appropriate for the Earswitch. Healthy participants will also be recruited as a separate cohort, to maximise the amount of data collected which can be used to validate and inform future designs. The methodology will be the same across both cohorts with the same equipment (Earswitch, second screen, and laptop) being used, however the healthy participants will not be able to answer all questions in PART 1. Healthy participants will be invited into a University lab to undertake the study, whereas participants with assistive technology needs will be given the option of a home visit. As the same equipment will be used, only the environment (i.e., home vs lab) will change which is not anticipate to affect the study data. At the start of the study a signal will be agreed with the participant (and carer when required) so that the participant can inform their carer and/or the experimenter if they wish to stop the study for any reason. The proposed study will take place in a single session and includes four main parts: PART 1 - Co-design Questionnaires. The specific aims for this part are to collect data on what assistive technologies people use and gain feedback on current switch technology to better understand how the Earswitch can be integrated in conjunction with other switch technology. The participants will be asked questions to understand the type of assistive technology (hardware and software) they currently use. This will include their opinions about the effectiveness, usability, and comfort of their current device, measured using the previously validated QUEST2 questionnaire. This process should not take more than 15 minutes, and will be carried out by the researcher, with the support of a carer where necessary. PART 2 - Earswitch insertion. Following this, the participant, with the help of the experimenter or the carer, will select an earbud size which will be inserted into the participant's ear. The participant will then be asked if it is comfortable or whether they would like to try a different size according to the comfort or fit of the earbud. Once the participant is happy with the size of the earbud, the experiment or the carer will install the Earswitch device, which involves putting a small camera into the participant's ear canal and positioning it so that it can see their eardrum. During this procedure, the participant will be asked to let the experimenter or carer know if it is uncomfortable or if they wish to stop. This should be no different to putting a regular ear bud into the participant's ear. Once this is complete, the participant will be asked some questions about the comfort of the device, and how easy they felt the installation process was. Once the Earswitch has been inserted, the experimenter will take a measurement of how far the otoscope is inserted into the ear, by using a ruler to measure the extruding element (with which the depth of the otoscope can be calculated). In addition, the experimenter will take a close-up picture of the Earswitch sitting in the concha to provide visual evidence of the fit (i.e., how the silicone earbud sits in the concha) and to identify any potential pressure points (e.g., on the tragus) that may help explain the device comfort. PART 3 - Ear rumbling test. Next, some videos will be recorded by the Earswitch device of the participant's ear drum while they contract the tensor tympani muscle voluntarily in response to several tasks. The tasks will ask the participant to voluntarily contract the TT muscle in response to different stimuli when requested. These stimuli will be presented to the participant either visually on a screen, audibly through some speakers, or both depending on their sight and hearing. The purpose of this is to see how well the participant can voluntarily contract their TT muscle on demand, and to see how well the Earswitch can recognise this. The tasks will involve the participant contracting their TT muscle voluntarily in response to a presented stimulus, twice in a row, multiple times in a row, and they will be asked to hold the muscle contraction for certain periods of time (1 second, 2 seconds, as long as possible). In addition, the participant's eardrum will be recorded when they perform everyday tasks to make sure that"

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common degenerative joint disease that affects the knee joint. The knee joint is a complex structure that is composed of three compartments: the medial compartment, the lateral compartment and the patellofemoral compartment. OA is characterized by the loss of joint space, which is the space between the bones in the joint. The loss of joint space is a hallmark of OA and is associated with pain and disability.
The current gold standard for the diagnosis of OA is the X-ray. However, the X-ray is a two-dimensional image that only provides information about the joint space in a single plane. This can lead to inaccurate diagnosis and treatment.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a three-dimensional imaging technique that can provide detailed information about the joint space in all planes. MRI can also provide information about the cartilage, bone and other structures in the knee joint.
The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of weight-bearing and flexion in the evaluation of the joint space in patients with knee OA. The investigators will perform MRI scans of the knee joint in four different positions: weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing with flexed and extended knee. The investigators will measure the joint space width in each position and compare the results.
The investigators hypothesize that the joint space width will be different in the four scan positions and that the weight-bearing and flexion positions will provide more accurate information about the joint space in patients with knee OA. This study will provide valuable information about the importance of weight-bearing and flexion in the evaluation of the joint space in patients with knee OA."

Dysphagia, or disordered swallowing, is prevalent in almost all neurodegenerative conditions and results in the inability to effectively protect the lower airways from foreign (i.e., food/liquid) and endogenous (i.e., saliva) material [1-3]. An unfortunate consequence of dysphagia is aspiration pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD) [4-6]. Swallowing therapy has proven to be effective for the management of dysphagic symptoms in PD. Treatment is most often delivered in clinics once/week over short time periods with the expectation that exercises be completed at-home. However, these paradigms lack biofeedback to assess the accuracy and strength of the prescribed exercise and accountability to ensure completion of the exercise program. Without biofeedback or options for long-term therapeutic intervention at-home, patients often regress to baseline levels [7-9]. The proposed research project seeks to test the effectiveness of a novel at-home surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback therapy tool called Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) on swallowing safety and efficiency in patients with PD. The significance of this project lies in the fact that dysphagia is expensive in terms of patient quality of life, health outcomes, and healthcare costs [10, 11] often increasing hospital costs by approximately 40% [12]. Thus, a targeted swallowing therapy system with biofeedback that can be utilized at-home may reduce hospitalizations secondary to dysphagia, help maintain therapeutic gains, and reduce the burden that dysphagia places on our healthcare system. sEMG is a therapy tool that has been used in rehabilitation practice for decades. Use of sEMG during swallowing therapy involves placement of electrodes under the chin (overlying the anterior belly of the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles) [13]. While the patient completes a swallowing task, electrodes detect collective muscle contractions associated with hyolaryngeal excursion - a biomechanical event critically important to airway safety and swallowing efficiency [14]. The patient can then see the waveform of the swallow displayed on a computer monitor. Measures of swallowing strength are derived from the amplitude of the waveform. sEMG hardware and associated software available in the marketplace today is cost prohibitive and thus, in the United States, only available for office-based swallowing intervention. sEMG provides external biofeedback regarding swallowing parameters by activating neural networks controlling both motor execution and imagery of the act of swallowing including the pre- and postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, insula, and cerebellum [15]. Research has shown that exercise programs incorporating biofeedback promote significant physiologic change that is maintained over time in patients with dysphagia [14, 16-18]. Patients with PD benefit greatly from biofeedback exercises for respiratory muscle strength and lingual strengthening programs and have even been found to maintain the gains made in therapy with at-home programs [7, 16, 19]. A limitation of the currently available sEMG programs is that research studies have solely focus on the strength aspects of the swallowing (amplitude of the waveform) while failing to address the dynamic, skill-based parameters such as timing and volitional initiation that is captured in waveform morphology. Skill based swallowing training focuses on the precision of movements; and this is especially important for patients with PD [14]. Additionally, traditional sEMG systems in the US lack the ability for clinicians to modulate swallowing targets during tasks, which, according to principles of neuroplasticity, is essential for maximizing therapeutic results. The BiSSKit program is a well-researched office-based biofeedback system that adheres to principles of neuroplasticity and incorporates skill training in addition to strength training [14]. Developed in New Zealand and recently approved by the US FDA, this program has been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application for tablet computers. This hybrid BiSSKiT system incorporates clinical visits and home-based skill/strength training and shows promise to change current therapy delivery models. Although exciting, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of the BiSSKiT with daily home therapy focused on strength and skill based swallowing training on changes to swallowing safety and efficiency in people with PD. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of this device on swallowing outcomes compared to"

The study will incorporate a harmonized protocol among the 8 countries to estimate point-prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR HPV) in low socio-economic populations and, among specific sub-populations, the incidence of persistent HPV infection. Due to differences in study settings, study population, targeted age-group, and eligibility criteria, country-specific protocols will be developed to complement the multi-country master protocol. In the master protocol, general principles on study design and methodology will be described, while the country-specific protocol will elaborate in more detail on methodology in each country related to subject identification, the enrolment process, and laboratory analysis. A standardized survey questionnaire, with some minor country-specific adaptations, and laboratory assays will be implemented throughout the participating countries in order to generate comparable data. Two separate approaches will be implemented to estimate prevalence and incidence respectively in each participating country. First, cross-sectional surveys (CSS) will be conducted in both urban and rural areas of selected countries in order to estimate the point prevalence of HPV infection in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The CSS will enrol girls and women aged 9-50 years, with equal sample size from four age-strata: 9-14, 15-20, 21- 30, 31-50. For specific populations, age-strata will be modified to include 12-35 years olds considering the target population characteristics and local context. Multi-stage cluster random sampling or another applicable sampling strategy will be applied to ensure representativeness. Urine samples will be collected for HPV testing, along with data on demographics, socioeconomic status, sexual and reproductive history, attitudes towards and awareness and uptake of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, and potential risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer. Additional data will be collected on knowledge of HPV, and attitudes, uptake and use of vaccines, using standardized questionnaires and case report forms. Second, Longitudinal studies (LS) will estimate the incidence of persistent HPV infection in sexually active girls and young women in geographically defined communities and special populations. Depending on the country setting, the LS will enroll sexually active girls and women who are aged between 15-35 years and follow them up to 24 months. Participants will be tested every 6 months for 24 months to determine incident persistent HR HPV infection. In selected countries, urine and self-collected vaginal swabs (SCVS) will be collected at the first visit to determine the comparability of HPV genotyping results from both sample types. For all the other visits, only SCVS will be collected. Data on demographics, socioeconomic status, sexual and reproductive history, cervical screening, HPV vaccination, and other potential risk factors will be collected using standardized questionnaires. Furthermore, the qualitative sub-studies in five selected countries (Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Sierra Leone, DR Congo) will follow and draw on findings from the CSS, focusing on girls and women of different age strata as well as community members (including boys and men) and key informants in the health care system in each study site. Qualitative study methods will vary depending on the site and CSS findings, but will include both individual in- depth interviews (IDIs) (up to   30 individuals per site), key informant interviews as well as multiple focus group discussions (FGDs) with  6-8 participants/group. Detailed qualitative study methodology will be developed separately as another study protocol and adapted according to the procedures for each site."

The use of cognitive functions such as memory is essential for the execution of daily activities and represents a crucial element for autonomy maintenance during aging. It is known that the physiological cognitive decline associated with aging also involves memory and can significantly impact the older person's independence. For these reasons, great interest has been generated by two tools that have proved to be decisive in supporting memory functions: non-invasive neurostimulation and memory training. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation that modulates brain activity by employing a direct current delivered through electrodes applied to the scalp. Recently, the use of tDCS has been combined with training interventions focused on working memory in healthy older adults, providing evidence of a significant improvement in memory function when memory training is associated with the use of tDCS compared to when it is performed without it. In particular, adaptive memory trainings coupled with stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex provide benefits that last also at follow-up visits after 1 or 3 months, especially in participants who exhibit a lower baseline performance. While it was observed that adaptive working memory training alone is unable to modulate brain plasticity mechanisms, it was hypothesized that tDCS can modulate brain plasticity by acting through long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms and that it can modulate brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that plays a relevant role in LTP. Several adaptive memory trainings focused on working memory, which is essential for decision-making processes and daily activities. Even if promising results have been shown so far, it appears that no study addressed the implementation of strategic memory training coupled with the use of tDCS. Adaptive memory trainings allow improving the performance in each task by gradually increasing its difficulty, without however resorting to teaching a strategy. Strategic memory trainings permit not only to improve participants' performance in the practiced task but also to generalize the use of memory strategies to new tasks. Intending to prevent cognitive impairment, using these intervention methods in healthy aging and the prodromal phases can be useful. To this end, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) indeed represents an intermediate state between normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (nMCD) and may predict the development of objective cognitive decline. In this frame, the primary goal of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to assess whether the application of transcranial direct current stimulation during strategic memory training (on-line neurostimulation) enhances the effect of strategic memory training. The follow-up visits allow for investigating whether eventual improvements are preserved over time and if this combined intervention affects the evolution of cognitive decline. The treatment protocol consists of 5 sessions (2/3 session/week, 1 hour/day) of strategic memory training combined with on-line tDCS (anodic tDCS, 2mA for 20 minutes, versus sham tDCS, applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - DLPFC). Healthy old participants will be recruited from the general population. Participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are recruited from Neuropsychology/Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Unit and Neurorehabilitation Unit of IRCCS Mondino Foundation. The diagnosis of SCD is formulated based on a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation (baseline cognitive assessment - T0) according to the guidelines presented in the literature. At T0, the following standardized tests are used: Global cognitive function is assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); Cognitive reserve is assessed using Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq); Mood is assessed using Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). At T0, practiced and not practiced memory tasks (Bottiroli et al., 2013) will be administered to the participants as pre-tests: Associative learning; List learning; Name-face learning; Place learning; Text learning; Grocery learning; Participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria are enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental group (strategic memory training + ACTIVE tDCS) or control group (strategic memory training + SHAM tDCS)."

Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem, with a prevalence of 1-2% in the general population and a lifetime risk of 20%. HF is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients aged 65 years and older. The incidence of HF is increasing, and the cost of HF to the NHS is estimated to be £2.3 billion per year.
The majority of HF patients are diagnosed in primary care, and the diagnosis is often delayed. The diagnosis of HF is based on clinical symptoms and signs, and the use of diagnostic tests such as echocardiography and cardiac biomarkers. However, these tests are not routinely performed in primary care, and the diagnosis of HF is often delayed.
The aim of this study is to develop and validate a predictive model for the risk of new onset HF using routinely collected primary care data. The model will be developed and validated using data from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) and the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) database. The model will be developed using a cohort of patients aged 16 years and older with no history of HF, and a minimum of one year follow up. The model will be validated in a separate cohort of patients with no history of HF.
The predictive model will be developed using a multivariable Cox proportional hazard model with backwards elimination approach to retain predictors of incident HF within each prediction window. The model will be validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).
The proposed model can extract informative risk factors from EHR data. Specifically we will fit multivariable Cox proportional hazard models with backwards elimination approach to retain predictors of incident HF within each prediction window. The model will be validated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a global health crisis, with millions of people infected and thousands of deaths. The rapid spread of the virus has highlighted the need for effective and efficient diagnostic tools to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection. Point-of-care tests to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection have the potential to allow earlier detection and isolation of confirmed cases compared to PCR-based diagnostic methods performed in centralized laboratories, with the aim of cost-effective reduction of transmission. In theory, sufficiently sensitive and specific point-of-care format tests could be implemented at PoE and used to screen low-prevalence populations effectively. In particular, rapid COVID-19 antigen tests in a lateral flow format COVID antigen RDTs or AgRDTs can play a key role in accelerating access to testing and improving turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. COVID antigen RDTs detect specific proteins known as antigens on the surface of the virus and can identify people who are at the peak of infection when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. A number of AgRDTs are now available, some of which have received emergency use authorizations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and/or the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These tests have the potential to detect an active infection with performance that is close to that of PCR in specific settings. However, the performance of COVID antigen RDTs outside of highly controlled settings is not well defined,particularly in low-prevalence groups of asymptomatic people (Bryan et al., 2020; Lassaunière et al., 2020 Linares et al., 2020; Porte et al., 2020). Antigen tests with rapid turnaround times and minimal user skill have been recently approved for emergency use listing (EUL) by the WHO. Performance data show sensitivity and specificity levels (at least 80% and 97%, respectively) sufficient for diagnostic purposes of SARS-CoV-2 in targeted individuals, but their role in population-based screening remains to be established. In this evaluation, performance characteristics of rapid SARS-COV-2 detection kits (including but not limited to the Standard Q COVID-19 Antigen Test Standard Q RDT and the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Panbio RDT, will be assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and their overall agreement with standard nucleic acid testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Finally, the performance of multi-test algorithms based on Ag-RDTs with or without RTPCR will be assessed for their potential use in low-prevalence screening programmes."

The aim of the DESC-HBR trial is to compare the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid, with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors, on the proportion of patients with optimal platelet reactivity (OPR). The secondary objective is to explore the effect of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor therapy on clinical events and patients' quality of life. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients in the OPR range measured through the VerifyNow system at peak level after drug maintenance dose (MD) at 14±2 days. OPR is defined as a platelet reactive unit (PRU) between 85 and 208 reactivity units based on international consensus. A key secondary outcome will be major, minor and nuisance bleeding according to the bleeding academic research consortium (BARC) definition up to 5 months. Secondary pharmacodynamic outcomes include platelet reactivity with the VerifyNow and T-TAS system at different timepoints (baseline, 2h after first dose, through levels before MD and peak levels after MD at 14±2 days). Further pharmacodynamic assessment at 1 and 2 weeks after P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation will be performed in the subset of patients discontinuing P2Y12 inhibitor at study conclusion or in case of P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation at anytime during the study.Other secondary endpoints will be explored including all-cause death, major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE), a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction (MI), target vessel revascularization (TVR) and stroke, net adverse clinical events (NACE), a composite of MACCE and BARC 2-5 bleeding, and each individual endpoint singularly appraised. Quality of life will be evaluated with health mobility and performance scales (i.e. EQ-5D-5L, SF-12), perceived stress scale (i.e. PPS).Cost-effectives analysis will be also carried out by inputting direct and indirect costs in relation to outcomes. Study visits are scheduled at baseline,14±2 days, 3 and 5 months after randomization."

Worldwide more than approximately 500 million people suffer from AR (30% of the Dutch population) and its prevalence is expanding. Nasal congestion (i.e. reversible mucosal congestion/nasal mucosal obstruction) is one of the most general and bothersome symptoms in rhinitis and is associated with other medical conditions such as rhinosinusitis and otitis media. This study is relevant as in addition to the high global occurrence of AR, this disorder has substantial effects on the quality of life (QOL) (e.g. during sleep and work). AR is related to high direct medical costs (mainly prescription of medications and outpatient visits) and indirect economic costs (including productivity decrease). Current medications are undesirable due to their side-effects (such as sedation in the case of intranasal antihistamines (INAH)). Acupuncture for AR in general can be considered as safe and can be seen as a potential remedial blueprint for nasal congestion. Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on specifically nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial aims to evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin®). A standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points has been established - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - and this selection of acupuncture points can be seen as a solid and profound approach from which every AR patient may benefit. This standard set opens the nose and affects the underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time to maintain its nose opening effect (i.e. to prevent recurrence of the complaint). The acupuncture protocol concerns 8 treatments during 6 weeks (i.e. 2 treatments per week during the first 2 weeks and 1 treatment per week in the consecutive 4 weeks). The positive effects of this treatment protocol (such as improvement QOL) may result in more confidence in the direct, post-treatment and long-term effects of acupuncture and lead to more acceptance of acupuncture as a solid treatment option for nasal congestion in AR instead of using an INAH spray. Hypothesis: Acupuncture will improve nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin®). Objective: To evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR."

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of a peer-mediated intervention on the social and linguistic outcomes of children with language impairment (LI) in inclusive preschool classrooms. The investigators propose that improved socialization experiences in the preschool classroom for focal children can disrupt the social exclusion, leading to accelerated growth in linguistic, social, and behavioral outcomes. The investigators will use a randomized controlled trial to estimate treatment impacts of a peer-mediated intervention, with 12 classrooms assigned to the treatment condition and 13 to the control condition. Within each classroom, the focal participants are children isolated from their classroom social network with low pragmatic language skills. One target child is selected per classroom using a priori exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. In the fall of each year, simple random assignment is used to allocate classrooms to the treatment group and to the control group. First, investigators identify all children's positions within the classroom social network using a teacher matrix conducted in fall of the academic year; from this network a child-level social network index is calculated (i.e., individual degree centrality; lower scores are characteristic of social exclusion). Second, teachers simultaneously complete the Developmental Pragmatic Profile (DPP) for each child in the classroom. Finally, among the participating focal children, investigators select the target child based on the lowest centrality scored weighted by DPP score, so that focal children represent the most socially isolated children with the poorest social-pragmatic communication skills. Children and teachers participate for a 9-month period, and the primary approach to treatment for focal children is described here. Specifically, focal children in classrooms randomized to the treatment condition receive peer-mediated pivotal response training (PRT) per procedures detailed by Brock et al.. PRT procedures are facilitated by a classroom teacher or teaching assistant-who receives ongoing training and support from research staff. First, investigators provide a one-on-one 1-h training session for each facilitator that focuses on how to identify, initially train, and then support peers on a day-to-day basis during center time. Second, investigators partner with the facilitator to identify two peers who (a) demonstrate good social skills; (b) respond well to adult directions; (c) have consistent attendance; and (d) do not have a history of negative interactions with the target student. The facilitator explicitly identifies the focal child (buddy) and asks the children to use three strategies to play with the buddy during center time: (a) offer your buddy some play options; (b) show and talk about how to play with your buddy; (c) compliment your buddy; and (d) show your buddy how to take turns. At each training session the facilitator will describe one strategy, provide examples, and practice the strategy through role play. After trainings, the facilitator provides ongoing support during center time to implement the strategies over 12 weeks during months 3-6 of the 9 months of study participation. The investigators propose that improved socialization experiences in the preschool classroom for focal children can disrupt the social exclusion, leading to accelerated growth in linguistic, social, and behavioral outcomes."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease process that disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses, resulting in a range of neurological signs and symptoms. Walking-related impairment is one of the most common symptoms, reported to affect more than 90% of people with MS. The leading non-pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is rehabilitation, such as physical therapy. Rehabilitation is believed to restore function through experience-dependent neuroplasticity. There is strong evidence that physical therapy can improve mobility-related function in people with MS, and emerging evidence that motor-relearning approaches to rehabilitation may be associated with changes in brain structure and function that correlate with improvements in functional performance. The leading pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is dalfampridine. Dalfampridine improves motor function by increasing nerve conduction through demyelinated axons, however, dalfampridine alone is not likely to generate neuroplastic changes needed for lasting benefits, because neural plasticity requires salient and task-specific practice with high repetition at adequate intensity, as well as complex environments that stimulate opportunities for movement to facilitate synthesis of neurotrophic factors. Indeed, the treatment effects of dalfampridine are reversed as soon as the treatment was discontinued. However, it is possible that improved nerve conduction velocity provided by dalfampridine may accelerate neuroplasticity generated from rehabilitation. Yet, combining dalfampridine with concurrent rehabilitation has never been studied. The objective of the proposed study is to test our central hypothesis that providing a motor-relearning physical therapy intervention in combination with dalfampridine will produce superior gains to either intervention alone in mobility through augmented neuroplasticity. Aim 1 will determine if dalfampridine can augment the effects of physical therapy in restoring function in people with MS by comparing the combined intervention to physical therapy without dalfampridine. Aim 2 will explore the comparative effectiveness between the combined intervention with dalfampridine alone, and between physical therapy alone and dalfampridine alone. In Aim 3, the investigators will investigate mechanisms of treatment effects by evaluating functional connectivity before and after each intervention arm. Exploratory Aim 4 will examine whether there are specific clinical and personal factors associated with treatment responsiveness to each type of treatment. The primary efficacy outcome will be percent change from baseline in Timed 25-Foot Walk to enable direct comparison to previous dalfampridine studies. A range of secondary and tertiary clinical outcomes, both objective and self-reported, will examine restoration of function (objective and perceived) beyond just walking speed. The investigators will enroll 48 participants with MS-related mobility deficits and EDSS ≤6.5. In the first treatment phase, all participants will receive 6 weeks of dalfampridine treatment to assess the effects of this treatment and determine individual responder status for stratified randomization in phase 2. Following 2-week dalfampridine washout and new off-drug baseline assessment, stratified randomization will allocate participants to either 6 weeks of physical therapy with resumed dalfampridine or 6 weeks of physical therapy without dalfampridine. Outcomes will be reassessed after the physical therapy treatment phase. This project tests a novel combination of two traditional interventions to improve mobility in people with MS, with specific aims that investigate both restoration of function and mechanisms of treatment effects using brain imaging outcomes. These two leading, yet distinct approaches for improving mobility in people with MS, may have complementary mechanisms of action leading to enhanced outcomes when combined. The findings generated by this research will inform the design of further studies exploring longer-term outcomes and disease progression trajectories associated with the interventions found to be most effective and tolerable for individuals with MS in this stage of the research."

Primary dysmenorrhea is a Greek term which means difficult flow and the term describe painful periods. The pain is usually felt in the lower abdomen but sometimes it may radiate in thighs and to the back. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common type of gynecological disorder among females worldwide. Some females may feel some associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting diarrhea, headache, dizziness and in severe conditions syncope. All of these symptoms occur usually in females with normal pelvic anatomy and symptoms occur just before menses. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs 6-12 months after the onset of ovulation cycle. Primary dysmenorrhea can be distinguished from secondary dysmenorrhea on the basis of symptoms and other pelvic or reproductive organ disorders. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, in secondary dysmenorrhea pain starts few days before the onset of menstrual cycles and may last longer than the cycle. The chances of secondary dysmenorrhea are more prevalent in females above the age of 20. A complete pelvic examination should be performed in females who are sexually active and have dysmenorrhea and those who are suspected to have endometriosis. In general population the prevalence of Primary dysmenorrhea is about 47-80%. Seventy five to eighty five percent of female have said to report that the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea are mild. Primary dysmenorrhea is not life threatening and does not cause any disabilities but some researches have said that most young girls are reported to be absent from school/college and not being able to perform any activity due to the severity of pain. Some evidence shows the link between dysmenorrhea and prostaglandin, the level of prostaglandin is said to be increased and leads to uterine contraction and ischemia. The release of prostaglandin leads to excessive uterine contraction and the constriction of small endometrial blood vessels leads to ischemia and thus pain. The level of prostaglandin is said to be increased during premenstrual phase in which progesterone level decreases and the level of prostaglandin increases in endometrial cells by the action of membrane phospholipids. The action of prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors plays an important role in pain relief. Another interesting factor shows the link between physical activity and dysmenorrhea. Females who perform physical activities like exercise for the purpose of developing or maintaining fitness have reported to be going through less pain and behavioral changes. Physical activities and exercises are believed to have reduced the level of stress and stress related symptoms. When we do exercise endorphins hormones are released from brain which increases the pain threshold and have said to improve the mood of the person performing exercise. It has also been observed that performing isometric exercises for 8 weeks has reduced the intensity and duration of pain but has no effects on the amount of bleeding. Performing stretching exercises for 8 weeks has also reduced the severity and length of pain in young girls and they have reported to be taking less medicine. The purpose of this research is to provide the information that which exercises i-e stretching or strengthening are more effective in reducing the intensity, frequency, duration and severity of pain in primary dysmenorrhea."

The risk associated with arterial hypotension during general anesthesia for surgery or interventional procedure has been demonstrated, but the threshold at which consequences for perfusion of one or more organs appear varies according to the mechanism of hypotension, associated abnormalities (Heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen transport), and the patient's terrain. Currently, a mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mm Hg and a reduction of less than 30-50% from the value measured before general anesthesia are commonly used treatment thresholds to ensure good perfusion of all organs. These values are based on large cohort studies that associate these blood pressure thresholds with the occurrence of postoperative complications or during the resuscitation stay. They cannot be generalized to certain subpopulations that are underrepresented, such as women and elderly patients. Normally, cerebral blood flow is self-regulated, which allows cerebral blood flow to adapt to oxygen requirements and to different levels of high and low blood pressure. However, this protective mechanism may fail for a degree of hypotension that depends on several factors such as the age or vascular health of the patient. For example, in patients with preexisting hypertension, the autoregulatory capacity of the brain is likely impaired making organs more susceptible to ischemia at low blood pressure. Thus, current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines in the setting of noncardiac surgery recommend individualizing care for patients with associated cardiovascular comorbidities. Arterial stiffness is currently one of the best independent, early biomarkers predictive of cardiovascular complications and cardiovascular comorbidity. Assessment of arterial stiffness is currently performed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement. Therefore, higher blood pressure goals tailored to the physiology of each patient may be preferable for these high-risk patients. Because there is individual variability in cerebral autoregulation, a strategy based on a one-size-fits-all recommended blood pressure (BP) value is nonsense. What is the tolerable target BP level for a patient under general anesthesia? Is there a simple and non-invasive way to measure the level of cerebral blood flow autoregulation and, more importantly, adequacy to the brain's oxygen requirements? The aim of the study is to measure non-invasively, easily and reliably the variations of cerebral perfusion in patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors during controlled variations performed during routine care to adjust the blood pressure level within the recommended safety standards during general anesthesia. The setting of the optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) level will be achieved within the ranges of values commonly used, taking into account the patient's cardiovascular comorbidities. In particular, the lower limit of MAP of 60 mmHg for patients without cardiovascular risk factors and 80 mmHg for patients with risk factors should never be exceeded, in accordance with current French and international recommendations. The main objective is to identify a significant linear relationship between the percentage change in mean velocity (Vm) and the percentage change in the 95% spectral frequency front (SEF95) during the MAP change. Cerebral perfusion and cerebral O2 adequacy will be compared and assessed by continuous and simultaneous measurements of cerebral blood flow by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral O2 adequacy by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a brain function parameter by intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) - frontal EEG. The classification of patients in the cardiovascular risk group will be determined in addition to their history and treatment by an arterial stiffness parameter (pulse wave velocity) measured non-invasively before and during the protocol by MESI mTablet automatic digital sphygmomanometer (MESI ltd, Slovenia). The objective for a given patient is to look for a possible threshold value of pressure that could impact the blood flow velocity (Doppler) and possibly the EEG and cerebral oximetry. This clinical research work is performed on adult patients undergoing scheduled surgery at Lariboisière Hospital under general anesthesia. All measurements are obtained non-invasively. The monitoring routinely includes continuous electrocardiogram and blood pressure monitoring by non-invasive means (Clearsight®, EV1000®, Edwards Sciences) in anesthesia pulsed O2 saturation (Sp"

The purpose of this study is to create and validate a scale that will allow the evaluation of the abdominal condition of premature infants. The scale will be used to assess the abdominal condition of premature infants in the neonatal intensive care units. The scale will be evaluated daily by the nurse, the physiotherapist and the resident of the service. The evaluation will be carried out at least 8 times over 21 days. If an abdominal massage is performed, an assessment of the abdominal condition by the scale will be necessary before and after each massage by the physiotherapist. Each assessment (by physio, nurse and resident) will be blinded and within a maximum time window of 30 minutes. The first evaluator clears the patient's abdomen (clothing and diaper removed) and then performs the assessment of the abdomen blindly. A description has been written so that each evaluator can use the ECAP scale under the same conditions and with well-detailed judgment criteria in order to have an evaluation that is as reliable as possible. The time taken to assess the premature baby's abdomen by the ECAP scale is less than 3 minutes. The evaluator fills out the ECAP assessment table, blindly. Within the next 30 minutes (the patient's abdominal condition is considered stable during this time), the second and third assessors have to do the same. These assessments are stored together with each patient's clinical data collection, and then analyzed by statisticians."

Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most common neurodegenerative disease, usually results in physical deterioration, as well as a spectrum of psychosocial sequels that could bring various challenges on one's daily lives. Patients experience common motor symptoms, including tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, in parallel with psychosocial stressors (i.e., non- motor symptoms NMS), such as sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal symptoms, dopaminergic drug-induced behaviors (e.g., hallucination, impulse control issues) and mood disturbance (e.g., depression, anxiety). While 21% of individuals struggling with the disease reported at least one of these psychosocial symptoms within the initial stage of the disease, they are generally at risk for increased emotional distress, cognitive declines, and elevated stress hormone (cortisol) levels. Both motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease could affect the quality of life of individuals and that of their caregivers. A cross-sectional study conducted by our research team has explored the symptom burden and support care needs in people with PD across East and Southern Asia (n=186), revealing significant unmet needs among Hong Kong PD patients regarding their psychosocial-spiritual concerns. In particular, they experience significant, moderate palliative care needs at the early to middle course of the illness. The extent of unmet support care needs among patients with mild to moderate PD is as great as that among patients with other chronic health conditions, such as advanced cancer, late-stage lung cancer, stage 4/5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and late stage chronic kidney disease. The visible and unpredictable symptoms of a distorted body (e.g., tremor and gait dysfunction) and the suppressed expressions due to having a masked face, reduced voice and slurred speech often results in difficulty seeking help and stigmatization of the disease. Despite the tremendous influences and common occurrence of NMS, they are surprisingly under- recognized in clinical practice because of the lack of spontaneous verbal complaints by the patients, as well as the lack of systematic questioning by healthcare professionals. A qualitative exploration of the illness experience of local PD patients highlighted the importance and urgent need for holistic PD interventions that emphasizes on early identification and preventive measures of individual who are at risk for PD patients, alleviation of the effects of the psychological sequels to PD patients, as well as the reduction of stigma and promotion of community support towards PD. The study adopts a 2-arm randomized controlled design, aiming to investigate the effectiveness of two mind-body interventions - yoga, and arts-based approaches in improving the psycho-social-spiritual well-being among PD patients."

The investigators have previously addressed the difficulty in identifying tumor in non-enhancing (NE) T2 hyperintense regions surrounding the contrast-enhancing bulk of tumor. The investigators have applied pH sensitive amine chemical exchange saturation transfer echo planar imaging (CEST-EPI) to patients with glioblastoma. CEST imaging can utilize detection of fast-exchanging amine protons to obtain an imaging contrast that is dependent on tissue acidity. Bulk water protons undergo chemical exchange with amine protons. CEST imaging detects the attenuation of bulk water magnetization following a saturation pulse, which can vary by concentration of amine protons. This contrast can be quantitated as the asymmetry in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTRasym) relative to water proton resonance frequency. Tumor cells are known to produce elevated levels of extracellular hydrogen, given 1) a higher metabolic rate secondary to increased cell turnover and 2) an affinity for anaerobic glycolysis - the Warburg Effect. The investigators have shown active tumor burden and active replication occurring in infiltrating glioblastoma cells. and thus leveraged CEST imaging to visualize infiltrating tumor cells. 19 In newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, higher median MTRasym at 3ppm within CEST+ NE regions p=0.007; p=0.0326] and higher volumes of CEST+ NE tumor [p=0.020; p<0.001] were associated with decreased PFS. Prospective MRI guided biopsies of CEST+ NE regions showed a correlation with presence of cell density and %Ki-67 positivity [p<0.001, p<0.001]. Furthermore, using pathological diagnosis as the gold standard, the investigators saw a threshold of MTRasym > 1.50% as able to identify tumor cells with a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 71.4%. In unpublished data with additional samples only from newly diagnosed WHO IV glioblastoma, the calculated sensitivity and specificity was 100% when using neuro-pathological review as the gold standard. Additionally, when using single cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) detection of tumor cells via copy number variation analysis as the gold standard, from 17 biopsies in CEST+ NE regions, the same threshold of 1.50% identified tumor cells with a sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 100%. Given the strong correlation between tumor cells and CEST+ NE regions, the investigators have preliminary conducted CEST+ NE resections on 5 patients with newly diagnosed WHO IV glioblastoma. In this preliminary data, the investigators found no significant post-operative complications with the larger resections. All patients received standard of care adjuvant therapy (temozolomide + radiotherapy) and none of the patients have experienced progression (median PFS 13 months). With this data, the investigators hypothesize that maximal safe resection of CEST+ NE regions will minimize the post-surgical tumor cell burden and allow for increased survival. Experimental Approach. The investigators will carry out a prospective, randomized controlled trial of surgical resection of glioblastoma with pH sensitive amine CEST-EPI. Patients will be enrolled by me at the UCLA Ronald Reagan Medical Center. The UCLA department of neurosurgery brain tumor program is a high-volume neuro-oncology center. The investigators will recruit patients with imaging consistent with WHO grade IV glioblastoma. 51 I will directly provide informed consent for participating in the trial along with informed consent for the surgery itself. Prior to randomization, all patients will undergo pre-operative medical clearance and standard pre-operative medication administration (levetiracetam 100mg BID and dexamethasone 4mg TID). All patients will undergo pre-operative standard anatomic MRI 52 within 1 week of surgery (3T Siemens Prisma, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany).

The investigators aim to examine the beneficial effects of a short playful interaction on the cognitive, social, and mood of older people. The investigators will examine changes in indices of mood, mental health, social functioning, cognition compared to an active control intervention. The investigators will examine the mediating role of personality traits and cognitive functions in connection to the beneficial effect of playful interactions in aging. The investigators hypnotized that playful interactions will induce greater effects on emotional and social indices, as well as on executive functioning, compared to more familiar social interactions. The investigators hypothesize that these effects will be found in older populations. The investigators hypothesize that the effects of short-term playful interaction tasks as compared to the matched social control condition will be preserved in the online format. Individuals' characteristics and personality traits will influence the effects of the interaction on the dependent variables. Participants 80 participants (up to 95, considering attrition). To detect a significant interaction between conditions and participant groups (ANOVA within-between interactions with repeated measures as a proxy for MLM, with 4 groups, and 6 types of repeated measures), assuming a medium-small effect size (f2 = .20), and a conservative estimate of correlation (r = .33), a sample size of at least 18 in each arm group is required to achieve a power of 0.90, using GPower. The investigators will recruit 20 participants per group expecting attrition. Procedure The study will take place in six sites including assisted living facilities, community centers and adults day centers in Israel. Participants will be invited by the research assistance to take part in the study. Participants who will be willing to take part in the study will meet with the research team and will read and signed an informed consent form before participating in the study. Following the informed consent signing, base line measures will be collected (traits and cognitive measures) (T0). Following base line assessment participants will be randomly assigned to four arms. At first, they will randomly assign to one of two conditions (online or face to face). The interactions will be separated in a week. A random half of the two conditions of participants (online and face to face) will be assigned to practice the playful interaction at the first week and control interaction in the second week, whereas for the other half this order will be reversed. One designated experiment assigned each participant randomly to one of the two interactions (playful or control), to keep the other experiments blind to the activity. For each participant, separate interactions will be conducted by a different experimenter. These are the four arms: Playful interactions operationalized by dramatic improvisation techniques based on verbal and non-verbal elements in face to face setting Playful interactions operationalized by dramatic improvisation techniques based on verbal and non-verbal elements in online setting An active control condition that involves introductory conversation and movement exercises in face to face setting in face to face setting An active control condition that involves introductory conversation and movement exercises in face to face setting in online setting The interventions will meet the following criteria: a) ease of implementation in an online system; b) a short interaction between 15-20 minutes. Both interactions incorporated bodily movement; however, the playful interaction encompassed elements of co-creation, spontaneity, and innovation, whereas the control interaction adhered to a more conventional and routine approach. The online interactions will take place using the ZOOM video conference software under laboratory conditions. All interactions will be guided by graduate students of the Theatre department at the university of Haifa or drama therapy students or theatre facilitator - the facilitators, who are unfamiliar to the participants. One designated experiment assigned each facilitator randomly to one of the two interactions (playful or control), to keep the other experiments blind to the activity. The facilitators will be randomly assigned to the different interactions, so that for each participants the separate interactions were conducted by a different facilitator. All interactions will be videoed recorded. A fidelity check will be done by the research team every week to make sure each participants was given the correct interaction (playful or control), and that each interaction included all phases in the protocol. Both interactions will commence with a battery of tests and self-reports before (T1) and after each session (T2). The battery of tests was conducted by an experimenter who will be blind to the type of intervention (playful or control). All self-reports and tests will be administered individually in a quiet and well-lit room before and after each activity. Items will be read aloud to participants when this will be necessary, and responses will be given orally and coded by the researcher.

The proposed project will establish the efficacy of using the SkillFlix for Parents online video library to improve the sexual health communication skills of parents of teens with autism spectrum disorder. A randomized controlled trial is being conducted to assess the impact of the resource on parent skill demonstration and confidence, conversation frequency, and teen knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Participants will be parent and youth dyads, including parents over 18 years old and youth aged 13-17 with ASD, reciprocal communication skills, receptive language skills, who are in mainstream classrooms for at least one class during the school day. Participants are primarily being recruited with assistance from agencies/organizations that serve those with ASD, community and professional advisory board members, and other community networks. It is also likely that participants will refer other parents of youth on the spectrum for participation. The study design will be a randomized controlled trial of dyads with pre- and post-assessment, and a 3-month follow-up assessment (6 months after start of study), each including a survey and audio recording. After completing the baseline activities, half (50) of the dyads will be randomly assigned to the SkillTalk ASD intervention group which will receive access to the SkillTalk ASD web site and the study mobile app. The control group will receive written materials with similar content. For baseline parents will take a survey, audio record a conversation based on a written conversation guide and upload it for analysis. Youth will take a survey. Intervention participants will have access to SkillTalk ASD for 3 months. During the three-month period, parent and youth participants will be asked to complete a bi-weekly conversation log. At the conclusion of the three-month period, they will participate in an immediate post-test which will again include a survey, audio record a conversation based on a written conversation guide and upload it for analysis. Youth will take an immediate post-test survey. During the three-month follow-up period, parents and youths will be asked to complete a biweekly conversation log.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a WHO grade 4 adult-type diffuse glioma and the most common malignant, primary brain tumor with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of only  5% in real-world studies. The Stupp Protocol, consisting of fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days/week for 6 weeks (a total of 60 Gy), plus concomitant daily temozolomide (TMZ, 75 mg/m2/day, 7 days/week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy) after maximal safe tumor resection, followed by six cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 days during each 28-day cycle), has been adopted as the standard of care for patients with newly-diagnosed GBMs (ndGBMs) since 2005. However, there have been no other treatment modalities except for tumor treating fields (TTFields) that have brought survival benefits for ndGBM patients during the past two decades. Since TTFields therapy is super expensive (about 1 million yuan/0.15 million dollars per year) and fewer than 10% of ndGBM patients can afford it around the globe, the Stupp Protocol is still being used as the first-line and the most widely-adopted treatment option for ndGBM patients around the world. Elemene, a Chinese anti-tumor medicine extracted from the plant Curcuma Wenyujin, has been isolated as a monomeric drug and has a broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect in various cancers, such as lung cancer, breast carcinoma, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. In recent years, its application in GBMs as revealed in the preliminary retrospective studies published in Chinese Journals and a few English Journals have shown survival benefits with acceptable toxicity. Elemene can pass through the blood-brain barrier because of its small molecular weight and lipid solubility and has synergistic anti-tumor effects with TMZ and radiotherapy for GBM patients. Several in vitro studies also have shown that Elemene could inhibit GBM cell proliferation, promote cell differentiation, and induce cancer cell apoptosis. All these findings from the above studies have indicated the potential survival benefits of Elemene in treating ndGBMs. However, so far, no clinical trials have tested the efficacy and safety of the new treatment protocol (Elemene added to the Stupp Protocol) for ndGBMs compared with the conventional Stupp protocol. In this study, the investigators aimed to launch a multi-center, phase II, randomized, controlled clinical trial to test the safety and efficacy of Elemene plus Stupp Protocol compared with Stupp Protocol alone for ndGBM patients."

The International Headache Society (IHS) reported that approximately 90% of headaches consist of tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine, which are the primary type of headache, and affect approximately 50% of the population. The incidence of headaches and migraines is to peak at the age of 20-50, and is more common in women than in men. Recurrent tension-type headaches and migraine attacks negatively affect the quality of life of individuals, reducing working capacity and participation in social and family activities. Therefore, tension-type headaches and migraines cause significant social exclusion, loss of workforce and economic burden. TTH and migraine impede personal care, productivity and leisure activities, which are an integral part of individuals' lives due to symptoms such as pain, fatigue, difficulty concentrating and/or dizziness. Participation in purposeful activities for individuals is an essential component of health and well-being. Activity self-efficacy is a definition that includes the sense of personal competence and satisfaction about the activities women engage in. When individuals engage in work, play, and daily life activities, women sustain, reinforce, shape, and modify women's capacities, beliefs, and tendencies. High self-efficacy perception can affect the sustainability of physical activity and the productivity of individuals. Both TTH and Migraine tend to occur during the most productive and high-capacity phase of life, between ages 25-55, affecting muscle groups used in daily life activities, potentially leading to limitations in participation, coping, and self-management skills among women. In this regard, it is important to study how tension-type headaches and migraines, which have significant social and individual effects, alter the self-sufficiency and perception of activity in women. Constant thinking of pain and avoiding physical activity can reveal dysfunction in individuals. Because of the individual-specific and complex structure of human roles, each individual suffering from a headache faces different limitations in fulfilling daily roles and social participation, depending on lifestyle and preferences. Thus, non-pharmacological treatments (physiotherapy practices, lifestyle changes, cognitive behavioral therapy, body awareness therapy) are recommended for women with TTH and migraine complaints to relax various muscle groups. One of these treatments is progressive relaxation training. PRT is defined as a method of voluntary, regular relaxation of large muscle groups in the human body with relaxation throughout the body. Specifically, applying PRT to muscle groups found in hands, arms, neck, shoulders, face, chest, abdomen, hips, feet, and fingers, which are most frequently utilized in daily life activities, enhances its benefits for individuals. In the literature, various studies reported that PRT improved occupational performance, participation in daily life activities and quality of life in addition to pain management in individuals with various chronic pains. According to the knowledge, there exists no study in the literature comparing the beneficial effects that PRT, one of the optimal treatments that can be applied in women with TTH and migraine, can have on these two distinct headache groups. Furthermore, studies examining the impact of PRT on activity self-efficacy perception and social participation are quite limited. The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the effects of PRT on pain characteristics, attack frequency, activity self-efficacy perception, and social participation in women with two different types of headaches, TTH and migraine. This study will enable clinicians working with women suffering from TTH and migraine to comprehensively evaluate them in clinical settings and provide more comprehensive intervention approaches to address challenges encountered in daily life."

Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a common complication of in-utero opioid exposure. The syndrome is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including tremors, irritability, and feeding difficulties. The severity of symptoms varies widely among infants, and the optimal treatment is not well defined. The goal of this study is to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) that are associated with the severity of NAS and to determine if these miRNAs can be used as biomarkers to predict the severity of NAS in infants.

The study will enroll 100 infants who are exposed to opioids in utero. The infants will be followed from birth until discharge from the hospital. The infants will be evaluated for the severity of NAS using standardized clinical assessments. Saliva samples will be collected from the infants at birth and at discharge. The saliva samples will be analyzed for miRNA levels.

The study will also collect data on the infants' neurodevelopmental outcomes at 6 months of age. The investigators will use a standardized questionnaire to assess the infants' developmental milestones.

The study will provide valuable information on the role of miRNAs in the pathophysiology of NAS and may lead to the development of new treatments for this condition."

The research is a randomized controlled experimental research design. Research hypotheses H1: The postoperative pain level of the patients in the intervention group is lower than that of the patients in the control group. H2: The level of fear of postoperative pain of the patients in the intervention group is lower than that of the patients in the control group. Research Variables Dependent Variables: Patients' pain level and fear of pain level Independent variable: Patient education Participants and setting The study group of the study consisted of 52 patients who underwent elective surgery in the orthopedics and traumatology clinic of the training and research hospital affiliated with the Ministry of Health in Istanbul between December 15, 2021, and March 15, 2022, and were open to communication and cooperation, had no cognitive and mental problems, and volunteered to participate in the study. The number of patients to be included in the study group; intervention and control were determined as a minimum of 25 patients (by calculating the margin of error of type 1 (α) = 0.05 and the power of the test (1-β) = 0.80, effect size 0.66 by power analysis of the patients constituting the universe). The study group consisted of a total of 52 patients, 26 in the intervention group and 26 in the control group, taking into account the possibility of data loss. Intervention group: Patients receiving patient education on pain management Control group: Patients who did not receive training in pain management Patients who met the inclusion criteria were interviewed about the study. Patients who agreed to participate in the study were asked to choose an envelope containing an intervention or control letter. The patient with an intervention letter on the envelope was included in the intervention group and the patient with a control letter was included in the control group. Thus, bias in group selection was presented in the study. Homogeneity between the groups was ensured by testing the gender, age, number of days of hospitalization, educational status, occupation, previous surgery, and regular use of pain medication. As a result of the analyses, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference between the gender, age, number of days of hospitalization, educational status, occupation, previous surgery, and regular use of pain medication in the intervention and control groups (p>0.05) (Table 1). According to the results, the intervention group (n: 26) and the control group (n: 26) showed homogenous distribution. Data collection tools Data were collected using the Information Form, Fear of Pain Scale-III, and Visual/Visual Analogue Scale. Information Form: The form, which was prepared by the researchers using the literature, includes 8 questions to determine the socio-demographic characteristics of the patients (gender, age, marital status, education level, occupation, number of days of hospitalization, previous surgery and regular medication use) (Büyükünal Şahin & Rızalar, 2018; Yang et al, 2019). Fear of Pain Scale-III: The scale was developed by McNeil and Rainwater in 1998 to measure the fear of pain. The scale was adapted into Turkish by Ünver and Turan (2018). The scale consists of 30 items and 3 sub-dimensions Fear of Severe Pain, Fear of Mild Pain and Fear of Medical Pain with 10 items in each sub-dimension. The response options of the scale prepared in 5-point likert type are; 5-extreme, 4-very much, 3-quite, 2-somewhat, 1-never. 1-never feeling fear, the 5-excessive feeling of fear. All items in the scale are positive and there are no reversed items. The lowest score that can be obtained from the scale is 30 and the highest score is 150. The minimum score for the sub-dimensions is 10 and the maximum score is 50. The higher the scores obtained from the scale, the higher the fear of pain. The total Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficient of the scale is 0.93, 0.88 for the fear of severe pain sub-dimension, 0.85 for the fear of mild pain sub-dimension, and 0.93 for the fear of medical pain sub-dimension (Ünver & Turan, 2018).

Chronic pancreatitis is an inherently complex disease requiring coordinated, multidisciplinary care. Patients suffer from constant, distressing, adverse symptoms including abdominal pain, steatorrhoea, bloating, wind, cramping, and fatigue - making it difficult to eat a normal or sufficient diet. They develop vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, and a difficult-to-manage diabetes subgroup (type 3c diabetes). There is no effective medical/surgical treatment, and the disease is progressive and incurable. The mainstay of treatment is diet, supplementation, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy- which helps patients to digest and absorb their food, alleviating symptoms somewhat. Contrary to perceptions, half of patients (or fewer) have an alcohol related aetiology. The investigators run several out-patient clinics for chronic pancreatitis including medical-led, nurse-specialist led, and type 3c diabetes clinics. A nurse specialist deal with 3-5 crisis phonically daily, each lasting up to 30mins. Patients have frequent urgent clinic attendance, A&E, and hospital admissions. What is the intervention? A steering group designed and developed the SmartCP mobile phone app during 2022 with the support of a government innovation grant. SmartCP consists of a symptom tracker, diet/physical activity log, alert system for escalating symptoms, quality of life assessment, red-flag alerts for diabetes/pancreatic cancer, educational content, push notifications and messaging function. Overall aim of the study To conduct a study to determine if SmartCP is feasible in the management patients with chronic pancreatitis, complementing current specialist clinical care. Design A single-arm, unblinded, feasibility study, with an uncontrolled, within-group baseline and post-intervention (16-week) design, with an embedded quantitative and qualitative process evaluation. Participants will receive the intervention for 16 weeks, supplementing usual clinical practice."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the incidence of anal fissure among COVID-19 survivors and to identify the risk factors associated with its development. This is a retrospective cross-sectional study conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 at Mansoura university isolation hospital. Patients who were diagnosed to have anal fissure during the follow up were included. The investigators telephoned about 350 patients, 176 replied to us while 174 didn't answer. Those who suffered from anal pain problems were advised to come to our colorectal outpatient clinic (OPC) to be examined to make sure of the diagnosis. But, because of the pandemic situation, no patient came to the OPC. Further telephone calls were conducted to those who were diagnosed with anal fissure to ask about their outcomes, to pick up how many of them were managed medically or their symptoms resolved spontaneously or needed surgical interference. The investigators collected data including; age, sex, the associated co-morbidities, and the degree of severity of infection, respiratory or GIT symptoms and the need for oxygen therapy. Other symptoms as fever, loss of smell and/or taste sensation, constipation or diarrhea and also the duration of these symptoms were checked. Additionally, the investigations that were conducted either laboratory or radiological."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of platelet rich fibrin (PRF) on wound healing following palatal connective tissue harvesting. The study was planned as a randomized prospective controlled study. Patients with Miller class 1 or 2 gingival recession who needs root coverage surgery in the Department of Periodontology were included in the study. The subepithelial connective tissue graft was obtained in each patient using the single incision technique from the region between the mesial of canine and the mesial of first molar in the palate. Connective tissue dimensions were approximately 10 × 5 × 2 mm. Finally, the incision line was sutured with 5/0 synthetic, nonabsorbable, sterile monofilament suture in the control group while L-PRF membrane was placed to the donor site in the test group before the suturing. Patients were evaluated using an ultrasonography device (MyLab™ Seven, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. USG measurements were performed on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 90 for palatal tissue thickness and tissue vascularization by an oral and maxillofacial radiologist with at least six years of experience. A 6-18 MHz intraoral probe was used in intraoral USG examinations. Sterile gel was applied to the intraoral probe and covered with a stretch film. Then, it was placed directly on the mucosal surface of the donor site in the palatal area. Mucosal thickness was evaluated using the B-mode of the device, and vascularization was evaluated using the color doppler and pulsed wave doppler modes of the device. The mean pulsatility index (PI) values of each patient were calculated and considered for statistical analysis. The power analyse of the study was performed for sample size calculation. Sample size was calculated using a statistical program (G*Power; Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany) for α = 0.05 and effect size = 0.26. The analyses revealed that 10 subjects per group achieved a power of 80 % with 95% confidence. The data were analysed with the SPSS 21 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to detect data's normality. For the comparison of the parameters of the study groups, independent samples T-test test was used for normally distributed data while Mann Whitney U test test was performed as non-parametric test. Within-group comparisons between the different time periods were tested with repeated measures of ANOVA. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple variations. The statistical significance value was accepted as p < 0.05."

The study aims to investigate the treatment of couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Eligible couples will be recruited for the study after providing informed written consent following counseling. The IVF protocol involves various steps. Women will undergo preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) as clinically indicated. Ovarian stimulation will be carried out using gonadotropin injections, and regular ultrasound monitoring will be conducted to track the growth of follicles. To prevent a premature LH surge, progestin primed ovarian stimulation or a GnRH antagonist will be administered. Once at least three follicles reach a size of over 17 mm, a trigger injection of either human chorionic gonadotrophin or a GnRH agonist will be given to induce final maturation. Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after the trigger under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The recruited women will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the microfluidic chip group or the density gradient centrifugation group. Randomization and blinding will be ensured to maintain the integrity of the study. Only the laboratory staff involved in sperm preparation will be aware of the group assignment, while the women and clinicians will be blinded to the treatment groups. Semen specimens will be collected by masturbation on the day of oocyte retrieval, following a period of 2-7 days of sexual abstinence. The semen samples will undergo evaluation according to WHO guidelines, including semen volume, sperm concentration, and percent motile spermatozoa. Sperm DNA damage will be assessed using an alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. The extent of DNA damage in spermatozoa will be examined using specific parameters. Sperm preparation will be performed based on the randomization list. In the microfluidic chip group, the Sperm Separation Device will be used, and the prepared sample will be collected in a test tube. In the density gradient centrifugation group, sperm preparation will be completed using a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation method, and the resulting sperm pellet will be washed and resuspended. Oocytes will be fertilized through intracytoplasmic sperm injection, and normal fertilization will be confirmed by the presence of two pronuclei. A few cells will be taken from the blastocysts for comprehensive chromosome analysis. Cryopreservation of all blastocysts will be done, and only euploid blastocysts without aneuploidies will be replaced in subsequent frozen embryo transfer cycles. Frozen embryo transfer (FET) will be performed in subsequent natural or hormonal replacement cycles, depending on the women's menstrual cycle regularity. Pregnancy outcomes will be monitored through urine pregnancy tests and transvaginal ultrasounds. If the pregnancy test is positive, further ultrasounds will be done to confirm fetal viability and the number of fetuses. Pregnancy and delivery data will be retrieved after delivery, and information on pregnancy outcomes, number of babies born, birth weights, and obstetric complications will be recorded. The study aims to assess the effectiveness of the two different sperm preparation methods and their impact on IVF outcomes, including pregnancy rates and obstetric complications."

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common disease that affects the nose and upper airways. It is characterized by inflammation of the nasal mucosa, which leads to symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose, and nasal congestion. The prevalence of AR is increasing worldwide, and it is estimated that approximately 10-30% of the population is affected by this disease.

The pathogenesis of AR is complex and involves several factors, including genetic predisposition, environmental factors, and immune system dysregulation. Several studies have shown that genetic factors play a significant role in the development of AR. In particular, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in the immune response and inflammation have been associated with an increased risk of AR.

One of the genes that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AR is the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. BDNF is a protein that is involved in the growth and survival of neurons in the brain. Several studies have shown that SNPs in the BDNF gene are associated with an increased risk of AR.

Another gene that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AR is the nerve growth factor (NGF) gene. NGF is a protein that is involved in the growth and survival of neurons in the peripheral nervous system. Several studies have shown that SNPs in the NGF gene are associated with an increased risk of AR.

In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors also play a significant role in the development of AR. One of the environmental factors that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AR is exposure to allergens. Allergens are substances that can trigger an allergic reaction in susceptible individuals. Exposure to allergens can lead to the activation of the immune system and the production of inflammatory mediators, which can contribute to the development of AR.

The aim of this study is to investigate the role of BDNF gene single nucleotide polymorphism and NGF serum level as risk factors that increase the severity of allergic rhinitis. The study will include 100 patients with chronic allergic rhinitis and 100 healthy controls. The patients will be divided into two groups based on the severity of their symptoms. The first group will consist of patients with mild symptoms, and the second group will consist of patients with severe symptoms. The healthy controls will not have any symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

The study will involve the collection of blood samples from all participants. The blood samples will be used to measure the levels of BDNF gene single nucleotide polymorphism and NGF serum level. The levels of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and C-reactive protein (CRP) will also be measured in the blood samples.

The results of this study will provide valuable information about the role of BDNF gene single nucleotide polymorphism and NGF serum level as risk factors for allergic rhinitis. This information can be used to develop new treatments for this disease and to improve the management of patients with allergic rhinitis."

Inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, leading to chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) and contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the world's population is inactive and older adults are at highest risk. Inactivity in older adults is linked to age-related diseases and cognitive decline. Inactivity also imposes social costs through increased medical expenses, which are already high among the growing older adult population in the US. Incentive-based interventions have gained popularity among behavioral scientists and policymakers as a tool for improving health-related behaviors. But there are drawbacks - first, monetary incentives are often not cost-effective, and therefore scalability is limited. Second, behaviors often return to baseline when monetary incentives are removed, i.e., healthy habits are hard to maintain when incentives are limited in duration. Third, there is a concern that monetary incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation to engage in health-promoting behaviors. In light of the limited success of incentive-based behavior change programs, the investigators propose to design and evaluate alternative incentives that address these challenges of scalability, habit formation and crowd-out. The investigators will aim to encourage physical activity through alternative incentives - by making a meal donations on behalf of participants (prosocial incentives) and give participants monetary incentives (personal incentives). Both types of incentives have underpinnings in behavioral economics. Meal donations harness prosocial preferences, which may be more powerful and less likely to reduce intrinsic motivation than equivalent monetary incentives. The overall aim is to evaluate the impact of alternative incentives on step count of older adults in the short-term and long-term. Exploratory analysis will also evaluate the impact on physical and mental health. The investigators will recruit 200 older adults and randomize half of them to receive additional prosocial and personal incentives for their walking behavior. The other half will not receive these incentives. The investigators will track step count of these two groups for 8 weeks using a Fitbit device. Under the treatment functionality, participants accrue a meal donation and a point for Feeding America for each day that they meet the step goal. The investigators plan to recruit older adults ages 55 and above at grocery stores and other locations around San Diego, CA. Recruitment will be on a rolling basis. PI Samek has recruited participants at grocery stores in prior studies, hence the investigators believe this is feasible. Participation will be limited to individuals who own a smart phone (61% of older adults in the US own a smart phone, and the investigators expect this number to grow as the population ages). Studies have shown that older adults are open to using app-based technologies, for example older adults are accepting of mindfulness apps. The research team will be given access to participants' Fitbit data through Fitabase, a research platform that collects data from internet connected consumer activity devices. The investigators identified 7,500 steps as an appropriate goal as studies show older adults walk 4,000 steps on average. For the treatment group, meals will be donated by the research team to Feeding America for each day they meet the step goal of 7,500 steps. They will also receive money for each day they meet the step goal of 7,500 steps a day, for up to 5 days a week. The control group will not receive these incentives for their walking behavior, but their daily step count data will be collected. Participants will receive a Fitbit upon enrollment. The investigators will collect their physical activity data for 1 week, as their baseline physical activity. After 1 week, individuals who on average less than 6000 per day, will be randomized to the treatment group, which receives the incentives for 5 weeks, or to a control group which does not. The investigators will also collect follow up data for 2 weeks. Individuals who on average walk more than 6000 steps per day during the 1 week baseline period will be dropped from the study."

This is an interrupted time series study conducted at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) neonatal ward between April 2022 and June 2023. Our study participants comprise of newborn patients admitted at MTRH during that period. The MTRH neonatal ward is arranged in 8 sub-units which comprise our comparison sub-groups. Newborns admitted from April-November 2022 comprise the pre-intervention arm and are not exposed to neoGuard, but receive existing standard-of-care vital sign monitoring. In December 2022, neoGuard was installed in 4 sub-units (intervention group), while the remaining 4 sub-units (comparison group) continued to use standard-of-care monitoring. The measurement of effectiveness will be performed at three levels: (1) device's ability to detect abnormal physiological signals and provide alerts/alarms that notify the nurses to check on a patient's status and; (2) alarms/alerts from level one that resulted in a necessary intervention being administered to the patient (valid alarms), versus all the alarms/alerts that did not necessitate an intervention (invalid alarms); (3) the month-to-month difference in newborn complication rates and treatment outcomes between the intervention group and comparison group. Medical staff who interact with neoGuard will participate in user surveys at the end of the intervention period to capture user experience and perceptions on feasibility and sustainability."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common sleep disorder in children that can cause daytime sleepiness, behavioral problems, and other health problems. Many children with OSA are not identified and thus do not receive treatment. In a previous study, the investigators found that a clinical decision support system helped primary care providers (PCPs) identify children with OSA. In this system, parents of children report on possible OSA symptoms (e.g., snoring, sleepiness) in their child before the visit. If the child has OSA symptoms, the PCP receives an alert during the visit recommending further evaluation and a possible referral for a sleep study or to see a specialist. While this system helped increase the number of children with OSA symptoms who received a referral, many children remained unidentified. The goal of this study is to see whether involving parents in the system can identify even more children. In this study, the investigators propose to test the impact of a health communication message, designed to educate and activate parents about their child's risk for OSA. This message is an infographic that helps parents recognize nighttime symptoms of OSA and how these nighttime symptoms may be impacting their child during the day. If a child has OSA symptoms, parents would view this infographic before their child's PCP visit and could discuss OSA with their child's PCP. For children with OSA symptoms, their parents will be randomized to either: 1) view the health communication message, or; 2) usual care, in which parents are not given any additional information about OSA or their child's risk prior to the appointment. In both cases, PCPs will receive a prompt indicating that the child is at risk for OSA."

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a high mortality rate. The pathophysiology of AN is still not fully understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and the cytokines neurofilament light chain (Nfl) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the pathophysiology of AN.
The investigators hypothesize that GDF-15, Nfl and GFAP are elevated in AN patients and that they are associated with the severity of the disease. The investigators also hypothesize that GDF-15, Nfl and GFAP are associated with the severity of the disease.
The investigators will compare the levels of GDF-15, Nfl and GFAP in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AN patients and normal-weight controls. The investigators will also correlate the levels of GDF-15, Nfl and GFAP with the severity of the disease and with body composition measures (lean and fat mass) and energy expenditure.
The investigators will include 8 AN patients with a restrictive subtype and 8 AN patients with an exercising subtype. The investigators will also include 16 normal-weight controls.

The aim of this study is to collect prospective data on pleural interventions and outcomes for patients who have undergone procedures in their service. The study will collect data on complications and key other data from patients undergoing pleural procedures. The data will include demographics, smoking history, pre-procedure observations, radiological findings and medical history along with information about the size of the service and range of procedures performed. Complications will be objectively defined, with baseline procedure information recorded, and at 1 month, all complications recorded according to specified criteria. At least 20 centres will be approached to collect prospective data on pleural interventions and outcomes for patients who have undergone procedures in their service. All patients who have a pleural procedure for fluid will have an ultrasound as part of the procedure but due to a difference in expertise around the country, centres (and clinicians within each centre) will record ultrasound findings in varying degrees of detail. Centres will specify what level of detail they can provide and can opt to perform a more detailed assessment if skills permit and the patient agrees. Any patient can be included in the sub-study if there is sufficient time and sufficient expertise of the clinicians to perform and interpret the more detail scanning procedures. Patients, who are willing, will also be asked to complete a visual analogue scale score for chest pain and breathlessness before and after their procedure and at a further time interval within 4 weeks. Any patients who are having an indwelling catheter inserted, or chest drain inserted for pleurodesis will be asked to complete an additional questionnaire. The majority of centres will be those with an active pleural service and will include a combination of district general and tertiary referral centres. The data collected will provide a best practice standard against which new and smaller volume centres can benchmark practice, to ensure patient safety."

Background and Rationale: In recent years, cCTA has become a crucial diagnostic tool for suspected CAD, recommended as the first-line test for patients with an intermediate pre-test probability of CAD by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and the American HeartAssociation (AHA) and Italian guidelines. However, most patients have non-obstructive CAD. While the management of patients with obstructive CAD is established, as it revolves around further diagnostic test for ischemia evaluation or upfront coronary artery revascularization, this is not the case for patients with non-obstructive CAD. However, these cohort of patients still has a significant risk of developing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) that could be prevented by implementing adequate medical therapy. To date, many approaches have been proposed to tackle this issue. However, these proposed solutions lack the ability to provide quantitative and reproducible results with a sufficiently strong predictive value, are often proposed as a stand-alone solution without the integration with multiple prognosticator imaging and clinical parameters, and are not delivered through platforms capable of providing external validation and easy integration in the clinical workflow. Among the proposed prognostic approaches, some are based on the qualitative evaluation of coronary artery plaque features, such as positive remodeling, low attenuation of the plaque, presence of spotty calcification, and napkin ring sign, which is subject to significant inter-reader variability. Other approaches rely on quantitative methods for evaluating atherosclerotic burden based on the extent of coronary artery plaques and their characteristics, such as calcium density, number of lesions, regional distribution, plaque volume, non-calcified plaque volume etc. However, these approaches may be hampered by low reproducibility, especially among different scanner vendors. Interestingly, a new research has also shown that, besides coronary artery vessel wall characteristics, pericoronary adipose tissue attenuation carries significant predictive value, as it reflects the state of coronary inflammation that plays a key role in the development and progression of coronary atherosclerosis. All these CAD characteristics are often analyzed independently from one to another, reducing their potential synergistic prognostic value and creating redundant variables that have negligible effect on prognosis. We propose an AI-based analysis that can integrate all this data in order to select the most important determinant of CAD progression and to discard futile features, thus creating an agile and clinically valuable risk stratification model. Furthermore, we plan to create a novel imaging marker of CAD with unfavorable outcome, to be integrated in the AI-based model, which will be based on topological features of the coronary artery tree. In fact, data on the association between coronary artery topology (e.g., vessel-length, coronary artery volume index, cross-sectional area, curvature, and tortuositv) and prognosis is scarce. However, it is known that vessel tortuosity influences wall shear stress and leads to disruption of laminar flow, resulting in endothelial dysfunction and flow alterations that may lead to atherosclerosis, eventually causing adverse cardiac events. Thus, this novel biomarker may carry a significant prognostic role. Based on these premises, our research aims to develop a novel clinical-imaging AI-based model to identify and categorize patients at high risk of disease progression and provide a more personalized management approach to improve patient outcomes. However, besides the primary objective of creating an AI-based model for CAD risk stratification, we aim to overcome some issues that currently hamper the widespread clinical application of AI in cardiovascular care. In fact, it is recognized that the integration of AI-based applications into the clinical workflow, which will increase usability and decrease costs, is currently lacking. We aim to tackle these issues with the help of the industrial partners involved in this project that will build a platform capable of delivering the software solution to provide external validation of the algorithm. This platform will be characterized by state-of-the-art security measures, interoperability with current clinical software, and easy-to-use interface.

The novel coronavirus infection epidemic is called plague, plague, blight, etc., characterized by rapid onset and strong infectivity, middle-aged and elderly patients are often seriously ill, and some clinical symptoms are protracted and difficult to cure, which seriously affects the quality of life of patients. The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is simple, economical and safe, and can better reflect the exercise tolerance and cardiopulmonary function of patients. It is widely used to evaluate the efficacy and rehabilitation effect of patients with cardiovascular diseases and chronic respiratory diseases. Although drugs can be used for symptomatic treatment such as cough and phlegm, there is still a lack of effective western medicine to relieve these symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, qi promotion of sweat, fear of wind and cold, loss of appetite and other symptoms. Citing an article on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus published by Nature, a top international scientific journal, it is believed that at the current stage, active research and development of drugs that can alleviate symptoms of novel coronavirus infection, promote the recovery of the disease and improve the quality of life, as well as the diagnosis and treatment of mild to moderate novel coronavirus patients will have huge public health benefits [7]. Jade screen, as a famous prescription for the treatment of surface deficiency syndrome, comes from Wei Yilin's Prescription for the effect of the World Medicine in the Yuan Dynasty (some researchers also believe that it comes from Zhu Zhenheng's Danxi Xin Method in the Yuan Dynasty). The party has the beneficial effect of gas-solid table stop sweat, attending table is not solid, spontaneous perspiration evil wind, complexion white, pale tongue moss thin white, pulse vain, run-down cou justified is susceptible to the wind. The jade screen is made of Astragalus, fried white art and windproof. Astragalus is mainly used for spleen and lung Qi deficiency, which is used to benefit Qi and solid surface, and is the king medicine. White art invigorating spleen and qi, helping astragalus qi and solid surface, as minister medicine; Windproof table and wind evil, as a tonic. However, there are few prospective clinical intervention studies on the use of Manzhi Guben granules for symptomatic supportive treatment during outpatient treatment of convalescent patients with novel coronavirus infection, and there is still a lack of high-quality clinical evidence-based medical evidence on its effectiveness in improving exercise tolerance of convalescent patients after novel coronavirus infection. This provides a good opportunity for the research of this project. By means of modern medical research, it is found that the main components of Manzhi Guben granules (Yupingfeng + Angelica sinensis) are: (1) Astragalus supplementing Qi and consolidating surface, antiviral infection, significant stimulation of interferon system, regulating and promoting humoral and cellular immunity; (2) Atractylodes atractylodes can nourish qi, invigorate spleen, dry dampness, enhance cellular and humoral immunity, and promote phagocytosis of macrophages; (3) Wind-proof and wind-dispelling, which can enhance immune function and fight infection; (4) Angelica sinensis: It has anti-thrombotic effect, improves blood circulation, improves coronary circulation in cardiovascular system, has anti-inflammatory and analgesic effect, lowers blood sugar effect, and has protective effect on lung. Some recent studies have found through modern pharmacological research means that a variety of active compounds in the prescription of Yupingfeng can play a role in the prevention and treatment of novel coronavirus infection through multi-target and multi-pathway [9,10], which further provides the basic theoretical basis for the clinical application of Manzhi Guben granules. The research team has published an article in Pharmacological Research on the diagnosis and treatment of novel coronavirus infection : Analyzed in 2020 registered in the Chinese clinical trial registry of 130 intervention new coronavirus infection in clinical research of traditional Chinese medicine, found that: Single-center studies accounted for 60.8%, non-placebo controls for 86.2%, open-label or unstated blinds for 30.8% and 60.8%, and 80.8% of clinical studies enrolled no more than 300 patients.

The fast growth of Decision Neuroscience is contributing to unveil the cognitive processes underlying choices and their neural bases. The results obtained so far show that decision-making involves neural mechanisms underpinning a complex balance between automatic appetitive or aversive drives generated by subcortical structures, and processes of executive control centered in fronto-parietal brain networks. While the role of meso-limbic structures in reinforcement learning have been widely investigated, it is much less clear to what extent are choices shaped by a) individual differences in executive skills; b) contextual factors potentially interfering with such skills, such as knowing that the outcome of those choices will impact only on one's own vs. another's welfare. This a critical gap, since executive abilities are known to decline even in physiological ageing, thus potentially interfering with the quality of choices. On this ground, this single center non-interventional fMRI study aims to provide novel insights into the relationship between executive and decision-making skills, and their possible changes with ageing, in 150 healthy individuals. This goal will be pursued by combining a behavioral assessment of decision-making and executive skills with a multimodal fMRI session including data concerning a) brain activity associated with decision-making and executive functioning in social vs. non-social contexts, b) brain structural morphometry (grey-matter volume/density), and c) brain structural connectivity (diffusion weighted imaging). The behavioral assessment will involve the main metric of decision-making (e.g., risk aversion, loss aversion, delay discounting) and executive functioning (e.g., selective attention and inhibitory control). MRI data will unveil the neural bases of individual differences in decision-making and executive performance in terms of performance-related patterns of brain activity, structure and connectivity. Results will provide an useful baseline for investigating alterations of decision-making and executive functioning, and of their neural bases, in pathological conditions."

The global aim of this research program is to identify technical, attitudinal, and motivational obstacles and solutions for people with PD for adopting technology to improve gait and to quantify changes in gait biomechanics that will make participants better and safer walkers, ultimately improving physical function, physical activity, motivation, and quality of life. Specific objective: Among members of the PQ who meet the criteria for technology readiness and have sufficient walking capacity to use the Heel2ToeTM sensor at home, the objectives are to estimate the extent to which they: (1) require support from the technology and rehabilitation team to optimize use; (2) use the sensor; (3) and change gait pattern, walking behaviours, motivation and functional and quality of life indicators over a period of 3 months. Design: An individualized, blocked, stepped-wedge design will be used, a design favoured for implementation science questions 63,64 and applicable here as the team does not have the resources to implement the technology to all participants all at once. Parkinson Quebec has provided funds to provide sensors for 100 people. Variable size clusters of people will be formed and randomized to receive the Heel2Toe sensor, training, and remote supervised use, at intervals of 3 weeks.

The SENIOR RCT is a multicenter study conducted in two North Italian Scientific Hospitalization and Treatment Institution in Pavia on older malnourished adults (≥ 65 years old). The estimated duration is 24 months, which include 6 months of nutritional intervention and a follow-up after 6 months, with an preferred starting date on January 2024. The primary objective of the SENIOR RCT is the evaluation of the efficacy of a 6 months sustainable nutrition protocol on malnourished older adults participants (diagnosed with the most recent GLIM criteria) in comparison to the hospital standard of care. Therefore, the primary endpoint is the improvement of the nutritional status between pre- and post-intervention between experimental and control group measuring the change of body weight and strength (handgrip). Secondary objectives are the change pre- and post-intervention between experimental and control group for blood biomarkers, dietary habits, quality of life and evaluation of sarcopenia. Secondary endpoints are the change pre- and post-intervention between experimental and control group for blood biomarkers, MEDI-LITE score, SF-12, diet composition, phase angle and gait speed. Participants of this study are older adults over 65 previously enrolled in the SENIOR cross-sectional study and willing to participate to the RCT phase or new enrolled patients from the two hospitals in according to the eligible criteria. Malnutrition will be diagnosed according to GLIM criteria, using Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) as screening tool. The experimental group at the baseline will receive a nutritional assessment followed by the elaboration of a sustainable and personalized nutritional protocol by qualified dietitians. The intervention will last 6 months with a monthly evaluation of the dietary consumption of the previous 24 hour (recall-24h), followed by a final follow-up after additional 6 months. For both groups at the baseline will be measured blood biomarkers, anthropometric variables, Mediterranean diet adherence, quality of life, strength (handgrip) and locomotion (gait speed). At 3 months weight and strength will be evaluated. At 6- and 12-months baseline measurements will be repeated except for the nutritional assessment. Dietary habits will be evaluated through a Mediterranean diet questionnaire (MEDI-LITE), while quality of life will be measured with Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) questionnaire. Anthropometric variables include weight, height (knee height and demi-span), waist circumference, and body composition (BIA). In addition, strength (handgrip) and locomotion (gait speed) will be evaluated. Strength (handgrip), Appendicular Skeletal Mass (ASM) and locomotion (gait speed) are necessary to diagnose sarcopenia according to the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People 2 (EWGSOP2) consensus. Malnutrition will be evaluated again at 6 months. Blood analysis will be carried out on a subgroup to evaluate the participants' inflammatory, nutritional and clinical status."

Background: Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells that leads to destructive bone lesions, renal damage, anemia, and hypercalcemia. MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy. The American Cancer Society estimates that annually over 34,000 new cases of MM will occur in the U.S. and over 12,000 deaths due to MM in 2022. Overall survival (OS) has improved significantly over the past 20 years with the development of proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies. However, despite these advances, patients ultimately relapse requiring multiple subsequent lines of therapy. As MM evolves, it generally becomes more refractory, and patients ultimately succumb to their disease. With multiple lines of efficacious therapies, the correct early identification of relapsed disease is important to trigger initiation of a new line of therapy. Limitations in conventional imaging highlight a need for molecular imaging agents with better sensitivity for detecting and measuring tumor burden to improve staging and treatment selection for patients with MM and plasma cell dyscrasias. 18F-fluciclovine is a radionuclide approved by the FDA for evaluating suspected prostate cancer recurrence but has shown additional ability in detecting MM lesions. Objective: To determine the concordance between 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in participants with multiple myeloma Eligibility: Participants >= 18 years old Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0 to 2 Participants must have a documented diagnosis of MM defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG) Criteria Participants fit criteria for one of the following categories: Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) without previous treatment (or within the first 3 cycles of front-line treatment) Relapsed and/or Refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) with at least 1 prior line of therapy Design: This is an open-label, single center phase 2 study evaluating 18F-fluciclovine PET/CT imaging in up to 55 participants with multiple myeloma. Participants will be enrolled into one of two cohorts based on disease status; newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) participants will be enrolled into Cohort 1 and relapsed refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) participants will be enrolled into Cohort 2. All subjects will undergo an 18F-fluciclovine injection followed by a static whole-body PET/CT at three time points: Timepoint #1, Timepoint #2 (after induction for NDMM or at 6 months for RRMM) and Timepoint #3 (at progression or at 5 years). Results will be compared to 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging at those same timepoints.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, and demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the presence of demyelinating plaques in the brain and spinal cord. The disease is associated with a wide range of symptoms, including motor, sensory, visual, and cognitive impairments. Gait disturbance is one of the most common symptoms of MS. It is characterized by a slow walking speed, shortened stride length, and reduced arm swing. The arm swing is a complex movement that is controlled by the central nervous system. It is a dynamic movement that is affected by the walking speed, step length, and the presence of other neurological disorders. The arm swing is an important indicator of the walking ability and functional capacity of patients with MS. The aim of this study is to evaluate the arm swing during walking in patients with early MS and healthy controls. The study will also evaluate the functional mobility of patients with early MS."

Paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) is characterized by episodic shortness of breath that can range in severity and acuity. Symptoms may greatly impact daily life. Some patients experience severe respiratory distress, which can lead to emergency department visits and occasionally intubation. The standard treatment is typically behavioral therapy performed by speech and language pathologists. However, new evidence suggests that video biofeedback may be an effective alternative treatment. Video biofeedback allows patients to directly visualize their breathing while performing specific breathing exercises. This is a desirable treatment because it can be performed at the time of diagnosis and requires minimal additional time or resources. The investigators' goal is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the relative effectiveness of video biofeedback and behavioral therapy in the treatment of PVFM. The primary endpoint will be the change in Dyspnea Index score before treatment and one month after treatment. Patients will complete surveys to collate data about patient expectations of behavioral therapy, their reasons for pursuing additional treatment if applicable, and the perceived benefits of the specific intervention. The investigators hypothesize that no clinically meaningful difference will be detected between behavioral therapy and video biofeedback for the treatment of PVFM. This pilot RCT will provide critical data for designing a fully powered trial comparing these two interventions, and will advance the investigators' goal of providing clinicians with important evidence for guiding treatment."

Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to sleep disorders. In the context of critical illness and ICU admission, there is an intersection of factors contributing to this situation: pre-existing health conditions, severe acute illness, sleep-altering treatments (sedatives, analgesics, mechanical ventilation), psychiatric disorders, and the physical environment. In addition to the impact during hospitalization, the literature points to a long-term reduction in quality of life due to sleep disturbance. Recent studies following up on patients after ICU discharge reveal high rates of sleep disorders up to 6 months after hospital discharge - related or unrelated to new psychiatric disorders and even cognitive changes. Furthermore, sleep disorders are associated with an increased incidence of delirium in ICUs, which refers to altered consciousness and cognition in patients admitted to the intensive care environment, which are associated with worsened patient outcomes such as increased hospital stay and consequently the risk of fatal complications. The prevalence of delirium is around 70%, with an incidence of 89%. Delirium assessment in ICUs is usually performed daily. In order to improve the sleep quality of this population, there are modifiable factors, whether environmental (lighting, noise, general care), physiological (medications, ventilatory parameter adjustments), or psychological (anxiety, pain, absence of family members). Routines to control environmental factors in ICUs seem to have an impact on reducing the incidence of acute brain dysfunction - delirium - and could help prevent sleep disturbances in critically ill patients. These measures include dimming or reducing corridor lights at night, grouping (when possible) care activities at appropriate times, raising curtains, and encouraging mobilization during daytime shifts. For non-delirious patients, the use of earplugs and eye masks is also recommended. Therefore, the investigators have developed this research project with the aim of evaluating the implementation of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary protocol to promote an improvement in sleep quality in critically ill patients. The SPIRIT Protocol is a summary of recommendations for clinical trials, which was used as a support in this study. This is a multicenter clinical trial with a quasi-experimental design. The first step consists of assessing the sleep quality in sequential patients admitted to the ICU and characterizing the disruptive elements. After this period, the second step will involve sensitizing and training the multidisciplinary team about the importance of sleep for critically ill patients and providing training for the implementation of a multifaceted protocol of interventions to promote sleep quality improvement. Once the multidisciplinary protocol is implemented, the sleep quality of the patients and the clinical impact of this protocol will be reevaluated."

The R61 phase is a single-arm trial of S-ENG plus eCAU (n=30) with 1 week of smartphone-based target assessment at baseline, 8-weeks and 16-weeks. Participants are 30 adults age 60 and older who report clinically significant loneliness and suicide ideation and reside in a senior living community (SLC). We will use ambulatory assessment via smartphones, including both active self-report (ecological momentary assessment, EMA) and passive sensing (audio recordings & GPS) to comprehensively assess indices of social connection. Subjects will complete EMA recordings using a smartphone daily following 3 personally-selected times for prompts (to enhance recall and ease of completion of assessments) for 10-days prior to starting study interventions, beginning the day after the baseline visit. Each EMA instance takes approximately 2-5 minutes to complete. EMA will be integrated with other smartphone technology to passively capture social behavior. The Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) will passively measure social behavior (i.e., conversation frequency, duration, and valence). GPS- will track time outside the home. Subjects will be given a study smartphone designed for older adults to use during assessment periods. All subjects who successfully complete the smartphone assessment protocol at baseline will be assigned to S-ENG. S-ENG involves 10 individual coaching sessions over (up to) 4 months. S-ENG is a stepped, modular intervention that addresses barriers to action plan implementation and challenges in processing positive outcomes when exposed to socially rewarding activities. Psychoeducational materials address the importance of social connection.

Design details:
- Primary Purpose: Treatment
- Allocation: Non-Randomized
- Intervention Model: Sequential Assignment
- Interventional Model Description: Women with POI taking standard-dose estradiol hormone replacement therapy (E2/dydrogesterone (oral) (2.0/10 mg)) were invited to the study. We conducted a pilot study designed to compare the effectiveness of oral estradiol (2mg/ day) and Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% (Gel sachet 1.5mg/ day) as standard-dose estradiol hormone replacement therapy. The obtained results on the absence of a significant difference in the effect of the above therapy made it possible to justify the prescription of higher doses of estrogens without prior switching from oral to transdermal therapy in equivalent doses in all study participants. Study participants will consistently receive Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% (Gel sachet 1.5mg/ day) and Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% (Gel sachet 2.0mg/ day) (both with 200mg micronized progesterone administered vaginally for 14days per cycle) with an outcome assessment at each stage of the study.
- Masking: Single

Arms and Interventions:
- Other: Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% 1.5mg/ day
- Other: Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% 2.0mg/ day

What is the study measuring?
- Primary Outcome Measures:
  - Evaluation of the severity of estrogen deficiency symptoms: The Green scale questionnaire was used initially and after 3 months against the background of HRT. The questionnaire includes 21 questions from 0 to 3 points, where a lower score means a better result.
  - Changing the assessment of quality of life using the Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36): The SF-36 is a generic QoL instrument. It consists of 36 items organized into eight domains: Physical Function (AF), Physical Role Function (RF), Bodily Pain (BP), General Health (GH), Vitality (VT), Social Function (SF),"

The gut microbiome in rural Papua New Guinea (PNG) is more diverse than that of USA controls, and the species Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) was only detectable in PNG. Interestingly, L. reuteri was also regularly detected in humans in studies conducted around 1960, but is very rarely found in contemporary humans, suggesting a recent decline of the L. reuteri population in Westerners. L. reuteri is further convincingly linked to a wide range of health benefits, such as modulating immune function and stimulating immune cell development, and it produces tryptophan metabolites that modulate the immune system. These findings provide a clear rationale to test the immunological effects of a L. reuteri strain that originates from PNG and explore nutritional strategies to potentially enhance these effects by supporting the colonisation of this strain. The main objective of this study is to systematically compare the possible immunological effects of synbiotic supplementation with a probiotic, L. reuteri PB-W1™, and a prebiotic blend (comprising 50 % raffinose and 50 % xylooligosaccharide) with that of the probiotic and prebiotic alone and characterise the mechanistic and ecological foundations of any effects."

This study aims to measure the effect of urolithin A supplementation on endothelial function, cerebral blood flow regulation, and serum biomarkers of NO bioavailability and mitochondrial function in middle-aged adults with obesity. Briefly, 54 adults aged 40-64 years of age with a body mass index equal to or greater than 30 kg/m2 will be recruited to participate in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study for 4 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group will consume 1,000 mg of urolithin A daily in the form of softgel capsules, whereas those in the control group will consume a placebo. Data collection will occur at baseline (day 0) and endpoint (day 28). The investigators will compare outcomes between control and intervention group. Researchers expect that urolithin A supplementation in middle-aged adults with obesity improves endothelial function and cerebral blood flow regulation, and that this improvement is accompanied by changes in biomarkers of NO bioavailability and mitochondrial function."

The incidence of hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure is increasing, mainly due to acute HFpEF. It is hypothesized that systemic inflammation resulting from comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension is responsible for the pathogenesis of myocardial structural and functional changes in HFpEF. Therefore, assessment of clinical and anamnestic factors and their relationship with signs of structural changes, functional disorders of intracardiac hemodynamics, signs of congestion and systemic inflammation will help optimize the diagnostic and treatment algorithm for patients with acute decompensation of HFpEF. In this context, additional markers such as body composition measures, ultrasound congestion criteria, and cellular stress-related biomarkers may complement or even surpass traditional markers in predicting the severity and prognosis of HFpEF. The creation of a register and analysis of the data entered into it will help improve the comprehensive diagnosis of decompensated HFpEF."

The proposed regional mental healthcare hub aims to deliver equitable, efficacious, and cost-effective AI-driven online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific online cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) programs for post-secondary students in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington (KFL&A) region. The initiative will target a broad population of students ranging from those interested in learning more about mental health (online psychoeducation program) to those seeking additional help for their psychiatric symptoms (e-CBT program). Our research team is strongly experienced in designing effective AI-assisted online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs for various mental health conditions in diverse populations. Therefore, being as effective as in-person methods of healthcare delivery, it is hypothesized that our online interventions disseminated via a robust implementation science and community collaboration strategy will be a feasible, cost-effective, and pragmatic solution to address accessibility issues with post-secondary student mental healthcare. The proposed mental health hub will offer a comprehensive care model using a stepped-care approach. Its implementation will be guided by a rigorous approach involving seven aims divided into three phases (pre-adoption, delivery, and post-adoption phases). (1) Pre-adoption phase: will assess post-secondary students' current mental health landscape through surveys and focus groups (Aim 1). This information will be used in the development of a 6-week online psychoeducation (Aim 2) and 12-week diagnosis-specific e-CBT (Aim 3) programs. The psychoeducation program will be followed by 6-months of AI-assisted journaling exercises to monitor the student's mental health and determine whether they would benefit from stepping up their care to receive the diagnosis-specific e-CBT program. The diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs will be adapted from prior clinically validated and diagnosis-specific psychotherapy modules developed by the lab. Four diagnosis-specific modules will support the most common mental health disorders in students (GAD, SAD, MDD and ADHD), as indicated by previous studies and the research team's cross-sectional survey of students in Ontario, Canada. Both programs will be delivered through the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT) - a secure cloud-based platform co-developed by the PI that offers online mental health interventions. (2) Delivery phase: will determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the online psychoeducation (Aim 4) and diagnosis-specific e-CBT (Aim 5) programs by comparing them to treatment, as usual, using validated clinical assessment tools. (3) Post-adoption phase: will use the collected data to monitor the success and fidelity of the programs using surveys and focus groups (Aim 6), and to build capacity and scale the project to other Canadian municipalities (Aim 7). As such, in contrast to other initiatives that target student mental health, this will be the first to involve students and end-users in all phases, from conception to implementation. The digital nature of this healthcare program and the implementation of AI technology results in new solutions that enable easier accessibility and broader reach to individuals in significant need of mental healthcare services. Therefore, to support the development of these mental healthcare resources, the research team has assembled a diverse, cross-functional interdisciplinary team of community leaders, including researchers, clinicians, health decision-makers, and end-users. Ultimately, leveraging the extensive expertise of a cross-functional research team, the objective of the study is to develop and implement a successful and effective digital care plan with the potential to improve post-secondary student mental health care substantially."

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases. It is typically characterized by a left-to-right shunt which results in volume overload of the right ventricle and overcirculation of the pulmonary vascularization (le Gloan et al., 2018). This may further result in arrhythmia, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary hypertension is caused by endothelial dysfunction, remodelling of the pulmonary vascularization, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventually causes shunt reversal into right-to-left (Eisenmenger's syndrome). At this point, closure of the defect is contraindicated. Small LV, although less extensively studied than dilated LV, also implies impaired LV function. Small LV means less tolerance to volume overload, which in turn impairs cardiac output and presents higher risk of heart failure and mortality (Saito et al., 2021). ASD closure in cases with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents a clinical challenge. Complete closure may cause pulmonary hypertensive crisis and low cardiac output syndrome; however, if left untreated, the disease progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases, which may also lead to Eisenmenger's syndrome and shunt reversal. Today, this condition is treated with fenestrated closure, either with patch or fenestrated septal occluder. The fenestration is hypothesized to provide protective effect against pulmonary hypertensive crisis because it allows blood to flow from right to left heart. The added volume into the left heart is then, hypothesized, to provide volume training for the left heart, mainly in the case of small LV. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of fenestrated closure compared to non- fenestrated closure to the left ventricular size at systole and diastole."

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of whole-body hypothermia and targeted normothermia in babies with mild hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy. The study will recruit babies born at or after 36 weeks of gestation with birth weight of 1800g or more with birth acidosis or requiring resuscitation at birth. The babies will be screened for eligibility using a structured neurological examination performed between 1 to 6 hours after birth. Once parental consent is obtained, babies will be randomised to whole-body hypothermia or targeted normothermia within 6 hours of birth, using a web-based program. The babies in both arms, who are born at a non-cooling centre (LNU or SCBU) will be then transferred to the nearest cooling centre (NICU) for continued care at earliest. Whole-body hypothermia (33.5±0.5°C) will be initiated within 6 hours of birth and continued for 72 hours using a servo-controlled cooling machine. The duration and depth of cooling will be as per the current standards for babies undergoing hypothermia with moderate or severe HIE in the NHS. After 72 hours of whole-body hypothermia at 33.5±0.5°C, the baby will be rewarmed at 0.5°C per hour to reach 36.5±0.5°C over 8 hours. Two hourly rectal temperature data will be collected for the first 80 hours. For babies randomised to normothermia, the rectal temperature will be maintained at 36.5±0.5°C using servo-controlled incubators for the first 80 hours and any hyperthermia will be treated with a standardised protocol. Rectal temperature will be recorded every 2 hours for the first 80 hours. Conventional MRI using standard 3D T1-weighted and 2D T2-weighted sequences and diffusion weighted imaging will be performed in all babies prior to discharge home. The follow-up assessment will be done for the recruited babies at 24 (±2) months of age by a central team of 2 to 3 examiners, masked to the allocation. The assessment will be carried out using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development IV. In addition, all infants will have a detailed neurological examination, including Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) for cerebral palsy, vision, and hearing assessment. Babies who die (the mortality rate is expected to be less than 1% in mild HIE) or who cannot be assessed with the Bayley-IV due to severe disability will be allocated a Cognitive Scale Composite score one point below the basal test score (i.e., score of 54) similar to the previous whole-body hypothermia trials. In all infants, PARCA-R (online or face to face) will be completed by the parents immediately prior to the Bayley IV assessments and CBCL (face to face only). The follow up visit will be scheduled in close consultation with the parents, either at the local hospital or at home. The data will be collected into a paper case report form (CRF) initially and then entered into electronic database at the participating sites. Data will include ante-natal, birth, and neonatal clinical information including gestational age, birth weight, gender, Apgar scores, birth history, delivery room resuscitation to assess the baseline comparability of the groups, core body temperature for assessment of intervention, details of the hospital course, laboratory investigations and MR imaging for safety monitoring, and neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years for primary outcome evaluation."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pTTL, a novel T cell immunotherapy, in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). pTTL is an autologous cell product for adoptive cancer immunotherapy containing in vitro expanded T cells stimulated with patient-specific tumour neoantigens derived from tumour-draining lymph nodes (RLNs). The study is composed of 3 parts, referred to as Part I, Part II and Part III. Patients will be consented separately for Part I and for Part II/III: a first consent is given for tissue collection and pTTL production, and a second consent is given for pTTL treatment, including pre-conditioning chemotherapy and follow-up. Part I of the trial entails patient identification, recruitment and screening of trial patients. It also comprises production of pTTL, which is performed in 3 steps: Collection of tumour samples and normal samples for NGS and neoantigen selection. Production of stimulatory NAG-coupled beads raw material TC0301. Collection of starting material for pTTL manufacturing from RLN. pTTL manufacturing. The time required from collection of tumour material and RLNs up until pTTL production and administration to the patient is approximately 8 to 12 weeks. The RLN starting material is cryopreserved after initial processing, enabling flexibility in the timing of pTTL administration. Part II of the trial entails pre-conditioning and supportive care therapy, treatment with pTTL, and 26 weeks safety follow-up. Pre-conditioning contains cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and will be administered between Day -7 and Day -5 before scheduled pTTL administration. Supportive care treatment will start on Day -9 or Day -8. pTTL administration will normally be administered on Day 1, with the option of administration on Day -3 if cell expansion kinetics during pTTL production indicates this would be preferable. Part II will end when the last treated patient has been followed for 26 weeks or earlier in case of death or patient withdrawal. Part III of the trial is a long-term follow-up initiated after completion of the initial 26 weeks safety follow-up period. Patients will participate in Part III for up to 4.5 years after end of Part II or until death, whichever comes first. pTTL DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION The drug product (DP), i.e. pTTL, is composed of in vitro expanded RLN cells, enriched for neoantigen-specific T cells. It is formulated as a cell suspension with the excipients NaCl (9 mg/mL) and human serum albumin (25 mg/mL) in a transfusion bag intended for intravenous transfusion. The product is administered fresh. Each patient will receive a single administration of pTTL.The cell dose obtained during the manufacturing process will vary depending on the size of the neoantigen-reactive clones present in the starting material and their proliferative capacity. The minimum dose of a pTTL unit is 20 million viable cells and the maximum dose is 1 billion viable cells."

The purpose of this study is to determine the role of serum amyloid A (SAA) in the diagnosis and prognosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis. SAA is a marker of inflammation and is elevated in many inflammatory conditions. It is also elevated in sarcoidosis, but its role in the diagnosis and prognosis of sarcoidosis is not well understood.
In this study, we will measure the serum concentration of SAA in patients with intrathoracic sarcoidosis and compare it to the serum concentration of SAA in healthy controls. We will also measure the serum concentration of SAA in patients with intrathoracic sarcoidosis at different stages of the disease and in patients with different patterns of disease on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT). We will also measure the serum concentration of SAA in patients with intrathoracic sarcoidosis at the time of diagnosis and compare it to the serum concentration of other biomarkers of granulomatous inflammation and pulmonary interstitial disease. We will also measure the serum concentration of SAA in patients with intrathoracic sarcoidosis at the time of diagnosis and compare it to the results of lung function tests and the extent of disease on HRCT. We will also measure the serum concentration of SAA in patients with intrathoracic sarcoidosis at the time of diagnosis and compare it to the changes in lung function tests and the changes in HRCT disease extent after 3 years of follow-up. Finally, we will measure the serum concentration of SAA in patients with intrathoracic sarcoidosis at the time of diagnosis and compare it to the need for recent/ongoing therapy after 3 years of follow-up.
The results of this study will help us understand the role of SAA in the diagnosis and prognosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis and may lead to the development of new diagnostic and prognostic tools for this disease."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the benefit of early intrauterine transfer of blank culture medium prior to transfer of a thawed embryo from the first IVF attempt.
In the context of a first IVF attempt, the transfer of a thawed embryo is often performed after a period of 2 to 3 days of culture in the laboratory. This period of culture is necessary to allow the embryo to develop and reach a stage of development that is compatible with the transfer. However, this period of culture is also associated with a risk of embryo loss.
The hypothesis of this study is that the transfer of a thawed embryo after a period of culture in the laboratory is not necessary and that the transfer of a thawed embryo without culture in the laboratory would be as effective as the transfer of a thawed embryo after a period of culture in the laboratory.

The study was planned to examine the effect of acupressure on back pain in the late postpartum period after cesarean section. The hypothesis was that acupressure application applied to puerperant women who had a cesarean delivery in the late postpartum period has no effect on reducing the level of back pain. The study was designed as a randomized controlled experimental study. The sample size of the study was calculated as 23 in the acupressure group and 23 in the control group. A total of 70 (Acupressure group: 35, control group: 35 participants) participants will be included in the study, taking into account possible data losses. In which group the participants included in the study will be, will be determined from the website of the random number generation program Research Randomizer, and they will be divided into two groups. Thus, each participants' number and group number will be determined and recorded. Data will be collected with the Introductory Information Form and VAS for assessing back pain. The VAS will be filled in by the participants to evaluate late postpartum back pain. The VAS will be filled in by the participants before and after the application. No application will be made to the control group and only routine care will be given. An environment where privacy can be protected and away from external stimuli will be prepared for the participants. The application will be started by choosing the most comfortable position for the participants, leaving the application points open. For this study, 6 points (a total of 12 points on both sides from each point) were determined for this study, and these points are LI4, which is the 4th point of the large intestine meridian, Zhong Zu HT2 point, which is on the triple heater meridian, and Quchi, the 11th point of the large intestine meridian. /LI11, the 36th point of the stomach meridian is ST36, the 21st point of the gallbladder meridian is Jian Jing GB21, the 43rd point of the bladder meridian is UB 43. In addition, expert opinion was taken to determine the points. The practitioner will apply 15 seconds of warming, relaxing, and preparatory quality to the area of each of the notes, respectively, and lightly rubbing to reduce tension and tissue sensitivity. A total of 3 minutes will be spent preparing for all points. After the preparation, acupressure will be applied to each point for a total of 12 minutes for all points for 1 minute. Thumb, index and/or middle finger will be used in acupressure application. Consecutive, breathing rhythm compressions will be repeated without raising the finger. Repeated compressions will be at a frequency that does not disturb the person, does not cause pain and has a calming effect. Although there is a difference in the order of use of the determined acupressure points, this study will be carried out symmetrically to the LI4, HT2, LI11, ST36, GB21, UB43 points, respectively. The data of the study will be evaluated using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 program. All data will first be evaluated with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for conformity to normal distribution, and then analyzed according to conformity to normal distribution. For descriptive statistics, percentages will be used in general, arithmetic mean±standard deviation for those suitable for normal distribution, median and minimum-maximum values for those that do not fit. Comparisons between groups for numerical variables of socio-demographic and clinical characteristics will be made with an independent two-sample t-test for normally distributed variables, and Mann-Whitney U test for non-normally distributed variables. Pearson Correlation test will be applied to determine the relationship between the fatigue severity of the experimental group and the tests and to determine the relationship between the tests.

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. The diagnosis of narcolepsy is based on the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, and the exclusion of other sleep disorders. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) sleep in a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). The gold standard for the diagnosis of narcolepsy is the in-patient clinical testing with polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT). However, this is not always feasible or practical.
The Dreem headband is a non-invasive, portable, and wearable device that can record EEG, ECG, EMG, and accelerometry. The Dreem headband has been validated in healthy volunteers and in patients with sleep disorders.
The aim of this study is to assess the ability of the Dreem headband to accurately diagnose narcolepsy and demonstrate response to treatment.
The study will recruit 20 patients with narcolepsy and 20 healthy volunteers. The patients will be recruited from the GSTT sleep service. The healthy volunteers will be recruited from the general population.
The patients will be asked to wear the Dreem headband for 7 days at home. The healthy volunteers will be asked to wear the Dreem headband for 3 days at home.
The data collected by the Dreem headband will be analysed by a sleep specialist. The diagnosis of narcolepsy will be based on the presence of excessive daytime sleepiness and cataplexy, and the exclusion of other sleep disorders. The diagnosis will be confirmed by the presence of sleep onset rapid eye movement (SOREM) sleep in a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).
The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of the Dreem headband in diagnosing narcolepsy will be compared to the gold standard in-patient clinical testing with polysomnography and multiple sleep latency test (MSLT).
The study will also assess the ability of the Dreem headband to demonstrate response to treatment in patients with narcolepsy.
The study will provide valuable information on the use of the Dreem headband in the diagnosis and management of narcolepsy."

Low back pain (LBP) is a common musculoskeletal disorder and today it is known that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence and intensity of LBP. This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time, next to reduced level of physical activity. Most people sit for a long hours in a slumped sitting posture. Prolonged sitting causes changes in the passive structures of the spine and induces a low back compressive load significantly higher than that observed in standing. Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Periodic rest breaks have been identified as a way to reduce self-report discomfort at the low back and a standing breaks may be beneficial for the passive tissues of the spine. A combination of sitting and standing is beneficial for reducing musculoskeletal discomfort. Research aim: The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP. Methods: This will be a randomized controlled study with pre and post-intervention assessment. The participants will be recruited from students. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group consisting of an active break (n = 25) or the control group (n = 25). The group with an active break with postural change from sitting to standing will be recommended to take an active break for every 30 minutes of sitting. The primary outcome will be average pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), disability measured using the Oswestry Disability Index and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting (Borg scale) and The Global Perceived Effect (7-point Likert scale). Secondary outcome will Post-Intervention Questionnaire (5-item self-completed questionnaire). Expected outcomes: Research outcomes - exercise protocol and intervention - will be developed to match the needs of young people with LBP and the possibilities of the environment, in order to reduce LBP and musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting, and consequently, maintain health and quality of life. The intervention will address the social and health needs of a particular social group: young people, with the possibility of extending the recommendations to other groups. Research outcomes will build evidence-based practice for students, teachers, health professionals, personal trainers, and family doctors."

The vaginal microbiota has a significant bearing on a woman's mental and physical health at every stage of life. A balanced microflora of the vaginal environment (eubiosis) consists of a predominant presence of lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacilli ensure the maintenance of an acidic pH that effectively makes the environment inhospitable to pathogens by preventing infection and protecting the genital tract. At the end of the reproductive period, the reduction of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, results in a decrease in the lactobacillus component with consequent depletion of the vaginal microbiota and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential human nutrient found mainly in oily fruits. It is a fat-soluble molecule with high antioxidant power. Topically administered, it not only plays a key role in protecting epithelial cell membranes from oxidative damage but is also able to modulate bacterial growth by contributing to pH acidification. The latter feature, in the vaginal canal, creates a favorable environment for the lactobacilli flora, positively affecting the microbial population and thus contributing to the prevention of all those problems related to increased vaginal sensitivity to pathogens during menopause. In addition, recent data show that vitamin E can counteract the production of biofilm produced by certain pathogens, which has detrimental effects on the homeostasis of the vaginal environment. The period of observation is from January 1st, 2020 to December, 31st, 2022, while the Data Collection period will be from June, 30th, 2023 to July, 31st, 2023."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of LSD on patients with end-stage fatal disease. The study is a randomized, double-blind, active-placebo controlled phase II study. The study will be conducted in a palliative care unit in a hospital in Germany.
The study will include 100 patients with end-stage fatal disease. The patients will be randomized to either the treatment arm or the control arm. The treatment arm will receive 100 or 200 μg LSD per os. The control arm will receive 25 μg LSD per os. The study will be conducted in two sessions, each separated by 2 weeks.
The primary outcome measure is the change in state anxiety assessed by questionnaire (state anxiety inventory, STAI-S) compared with active placebo. Secondary outcome measures include changes in pain levels, opioid use, spiritual well-being, demoralization, quality of life, and caregiver burden. The study will also assess the burden of suffering, subjective changes after intervention, and adverse events."

The purpose of this study is to determine whether a text messaging program can improve health behaviours during pregnancy.
The study will recruit 1,000 pregnant women at 15 weeks gestation or earlier, who are at risk of suboptimal weight gain and inadequate prenatal care. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the SmartMom text messaging program or a control text messaging program.
The SmartMom program will provide participants with evidence-based information to promote healthy behaviours during pregnancy. The control program will provide participants with general information about pregnancy.
The study will measure the impact of the SmartMom program on health behaviours, including weight gain, prenatal care attendance, and health knowledge. It will also measure the impact on mental health, including depression, anxiety, and fear of childbirth.
The study will also measure the cost-effectiveness of the SmartMom program compared to the control program."
