The aim of the study is to highlight possible psychosocial clusters of variables that are specific to the onset and maintenance for each condition (FM, CM, and VU). Specifically, the observation of possible clusters will be made based on variables such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences. The hypothesis is that specific psychological factors (clusters of high number of early traumatic events, high levels of central sensitization, and specific traits and defense mechanisms) characterize FM, CM, and VU groups compared to controls.
The study involves the administration of a protocol of self-report questionnaires consisting of two parts: the main (about 25 minutes for the administration) and the optional one (additional 20 minutes). This decision stems from the realization of the length of the protocol, to increase the collection of data in pursuit of the main objective of the study (cluster analysis).
The main part of the protocol includes the following questionnaires:
Central Sensitivity Inventory (CSI)
Traumatic Experiences Checklist (TEC)
Personality traits (PID-5)
Defense Mechanisms (DMRS-SR-30)
Mental pain (Mental Pain Questionnaire)
Environmental sensitivity (Highly Sensitive Person Scale)
The optional part of the protocol includes the following questionnaires:
Psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and psychosomatics (Brief Symptom Inventory)
Physical and Psychological Quality of life index (SF-12)
Alexithymic traits (Toronto Alexithymia Scale)
Perceived Social Support (SPQ)
Sexual Satisfaction (SSS)
Sexual Functioning (FSFI)
gentipolvic pain (SF-MGQ)
The study will involve the recruitment of 100 women diagnosed with FM, 100 women diagnosed with CM, 100 women diagnosed with VU, and 100 women from the general population with no chronic pain condition.
The study will be conducted in the clinical department of the University of Padua."

Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by insulin deficiency. T1DM is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. In the 10th Diabetes Atlas (2021) data of the International Diabetes Association (IDF), it is stated that the population of children aged 19 and under is 2.61 billion in the world, approximately 1.2 million of these children have T1DM, and there are approximately 150 thousand new children diagnosed with T1DM every year in the world. In the same report, it was stated that there are approximately 26 thousand children aged 19 and under with T1DM in Turkey. T1DM, whose treatment and management is complex, causes both children and their parents to encounter many problems. These problems cause deterioration in quality of life and perceived well-being in children with T1DM. The problems experienced in this direction, adaptation problems and decreased quality of life lead to deterioration of metabolic control in children with T1DM. Children with T1DM who cannot adapt to their disease may have acute and chronic complications that lead to deterioration of metabolic control. One of the most important complications seen in children with T1DM is osteopenia, which tends to increase gradually. Proper nutrition, physical activity, insulin therapy and follow-up of complications have an important place in preventing complications that may develop in children with T1DM, ensuring metabolic control and increasing their quality of life. Exercise in T1DM; reducing the need for insulin and increasing its effect, providing blood glucose control, increasing muscle strength, providing weight control, increasing body fat and muscle mass, increasing body fluid ratio, increasing bone mineralization, positively affecting the cardiovascular system, reducing blood fats, increasing self-conditioning, It provides many benefits such as increasing confidence and reducing stress. Despite the numerous benefits of exercise, studies have shown that children with T1DM do not exercise regularly and do not want to do traditional (walking, running, cycling, swimming, etc.) exercises. In this direction, exercise that requires continuity in diabetes management can be made dynamic for children with T1DM by using different approaches. For this reason, it is thought that structured exercise with"

The Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model that is universally thought to improve health, and it is known that the Mediterranean diet has beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases. The Mediterranean diet is rich in foods containing monounsaturated fat (especially omega-3), antioxidant vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, C, E, folic acid, selenium, zinc, calcium), which are thought to have positive effects on the prevention and course of MS. Preferring vegetable oils instead of animal fats in Mediterranean type diet, preferring fish instead of red meat consumption, preferring low-fat / fat-free milk and dairy products, limiting the intake of simple sugar and refined carbohydrates, increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in pulp and antioxidants. It is thought that this type of nutrition may positively affect the course and treatment of immune diseases by reducing inflammation. Although there is no effective clinical evidence for the application of nutritional support as complementary therapy in MS patients, it is known that patients often use various nutritional supplements to reduce symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. It is also important to determine the frequency of current nutritional support use in order to prevent unconscious use of nutritional support in the group. Because the most common symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, individuals with MS are often less physically active than age-matched adults All these negativities result in decreased functional activities, loss of mobility and balance problems. Walking and, in a broader sense, mobility are functions that are frequently affected in MS and have a high negative impact on quality of life. Gait problems are not uncommon in MS, and it is reported that a significant portion of individuals in this group are adversely affected by their daily living activities. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters."

Overactive bladder (OAB) is a common condition in which the bladder muscle contracts involuntarily, causing a sudden urge to urinate. OAB is a chronic condition that can be debilitating and negatively impact quality of life. There are several treatment options for OAB, including behavioral therapy, medications, and surgery. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to OAB treatment, and the optimal treatment for an individual patient depends on a variety of factors.
One factor that can influence treatment choice is the patient's cultural and linguistic background. Patients from diverse backgrounds may have different preferences and values when it comes to treatment options. For example, some patients may prefer a treatment that is less invasive or has fewer side effects, while others may prioritize effectiveness or convenience.
To address this issue, the investigators will conduct a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to assess the preferences of a diverse group of OAB patients for different treatment options. The DCE will involve asking patients to choose between two hypothetical treatment options, each with different characteristics. The investigators will use the results of the DCE to develop a decision aid that can help patients make informed choices about OAB treatment.
The investigators will also conduct a qualitative study to explore the experiences of OAB patients from diverse backgrounds. The qualitative study will involve in-depth interviews with patients to understand their experiences with OAB and their preferences for treatment options.
The results of this study will help to develop a more patient-centered approach to OAB treatment, taking into account the diverse needs and preferences of patients from different backgrounds."

Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most common cancer in men. The standard of care for localized PCa is surgery or radiotherapy. The main goal of radiotherapy is to deliver a high dose of radiation to the prostate while sparing the surrounding organs. The most common side effects of radiotherapy are urinary and rectal toxicity.
The investigators hypothesize that a dose escalation on the dominant lesion (DIL) of the prostate could improve the local control of the disease.
The investigators propose to perform a phase I/II study of fractionated stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) with focal boost on the DIL of the prostate.
The investigators will enroll 30 patients with localized PCa. The investigators will perform a dose escalation study to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the focal boost.
The investigators will perform a 3+3 design. The investigators will start with a dose of 45 Gy in 5 fractions of 9 Gy to the DIL. If 0 of 3 patients experience a grade 3 or higher toxicity, the investigators will increase the dose to 50 Gy in 5 fractions of 10 Gy. If 1 of 3 patients experiences a grade 3 or higher toxicity, the investigators will decrease the dose to 45 Gy in 5 fractions of 9 Gy.
The investigators will perform a 2-year follow-up to assess the local control and biochemical progression-free survival."

The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a serious game (SG) as an e-health intervention for young people with asthma. The study will be conducted in two groups of 10-12 years old children with controlled asthma. The first group will play the SG, the second group will follow the standard treatment plan. The SG will be projected with a 4K projector and controlled by the child's movements, which will be tracked in markerless mode using Azure's Kinect sensor. SG will include an adaptive tool to enable the experience based on the child's specific motor skills. The dynamics of SG will be adapted by considering real motor and physiological data acquired during each SG session via a wristband. These data are necessary to keep the child in the aerobic zone (60-80% of maximum heart rate). The movements are: Side bending: Moving an obstacle to open a passage. High jump: Overcoming a low, frontal obstacle. Side lunge: Avoiding a side obstacle. Squat: Passing under a low, frontal obstacle. The SG will be played in a group of 2-3 children, with the support of a physiotherapist. The SG will be played for 30 minutes, 3 times a week, for 6 months.

The investigators aim to determine the optimal time to wean infants born at < 30 weeks gestational age (GA) off continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). The investigators hypothesize that weaning CPAP at 32 weeks GA (vs. 34 weeks GA) will result in a lower rate of CPAP/non-invasive ventilation (NIV) weaning failure, a lower rate of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and a shorter length of hospital stay. The investigators will conduct a multicenter, randomized control trial involving premature neonates born between 23 0/7 and 29 6/7 weeks gestational age. The trial will take place in four Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs) within the Rady Children's/University of California, San Diego network, including Rady Children's Hospital - San Diego, Jacobs Medical Center, Scripps La Jolla (Rady NICU) and Rancho Springs (Rady NICU). The investigators aim to recruit 130 infants, a target sample size determined based on retrospective data from all of the participating units. Examination of CPAP failure rates in babies < 28 weeks who were weaned off CPAP before 34 weeks CGA revealed a 62.5% failure rate, whereas those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 34 weeks CGA exhibited a 26.7% failure rate. Thus, the investigators selected 34 weeks CGA as the time point for maintaining CPAP in babies < 28 weeks GA. For infants > 28 weeks, the retrospective review demonstrated a 76% failure rate if weaned off CPAP before 32 weeks, while those who remained on CPAP at or beyond 32 weeks showed an 11% failure rate. Consequently, the investigators chose 32 weeks CGA as the designated time point for continuing CPAP in babies with a GA of 28-30 weeks. The sample size calculation employed a two-independent- study-group design with a primary endpoint of a binomial outcome (failed CPAP wean, yes/no).

Cleft lip and palate, which affects 0.5-1.6 out of every 1000 live births, is the most prevalent congenital defect of the head and neck. When the palatal shelves and the medial nasal process fail to fuse together between the fourth and eighth weeks of development, unilateral cleft lip and palate results. Lip muscles are disrupted and abnormally inserted to the columellar base on the non-cleft side and from the alar base on the cleft side. The nasal floor and alveolus on the cleft side may be deficient or absent. Several approaches, including quadrangular flaps, triangular flaps, and rotation-advancement procedures, were established in the middle of the twentieth century.
The first known cleft-lip repair was a straight-line suture and a simple cut along the cleft borders, followed by a curved incision to lengthen the lip. Drawbacks of straight-line restorations included vertical lip contraction and lip notching. Tennison-triangular Randall's approach, which relies on mathematical calculations and lessens vertical lip contraction, is the most popular triangular technique, however the scar violates the philtrum.
The Millard rotation-advancement approach was created to align the scar with the philtral column naturally occurring. The initial rotation-advancement technique underwent various variations. Vermilion notching and a scar along the philtral line can be noticed in Millard's repair. The Cupid's bow is distorted and the white roll up is pulled up by scar contracture.
Mishra provided a modification to Millard's technique to create the vermilion and white roll on the medial lip segment. If there is medial hypoplastic vermilion or partial medial vermilion loss, the Mishra procedure is also used.
Anthropometric Evaluation of surgical technique and comparison of cleft and non-cleft sides are two benefits of measuring surgical outcome. Farkas and colleagues, provided normative measurements of the lip and nose. Qualitative Assessment is subjective assessment and can analyze facial aesthetics and appearance impairment using scales, indices, scoring systems, and rankings.

Diverticulitis is a common condition in western countries with relatively uncommon complications. Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal, colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely, accounting for 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease. Herein we describe a case of a fistula connecting the sigmoid colon with the left flank-lower lumbar area, due to diverticulitis of the sigmoid colon. A new over-the-scope clip system, called OTSC (Ovesco Endoscopy, Tübingen, Germany), appeared on the market about 3 years ago. The system consists of a nitinol clip loaded at the tip of the endoscope that can capture a large amount of tissue and compress the lesion until healed. Results from animal models and initial clinical use support the efficacy of OTSC closure in the treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding; its role in the management of iatrogenic perforations in humans is less defined, and reports on its use in treating colorectal postsurgical leaks and fistulas are anecdotal. Here we report on the use of OTSC in the endoscopic treatment of colo-cutaneous fistula as a complication of acute diverticulitis."

Heart failure (HF) is a chronic condition where the heart muscle is no longer able to supply the body with enough oxygen and nutrients. This can lead to fatigue and poor quality of life. Often, people do not know they have heart failure until they end up in hospital. This study wants to improve the screening of heart failure and identify patients at risk for heart failure earlier. This will help determine if early-screening and treatment can help prevent further decline in these patients. This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months.

The PHYSIOSCORE is a scale developed to assess the complexity level and physical therapy care in hospitalized patients. The scale was developed in two phases. Phase 1 was performed by a committee of ten physical therapists with more than ten years of experience in hospital care. The questionnaires were developed based on variables used in clinical practice. The committee agreed that the scale needed to meet four objectives: (i) be composed of variables used by physical therapists working in the hospital; (ii) have valid content for hospitalized adult patients; (iii) be viable (fast and easy to use); and (iv) have inter-examiner reliability. In the first meeting, every committee member was asked to report relevant variables. After that, the committee was asked to classify each informed variable as unimportant, important, or essential for the physical therapy assessment to provide quality care to the patient during hospitalization. The validity of this construct was performed using the Delphi technique14,15, and the consensus was defined with a minimum percentage of at least 75% agreement as important or essential. Only the items that reached consensus were retained for the second round. In the second round, the committee members were asked to re-evaluate each item and classify them on a 10-point numerical scale. Where the score 0 represented the item within the normal range and 5, 7, or 10 points, depending on the item analyzed, the condition that most deviated from normality and consequently would result in greater attention and greater complexity of physical therapy care (Appendix B). The consensus was defined with a minimum percentage of at least 75% agreement among the participants for each item. The final version of the PHYSIOSCORE was composed of 106 items, divided into three domains: respiratory, imaging, and neuromuscular. For patients with spontaneous breathing or noninvasive mechanical ventilation, the PHYSIOSCORE consisted of six items: pulmonary function, pulmonary sound, need for airway clearance, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2), respiratory rate (f), and imaging examination. For patients on invasive mechanical ventilation, the PHYSIOSCORE was also composed of six items: pulmonary sound, PaO2/FiO2 ratio, patient-mechanical ventilator interaction, measurements"

Background:
Human papillomavirus (HPV) positive oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a highly curable disease with excellent overall survival rates of 70-100% at 3 years. These outcomes are dependent on disease burden and patient characteristics and independent of treatment modality. Significant treatment related side effects exist despite advances in radiotherapy technology, surgical techniques, and supportive care. In addition to common acute toxicities, their favorable overall survival potentially places these patients at increased risk for developing long-term treatment-induced side-effects. Therefore, it is important to establish novel management approaches that maintain excellent current clinical outcomes while effectively reducing acute and long-term side effects.
The de-escalation trials for surgical management have explored various combinations of dose-reduction, while preserving favorable oncologic outcomes for patients. Prospective trials have demonstrated efficacy, safety, and functional benefit following treatment reduction to the primary tumor, regional lymph node metastasis, and the elective nodal volume. Therefore, newer approaches of combining the treatment modifications from each of these treatment fields offer the potential to have substantial harm reduction for future patients.
Cell free HPV tumor DNA (ctDNA) has emerged as a method to monitor the presence of disease and is a promising biomarker. Changes in expression of ctDNA post treatment with TransOral Robotic Surgery (TORS) or radiation therapy (RT) with or without chemotherapy are observed and clearance of ctDNA is associated with a favorable prognosis. These promising findings have led several groups to initiate clinical trials evaluating observation in patients after definitive oropharyngeal cancer removal and subsequent clearance of ctDNA levels. Data suggests that patients who initially undergo observation following TORS have similar rates of distant metastases and favorable rates of salvage. To date, an observation-based approach has not been adopted for intermediate risk patients due to challenges identifying optimal cohorts for observation and concern for increased treatment related toxicity for patients who do require salvage.
In this trial, the investigators propose use of ctDNA clearance to identify patients who are optimal for observation. This protocol tests the hypothesis that patients currently recommended for adjuvant RT based on intermediate risk factors can be observed"

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a chronic malignancy with no current cure. Previously dependent on myeloablative chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation to induce prolonged remission, recent advances in targeted therapies are enhancing overall survival and extending the duration between treatments. Monoclonal antibodies, including CD38-directed monoclonal antibodies, combination immunotherapies, and T-cell therapies are among the many promising agents for treating relapsed or refractory (R/R) MM. This improvement in treatment outcomes is accompanied by significant risk for toxicities such a neutropenia and subsequent infections which themselves can be life-threatening. Several studies indicate a high symptom burden and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) for individuals with multiple myeloma, with most of what is known from clinical trials of highly selective populations or qualitative studies conducted outside of the US among mostly white patients. These factors, coupled with the rapidly changing multiple myeloma treatment landscape, limits the generalizability to wider population as well as an understanding of MM's impact across the disease course. A more complete investigation of the symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among patients with multiple myeloma is urgently needed to provide a comprehensive view of the ways in which multiple myeloma and its treatments affects individuals' lives. The purpose of this study is to explore the use of symptom monitoring and digital life coaching (DLC) to inform a more complete understanding of the impact of multiple myeloma on symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among a diverse U.S.-based, contemporary sample. The benefits of routine symptom monitoring have been demonstrated in recent studies, where overall survival increased among cancer patients who routinely monitored their symptoms. As the science related to symptom monitoring continues to evolve, exploring interventions to support both the assessment of and interventions related to disease and treatment-related sequelae it is important to identify how symptoms can best be monitored and managed. Studies to date have explored how symptom monitoring can be conducted for patients in the ambulatory setting, where patients do not receive around the clock assessment and management as they would in"

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic relapsing disease of the gastrointestinal tract, characterized by inflammation and loss of function. The pathophysiology of IBD is not fully understood, but it is known that the gut microbiota plays an important role. A healthy gut microbiota is essential for the development and function of the immune system, and a dysbiosis is associated with the development of IBD. The gut microbiota is influenced by dietary factors, and a low-fiber diet is associated with a dysbiosis. Therefore, increasing dietary fiber intake may be a promising strategy to improve the gut microbiota and reduce the risk of IBD.
The aim of this study is to explore the effect of a 4-week intervention with WholeFiber Trademark (TM), a dried vegetable rich in prebiotic intrinsic fibers, on inflammation, fecal gut microbiota and metabolites, IBD-complaints and quality of life (QoL) in patients with IBD.
In this before-after pilot study, 12 patients with IBD will receive WholeFiberTM; of which 6 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 6 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC). The difference in outcomes before and after the intervention in fecal calprotectin, IBD complaints, QoL, serum inflammatory markers, gut microbiota and SCFA will be determined. Furthermore, it will be explored whether the response on the intervention will be different between UC and CD.
Furthermore, an evaluation questionnaire will be conducted to assess feasibility and acceptance of the WholeFiberTM intervention in this population."

Dyspnea is a frequent symptom in patients under mechanical ventilation. It is a multifactorial symptom, the intensity of which is difficult to measure. The presence of dyspnea is a predictor of failure of the weaning test and of prolonged mechanical ventilation. The variability of the respiratory movements is a marker of dyspnea. The aim of this study is to evaluate the relationship between the variability of the respiratory movements and the intensity of dyspnea in patients under mechanical ventilation during a weaning test.
The study will be conducted in patients under invasive mechanical ventilation, able to perform a weaning test. The intensity of dyspnea will be measured by the Dyspnea Visual Analog Scale (D-VAS) for communicative patients and by the Mechanical Ventilation Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) for non-communicative patients. The variability of the respiratory movements will be measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of chest expansion, after pre-processing by an artifact elimination algorithm, per period of 5 minutes and displayed continuously as a trend curve on a tablet connected to the sensor Frequency analysis of the respiratory signal by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) over periods of 5 minutes and calculation of the H1/DC component. The surface electromyography of inspiratory extra-diaphragmatic muscles (Alae nasi and Parasternals) will be collected via self-adhesive surface electrodes. The electrical signals of inspiratory muscle activity will be identified using the Labchart Peak Analysis to extract the root mean square (RMS) of the EMG (RMS-EMG). This envelope of the inspiratory RMS-EMG signal will be used for the calculation of the maximum EMG amplitude (EMGmax) and its area under the curve (EMGAUC). To minimize the artifacts related to ECG activity, the parasternal EMG signal will be filtered before the RMS averaging process, using a low pass filter (50-400 Hz).

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity. The gold standard treatment for CTS is surgical release of the transverse carpal ligament (TCL). The conventional surgical approach for CTS is a longitudinal incision which was created between the thenar and hypothenar eminences along the longitudinal axis of the ring finger. However, this approach is associated with several complications such as scarring, infection, and nerve injury. Recently, a new mini-incision approach for CTS was introduced. This approach is a modified approach of the conventional approach. The incision is started above the proximal flexor wrist crease and is advanced proximally for 1.5-2.0 cm. The aim of this study is to compare the outcome of a modified mini-incision approach versus the conventional approach for CTS. The study will be conducted on 60 patients with primary CTS attending Mansoura university hospitals with EMG-and NCS-proved median neuropathy at the wrist. Patients will be randomly divided into two groups: Group I: patients will be subjected to a longitudinal mini-incision started just above the proximal flexor wrist crease and then extended for 1.5 - 2 cm in a proximal direction. Group II: patients will be subjected a longitudinal incision which was created between the thenar and hypothenar eminences along the longitudinal axis of the ring finger. Then, it was extended to the proximal flexor wrist crease. The outcome measures will be: improvement in carpal tunnel syndrome associated pain, pillar pain, recurrence of neuropathic symptoms, operative time, and scar effect."

The aim of this study is to investigate whether applying action observation learning in a population with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) would yield positive results in cognitive status, functionality, activities of daily living (ADL), gait, and balance. Furthermore, the study aims to determine whether there are better outcomes when AOT is conducted under the guidance of a therapist or under the direction of MCI-free individuals, compared to self-directed AOT.
The hypothesis of this study is that intervention using an exercise plan for upper and lower limbs through action observation learning is effective in improving cognitive status, functionality, ADL, gait, and balance in patients with mild cognitive impairment. It is also hypothesized that this effectiveness is greater when the learning process involves observing actions performed by other patients with similar characteristics, compared to observing actions performed by the therapist.
Main Objective: To compare the effectiveness of action observation therapy in patients with mild cognitive impairment who observe the therapist, patients with mild cognitive impairment who observe patients without cognitive impairment, and a control group.
Secondary Objectives: To assess the benefits of an exercise plan using action observation learning on upper limb functionality. To evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise plan using action observation learning on ADL in patients. To examine the benefits of an exercise plan using action observation learning on balance. To determine the effects of an exercise plan using action observation learning on cognitive status. To investigate the impact of an exercise plan using action observation learning on gait."

The placement of a central venous line is a common procedure in the intensive care unit and in the operating room. The use of ultrasound guidance is recommended to reduce the risk of complications. However, the use of ultrasound is limited by the need for a dedicated machine and a trained operator. The use of an ultraportable ultrasound device could allow the use of ultrasound guidance in all patients.
The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the placement of a central venous line using an ultraportable ultrasound device to the conventional technique.
The primary endpoint is the length of the procedure.
The secondary endpoints are the number of attempts, the number of complications, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the procedure, the number of patients with a correct position of the catheter at the end of the"

Episiotomy is a planned surgical incision to the perineum and posterior wall of the vagina during the second stage of labor. The fibrotic and sclerotic scar tissue formed as part of the healing process of episiotomies may cause pain. Therefore, episiotomy is associated with sexual dysfunction due to the painful sexual intercourse, chronic pain and infections and scarring in long term. 40% of the patients complain about persisted dyspareunia after 6 months of delivery. Genital pelvic pain/penetration disorders disturb the quality of sexual life of the couple and affect the psychology and wellbeing of the partners. Since, vulva is rich in afferent nerve endings, episiotomy scar healing is associated with pain. Er:YAG laser is a safe option for the treatment of vulvar pain. Er:YAG laser is a non-invasive and non-ablative procedure that strengthens the connective tissue in the vaginal wall. It provides controlled thermal energy and causes shrinkage of the collagen fibrils in the vaginal epithelium and lamina propria. It also induces neocollagenesis, elastogenesis and neoangiogenesis by temperature change. With minimum damage to the peripheral tissue, the viable cells in the target tissue react to this temperature change by expressing heat shock proteins (HSP). Then, HSP increases the levels of transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, epidermal growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, vascular epithelial growth factor which induce neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. Therefore, the thermal energy stored in the vaginal wall induces proliferation of the epithelium which is rich in glycogen, neovascularization and collagen production in the lamina propria. Er:YAG laser is also an effective modality to treat the scar tissue formed after the mediolateral episiotomy since it is a matter of functionality and esthetics. By tissue remodeling effect Er:YAG laser will improve the scar tissue of episiotomy and ameliorate the vulvar pain.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common physical disability in childhood. Although motor impairments are the most visible, sensory impairments are also common in children with CP. Sensory impairments can have a negative impact on motor function and functional performance. Therefore, it is important to develop effective interventions that target sensory impairments in children with CP.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of Sense for Kids therapy compared to an equal dose of upper limb motor therapy on upper limb sensorimotor outcomes in children and adolescents with unilateral CP. Additionally the potential role of clinical and neurological baseline characteristics on treatment response will be explored, including the anatomical characterization of the brain lesion, age and baseline somatosensory function.
The study will be conducted in 50 children and adolescents with spastic unilateral CP aged between 7 and 15 years old. Participants will be randomized to the intervention or active control group through randomization by minimization with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Participants in both groups will receive three session of upper limb therapy per week for a period of 8 weeks, resulting in a total therapy intensity of 18 hours. The intervention group will receive Sense for Kids therapy, which consists of component-based training and occupation-based training. During the component-based training participants will perform graded and structured practice of tactile object recognition, texture discrimination and proprioception. During the occupation-based practice, participants will repetitively perform self-chosen activities of daily living while attention is denoted to somatosensory aspects necessary for successful task completion (e.g., position of the upper limb, texture of materials, localization of materials based on touch). Participants in the control group will receive an equal amount of motor training, consisting of unimanual motor tasks and bimanual goal directed training of self-chosen activities of daily living.
Outcomes will be assessed at three different points in time, being within two weeks prior to therapy commencement (baseline), within one week following therapy completion (post-intervention) and 6 months after the therapy has ended (follow-up). Outcome assessments include qualitative and quantitative measures of upper limb sensorimotor function. The primary outcome measure is the Assisting Hand Assessment"

Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) is a common complication in patients with sepsis, and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The pathogenesis of SALD is not fully understood. The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI) is a simple and inexpensive method to predict the occurrence of liver fibrosis. However, whether APRI can predict the occurrence of SALD in patients with sepsis is still unclear. In this study, we aimed to investigate the correlation between APRI and the occurrence of SALD in adult patients with sepsis. We also aimed to validate the results using our own data.
We included adult sepsis patients (≥18 years) as study participants, but only those who had data available for their first hospitalization and first ICU admission were enrolled in our study, if they had multiple admission records in the database. Exclusion criteria include: all types of chronic liver disease; viral hepatitis; primary acute cholangiopathies; cholecystitis; hepatic infarction; liver necrosis; liver trauma; length of ICU stay < 24 hours.

The purpose of this study is to develop and validate a noninvasive multimodal ultrasound-based imaging biomarker for myofascial pain (MP). MP is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). It is associated with a range of tissue abnormalities, such as taught muscle bands, trigger points (TPs), and thoracolumbar fascia motion dysfunction, along with poor tissue elasticity. As a result, a composite biomarker for MP related to components of the syndrome is more likely to be plausible biologically, robust, and useful clinically for diagnosis and treatment. The investigators propose to study: 1. The echogenicity of latent and active trigger points, 2. The dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation quantified by strain tensors (compression, extension, and shear) in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, 3. The viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles measured by ultrasound shear wave elastography. In the R61 Phase (year 1 to 3) the investigators will use deep learning to integrate these measurements into a predictive biomarker and use established validation methods to test its ability to predict MP. The investigators will determine the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarker to classify the myofascial components of pain, as well as the response to treatment (a diagnostic and predictive marker). In the R34 Phase (year 4 to 6) the investigators will use the biomarker to develop and test a new treatment for MP."

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH) is a common neurosurgical condition. The standard of care for cSDH is surgical evacuation. The goal of surgery is to remove the hematoma and relieve the mass effect on the brain. However, there is a risk of neurologic deterioration after surgery. This is thought to be due to the release of excitatory neurotransmitters from the hematoma. These neurotransmitters can cause seizures and other neurologic problems.
One way to prevent this is to monitor the brain with electroencephalography (EEG) during surgery. EEG is a test that records the electrical activity of the brain. It can detect seizures and other neurologic problems.
In this study, the investigators will use EEG to monitor the brain during surgery for cSDH. The investigators will place electrodes on the scalp to record the electrical activity of the brain. The investigators will also place electrodes in the hematoma to detect the release of excitatory neurotransmitters.
The investigators will use this information to determine if the release of excitatory neurotransmitters is causing neurologic problems after surgery. The investigators will also use this information to develop new treatments for cSDH."

Neuromuscular diseases (NMD) and neurodisabilities (ND) are a group of conditions that affect the muscles and nerves, resulting in weakness and wasting of the muscles. People with NMD and ND are at risk of developing lung infections, which can be serious and require hospital admission. The investigators have developed a new treatment for people with NMD and ND, which involves breathing in a salt solution called hypertonic saline (HTS). The investigators want to see if HTS can help to prevent lung infections in people with NMD and ND.
The investigators will recruit 100 people with NMD and ND who have had at least one lung infection in the past 12 months. Participants will be randomly allocated to receive either HTS or normal saline (placebo) for 52 weeks. The investigators will measure the number of lung infections that occur during the study period.

The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of conventional endodontic treatment with that of endodontic treatment combined with photodynamic therapy (PDT) in patients with apical lesion. A randomized, clinical, superiority trial will be carried out, controlled, blinded and masked, with 3 parallel arms. The patient sample will be randomized in 3 treatment groups: the first is the placebo group which will receive conventional endodontic treatment (ET) and a simulated treatment with the equipment in which no radiation will be emitted; the second group will receive conventional ET associated with PDT with diode laser at 660 nm, fluence 10 s/canal; and the third group will receive conventional ET associated with PDT with laser at 660 nm, 20 s/canal. The photosensitizer used in the PDT will be methylene blue. Clinical and radiographic examination of all the patients will be used to obtain baseline values (T0) and values 6 months post-treatment (T1). The presence and size of apical lesion will be assessed at T0 and T1, the percentage reduction of the lesion will be calculated and the PAI index will be used as a scoring system to assess the lesion. The success rate will be assessed for each group 6 months after completion of the treatment. Disinfection of the root canals will be assessed by analysis of colony formation (ufc/ml); biological samples will be taken with paper cones inserted into the root canals to the apical region at two moments: Baseline (before treatment, T0); after instrumentation with PDT (experimental groups) and without PDT (placebo group). Adverse events will be analysed; a serious adverse event for this study is any unfavourable odontological event that the investigators believe to bear a causal relation with the experimental intervention."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in clinical practice. It is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. Catheter ablation is the most effective treatment for patients with symptomatic AF. The current standard of care is pulmonary vein isolation (PVI). However, the success rate of PVI is variable and depends on the type of AF. In patients with paroxysmal AF (PAF), the success rate of PVI is high, but in patients with persistent AF (PsAF), the success rate is lower. The reasons for this are not fully understood.

The presence of extranodal extension (ENE) in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is a well-known prognostic factor. However, the presence of ENE is not always accurately assessed by imaging. The investigators aim to assess the accuracy of the identification of ENE by radiologists in real world situations by correlating with histopathology (pENE) and to evaluate the prognostic significance (overall survival rates) of ENE.
The investigators will also evaluate the prognostic significance (recurrence rates) of ENE and to evaluate the prognostic significance (overall survival rates) of ENE: Risk stratify HNSCC patients based on presence of radiographic ENE, according to their HPV status and N stage.
The investigators will also assess the utility of various existing standardized diagnostic classification systems in accurately diagnosing ENE and to measure interobserver variability amongst radiologists in grading radiographic ENE and to measure impact of standardized criteria on this variability."

Diabetic Foot Osteomyelitis (DFO) is a major complication of diabetes mellitus and a leading cause of non-traumatic lower-extremity amputation worldwide. DFO is a major trigger of amputation in over 80% of persons with diabetes resulting in subsequent loss of quality of life. Medical treatment of DFO may prevent amputations with early diagnosis of osteomyelitis and appropriate use of antibiotics. Surgically or radiologically acquired bone sample for culture is the reference standard recommended by the International Working Group of Diabetic Foot (IWGDF) to diagnose DFO and to determine the causative bacteria and their susceptibility. However, defining appropriate antimicrobial therapy directed to the causative bacteria in DFO is challenging since it requires bone biopsy procedures which are underused in clinical practice for various reasons including lack of availability, cost, and delay. To overcome these barriers, we have set up for a few years a bedside blind bone biopsy procedure performed by a physician at the bedside in the clinical ward. Since then, this method has been used in more than 200 patients with DFO in the diabetology departments of Lariboisiere Hospital and Bichat Hospital (Paris). We have recently published our observational data of 79 patients showing that bedside blind bone biopsy is a simple, safe and efficient procedure for the diagnosis of DFO with a similar rate of complete DFU healing at 12 months compared to conventional surgical or radiological bone biopsies. In order to extend and confirm these preliminary and observational results, the aim of this study is to compare the efficiency and safety of bedside blind bone biopsy versus conventional bone biopsy in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of patients with DFO. Our hypothesis is that bedside blind bone biopsy is non inferior to conventional bone biopsy in DFO outcomes and can be used as a simpler alternative procedure to document DFO. The main objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority of beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional bone biopsy on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives of this study are to: compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy compare microbiological culture results between groups compare the safety of both procedures compare"

African Americans (AA) are less likely to receive quality end-of-life (EoL) care. For example, goals of care conversations, which are critical discussions between clinicians, patients, and families near the end of life, are less likely to occur for AAs than for Whites, and preferences are less likely to be followed when they do occur. Instead, families are more likely to be labeled as difficult if their decisions are incongruent with clinicians' recommendations. EoL decisions for many AA persons are rooted in both culture and a lifetime of experiences of structural racism. Efforts to address disparities need to address multiple factors such as patient-level cultural identity and EoL care values, interpersonal- and community-level norms for EoL communication and treatment, and healthcare institutional contexts for delivering EoL care in a setting affected by institutional racism. Our research group began to address this need with 'African American Community Speaks', a proof-of-concept prototype of a community-developed training program for clinicians caring for AA older adults with serious illnesses. The program originally focused on rural Southern older AAs and is not broadly generalizable across the US due to geographic differences in culture, attitudes, and communication preferences among AA persons in the US. Thus, we propose to adapt our prototype program to urban-dwelling Southern and Northern older AA adults using our established platform of Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) in two geographically diverse regions: Birmingham, Alabama, and the Bronx, New York. To create the new training program called 'Caring for Older African Americans', our team of experts in CBPR, medical sociology, and clinical trials will work with local Community Advisory Boards to: 1. Conduct a comparative ethnographic study of urban dwelling AAs in the North and South to describe AA community values and preferences related to EoL care; 2. Adaptation of our prior community-developed training program by integrating community-developed storytelling videos for empathizing with experiences of racism in EoL care, guidelines for culturally concordant EoL care delivery, and adapting an existing implicit bias management program to goals of care communication; and 3. Conduct a cluster randomized trial in which we will randomize training times to 1 of 4 start dates using a"

Head and neck cancers are the sixth most common cancer common worldwide causing more than 380,000 deaths each year. More than 90% of these cancers are carcinomas epidermoids arising from the mucosal surfaces of the cavity oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx. Squamous cell cancers of the head and neck are classically correlated with risk factors linked to excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco and have a rather poor prognosis (mainly HPV (Human Papilloma Virus) negative patients). However, the incidence of Head and Neck cancers in patients without alcohol-smoking risk factor has continued to increase in recent years, in relation to more and more frequent HPV contamination. Evolution of oral sexual practices seems to be one of the explanations for the progression of these cases of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and oral cavity HPV positive. Some studies show a difference in the expression of certain genes within the two groups of tumors (HPV+ and HPV-) including some that confer sensitivity to certain chemotherapies (CCND1, TYMS) and others to radiotherapy (RBBP4). However, patients with HPV+ Head and Neck cancers are treated according to the same referential as HPV- Head and Neck cancers. There is therefore a real need for studies identifying predictive markers in order to be able to offer patients a more effective suitable and less invasive treatment. This is the context of this research project."

Colorectal cancer is a common digestive tract tumor in China. At present, laparoscopic surgery has become the classic operation of colorectal cancer surgery compared with the traditional open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) refer to the clinical abnormal changes in the lungs after surgery, These include lung infections (pneumonia), atelectasis, pleural effusion, bronchospasm, acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%. The reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications. Numerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for more than 40 years to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of the positive physiological effects of prone positioning on transpulmonary pressure, lung compression and ventilation perfusion ratio, it has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. Currently, the mechanisms of prone position training are decreased lung compression in the gravity dependant zone,homogenisation of transpulmonary pressure, improvement of ventilation/perfusion ratio, and reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) or patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). So, the purpose of this study is to"

Frailty is a common condition in older adults that increases the risk of falls, hospitalization, disability, and death. It is associated with decreased quality of life and increased healthcare costs. The AGE SELF CARE group visit program is a virtual program that aims to prevent frailty in older adults. The program is designed to be delivered virtually to older adults who are pre-frail. The program consists of 8 weekly 90-minute group visits, with approximately 12 participants in each group. Sessions focus on chronic disease management; healthy lifestyle education, including nutrition, physical activity, sleep, stress management, and socialization; home adaptation to optimize the home environment for usability and safety with aging; and anticipatory guidance. Educational materials include a library of handouts and pre-recorded videos from interdisciplinary team members about a topic. The group applies learning to their own lives, develops personal goals, and reports back about brief home activities or practices. Sessions will be modified and targeted toward frailty prevention according to existing data and published guidelines. For example, the Mediterranean diet will be discussed as a nutritional approach that can reduce frailty progression. Physical activity guidelines will focus on resistance training to simulate daily activities, power training, balance exercise, and mind-body movement. Finally, sessions will include information on home safety modification and polypharmacy."

The COVID-19 pandemic has hit the world hard, and older and vulnerable persons are more likely to get very ill when infected, and have the highest morbidity and mortality. The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore geriatric rehabilitation will be very likely required. Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) is defined as a multidimensional approach of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, the purpose of which is to optimise functional capacity, promote activity and preserve functional reserve and social participation in older people with disabling impairments. The goal of geriatric rehabilitation has been defined as to assist [older people] to manage personal activities of daily living without the assistance of another person. If this is not possible, the goal is to minimize the need for external assistance through the use of adaptive techniques and equipment. Thereby focussing on the amelioration of dependency in activities of daily living. However, we are still in the dark about the amount of functional recovery of geriatric post-COVID-19 patients. We do know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious. Before being able to assure the best outcomes for older post-COVID-19 geriatric rehabilitation patients, we first have to be informed about what the clinical characteristics are, what treatment is provided, and what outcomes geriatric post-COVID-19 patients have in geriatric rehabilitation. Therefore, members of the Special Interest Group Geriatric Rehabilitation of the European Geriatric Medical Society (EuGMS) decided to conduct this multi-center observational cohort study into usual care data on the course of functional and clinical outcomes in post-COVID-19 geriatric rehabilitation patients in Europe. The study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (2013 version) and in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and in full conformity to any applicable state or local regulations in the participating countries.

The immunogenicity after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens is diminished in kidney transplant recipients. This patient group therefore remains extremely vulnerable for viral infections despite vaccination. This impaired immune response is related to the use of immunosuppressive agents, especially Mycophenolate Mofetil/Mycophenolic Acid (MMF/MPA). Patients that use everolimus instead of MMF/MPA elicit a higher immune response after vaccination.
Objective:
To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron XBB.1.5 strain.
Secondary objectives:
To investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in kidney transplant recipients results in superior humoral immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as measured by SARS-CoV-2 specific anti-S1 antibody levels herpes zoster vaccination as measured by varicella zoster specific anti-gE antibody levels

Patients experiencing problems with their conventional maxillary denture can benefit from implant-retained overdentures (IODs). Several retention systems are available. These retention systems can be roughly divided into bar-retained IODs, in which multiple implants are splinted and the overdenture is attached through retentive clips, and into retention systems using non-splinted solitary attachments. Bar-retained IOD's provide good retention, require little maintenance, but are more expensive than solitary attachments. Medium term results of bar-retained IODs are promising with high implant and overdenture survival and low incidence of complications and may be considered the gold standard. Solitary attachments serve as an alternative to bars. These attachments are more economical and are easy to clean by the patient, but wear more easily, which can cause lack of retention. However, replacement of these attachments can often be done chair side. A recent review reported that, when a maxillary IOD is supported by four implants, both types show equal implant survival, overdenture survival and patient satisfaction. However, these conclusions are based on a limited amount of randomized controlled trials. Moreover, most studies reporting on solitary attachments were retrospective. Evidence on maxillary IOD attachment systems has been mostly short to medium term, non-comparing or retrospective and therefore inconclusive. This underlines the need for studies comparing different attachment systems with a longer follow-up.
The study design is an observational study to compare treatment outcomes of fully edentulous patients with maxillary IODs, supported by four implants, retained by either bars or Locator attachments. Patients were treated 10 years ago with dental implants and an overdenture in the maxilla because of problems with retention and stability with their conventional denture. Outcomes: primary outcome is the change in marginal peri-implant bone level 10 years after placing the overdenture. Secondary outcome measures will be implant and overdenture survival, peri-implant mucosa health and patients' satisfaction using a questionnaire."

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a chronic disease that affects the red blood cells. It is the most common genetic disease in the United States. People with SCD have episodes of pain, called pain crises. Pain crises can happen for many reasons, such as infection, stress, or cold weather. They can also happen for no known reason. Pain crises can be mild or severe. They can last for a few hours or several days. Pain crises can be very painful and can interfere with daily activities. They can also cause stress and fatigue.
Stress is a feeling of emotional or physical tension. It can come from any situation or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous. Stress is a normal part of life. It can be positive, such as when you are excited about a new job. But it can also be negative, such as when you are worried about an upcoming test.
Fatigue is a feeling of tiredness or lack of energy. It can be caused by many things, such as stress, lack of sleep, or illness. Fatigue can make it hard to do daily activities.
Quality of life (QoL) is a person's perception of their life. It is affected by many things, such as physical health, emotional health, and social relationships. QoL is an important part of a person's overall health.
The purpose of this study is to see if a program of exercise, relaxation, and stress management can help people with SCD manage their pain, stress, and fatigue. The study will also look at the effect of the program on QoL.
The study will be conducted at the University of Michigan. Participants will be adults with SCD who are between the ages of 18 and 55. They will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests.

GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett´s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). In the diagnosis of the reflux disease the DeMeester score is used as a measure of esophageal acid exposure time. Important differential diagnosis are benign functional disorders of the esophagus such as is functional heartburn or functional dysphagia. Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. The results are inconsistent: In younger patients (18 - 40 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) the prevalence of anxiety and depression is higher than in those without GERD. There is an independent association between GERD, anxiety and current depression. Patients with anxiety are more likely to experience GERD symptoms and these symptoms seem to be more severe in anxious patients. Anxiety and depression intensify symptom perception. Patients with GERD have a higher incidence of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances than in the general population, and there is an association between psychosocial disorders and an increased risk of anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. Thus, there is a interaction between GERD and psychosocial disorders, which has been discussed as the psychoemotional effects of GERD. GERD is considered to be an independent source of stress. A long duration of GERD was associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women were more likely to have these symptoms. In patients with Barrett's esophagus, a complication of GERD in which the mucosal cells of the esophagus, under constant exposure"

Disordered eating (DE) is a common problem among women, with a lifetime prevalence of 10.2%. Although there are effective treatments for DE, many women do not receive treatment due to barriers such as cost, stigma, and lack of access to specialized care. Mobile technology offers a promising approach to delivering evidence-based treatments for DE to a wider population. The proposed study will test the efficacy of a self-guided, personalized treatment for women with DE. The study will be a single-arm pilot study, with 30 women with DE completing two weeks of smart-phone self-monitoring to identify target problems and then receiving two self-guided modules of personalized treatment directly to their smart-phones. The treatment modules will be based on cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and will be tailored to each participant's specific needs. The study will also examine the feasibility of the treatment approach, including the acceptability of the treatment modules and the extent to which participants engage with the treatment. The study will be conducted in two phases. In Phase 1, participants will complete a baseline assessment and then complete two weeks of smart-phone self-monitoring. In Phase 2, participants will receive the two self-guided treatment modules and will complete weekly assessments of their symptoms and treatment engagement. The study will be conducted in a single site, with participants recruited from the community. Participants will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires at baseline, at the end of the two-week self-monitoring period, and at the end of the two-week treatment period. The study will also collect data on treatment engagement and acceptability. The study will be conducted in a single site, with participants recruited from the community.

Lynch syndrome (LS) is a hereditary cancer syndrome characterized by a predisposition to the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) and other cancers. The risk of CRC is estimated at 40 to 80% by the age of 70. The current standard of care for CRC screening in LS is colonoscopy every 1 to 2 years. The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in screening for neoplastic lesions in Lynch syndrome.
The CAD EYE system is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is designed to assist the endoscopist in the detection of colorectal polyps. The CAD EYE system is based on a deep learning algorithm that has been trained to detect polyps in the colon. The CAD EYE system is designed to be used in conjunction with conventional colonoscopy. The CAD EYE system is not intended to replace the endoscopist, but rather to assist the endoscopist in the detection of polyps.
The study will be conducted in two groups: the CAD EYE group and the indigo carmine chromoendoscopy (CE) group (reference technique). The colonoscopy procedure for each patient will be no different from a conventional colonoscopy examination. In the CAD EYE group, descent is performed under white light, with the CAD EYE system switched on. When polyps are detected, they are rigorously described and histological predictions of endoscopist and CAD EYE will be reported separately. Then polyps will be removed by polypectomy or mucosectomy. Removed polyps are then sent for anatomopathological analysis. In the CE group, descent is performed under white light with indigo carmin chromoendoscopy (0.4%) applied through a catheter spray. When polyps are detected, they are rigorously described and histological prediction of the endoscopist reported.
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in screening for neoplastic lesions in Lynch syndrome. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CAD EYE, the rate of resect and discard strategy, and the time of colonoscop"

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) is a common problem in pediatric surgery. The management of ASBO is challenging and often requires surgery. The use of enteral contrast agents to diagnose and manage ASBO is controversial. The investigators conducted a prospective observational study at nine children's hospitals that are members of the Western Pediatric Surgery Research Consortium. The investigators enrolled 314 children with ASBO. The use of an enteral contrast protocol was at the discretion of the attending pediatric surgeon. Patients received 30-200ml of enteral contrast followed by X-rays at 8-12 hours and 24 hours after contrast administration. Patients were included in the contrast arm if enteral contrast, administered as part of an abdominal CT scan, was followed with subsequent x-rays to assess for progression of contrast to the colon. Failure (complete bowel obstruction) was defined as failure of contrast having not reached the colon by 24 hours after oral administration at which point operative intervention was recommended. The decision to operate was at the discretion of the attending surgeon. The investigators found that the use of an enteral contrast protocol was associated with a 20% decrease in the need for surgery. The investigators also found that the use of an enteral contrast protocol was associated with a 25% decrease in the length of hospital stay. The investigators also found that the use of an enteral contrast protocol was associated with a 50% decrease in the rate of adverse events related to contrast administration. The investigators conclude that the use of an enteral contrast protocol is safe and effective in the management of pediatric ASBO."

Direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now recommended as a first-line option in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation. However, current international clinical practice guidelines and product inserts suggest caution and/or avoidance in using DOACs in case of potential drug-drug interactions (DDI), including DDI with anticancer therapies. Indeed, potential important DDIs can affect the efficacy and safety of DOACs and/or anticancer therapies and/or other interfering medications in these patients. Data about the pharmacokinetics (PK) of DOACs in cancer patients are scarce. By using a PK approach, this study aims : to describe the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting to identify factors (age, weight, renal function, co-morbidities, etc) influencing the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting.
The study will be conducted in 2 phases: a prospective observational phase and a retrospective observational phase.
The prospective observational phase will be conducted in 20 cancer centers in France. The retrospective observational phase will be conducted in 20 cancer centers in France.

Bronchiectasis is a chronic lung disease characterized by irreversible dilatation of the bronchial tree. Patients with bronchiectasis suffer of chronic cough and sputum production, and are predisposed to recurrent airway infections. Many systemic diseases can cause bronchiectasis: cystic fibrosis (CF), primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), primary immune deficiencies (PID) and idiopathic bronchiectasis (IB) represent a significant proportion of patients with bronchiectasis starting in early age. Pulmonary function testing (PFT) and specifically forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) is a common modality used to estimate lung disease progression and pulmonary exacerbations in patients with bronchiectasis. Although patients with bronchiectasis tend to have non reversible obstructive patterns on pulmonary function tests (PFTs), reversible obstruction is not uncommon. While bronchodilator response (BDR) is a main characteristic of asthma, the pathophysiology causing this phenomenon in bronchiectasis patients is less clear. The improvement in FEV1 after inhalation of bronchodilators can be attributed to bronchodilation or improved mucociliary clearance. It can be speculated that for some of the bronchiectasis patients, hyper-reactive airways or asthma can contribute to the reversible pattern. Despite the wide scale use of bronchodilators in bronchiectasis the evidence for its efficacy is lacking. While some studies found that BDR is associated with more severe disease, other studies did not find such associations. According to ATS/ERS statement, the proper way to determine BDR, is by first recording three attempts of spirometry, then delivering bronchodilators, and after a waiting time, obtaining again at least three attempts of spirometry. The most recent ATS/ERS technical standard suggests that change of >10% relative to the predicted value for FEV1 or forced vital capacity (FVC) be considered a positive BDR. While in most scenarios it is reasonable to assume that the change in FEV1 measured after the waiting time can be attributed solely to the affect of bronchodilators, this is not necessarily the case in bronchiectasis. Theoretically, in bronchie"

The purpose of this study is to examine the relationship between gender identity, hormone levels, and pain sensitivity. The investigators will also examine the relationship between pain sensitivity and social and psychological factors. The investigators will recruit 100 participants from the LGBTQ+ community in the Raleigh-Durham area. Participants will be assigned to one of the following groups: Cisgender Man (CGM), Cisgender Woman (CGW), Transgender Man (TM), Transgender Woman (TW), Transgender Man plus Testosterone (TM+T), Transgender Woman plus Estrogen (TW+E). Participants will be asked to complete a number of questionnaires and undergo a number of pain tests. The investigators will also collect a small blood sample to measure hormone levels and immune cell populations and activity. The investigators hypothesize that TM and TW will have higher pain thresholds and lower pain sensitivity across the majority of pain tests when compared to CGM, CGW, and TM+T. The investigators also hypothesize that gender identity will influence pain sensitivity. The investigators hypothesize that TM and TW will have pain sensitivity scores that align with their identified gender and will not be related to hormone levels or genetic sex. The investigators hypothesize that stress, sleep quality, depression, social support and perceived discrimination will affect pain sensitivity measures. The investigators hypothesize that TM and TW will have higher levels of stress, lower sleep quality, higher levels of depression, lower levels of social support and higher levels of perceived discrimination. The investigators hypothesize that TM and TW will have higher levels of NK and CD8+ cells than CGM, CGW, and TM+T. The investigators hypothesize that the presence of estradiol will be positively correlated with stimulated cytokine release in T cells."

Stroke is a leading cause of disability in the UK. The majority of stroke survivors are admitted to hospital for rehabilitation, however the amount of therapy they receive is often less than the recommended minimum of three hours of multidisciplinary therapy a day, at least five days out of seven. This is due to a lack of staffing resources. New and innovative models of rehabilitation delivery are needed in order to bridge the gap between current staffing resources and recommended levels of practice intensity. Commercially available technology, such as robotics, adapted treadmills, virtual reality, and mobile digital devices such as smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors, have been shown to be a safe and feasible method of increasing rehabilitation intensity, under the prescription and supervision of therapy staff. It can be used to enhance usual therapy and can allow stroke patients to work on physical, cognitive, visual, and communication goals, without one-to-one or 'hands on' treatment from a therapist. Despite the potential offered by rehabilitation technology to help deliver evidence-based levels of practice intensity and automated feedback without additional labour costs, currently few technologies have been adopted into everyday rehabilitation. A well-established research group at the University of Strathclyde (UoS) Biomedical Engineering department have been developing and testing a technology enriched rehabilitation model as a possible solution to the gap between clinical need and current provision. The technology enriched rehabilitation model has been tested under controlled conditions with chronic stroke survivors (at least one year post stroke) and shown to be feasible. While this model presents a potential method of scaling up rehabilitation delivery, and has been successfully deployed and tested for feasibility with chronic stroke, it not yet been evaluated for acute and sub-acute stroke patients or tested for clinical acceptability. Recently, an NHSL occupational therapy advanced practitioner has been seconded into a research post within the UoS Biomedical Engineering department. This has created greater opportunity for collaboration between the research team at UoS and NHS Lanarkshire, to test this technology delivered rehabilitation model within an acute stroke unit where the impact of enhanced rehabilitation is likely to be greater.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects the motor neurons of the brain and spinal cord. The disease is characterized by a progressive loss of muscle strength, which leads to respiratory failure and death. Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the only palliative treatment for respiratory failure. It compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy).
The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort (scale A1 of the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile (MDP) questionnaire) of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated with NIV.
This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study. ALS patients will be recruited during their respiratory evaluation carried out as part of their usual care provided in an ambulatory setting (day care hospital) in the Pneumology Department of Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital. Eligible patients will be offered a digital therapy session based on immersive virtual reality (IVR) and a music therapy session, 60 minutes apart. The IVR session will be based on medical hypnosis (GAMIDA®) and the music therapy session will be based on the choice of music that the patient wishes. Each session will last 15 minutes. Patients will start either with the medical hypnosis session by IVR or with the music session depending on the randomization carried out before the start of the study. The random order will be provided by software (CleanWeb)."

The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue. In France, the over-prescription of antibiotics is a major factor in the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most common bacterial infections in women, and are the main reason for antibiotic prescriptions in primary care. The emergence of resistance to first-line antibiotics is a major concern, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is a major factor in the emergence and spread of resistance.
The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of a selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility testing for E. coli UTIs on the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing in women with E. coli UTIs.
The study will be conducted in the Loire Atlantique and Maine et Loire departments (France). The study will be a randomized controlled trial, with a 1:1 allocation ratio. The intervention will be the dissemination of a selective reporting of antibiotic susceptibility testing for E. coli UTIs. The control arm will receive a standard antibiotic susceptibility testing report.
The primary endpoint will be the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing, defined as the number of urine cultures associated with a prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics (Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, fluoroquinolone, third-generation cephalosporin) prescribed by GPs in the same practice over a period from 3 days before to 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing, relative to the total number of urine cultures.
The secondary endpoints will be the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (=within 5 days after report of the antibiotic susceptibility testing), the rate of antibiotic de-escalation, the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, as a continuous variable (dose-effect) and ordinal variable (threshold-effect), the GP characteristics (demographics, practice patterns, number of encounters/year, and number of patients declared), and the patient characteristics (age, diabetes"

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells. Patients with acute ischemic stroke included in the study will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline were given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The investigators evaluate whether sodium valproate can improve clinical outcomes and increase peripheral CD177+ neutrophil levels."

Supportive and palliative care play an important role in cancer treatment, and when introduced early can improve quality of life and may even increase median survival rates, as shown in patients with advanced lung cancer. Complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) is a popular supportive approach among oncology patients and is on the rise worldwide. As a response to this demand, there is an understanding that these approaches need to be integrated in cancer care. In 90% of large comprehensive cancer centers in the US and in many others in Europe and elsewhere, complementary and integrative medicine is being integrated into supportive patient care. Homeopathy is one of the CIM modalities utilized by patients with cancer. It is widely practiced worldwide, especially in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. In the United States, during the 1990s, sales of homeopathic medicines grew at an annual rate of 20-25%, and in the 2015 US National health statistics report, homeopathy was mentioned as used by over 5 million people. This modality involves detailed interview that emphasizes the unique characteristics of symptoms experienced by patients followed by utilizing highly diluted substances. Dilutions that are above 12c (dilution of 10-24 actually do not have the original substance), which are commonly used in homeopathy, reflect that the original material is not in this remedy. As a result of this understanding this complementary therapy remains one of the debated modalities in CIM. Some mention that patients seek that method of care due to the fact that this approach emphasizes empathic listening to patients' concerns and worries, and the effect of the actual remedy, due to its high dilution, reflect a placebo response. On the other hand, some clinical studies reveal that the use of homeopathy in cancer care, as a supportive approach, reflects clinical benefit that is not attributed to placebo, without risk of side effects or interactions with the conventional oncology approach. In one prospective observational study done in Germany with cancer patients in two differently treated cohorts: one cohort with patients under complementary homeopathic treatment (n = 259), and one cohort with conventionally treated cancer patients (n = 380).

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common liver disease in the general population. It is characterized by the accumulation of fat in the liver in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. NAFLD is a major risk factor for the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevalence of NAFLD is increasing worldwide, and it is estimated that 25% of the adult population in the United States has NAFLD. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is complex and multifactorial, involving both environmental and genetic factors. The main risk factors for NAFLD include obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The treatment of NAFLD is challenging, and there is no established standard of care. The current treatment options for NAFLD include lifestyle modifications, such as weight loss and exercise, and pharmacological interventions, such as vitamin E, pioglitazone, and statins. However, these treatments have limited efficacy and are associated with significant side effects. Therefore, there is a need for new and effective therapies for the treatment of NAFLD. Proliverenol is a natural product that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. It is derived from the leaves of the plant Piper betle, which is commonly used in traditional medicine in Asia. Proliverenol has been shown to improve liver function in animal models of NAFLD. In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Proliverenol in the treatment of NAFLD in humans. The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with NAFLD. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Proliverenol or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary outcome measure will be changes in liver enzymes (ALT and AST) at 12 weeks. Secondary outcome measures will include changes in liver fat content, liver stiffness, and liver histology. The investigators hypothesize that Proliverenol will improve liver function in patients with NAFLD."

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of ascites that can lead to death and can be described as an acute infection of ascites without any certain source of infection SBP is considered the most common infection in cirrhotic patients with ascites. SBP is diagnosed by the presence of ≥250 polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNL)/mm3 in the ascetic fluid in absence of surgical and treatable causes of intra-abdominal infections SBP has many pictures of clinical presentation SBP can be asymptomatic and patients pass unnoticed or can discovered accidentally may have local symptoms and signs of peritonitis such as abdominal pain, and tachypnea or may present with signs of deteriorated liver function in form of gastrointestinal bleeding, shock and renal failure.
The treatment of SBP is based on the use of third generation cephalosporins (3GC) for 5 to 7 days. The response to treatment is defined as the absence of fever (axillary temperature <38°C) and resolution of PMN leukocytosis (<250/mm3) in the ascetic fluid. The response rate to treatment is 60-80%.
The prognosis of SBP is poor with a mortality rate of 20-30% at 30 days and 50% at 60 days. The mortality rate is higher in patients with a high MELD score (>15) and in patients with a low platelet count (<100,000/mm3).
The aim of this study is to evaluate the predictive value of the platelets to lymphocytes ratio (PLR) and the monocytes to lymphocytes ratio (MLR) in the diagnosis of SBP and in the prediction of response to treatment in cirrhotic patients with SBP."

Dyspnoea is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department (ED). Dyspnoea requires timely evaluation and treatment as several conditions causing dyspnea are time critical. Previous studies have suggested that point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) increase diagnostic accuracy in the initial assessment of patients with dyspnoea. However, in most studies POCUS was done by highly experienced physicians which could limit the generalisability of POCUS in the hands of all emergency specialist and residents.
Aim To evaluate whether POCUS performed by a variety of emergency medicine physicians (specialists and residents) increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with dyspnea compared to routine assessment.
Method: Specialist and residents in Emergency Medicine at the ED in Lund and Helsingborg (Sweden) will have a short training and certification in a structured dyspnea POCUS protocol. The protocol includes focused lung (8 or 14 zones), heart (subcostal, parasternal and apical four chamber views) and inferior vena cava ultrasound.
Study design Prospective observational study
Study population Inclusion criteria Adult patients presenting to the Emergency Department within the highest or second highest triage category (Rapid Emergency Triage and Treatment System) and any of the following: Presenting with shortness of breath Oxygen saturation less than 90 % on room air Respiratory rate more than 25 breaths per minute and oxygen saturation less than 95 % on room air Exclusion criteria Inclusion in the study will delay urgent interventions Patient is discharge from the ED (without hospital admission)
Firstly, an ED physician will assess the patient using available routine diagnostic procedures. After consent to the study, the physician will document the estimated likelihood (not likely, unlikely, likely, very likely) of the following diagnosis: heart failure, pulmonary embolism, pneumonia, exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), exacerbation of asthma, pleural or pericardial fluid. Clinical bedside tests will be available as in routine practice in the ED (e.g., ecg, blood gas results). A physician certified in the dyspnea protocol will then perform POCUS and deliver the findings to the initial physician assessing the patients"

Postoperative radiotherapy is widely practiced and highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer, the most common cancer in women. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' physical respiratory skill levels, but does not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIB"

Infertility is a common problem in couples of reproductive age. Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive after 12 months of regular unprotected intercourse. Infertility is a multifactorial disease, with a prevalence of 15% in the general population. Infertility is a major public health problem, with an estimated 48.5 million couples worldwide affected by infertility. Infertility is a major cause of psychological distress and can lead to social isolation and depression. Infertility is also associated with a significant economic burden, with an estimated cost of $186 billion per year. Infertility is a complex disease, with many potential causes. Infertility can be caused by problems with the male or female reproductive system, or a combination of both. Infertility can also be caused by lifestyle factors, such as smoking, obesity, and stress. Infertility can be treated with a variety of methods, including lifestyle changes, medication, and surgery. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is a common treatment for infertility. IVF is a procedure in which eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilized with sperm in a laboratory. The fertilized eggs are then transferred to the uterus. IVF is a complex and expensive procedure, and it is not always successful. The success rate of IVF depends on many factors, including the age of the woman, the quality of the eggs, and the sperm. In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in the role of the vaginal microbiome in fertility. The vaginal microbiome is the community of microorganisms that live in the vagina. The vaginal microbiome is important for maintaining a healthy vagina and preventing infections. The vaginal microbiome also plays a role in fertility. Studies have shown that the vaginal microbiome can affect the success of IVF. Women with a healthy vaginal microbiome are more likely to become pregnant after IVF than women with an unhealthy vaginal microbiome. The investigators hypothesize that the vaginal microbiome can be used to predict the success of IVF. The investigators also hypothesize that the vaginal microbiome can be used to guide treatment decisions in infertile couples."

Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive option, as it is a spice throughout the world which possesses medicinal properties in regulating human nutrient metabolism. In a recent review of the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperlipidemia in humans with diabetes and prediabetes, this analysis suggested that fenugreek has total cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The effects of fenugreek on triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol showed a trend towards reduction and an incremental trend for HDL-cholesterol but needed further confirmation. The effect of fenugreek in human subjects with hyperlipidemia without diabetes has not been investigated. This research aims to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed consumed as a tea in patients with hyperlipidemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. Changes in plasma microRNAs will be analysed to establish non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidemia.

Participants without pre-existing CVD or diabetes aged 18-70 years old will be included if they have hyperlipidemia (plasma triglyceride level between 1.7 - 4.5mmol/l) not on any lipid-lowering treatment or on a stable lipid-lowering treatment (last six months) but still have confirmation of high triglycerides within the range required for study. 114 participants will be randomized into two groups (57/group) to receive either fenugreek seeds or control tea, respectively. Treatment allocations will be placed into sealed envelopes and this will be opened at the baseline study visit with the participant.

Panoramic radiography is an extra-oral imaging technique and is considered an effective, fast, and relatively inexpensive diagnostic tool to examine dentofacial structures.
Various errors such as open lips, shifted or tilted head position, inappropriate exposure parameters, movement of the patients, etc., have been reported for panoramic imaging, which reduce the quality of the images. The low quality of the radiographic images can result in misinterpretation by dentists, eventually leading to incorrect treatment plans. In addition, panoramic imaging errors ultimately can cause the repetition of radiography.
Patient positional errors have been identified as the most frequent panoramic imaging errors, with some studies suggesting this is the case for nearly 95 percent of reported errors. Positional error and patient movement are two common reasons to reject dental imaging including intra-oral, extra-oral, and Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT).
Thus, it is suggested that all dental radiography staff receive regular training focused on correct positioning techniques and reduction of patient movement.
The typical patient positioning errors in panoramic radiography include failure to rest the tongue against the palate, head positioned forward, head positioned backward, head twisted towards the left or right, the chin too high, the chin too low, a slumped position and inadequate neck extension, not resting the chin on the chin support, failing to use the bite guide, lips opened, patient movement during imaging and not removing the metal objects or prostheses.
Among all the positional errors mentioned above, the most common error is the failure to keep the tongue against the palate. Due to the failure of holding the tongue against the palate, the palatoglossal airspace (PGA) appears in panoramic radiographs as a dark radiolucent band under the hard palate and on the apices of the anterior maxillary teeth. This artefact significantly reduces the quality of the panoramic radiograph as it may be difficult or impossible to interpret the desired periapical region for correct diagnosis and treatment planning (for example, making it difficult to interpret cystic lesions in the anterior area of the upper jaw).
In this experimental study, all panoramic images were taken by a technician according to the patient positioning standards. Before panoramic imaging, the"

Stroke is a major cause of death and disability worldwide. Branch atheromatous disease (BAD) is a common cause of stroke in East Asia. The current standard treatment for BAD-related stroke is antiplatelet therapy. However, the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy is limited in patients with BAD-related stroke. Tirofiban is a GPIIb/IIIa receptor antagonist that has been approved for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. Tirofiban has been shown to reduce the incidence of stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, the efficacy and safety of tirofiban in patients with BAD-related stroke have not been investigated. The BRANT study is a multicenter, randomized, open label, blinded endpoint, Parallel controlled trial with the primary null hypothesis that, in patients with acute BAD-related stroke, there is no difference in the proportion of excellent outcome in those treated with intravenous Tirofiban compared with those treated with standard antiplatelet therapy based on guideline when subjects are randomized within 48 hours of stroke onset. The primary objective is to determine whether intravenous tirofiban (a loading dose of 0.4ug/kg/min*30min followed by a maintenance dose of 0.1ug/kg/min*47.5h) is effective in increasing the proportion of excellent functional outcome (mR: 0-1) at 90 days, when initiated within 48 hours of stroke onset. The active comparator is standard antiplatelet therapy based on guideline [ie, 1) aspirin 150-300 mg qd, OR 2) aspirin 100 mg qd plus clopidogrel 75 mg qd] for 48 hours.

Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the UK and the leading cause of cancer death. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines recommend that high-risk individuals should be offered annual low-dose CT (LDCT) scans to detect lung cancer at an early stage. However, the NHS Lung Health Check (LHC) programme has shown that the uptake of LDCT scans is low, with only 30% of eligible individuals attending for their first LDCT scan. The reasons for this are complex and include a lack of awareness of lung cancer risk, a lack of understanding of the benefits of LDCT scans, and a lack of trust in the NHS.
The ALPINE study aims to address these issues by developing a new approach to lung cancer screening that is more personalised and tailored to the individual. The study will use a combination of clinical risk factors, molecular and immune biomarkers, and artificial intelligence (AI) to create a more accurate risk prediction model. This model will be used to identify individuals who are at high risk of lung cancer and should be offered an LDCT scan.
The study will also use AI to create a more accurate risk prediction model. This model will be used to identify individuals who are at high risk of lung cancer and should be offered an LDCT scan.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes with bilateral lung infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT imaging. 10% of all ICU admissions are ARDS patients, and the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus has dramatically increased the number of ARDS patients in ICUs across the world. The international epidemiological study (2016) reported a mortality rate of 35-46% for ARDS, and this is very high mortality compared to other ICU diseases. Furthermore, ARDS survivors present with many functional impairments, including physical, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunction (Post Intensive Care Syndrome, PICS), and their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of Life (QOL) are impaired and many other functional impairments have been pointed out. Their inability to get their original life has attracted significant research attention and become a significantly important research topic. Many patients who are unable to return to work due to functional disability require nursing care, and there is concern about the increased burden on the patient, the family supporting the patient, and the social economy. Therefore, the development of effective strategies for patients with ARDS that take into account not only mortality but also functional prognosis is strongly needed. Recent studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume and airway pressure control), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, noninvasive mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have improved outcomes, including mortality, in patients with ARDS. However, the mortality of patients with ARDS is still as high as 40%. In addition, the complete reintegration ratio of patients with ARDS after 1 year of hospital discharge reported in 2003 was only 50%, and recent reports have shown little progress in this aspect. Strategies to improve outcomes (mortality and functional prognosis) of ARDS patients by improving not only treatment but also the quality of ICU care have become a hot topic in recent years. The previous paper showed that excessive sedation and absolute bed rest for the purpose of ventilation control and rest during intubation in ARDS patients correlated with delirium, prolonged duration"

Prostate cancer (PCa) is a significant health care system challenge. PCa is the most common male cancer in Finland and most western countries. Interestingly, although the incidence of indolent (latent) PCa is very similar throughout the globe, there is a remarkable global age-adjusted incidence variation (up to 40-fold difference between highest and lowest incidences). Epidemiological data suggest that aging in men is associated with neoplastic processes in the prostate but only a subset of men will develop a true malignancy potentially affecting their life-span or quality of life. Genetic factors have a significant effect on PCa risk, but very likely life-style (e.g. diet and physical activity) affect PCa risk as well, but the mechanisms mediating protective or harmful effects of life-style remain unclear. Gut microbiota, i.e. the collection of microbes colonizing the gastrointestinal tract, is acknowledged to play significant role in many metabolic pathways and pathogenic processes in the human body. Although there is some evidence suggesting that gut microbiota affects therapy responses (especially androgen deprivation) in PCa, it ́s potential role in prostate carcinogenesis is not well documented. Our previous studies suggest that gut microbiota composition is different in men with and without PCa and that changes in steroid hormone synthesis may be one mechanism how gut microbiota affects PCa risk.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of prostate medication (5-alpha-reductase inhibitors and androgen deprivation therapy) on gut microbiota and metabolism. The study will include two cohorts: men with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and men with prostate cancer (PCa). The BPH cohort will include a total of 50 subjects and the PCa cohort will include a total of 50 subjects. The study samples (gut microbiota, metabolite sampling) will be collected prior the start of the prostate medication and after 2 months of medical therapy. In addition, after 6 months, PSA measurement is repeated."

This study is conducted to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of the combination therapy of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients. Monotherapy of Hydroxyurea was sustained at a daily dosage ranging from 10-20 mg/kg for a duration of 6 months, during which the treatment response was documented. After this initial 6-month period, thalidomide was introduced into the treatment regimen. Thalidomide was administered orally at bedtime, with an initial dosage of 2-5 mg/kg. An incremental dosing approach was employed for thalidomide, with individuals who exhibited an insufficient response to lower doses having their dosage increased to a maximum of 5 mg/kg. Additionally, aspirin was prescribed at a daily dosage of 2-4 mg/kg to mitigate the risk of thrombosis. Blood transfusions were administered under specific conditions throughout the study. Transfusions were initiated if the Hb levels dropped below 7 g/dL or if patients exhibited symptoms or instability, regardless of their Hb levels. Patients who were undergoing iron chelation therapy (utilizing deferasirox, deferiprone, and/or deferoxamine) while on HU monotherapy continued this regimen throughout the combination therapy phase. Throughout combination therapy, various assessments were conducted and documented, including blood transfusion events and comprehensive blood count evaluations, carried out at baseline, as well as during the 1-year, 2-year, and 3-year follow-up periods. Concurrently, safety parameters, such as urea and creatinine levels, liver function tests, and measurements of liver and spleen size, were consistently monitored and recorded. Outcome: Good responders were characterized as individuals who were previously reliant on blood transfusions while on hydroxyurea therapy but became transfusion-independent after the initiation of hydroxyurea and thalidomide combination therapy. Furthermore, patients who were already free from transfusions while on hydroxyurea therapy and demonstrated an increase in Hb levels exceeding 1 g/dL upon combination therapy were also classified as good responders. Responders were defined as patients who, while receiving blood"

Venous leg ulcers (VLU) are a common problem in the UK, with an estimated 1.5 million people affected. The cost of VLU to the NHS is estimated to be £4.1 billion per year. The current standard of care for VLU is compression therapy, however, this is not always effective and there is a need to identify the underlying cause of the VLU. This is often difficult to determine and can require a number of investigations. The investigators aim to determine the role/position of diagnostic imaging in the patient journey for a patient with active or healed ulceration. The investigators will also determine the current practice in primary care for venous leg ulcer management and availability of services to onward referral. The investigators will also determine the current practice for diagnosis and management of suspected venous leg ulcers in vascular scientist departments across the UK. The investigators will establish what the minimum diagnostics should be for this cohort of patients including what scans should be performed and can a set criterion be applied to this cohort of patients.

The objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults.
Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality"

African-American (AA) mothers have a higher risk for perinatal depression than Caucasian women that is attributable to increased socio-environmental stressors. In addition, AA women have poor healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment compared to Caucasian women. An intervention is required to supplement and support the clinical objectives of the mother's depression care without requiring the mother's direct involvement. Fathers are an underutilized resource to reduce the mother's environmental stress and encourage healthy maternal behaviors. The African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment-Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression (ASSET-PPD) protocol will target the fathers' support of the mothers' mental health treatment and their active engagement in the family to reduce maternal stress. The ASSET-PPD intervention will be designed to have 4 active modules that address key factors to reduce maternal stress during the prenatal period and 2 postpartum review sessions. The modules will be individual sessions constructed to provide training, information, and behavioral assignments to increase fathers': 1) prenatal and postpartum family involvement; 2) mental health psychoeducation; 3) interparental communication and relationship skills; and 4) balanced division of family tasks. ASSET-PPD will be evaluated in a pilot RCT with 50 cohabiting or non-cohabiting fathers and AA mothers who will be randomized into the ASSET-PPD intervention or the comparator group. Fathers only will participate in the intervention, and mothers and fathers will complete measures of mental health and parental experiences. Maternal depressive symptoms will be assessed as a primary outcome, and breastfeeding and parent-infant interactions will be assessed as secondary outcomes."

In individuals with type 1 diabetes, adjusting insulin doses to accommodate the ever-changing conditions of daily life is crucial for achieving satisfactory metabolic control. To address this challenge, researchers have developed an Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) system, commonly known as an artificial pancreas. This system comprises of an insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor, and a sophisticated control algorithm. The algorithm uses CGM data to calculate the insulin dose required to maintain good glycemic control, and it automatically commands the insulin infusion. However, artificial pancreas systems can experience malfunctions, some of which are highly risky. The most dangerous malfunctions include insulin pump failures and infusion set occlusions, which lead to prolonged interruptions in insulin delivery. This exposes the patient to the risk of hyperglycemia and, even more dangerously, ketoacidosis, a severe complication that can result in hospitalization and, in severe cases, death. Unfortunately, patients do not always notice these issues in a timely manner. This study aims to test new algorithms for detecting pump/infusion set malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery. The study consists of three phases: Phase 1: Preliminary Data Collection (Free-living Data) In this phase, data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions are collected. This data is obtained from a download form the patient's artificial pancreas. The one-month session is designed to gather a substantial amount of patient-specific data to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals impact the patient's glycemia as recorded by the CGM sensor. During this phase, the patient continues to use their artificial pancreas in their daily life. Phase 2: Induction of Hyperglycemia The second phase involves the patient visiting the clinic, where, according to a specific protocol and a defined schedule, insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump malfunction. The resulting episode of hyperglycemia is closely monitored under medical supervision. At the end of the experiment, the study team assists the patient in restoring euglycemia before returning home.

Background:
Soft-tissue sarcoma (STS) is a rare disease with an incidence of 3-4 per 100.000 people per year. The treatment of STS is complex and involves a multidisciplinary team of experts. The treatment decision is often difficult, because there is no clear evidence on which treatment option is best for the individual patient. The treatment decision is also difficult for patients, because they have to weigh the benefits and harms of all treatment options.
The aim of this study is to assess whether the use of the personalized risk assessment tool (PERSARC) is (cost)effective in reducing decisional conflict and increasing informed choices in high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma patients compared to usual care (co-primary outcomes). In addition, we aim to assess in a process evaluation (a) the involvement of patients in decision-making (b) the extent and way PERSARC is used by patients and professionals, and (c) how satisfied patients and professionals were with the use of PERSARC.
Methods:
To assess the (cost)effectiveness of PERSARC in treatment decisions of high-grade extremity Soft-tissue Sarcoma-patients, a parallel cluster randomized trial will be conducted in the 6 Dutch hospitals that are Soft-tissue sarcoma expertise centers. Hospitals will be randomized between standard care (control condition) or care with the use of PERSARC (intervention). Outcomes will be assessed within one week after treatment decision has been made (T1), and after 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment decision has been made (T2, T3, T4) in at least 120 patients. See main study parameters/endpoints for a description of the outcomes that will be measured at these time points.
Actual use of PERSARC, satisfaction with/added value of PERSARC and barriers and facilitators for the integration of PERSARC in treatment decision-making processes during patient-clinician encounters will be measured in a process evaluation using questionnaires, interviews, and audio-recording/observation of consultations."

This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Pfizer's ABRYSVO vaccine against severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in older adults. The study will use a retrospective case-control design and a retrospective cohort design. The case-control design will assess RSV-related outcomes, while the cohort design will assess all-cause outcomes. The cohort study may also assess RSV-related outcomes. Standard of care (SOC) RSV testing and re-testing of remnant SOC respiratory specimens for those who did not have SOC testing will be used to define RSV-related endpoints. For the cohort design, a sensitivity analysis including imputation of results for individuals experiencing lower respiratory tract infections without confirmation of RSV positivity or negativity may also be conducted. In the event that standard of care testing practices decline or there are not enough available specimens for estimating RSV-associated VE, the study may be extended to additional seasons.
Secondary objectives of the TND, and if conducted for RSV-related endpoints, of the cohort study, include estimating vaccine effectiveness against: RSV-related lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations among high-risk groups, RSV-related acute respiratory tract infection hospitalizations, and Emergency Department (ED) visits. The retrospective cohort analysis will provide VE estimates against additional all-cause ARI and LRTI outcomes, as well as incidence rates and rate reductions for study outcomes, and will include outpatient outcomes. Analyses will include stratifications by presence of comorbidity, RSV subgroup, severity, age, frailty, and other selected demographic factors."

Botulinum toxin (BoNT) is a safe and effective treatment for numerous conditions in neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and urology. In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the procerus was located at a depth of 3.8 ± 0.7 mm at the glabella and 2.7 ± 0.6 mm at the sellion while the intercanthal vein was located 3.0 ± 0.6 mm below the skin's surface superior to the sellion. Careful consideration of depth of injection and facial anatomy must be taken to avoid bruising and intravascular injection of BoTN. Additionally, in a cadaveric study looking at depth of corrugator supercilii of 32 Korean hemifaces using 3D scanning, Lee et al. found that the corrugator supercilii muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 +/-1.4 mm medially and 6.6 +/-1.4mm laterally and recommended BoTN injections at the depth of 4mm. However, no in vivo studies have been performed to validate this as"

Stroke is a disease that occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, resulting in a lack of oxygen and nutrients to the brain. As a result, brain cells die, and the functions controlled by the affected area of the brain are impaired. Stroke is the leading cause of disability in adults, and it is estimated that 15 million people worldwide suffer from stroke each year.
Stroke can cause a variety of impairments, including muscle weakness, balance problems, and difficulty walking. These impairments can lead to decreased physical activity, which can further contribute to muscle weakness and other health problems. Physical activity is an important part of stroke rehabilitation, as it can help improve muscle strength, balance, and walking ability. However, many stroke survivors do not engage in enough physical activity due to a lack of motivation, access to exercise facilities, or fear of falling.
Community-based exercise programs can provide a safe and effective way for stroke survivors to increase their physical activity levels. These programs can be designed to meet the specific needs of stroke survivors and can be tailored to their individual abilities. They can also be conducted in a variety of settings, such as parks, community centers, or even the patient's home.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a community-based exercise program for stroke survivors. The study will be conducted in a randomized controlled trial design, with participants randomly assigned to either the exercise group or the control group. The exercise group will participate in a 12-week exercise program that includes aerobic exercise, strength training, and balance exercises. The control group will receive standard stroke rehabilitation care.
The primary outcome measure will be the 6-minute walk test, which measures the distance a person can walk in 6 minutes. Secondary outcome measures will include measures of muscle strength, balance, walking ability, and quality of life.
The study will be conducted in a community setting, with participants recruited from the local community. Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, and will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires and tests.

Bipolar disorder is a chronic illness that causes significant psychosocial impairment and disability. It affects more than 1% of the world population regardless of demographic characteristics such as ethnicity, nationality, socioeconomic status and is one of the leading causes of global disability. Bipolar disorder can cause serious cognitive and functional impairments and maintaining life with this disorder involves some difficulties for the individual. Functional impairments such as deterioration in family relationships, problems in work life and incompatibilities in social relationships negatively affect both the well-being and quality of life of the individual. Quality of life is recognised as an important outcome measure for the effectiveness of treatment of mental disorders. Compared to healthy individuals, the quality of life of patients with bipolar disorder is significantly impaired in both the euthymic and symptomatic periods. The ability to cope with difficulties is assumed to be a protective factor for quality of life. However, individuals diagnosed with bipolar disorder are exposed to more stressful events due to their illness and experience coping problems, including in the euthymic period. For these reasons, developing coping skills is among the targets in the treatment process of bipolar disorder. The stress coping strategies of these individuals may even affect the risk of suicide. Bipolar disorder is a serious illness that causes increased mortality, including death by suicide. Approximately 10-20% of these individuals end their lives and approximately one third of these individuals attempt suicide at least once. Patients with bipolar disorder and previous suicide attempts have a worse quality of life. One of the most important factors associated with suicide and morbidity in bipolar disorder is impulsivity. Impulsivity, which can be defined as a predisposition to unplanned reactions to internal and external stimuli regardless of negative consequences and the absence of behavioural inhibition, is one of the clinical features of bipolar disorder. Although it is more common during manic episode, it can also be found in other mood phases. Bipolar disorder is characterised by high impulsivity even during recovery periods. Increased impulsivity is not only associated with suicide attempts but may also lead to functional impairment. In the literature, it has been revealed that high impulsivity is associated with poor quality of life. In the study, it was planned to determine the predictive effects of impuls"

Psychological problems experienced by athletes after serious injuries have been studied intensively in recent years. Important psychological problems can be experienced after sports injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), these delay physical recovery, affect the quality of rehabilitation, and eventually cause problems or re-injuries in the process of returning to sports. The most important of these problems are re-injury anxiety, rehabilitation adherence, rehabilitation self-efficacy problems, and kinesiophobia. Although some interventions have been proposed for the solution of these problems, a structured intervention approach has not been put forward yet. With this research project, our aim is to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (CBT+VR) enriched with the contribution of virtual reality (VR), which the investigators prepared to intervene in psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. If the CBT+VR protocol is effective, it can be used to increase the quality of physical rehabilitation and therefore to ensure that the perceptions of athletes regarding their psychological outcomes about their return to sport are positive. CBT+VR protocol will be tested, and if it is found effective, it will make a significant contribution to both the literature and practice. The main peculiarity of this study is that a holistic protocol including virtual intervention will be developed for the solution of psychological problems encountered in the rehabilitation process of sports injuries for the first time. The research will be conducted with 60 athletes who meet the inclusion criteria. In the study, which is planned as a 4X5 (groupXmeasurement) mixed factorial design model with four groups (intervention1-intervention2-intervention3, control), the athletes will be filled with psychological assessment scales in order to collect the first data within the first week of starting physical therapy after ACL operation. The CBT+VR protocol will be applied to the first intervention group. Only the behavioral intervention part of the protocol in the VR environment will be applied to the second intervention group. The CBT protocol will be applied without the VR environment for the third intervention group. It is planned that for all intervention groups and the control group, there will be 10 sessions in total once a week, and each session lasts 50 minutes.

Most patients prefer to discharge from the hospital to their own home, but 11% of all hospitalized patients-and 22.4% of patients with Medicare-require discharge to a post-acute care facility. Hospital systems are increasingly incentivized to facilitate discharge home since a post-acute care facility stay is costly. Post-acute care is most often necessitated by a patient's functional decline during hospitalization. Physical therapists, whose primary treatment objective is generally to improve functional independence, could therefore play a crucial role in promoting improvements in functional status sufficient to enable a greater number of discharges to home. In current practice, however, physical therapists in acute care hospitals do not generally address patients' function-related deficits. They do not generally have the opportunity to do so, since the Inpatient Prospective Payment System incentivizes short hospital stays. Nor have they needed to, since post-acute care facilities have become the primary setting for patients to regain functional independence. In this environment, physical therapists-a constrained resource in most hospitals primarily play a consultative role in which they evaluate functional status during a single visit in order to provide a recommendation for appropriate post-acute rehabilitation needs. With greater focus on ensuring value across the care continuum, healthcare systems are now striving to maintain short hospital stays, but also limit post-acute care utilization. This will require patients to achieve greater functional independence as quickly as possible within their hospital stay. Thus, the role of physical therapists in acute care hospitals must evolve.

For such patients, an Epic best practice advisory (BPA) alert will appear on the screen, which will prompt therapists to consider a visit on the next day. The second Epic-integrated solution is an indicator column on the patient lists maintained by therapists, which will identify patients who would benefit from daily PT (a green dot), those who would not ("

The elbow being a highly constrained synovial hinge joint has a high propensity for degeneration and stiffness. There could be functional losses seen with even less severe loss of range of motion (ROM) at the elbow. The stiff or contracted elbow is defined as an elbow with a reduction in extension greater than 30 degrees, and/or a flexion less than 120 degrees. Although supination and pronation are often reduced as well, this will not be considered further as contracture of the elbow is not related to forearm rotation. The elbow is more prone to stiffness because Brachialis muscle lies directly over the anterior capsule, the anterior capsule tends to tear more frequently than posterior, all 3 elbow articulations exist in 1 capsule, the elbow is prone to development of Heterotrophic Ossification. Loss of terminal extension is less disabling than loss of the same degree of terminal flexion. It was a randomized, controlled trial, conducted among post-traumatic stiff elbow patients. Sample size was 32 by using G Power Calculator. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group after a baseline assessment with a lottery ticket and an opaque envelope. All participants in both groups were evaluated on two occasions: (i) baseline (ii) After 4 weeks of intervention.

Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method of measuring the amount of oxygen in the blood. It is used to monitor the oxygen saturation of the blood in patients with a variety of conditions. Pulse oximetry is used in the hospital setting, as well as in the home setting. It is a simple, painless test that is performed by placing a small sensor on the patient's finger, earlobe, or bridge of the nose. The sensor emits a small amount of light into the tissue, and the amount of light that is reflected back is measured. The amount of light that is reflected back is proportional to the amount of oxygen in the blood. Pulse oximetry is used to monitor the oxygen saturation of the blood in patients with a variety of conditions, including heart disease, lung disease, and sleep apnea. It is also used to monitor the oxygen saturation of patients who are undergoing surgery. Pulse oximetry is a safe and effective way to monitor the oxygen saturation of the blood. It is a simple, painless test that can be performed in the hospital or at home."

Heart failure (HF) is a common and costly disease. The prevalence of HF is increasing, and the prognosis is poor. The main symptoms of HF are breathlessness, fatigue and edema. The symptoms are caused by a combination of cardiac and non-cardiac factors. The non-cardiac factors are mainly related to the retention of sodium and water in the body. The retention of sodium and water is caused by a combination of factors, including a reduced ability of the kidneys to excrete sodium and water, and a reduced ability of the blood vessels to dilate and increase blood flow. The reduced ability of the blood vessels to dilate and increase blood flow is caused by a reduced production of nitric oxide (NO). NO is a gas that is produced by the endothelium (the inner lining of the blood vessels). NO is important for the dilation of the blood vessels. The reduced production of NO is caused by a reduced production of NO by the endothelium. The reduced production of NO by the endothelium is caused by a reduced production of NO by the endothelium.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction (aSBO) is a common problem in the general surgery practice. The incidence of aSBO is estimated to be 10-20 per 100,000 population. The incidence of aSBO is higher in patients who have had prior abdominal surgery. The most common cause of aSBO is adhesions. The treatment of aSBO is surgical. However, the timing of surgery is controversial. The current standard of care is to place a nasogastric (NG) tube and administer intravenous fluids and electrolytes. The NG tube is used to decompress the bowel and to provide nutrition. The NG tube is also used to administer water-soluble contrast (WSC) to confirm the diagnosis of aSBO. The WSC is used to confirm the diagnosis of aSBO and to determine the level of obstruction. The WSC is also used to determine the presence of bowel ischemia. The WSC is administered through the NG tube. The WSC is administered in the NG tube over 1-2 hours. The WSC is then removed and the NG tube is left in place. The NG tube is left in place until the patient is ready for surgery. The NG tube is then removed in the operating room. The NG tube is used to decompress the bowel and to provide nutrition.

Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) is the most common compression neuropathy. CTS results from the compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. The main symptoms include pain and other unpleasant sensations in hand and wrist. In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and other muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of manual performance. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) remain the method of choice in diagnosing CTS. However ultrasonography (US) is increasingly used along with or instead of NCS. Most frequently, the increase of the cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the inlet to the carpal tunnel is regarded as the marker of CTS. A number of other measurements such as median nerve mobility, volar bulging of flexor retinaculum and others were also studied to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In this study the investigators aim to assess the utility of measurements made at the point of the maximal stenosis of the median nerve in the tunnel to diagnose CTS. So far, there were only few studies, which visualized the maximal nerve stenosis, which is the essential pathological feature of CTS. In general, the group of patients with CTS and controls will undergo NCS of symptomatic median and ipsilateral ulnar nerves and US of the symptomatic median nerve with measurements of the cross-sectional area, diameter and echogenicity at various points, including the point of the maximal stenosis. The location of the maximal stenosis with respect to external (distal crease) and internal (wrist and hand bones and thenar musculature) will also be evaluated. Subjects will also be asked to fill out the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) and a demographic questionnaire. US measurements will be compared between patients and healthy volunteers. US measurements, especially those made at the point of stenosis will be correlated among patients with clinical severity of CTS, reflected by the score in BCTQ and with the grade of electrophysiological severity as introduced by Padua et al.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is a malignant tumor of plasma cells, which is characterized by the presence of monoclonal immunoglobulin (M protein) in the blood and urine, and the presence of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is an important treatment for MM. However, the high-dose melphalan (HD-MP) conditioning regimen used in ASCT is associated with a series of adverse reactions, such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc. Tocilizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the interleukin-6 receptor (IL-6R), which can be used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, giant cell arteritis, and other diseases. Tocilizumab can reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, and has been shown to be effective in the treatment of nausea and vomiting in patients with cancer.

The most common treatment for male factor infertility is intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). ICSI is a procedure in which a single sperm is injected into an egg to achieve fertilization. However, ICSI outcomes are poor in couples with high SDF.
The investigators have developed a new method to separate sperm with high SDF from sperm with low SDF. This method uses a microfluidic device called Zymot. The Zymot device is a small, handheld device that separates sperm based on their size and shape. The investigators hypothesize that using the Zymot device to separate sperm with high SDF from sperm with low SDF will improve ICSI outcomes in couples with high SDF.
The investigators will compare the clinical pregnancy rate in couples with high SDF who undergo ICSI using the Zymot device to the clinical pregnancy rate in couples with high SDF who undergo ICSI using conventional methods. The investigators will also compare the number of utilizable embryos obtained in couples using the Zymot device to the number of utilizable embryos obtained in couples undergoing conventional ICSI."

Archery can be described as a comparatively static sport requiring strength and endurance of the upper body, in particular the forearm and shoulder girdle. Skill in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow to a given target in a certain time span with accuracy. The discipline is described as a three-phase (the stance, the drawing and the sighting) movement. Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and follow-through. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. An archer pushes the bow with an extended arm, which is statically held in the direction of the target, while the other arm exerts a dynamic pulling of the bowstring from the beginning of the drawing phase, until the release is dynamically executed. The release phase must be well balanced and highly reproducible to achieve commendable results in a competition. The bowstring is released when an audible impulse is received from a device called clicker that is used as a draw length check. Each arrow can be drawn to an exact distance and a standard release can be obtained using the device. The clicker is reputed to improve the archer's score and used by all target archers. The archer should react to the clicker as quickly as possible. In particular, a repeated contraction and relaxation strategy in the forearm and pull finger muscles should be developed for this reason. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization and stabilization-related parameters on shooting performance at the cervical, lumbal and scapular levels in archery athletes. A total of 40 archery athletes aged between 10 and 18, who have been professionally engaged in archery for at least 1 year were included in the study. Demographic information and musculoskeletal system evaluations of the athletes were done. Performance of the athletes via Upper Extremity Closed Kinetic Chain Stability Test, Hand Grip Strength test; presence of scapular dyskinesia was evaluated via the Lateral Scapular Slide Test. Cervical region stabilization was evaluated via Craniocervical Flexion Test, scapular level stabilization was evaluated via Scapular Muscle End"

The investigators will develop and test an artificial intelligence (AI) communication training tool to improve pediatrician communication with adolescents and their mothers on contraception. The investigators will use a mixed-methods approach to develop and test the AI communication training tool. In Stage 1 (formative), the investigators will characterize communication content and styles of pediatricians (residents, fellows, attendings) and adolescent-mother dyads on contraception discussions with 50 real-life clinical encounters. Through separate post-encounter surveys of each pediatrician-adolescent-parent triad using validated scales, the investigators will describe the overall quality of the interactions (concordant contraception plans, satisfaction), communication (confidence, comfort, self-efficacy, confidentiality) and decision-making (perceived autonomy, ownership, and power) to determine ideal, moderate and poor communication interactions. Then, separate group interviews (n = 15, with adolescents, mothers and physicians) will review recorded vignettes to identify optimal culturally tailored communication strategies. In Stage 2 (development), the investigators will upload de-identified and anonymized vignettes to an AI communication training tool to develop and refine the tool through prompt engineering and performance evaluation with adolescent, parent and pediatrician advisory boards. Then, the investigators will iteratively test the acceptability and feasibility of the tool on 10 pediatrician learners. In Stage 3 (proof-of-concept), the investigators will test how an AI communication training intervention tool can improve triadic interactions by comparing evaluation results of 50 pre-training and 50 post-training real encounters. This study will advance pediatrician communication training, empower adolescent sexual health, support mothers' priorities, and test how AI communication training chatbots can improve triadic interactions."

Vitiligo is a common autoimmune condition that causes depigmentation of the skin. It is estimated that 0.5-1% of the UK population has vitiligo. Vitiligo is associated with significant psychological and social morbidity, and can have a significant impact on quality of life. There is a lack of data on the burden of vitiligo in the UK population. This study will provide estimates of the cumulative lifetime risk of vitiligo in the population overall, and by important sociodemographic groups, including age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation. These approaches allow creation of cumulative lifetime risk plots which provide an excellent and accessible way to display the relative disease burden across groups. The cumulative lifetime risk of vitiligo will be estimated at age 80 years (approximate lifetime expectancy in the UK) using survival models, with age as the timescale and accounting for competing risk of death. This study will also perform a subgroup analysis in the vitiligo population to identify health-related disparities across people in different deprivation, sex and ethnic groups. The disparities that will be considered are: Mental health conditions; healthcare utilisation; and work impact (time off work and unemployment), The assessment of any associations with baseline characteristics and the outcome of interest will be used using Cox proportional hazards models (time to event outcomes) and generalised linear models."

In laparoscopic surgeries; a trocar is inserted through a small incision and an intervention is made into the peritoneal cavity. Approximately 3-4 liters of carbon dioxide (CO2) insufflation (inflating the abdominal cavity with carbon dioxide gas) is applied and the intra-abdominal pressure is adjusted to 10-20 mmHg. Intra-abdominal pressure is continuously measured by pressure monitoring, which is routinely performed during laparoscopic procedures. The applied intra-abdominal pressure is determined by the surgical team and the most optimal value that creates pneumoperitoneum for the patient is preferred. Abdominal compartment syndrome can be seen due to abdominal hypertension at intra-abdominal pressure values above 20 mmHg. Both pressure values applied to the patients intraoperatively are within safe ranges. The mechanical power of ventilation (MP) is the amount of energy transferred per unit time from the mechanical ventilator to the respiratory system. Although this energy is mainly used to overcome airway resistance and respiratory system compliance, some of it directly affects the lung tissue, potentially causing ventilator induced lung injury (VILI). MP is a summary variable that includes several components, including tidal volume (VT ), peak pressure (Ppeak), driving pressure (Driving Pressure, ΔP), and respiratory rate (RR). These components; requires that the mechanical ventilator be adjusted so that the least amount of energy is transferred to the respiratory system per unit time for each patient in order to prevent ventilator-associated lung injury. In the researches; a relationship between mechanical power (MP) and complications such as ventilator-associated lung injury (VILI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been found. The findings suggest that the mechanical force applied to the lungs should be reduced during intraoperative ventilation in patients undergoing major surgery. In adult patients undergoing general anesthesia during major surgical operations, higher patient exposure to ventilation as measured by higher mechanical power; it has been shown that it is associated with increased in-hospital mortality and higher hospital stay and higher ICU follow-up requirement.

Background:
Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide and the leading cause of cancer death. The standard of care for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. However, the efficacy of these treatments is limited by the development of resistance and the occurrence of severe side effects.
The investigators hypothesize that the metabolic state of patients is a key effector of protein clearance, and the increased albumin as well as monoclonal antibodies clearance that is observed in patients with progressive cancer disease inversely correlates with treatment response and may well be consequential to changes in the metabolic state of cancer patients.
Interestingly, several studies in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, amongst which are NSCLC patients, have shown that weight loss and catabolism can be prevented or improved by intake of high energy/high protein Oral Nutritional Supplements (ONS).
The investigators hypothesize that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements decrease protein clearance including drug clearance in NSCLC patients receiving anti-PD-1 ICIs, which on its turn would positively affect anti-PD-1 drug bioavailability, leading to activation of the immune system and thereby an increased response to PD-1 ICIs.
An increased clearance of anti-PD-1 ICI may also represent a general dysfunctioning of the immune system, because immune cell activation, proliferation, migration and tumor cell killing may all be influenced by cachexia.
Enrichment of nutritional supplements with specific nutrients known to have immune-modulating properties, may further balance immune responses supportive of ICI efficacy.
In conclusion, nutritional intervention with high energy/high protein nutritional supplements, especially if enriched with nutrients known for their immune- or microbiome-modulation properties, may have a positive impact on several mechanisms underlying cachexia-induced PD-1 ICI efficacy impairment."

Each participant will be evaluated by a team of experienced psychologists and clinicians, administering structured clinical interviews to assess the presence/absence of axis I and II psychiatric disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II) (first visit). Furthermore, in all subjects the degree of depressive/manic dysintomatology will be measured through the use of clinical scales and psychopathological tests such as: the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), the Montgomery- Asberg Depression rating Scale (MADRS), the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)(second visit; within one week of the first screening visit). Moreover, additional clinical data will be extrapolated from medical records and interviews with psychiatrists (if available). The investigators will also evaluate the suitability of each participant to undergo the multimodal acquisition of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data with a 7T GE scanner. The neuroimaging session, performed during the third visit (within one month of the second visit) will include: T1-weighted image acquisition: to study the volumetric differences of white and gray matter between subjects in the prefrontal-limbic pathway. fMRI: to assess functional connections between prefrontal cortex and limbic system. 1H-MRS: to study glutamatergic neurotransmission within the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The sequences will be optimized thanks to the 32-channel brain coil (NovaMedical), to reduce artifacts and inhomogeneities in images. The second part of the study will involve murine models.

The intestinal flora is a complex community of interacting bacteria. The potential role of intestinal flora in human health has attracted extensive attention. Imbalances in the gut microbiome have been implicated in a variety of chronic diseases. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of morbidity worldwide and are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Recent advances have provided scientific evidence that cardiovascular disease may also be attributable to gut microbiota. In many literatures, we have found complex interactions between microorganisms, their metabolites, and potential impacts on the development and progression of cardiovascular disease. The use of intestinal flora in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is the latest research direction. Gut microbes are likely to be used in the clinical treatment of cardiovascular diseases in the near future. Gut microbes play an important role in human health and disease. It not only participates in many physiological processes of the host, but also affects the function of the central nervous system (CNS) through the activity of the microbiota - gut - brain axis, which may be closely related to neurotransmitter, immune, endocrine and metabolite pathways. When the intestinal flora is dysfunctional, it can affect the occurrence and development of CNS diseases such as cerebral ischemia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, hepatic encephalopathy and mental disorders. Fecal microbial transplantation, exercise training, acupuncture and massage and other therapies can improve intestinal flora disorders, and are expected to become effective measures to treat and prevent some nervous system diseases."

Pembrolizumab has been approved for first-line locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with a tumor proportion score (TPS) ≥50% for PDL1, based on the results of KEYNOTE-024. However, even with a positive PDL1 status, only a fraction of patients respond to immunotherapy. In the KEYNOTE-024 study evaluating pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥ 50%, the response rate in the pembrolizumab arm alone was 45%. This result led to the approval of pembrolizumab for first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥ 50%, which nevertheless represents only 22% of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Early identification of biomarkers for patients unlikely to benefit from first-line pembrolizumab is therefore a crucial step in selecting suitable candidates. Furthermore, in cancer, genomic alterations in NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 result in constitutive activation of NRF2-dependent gene transcription, which promotes cellular resistance to oxidative stress, xenobiotic efflux, proliferation and metabolic reprogramming. Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 are found in 3.5-15% and 12-17% of NSCLC patients respectively. NFE2L2 is a transcription factor that directs the expression of free radical defense genes that may interfere with radiation-induced DNA damage. KEAP1 is an adaptor protein that targets NFE2L2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction as part of normal homeostasis. These new biomarkers are of clinical interest, as KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations predict radiation resistance in patients with localized NSCLC treated with radiotherapy but not surgery. Some data also suggest a role for the KEAP1/NFE2L2 axis in response to immunotherapy. Establishing a predictive model for the presence of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutation would provide a tool for predicting survival (progression"

The Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) is a dietary pattern that has been associated with a reduced risk of depression. However, the evidence is still scarce and the mechanisms underlying this association are not well understood. The investigators hypothesize that the anti-inflammatory properties of the MedDiet may be one of the mechanisms underlying the association between the MedDiet and depression. The investigators also hypothesize that the MedDiet may be an effective adjuvant treatment for depression.
The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that an intervention promoting adherence to the MedDiet can decrease symptoms of depression in patients with MDD and elevated inflammation biomarkers. The investigators will conduct a randomized open controlled trial with two parallel groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Participants will be individuals diagnosed with a first episode of MDD, according to the F32 Depressive episode (F32.0; F32.1; F32.2) classification of the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), under treatment with antidepressant medication for a period of time less than or equal to 6 months, attending to outpatient consultations. Potential participants will be invited to enrol by their medical doctors from the participating recruitment centres. After signing the informed consent, CRP and IL-6 levels will be tested. Participants with increased inflammatory biomarkers, meeting all other inclusion criteria will be randomized to (a) the intervention arm or (b) the control arm of the study, in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-generated list of random numbers stratified by center in variable blocks of size 2, 4 and 6. Treatment allocation will be concealed from the researchers, using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes.

The goal of this study is to develop and test a culturally adapted parenting curriculum for refugee families in Tijuana, Mexico. The investigators will use a participatory research model to engage community stakeholders in two large shelters in Tijuana to prioritize 3-5 parenting skills. The investigators will then recruit participating parents until reaching a sample size of 120, divided into 8 groups of 15. All participants will vote for 1-2 interventions from a list of 5 to revise and adapt to the local context through small group discussions and consensus building. Participants will complete baseline questionnaires anonymously. Half of the participants (Group 1, N=60) will be randomized to receive the adapted learning curriculum in groups of 15, twice a week for 4 weeks. At the conclusion of month 3, all participants will complete the same questionnaires as pre-intervention. These data will serve as post-intervention data for Group 1 and a second baseline for the remaining participants (Group 2). During month 3, Group 2 will receive a two-page handout on childhood nutrition in Spanish. They will serve as the control group for the first wave of intervention. Month 4: Group 2 will receive the same intervention as group 1 in month 3. At the conclusion of month 4, participants will complete the same questionnaires as pre-intervention. They will also complete open-ended feedback interviews. Month 5: Researchers will analyze all anonymous data and share preliminary results with the community through peer leaders. Month 6-7: Researchers will conduct a phone follow-up for all available participants (2 months post intervention) and collect data anonymously. Month 8: Researchers will again analyze the aggregate data and share results with the community. Month 9: Researchers will draft a manuscript, share final results with the community and nonprofit/academic partners."

With the accelerated pace of the global aging society, the prevalence of degenerative diseases is increasing. At present, spinal degenerative diseases caused by body degeneration have become the most common type. With the continuous deepening of the research on spinal degenerative diseases and the continuous development, update and promotion of minimally invasive surgery technology and instruments, minimally invasive surgery has attracted more and more attention of spine surgeons due to its advantages of rapid recovery, small trauma and fewer complications. The core of endoscopic spinal surgery is nerve root decompression. The procedure is centered on the nerve roots, which can be damaged with the slightest carelessness. According to statistics, the incidence of nerve root injury under spinal endoscope is 1.8-2.5%. Most of the injuries include the stimulation and edema of the nerve root during the operation, which may lead to postoperative sensory retardation and motor weakness, which will damage the patient's physical function and reduce overall satisfaction. The intraoperative nerve exploration is time-consuming and critical, and the variability of the patient's nerve anatomy will also add difficulties to the operation. A real-time auxiliary intraoperative nerve identification technology is necessary. With the progress of optical technology, fluorescent-guided surgery has shown considerable prospects in assisting in identifying nerves. Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only fluorophore approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intraoperative near-infrared imaging. It can emit near-infrared light after being irradiated by excitation light, which has the characteristics of high penetration depth, low spontaneous fluorescence and high sensitivity. At present, ICG near-infrared fluorescence imaging has been applied to clinical research of thoracic sympathetic ganglion, facial nerve, phrenic nerve and pelvic nerve. In recent years, more and more researchers have paid attention to the application value of ICG fluorescence imaging in neuroimaging. It has been applied to clinical research of thoracic sympathetic ganglion, facial nerve, phrenic nerve and pelvic nerve."

Routine PRO monitoring is an evidence-based practice that improves patient outcomes. Patients with cancer commonly experience symptoms which go unrecognized by clinical teams up to half of the time. PROs are a powerful tool to bridge this gap, amplifying the patient experience and improving communication between patients and clinicians. A seminal clinical trial was conducted in which weekly PRO symptom assessments with care team alerts led to reduced care utilization, improved quality of life, and lengthened overall survival among patients receiving active treatment for advanced solid tumors. Subsequent randomized trials have corroborated the quality of life and survival advantages of PRO monitoring in other cancer populations and practice settings. Real-world adherence to PRO monitoring is lower than in seminal clinical trials, with potential racial/ethnic disparities. Multilevel barriers to PRO implementation exist at the patient, clinician, practice, and system levels. While patient adherence to PRO monitoring in seminal trials ranged from 70 to 90 percent, real-world adherence is much lower and more variable. Our preliminary research demonstrates that in a large, multi-site rollout of PRO monitoring, mean patient-level adherence was less than 50 percent. Moreover, compared to non-Hispanic White patients, Black and Hispanic patients were 9% and 4% less likely to complete PRO questionnaires, respectively, but more likely to report more severe symptoms. These results highlight that historically marginalized subgroups may benefit less from current methods of PRO administration, potentially reinforcing existing disparities in symptom management if not remediated. This will be the first study to apply behavioral economic strategies to align clinicians and patients in achieving sustained patient-level PRO adherence, and addresses limitations of current PRO approaches. Current approaches to PRO collection are limited by: (1) suboptimal clinician engagement, (2) encounter-based assessments which preclude longitudinal monitoring of PROs outside of the clinic, and (3) insufficient automated effectors actively linking reported symptoms with clinical response. This proposal addresses these limitations by employing behavioral strategies directly targeting clinician engagement, utilizing novel electronic remote monitoring methods to maximize real-time PRO capture, and linking these with pathway-driven automated effectors."

Prognostic awareness is defined as the degree to which a patient is aware of the prognosis of their illness. Prognostic awareness is associated with less depression, better quality of care and earlier referral to palliative care. Supportive care in cancer is the prevention and management of the adverse effects of cancer and its treatment. Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) is a relatively new initiative implementing early supportive care in patients with advanced cancer. Although studies have shown that a large proportion of patients with advanced cancer remain unaware that their disease is not curable, research regarding prognostic awareness in patients referred to Enhanced Supportive Care (ESC) services is still scarce. A deeper knowledge of the factors and patient characteristics associated with prognostic awareness is an important first step to develop interventions to improve prognostic communication and thereby to facilitate delivery of high-quality ESC.
The primary aim of this study is to better understand the prognostic awareness of patients referred to the ESC service. A secondary aim is to evaluate the relationship between patients' prognostic awareness and levels of psychological distress, quality of life, trust in medical professionals and perceived quality of care.
This will be a cross-sectional prospective study. Potentially eligible patients will be identified by members of the ESC team and will be informed about the study. Interested patients will then discuss the study with the research team and will be invited to participate. After informed consent has been obtained, participants will complete a questionnaire which will cover their level of prognostic awareness, psychological symptoms, and quality of life. The questionnaire will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaire can be completed online via RedCap.
Endpoints: The primary endpoint of this study is the level of patients' prognostic awareness, which will be assessed by the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire. This questionnaire has previously been successfully used in research to assess patients' information preferences, perceptions about their prognosis and the goals of therapy and communication preferences about end-of-life care. Secondary endpoints will be (a) patients' preferences for receiving prognostic information assessed through the Prognosis and Treatment Perception Questionnaire (b) symptoms of depression evaluated through the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), (c) symptoms of anxiety"

Arterial hypertension is one of the most important risk factors in developing a cardiovascular disease. While medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications should always be included. Besides physical activity and a balanced diet, there are also therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine. One very important part in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. In arterial hypertension, temperature-elevating armbaths, developed by Kneipps contemporaries Hauffe and Schwenninger, are a hydrotherapeutic approach that is highly recommended. Even though hydrotherapy has been a part of complementary medicine for more than a century now some therapeutic approaches lack of scientific evidence - especially when it comes to their effect on arterial hypertension. This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group or waitlist (treatment as usual). All 50 participants will be monitored with three 24-hours ambulatory blood pressure measurements (24h ABPM) at the beginning of the trial after randomization, at 8 weeks and at 6 months. The intervention group will be advised to perform the armbaths on 5 of 7 days per week for 8 weeks total. Each participant will get a detailed instruction how to perform the armbath and will be handed a diary to document their performance. After 6 months, each participant of the control group will be offered to be instructed on performing the armbaths as well. Within the active period of 8 weeks, participants of both groups will be called regularly to ask about their health and whether they have questions regarding the trial."

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis. The disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which is transmitted by respiratory droplets and aerosols. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 are variable, ranging from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The most common symptoms are fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea, and myalgia. The disease can also cause gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. In addition, COVID-19 can cause neurological symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, and loss of taste and smell. The disease can also cause cardiovascular complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism. The most severe form of COVID-19 is ARDS, which is characterized by respiratory failure and requires mechanical ventilation. The mortality rate of COVID-19 is high, especially in older adults and those with underlying medical conditions. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. The most effective way to prevent the spread of the virus is to practice good hygiene and social distancing.

Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a common complication of epidural analgesia during labour. It is a self-limiting condition, but it can be very debilitating and may require hospital admission and treatment. The incidence of PDPH is estimated to be 1-2% of all epidural analgesia. The most common treatment for PDPH is bed rest and hydration. However, these treatments are not always effective and may be associated with other complications. Intravenous (IV) fluids are often used to treat PDPH, but there is no consensus on the optimal volume and duration of fluid administration. Some studies have shown that IV fluids can be effective in treating PDPH, but others have found no benefit. In addition, IV fluids can cause fluid overload, which can lead to other complications. Therefore, the optimal treatment for PDPH remains unclear.
Intrathecal (IT) catheter placement is a procedure that involves placing a small tube into the spinal canal. The tube is then used to deliver local anesthetic and other medications to the spinal cord. IT catheter placement is often used to treat chronic pain, but it can also be used to treat PDPH. Intrathecal catheter placement has been shown to be effective in treating PDPH in some studies, but there is limited evidence on its effectiveness in obstetric patients.
The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of IT catheter placement versus resiting epidural catheter after dural puncture in obstetric patients. The study will be a randomized controlled trial. Patients who develop PDPH after epidural analgesia during labour will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: IT catheter placement or resiting epidural catheter. The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of PDPH at 24 hours. Secondary outcome measures will include the incidence of PDPH at 48 hours, the quality of analgesia during labour, the incidence of adverse events, and the incidence of chronic pain at 1 and 3 months."

The PFP program is designed to improve the quality of care and reduce the cost of care for high-utilizers of mental health services. The PFP program is a 3-year program that includes a tailored mix of assertive case management, crisis intervention, substance use counseling, mental health treatment, peer support, skill-building and care coordination, among other services delivered by a provider agency contracted by Santa Clara County. Individual and organizational performance incentives relative to traditional contracted service arrangements were also included. Specifically, the agreement between the contracted provider and the County included an agreed schedule of financial rewards and penalties for the contracted provider based on whether its enrollees utilized more or less care than had a historical cohort of patients enrolled before the program began.
The PFP program is being evaluated using a RCT design. The RCT is measuring the impact of the PFP program on the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services, the total cost of 24-hour psychiatric services at Barbara Arons Pavilion (BAP), the total cost of Emergency Psychiatric Services (EPS), the total cost of Contract Hospital, the total cost of Crisis Residential Facility, the total cost of Transitional Residential, the total cost of Residential Care Facility, the total cost of Institutes of Mental Disease (IMD), the total cost of Custody Health, and the total cost of Incarceration.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been a major public health challenge, with over 1.1 million deaths in the US alone. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent severe illness and death from COVID-19. However, vaccine uptake has been low in the US, with only 68% of the population having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of two brief digital interventions to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake among adults with anxiety or depressive symptoms. The investigators will recruit undervaccinated participants with and without symptoms of anxiety or depression from the CHASING COVID Cohort, a large and geographically diverse community-based US cohort. The investigators will assign undervaccinated cohort participants, with and without symptoms of anxiety or depression, to: 1) an attitudinal inoculation intervention; 2), a CBT-informed intervention; or 3) a conventional public health messaging intervention without attitudinal inoculation or CBT-informed content. The investigators will examine the outcome of COVID-19 vaccination at 4 weeks post-intervention, conducting intent-to-treat comparisons between arms."

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of binaural beat music on sleep quality, heart rate variability, and depression in older people with poor sleep quality in a long-term care institution. This study was a randomized controlled trial. The participants were recruited from a long-term care institution in Taipei, Taiwan. The sample size was 40 participants. The participants were randomly assigned to the binaural beat music group (BBM group) or the control group. The BBM group received 15 minutes of Taiwanese Hokkien oldies (familiar music, can be selected by participant) with BBM embedded, and the control group received 15 minutes of Taiwanese Hokkien oldies (familiar music, can be selected by participant) without BBM embedded. The intervention was conducted thrice a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for two weeks (total of 12 times). The PSQI, HRV analyzer, and GDS were used to assess the sleep quality, heart rate variability, and depression status of the participants. The results showed that the BBM group had significantly better sleep quality, heart rate variability, and depression status than the control group. The results of this study suggested that BBM could be used to improve sleep quality, heart rate variability, and depression status in older people with poor sleep quality in a long-term care institution."

Head and neck cancer (HNC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The incidence of HNC is rising in the UK, with an estimated 10,000 new cases per year. The majority of patients are diagnosed with early stage disease and are cured with surgery or radiotherapy. However, there is a significant risk of recurrence and death from the disease. The current standard of care for patients with HNC is a 5 year follow up pathway, which involves regular outpatient appointments with a multidisciplinary team. This is resource intensive and there is no evidence that it improves patient outcomes. The investigators have developed a personalised follow up pathway for patients with HNC, which is based on the risk of disease recurrence. Patients are stratified into low, intermediate and high risk groups and receive a personalised follow up plan. Patients in the low risk group are discharged from routine follow up and are followed up in the community by their GP. Patients in the intermediate and high risk groups are followed up in the hospital by the multidisciplinary team. The investigators have developed a personalised follow up pathway for patients with HNC, which is based on the risk of disease recurrence. Patients are stratified into low, intermediate and high risk groups and receive a personalised follow up plan.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of an air-polishing device in preventing WSLs and gingivitis among patients undergoing multi-bracketed fixed orthodontic treatment. The null hypothesis tested is that there is no difference between the air-polishing device and the conventional ultrasonic device in preventing WSLs and gingivitis during orthodontic treatment. Clinical examination and clinical samples will be taken before, during and after orthodontic treatment. It is a single center study of 3 years duration involving samples of 60 patients attending the Division of Orthodontics for treatment. Half of the participants will be randomly assigned for treatment with the air-polishing device in every orthodontic appointment, meaning once per month, the other half will be treated with a standard ultrasonic scaler every six months. The study duration for each participant will be approximately 2 years. The investigators will then analyze the prevalence of WSLs using the Quantitative light-induced fluorescence (QLF) method. Gingivitis will be evaluated throughout the study by using standard clinical parameters; the antimicrobial efficacy against several known periodontal pathogens and the host-response (inflammatory markers in GCF) will be measured by the qPCR assay and the multiplex immunoassay, respectively. Clinical evaluation and collection of samples for microbial and host response analysis will be performed every 6 months. Incidence of bracket debonding we will be calculated and compared."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, affecting over 1 million people in the UK. It is associated with a 5-fold increase in stroke risk and is a major cause of hospitalisation and death. The current standard of care for AF is to control the heart rate and rhythm with drugs, but these are not always effective and can have side effects. In some cases, surgery to remove the part of the heart that causes AF may be an option. This is called a left atrial appendage (LAA) exclusion procedure.
During cardiac surgery, a randomised trial has shown that surgical exclusion of the LAA at the time of cardiac surgery is associated with a 2.2% reduction in ischaemic stroke and systemic embolism. Therefore, surgical exclusion of the LAA, which in the latter study was most commonly achieved by excision, is a well-recognised part of routine surgical practice for patients with AF. During lung resections for malignancies, irrespective of a history of AF, along with the part of the lung being resected, the pulmonary vein and surrounding portion of the left atrium are also removed. These operations therefore provide tissue which is known to be of great importance in promoting and sustaining AF, but which is normally discarded. In the current study proposal, we will obtain this tissue and analyse it histologically. In the first instance, as a pilot study of up to 10 patients to assess the feasibility of such an analysis. This sample size is informed by our previous basic science studies of cardiac and lung fibrosis and will inform the design of a future full study. We aim to obtain samples from patients in sinus rhythm (thoracic surgical patients) and varying durations of AF (all surgical cases) to encompass tissues with different degrees of fibrosis.
Design of research Up to 10 patients undergoing cardiothoracic surgery at University Hospital Southampton NHS Foundation Trust (UHS) will be recruited. In all cases, the patients would be undergoing surgery where the tissue being studied in the protocol would normally be removed. In the case of thoracic surgical patients, this would be those undergoing lung resections where an ostial pulmonary vein segment will be excised. Here the"

The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of integrated and isolated resisted exercise on strength, power and endurance in gym beginners. The study can help coaches and trainers to identify the most effective training methods for improving strength, power and endurance.
The study will be conducted on 30 male gym beginners. The participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 (INT) and Group 2 (ISO). The INT program will involve a standard warm-up and cool down. The INT program involve exercises aimed at improving core stability, power, and strength. These exercises will progressed to more demanding exercises over the 8-week training program. The intensity increased by adding more repetitions, resistance, and through exercise modifications. Integrated resisted exercises include opposite arm and leg lift, bridging, side lying lift, ball back extension, push up 5 times repetition twice a week in first 4 week and then progress to 10 times repetition twice a week from 5-8th week of session.
The ISO program involved participants first performing a series of standardized warm up and cool down exercises before and after the training program, respectively. Specifically, the participants rode a stationary bike for 10 minutes followed by static stretching of the calves, hip flexor, and low back. The ISO program began with 5 time repetition and lower body resistance exercises for the first 4 weeks and progressed to 10 exercises for the last 4 weeks. The exercise resistance used in the ISO program also progressed over the 8 weeks. The static stretches were repeated as part of the cool down after completing the ISO program. Isolated exercises include leg press, bench press, Ab crunch, barbell curl and back squat.

The purpose of this study is to assess the barriers and facilitators of integrating Horyzons, an evidence-based digital intervention, in outpatient mental health clinics in North Carolina that provide care to individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders. The primary aim is to evaluate and identify the unique barriers and facilitators in implementing Horyzons at each first episode psychosis (FEP) clinic as part of standard care and distinct implementation strategies. The secondary and tertiary aims are to evaluate client engagement with Horyzons and attrition as part of clinical care and assess the change in clients' psychological measures across in addition to their use of state-funded services (e.g., emergency department and social services) across the 12-month intervention.
Participants: To assess the first aim, the investigators will recruit 20 clinicians and/or peer specialists from the FEP clinics. To assess the first and second aim, the investigators will recruit 50 individuals with FEP (i.e., first episode of a schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders). Procedures (methods): Service provider participants will be recruited over a 4-6 week period at their respective clinics. They will be asked to complete an adapted measure, the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network (CPCRN) Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Survey, assessing clinical readiness, leadership, acceptance, adoption, and perspective on evidence-based practices.

Liver transplantation is the transplantation of the liver, which is completely or partially removed by surgical intervention, from a living or brain-dead cadaver to the recipient. Today, organ transplantation procedures are carried out successfully in many centers in our country.Liver transplantation has become the most effective treatment method for acute and chronic liver failure due to different reasons.The life expectancy of individuals with advanced liver disease, which was limited to months before liver transplantation, was extended with liver transplantation and the quality of life was improved with this treatment method. However, since most of the organ transplants are made from genetically different donors, tissue compatibility between the donor and the recipient remains a problem.Therefore, the recipient's immune response to donor graft antigens should be considered. In recent years, the application of advanced surgery and new immunosuppressive approaches has made it possible to successfully transplant almost any vital organ or tissue. However, due to both infection and genetic factors, an immune response to the donor organ may develop and cause organ rejection. At this point, we think that early diagnosis and discovery of immune response parameters that distinguish infection from rejection may be important.In our study, some inflammatory Interleukin-2 , Interleukin-6, Interferon-γ, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α and anti-inflammatory Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 cytokine genes expressions and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1, which contributes to the pathology of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases; Human Leukocyte Antigen-G5, which suppresses the immune response; the expression levels of transcription factor Forkhead box-P3 expressed in regulatory T-lymphocytes and Cluster of Differentiation (CD)14 genes, which are thought to be biomarkers in various infectious diseases and expressed in monocytes, will be measured from peripheral blood samples obtained from liver transplant patients before, 1 month and 6 months after the operation.

Acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) is a common cause of hospitalization in the United States. The mainstay of treatment for ADHF is diuretics, which are used to reduce the volume of fluid in the body. However, diuretics can cause side effects such as dehydration, electrolyte imbalance, and kidney damage. In addition, diuretics are not always effective in reducing fluid volume.
The investigators have developed a new device called the RenalGuard System that can be used to deliver fluids to the body in a controlled manner. The RenalGuard System is designed to prevent dehydration and electrolyte imbalance while still allowing the body to get rid of excess fluid.
The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to test the safety and effectiveness of the RenalGuard System in patients with ADHF. The investigators will compare the RenalGuard System to standard diuretic therapy in patients with ADHF. The investigators will also compare the RenalGuard System to standard diuretic therapy in patients with ADHF and acute kidney injury.
The investigators hypothesize that the RenalGuard System will be safe and effective in patients with ADHF. The investigators also hypothesize that the RenalGuard System will be more effective than standard diuretic therapy in patients with ADHF and acute kidney injury."

Idiopathic chest pain (ICP) is a common complaint in pediatric patients. Although the pain is typically benign, it can be distressing and lead to significant anxiety and functional impairment. The current standard of care for ICP is reassurance of the benign nature of the pain. However, there is a need for additional interventions that can help reduce the pain and anxiety associated with ICP. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and anxiety in adults with chronic pain. However, there is limited research on the use of MBI in pediatric patients with ICP. The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a self-guided MBI in pediatric patients with ICP. The study will be a pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the standard of care control group or the mindfulness-based intervention group. Participants in the mindfulness-based intervention group will be asked to use the Headspace app to sequentially complete the Basics, Basics 2, and Basics 3 courses. Each of these courses lasts 10 days, and participants have the ability to choose how long daily sessions last. Participants will be asked to complete surveys at baseline, 14 days, and 44 days.

Pancreatic cancer is the 7th most common cancer and the 4th leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The 5-year survival rate is less than 10%. The standard treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgery, but only 15-20% of patients are eligible for surgery. For patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer, the standard treatment is chemotherapy. The current standard chemotherapy is FOLFIRINOX (5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin). The median overall survival (OS) of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer treated with FOLFIRINOX is 11.1 months.
The immune system is the body's natural defense against infections and cancer. The immune system can recognize and kill cancer cells. However, cancer cells can also escape the immune system. One way cancer cells escape the immune system is by producing a protein called PD-L1. PD-L1 binds to a protein called PD-1 on the surface of T cells. This binding prevents the T cells from killing the cancer cells.
Durvalumab is a new type of drug that blocks the PD-L1 protein. This may help the immune system kill cancer cells. Rintatolimod is a new type of drug that stimulates the immune system to kill cancer cells.
The aim of this study is to find out if the combination of durvalumab and rintatolimod is safe and effective in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer."

A total of approximately 40 female athletes pertaining to the Londrina Esporte Clube (name in Portuguese of the team) women's five-a-side soccer will be recruited for the study. The choice of exclusively women individuals is due to sexual dimorphism in pain perception, thus contributing to the results being more homogeneous and reliable. The criteria for inclusion of volunteer participants in the project will be to be between 16 and 35 years old, and to be able to perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol. Exclusion criteria will include locomotor system dysfunctions or use of analgesic/anti-inflammatory medication at the time of recruitment, as well as being on a calorie-restricted diet or ergogenic supplementation. The study will consist of two experimental groups, made up of healthy individuals, who will perform the proposed intense dynamic exercise protocol, as follows: 1) control group that will receive placebo supplementation (corn starch tablets at a concentration of 750 mg); and 2) intervention group that will receive supplementation with diosmin (tablets at a concentration of 750 mg). Treatment of study participants will occur orally, and everyone will ingest identical opaque capsules containing placebo or diosmin with water. The treatment protocol will be applied before the start (pre-treatment) of the intense dynamic exercise sessions, once a day, during the two days before, and on the day (immediately before) the execution of the exercise protocol.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of childhood disability with a prevalence of 2.11 per 1000 live births in high income countries. CP enfolds a group of developmental disorders of movement and posture, attributed to non-progressive disturbances which occurred in the developing foetal or infant brain. An advanced treatment option for individuals with severe CP is Intrathecal Baclofen (ITB) treatment. This treatment can be considered when other options, such as oral medication, are insufficient or cause side effects. Previous studies have shown mostly low level evidence for the effect of ITB on spasticity in children with CP. For children with dyskinetic CP, The Amsterdam UMC and Maastricht UMC previously conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial, which provides evidence for the effect of ITB on attaining personal treatment goals after three months of ITB treatment. It was furthermore found that after one year of ITB treatment, personal treatment goals were at least partially achieved in 97% of children and adolescents. Not all children show similar response to ITB: some benefit more than others in attaining treatment goals. The investigators previous research on the effect of ITB in children with CP, found that a higher level of dystonia prior to ITB and reduction of pain during ITB were associated, for a small part, with attainment of treatment goals. Sample size was not sufficient to look at specific factors associated with specific types of treatment goals. For example, goals on the level of personal care could be influenced by other factors than goals related to sitting or transfers. Long-term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with CP have not yet been described in literature. Furthermore, knowing which factors influence outcome on the long term, preferably related to specific types of treatment goals, can be used to inform and select children better before initiating ITB. In order to accomplish these goals prospectively, real life data over a long period of time, and from a large cohort are needed. The Netherlands CP register is an innovative register for data collection which was developed between 2016 and 2020 in a unique collaboration between children with CP, their parents, researchers and health care professionals. The overall aim of the register is to provide personalized, value-based care for children"

Falls are a significant concern among older adults, leading to physical impairments, psychological trauma, and a decline in abilities and quality of life. Exercise has been shown to be effective in improving muscle strength, balance, mobility, and postural control, all of which are risk factors for falls and Fear of Falling (FOF). However, traditional exercise programs have limitations in terms of cost, sustainability, and long-term adherence. Nordic Walking (NW), a low-risk and low-tech intervention, has emerged as a promising alternative, offering numerous physical and mental health benefits.
The study aims to test the feasibility and safety of a novel NW activity program for community-dwelling older adults who are at risk of falling or experience FOF. The study also aims to determine the distribution and effect sizes of outcomes to inform future sample size calculations and explore participants' perspectives of the intervention.
The study will be conducted in two stages. Stage One will involve a two-arm, parallel, single-blind, randomized controlled pilot trial. Forty older adults at risk of falling will be recruited and randomly assigned to either a 10-week NW intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will receive supervised NW training sessions and will be coached to practice independently. The control group will receive regular phone calls to discuss healthy lifestyle habits.
Outcome Measures: The study will collect feasibility and safety data, including recruitment, adherence, and follow-up rates, as well as adverse events. Effectiveness outcomes will be assessed using measures such as the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, Stay Independent Falls Risk Assessment Tool, Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale, and the Four-Square Step Test (FSST).
Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics will be used to characterize participants and feasibility measures. Hedge's effect size and confidence intervals will be calculated. Independent samples t-tests and chi-square tests will be used to compare the intervention and control groups. The main focus of the analysis will be to estimate the effect size, test the intervention's feasibility and safety, and inform future studies.

Fiberoptic colonoscopy is a common examination method for lower digestive tract diseases. It is often necessary to use intravenous anesthesia to reduce discomfort, and intravenous propofol combined with fentanyl is the most widely used in clinical practice. But intravenous general anesthesia can lead to hemodynamic fluctuations and an increase in anesthesia-related complications such as longer stays in the hospital after surgery. Complications related to sedation and analgesia have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Studies have shown that most of the adverse events in endoscopy are related to the sedation and analgesia drugs used. With the successful application of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) in the field of postoperative analgesia, this technique has also been used in the sedation and analgesia of gastroenteroscopy in recent years. Propofol has the characteristics of quick action, short time of action and rapid recovery, so it is very suitable for the anesthesia and sedation of painless abortion and painless gastroenteroscopy. Remifentanil, as an opioid μ receptor agonist, is easily hydrolyzed rapidly by non-specific esterases in plasma and tissues due to the ester bond contained in its chemical structure. Therefore, it has unique pharmacokinetic characteristics such as rapid intravenous injection, small volume of distribution, rapid clearance after drug withdrawal, no accumulation, metabolism is not affected by liver and kidney function, and has been widely used in various surgeries in recent years, especially in the anesthesia of short surgeries.
This study is a randomized controlled study. The study will be conducted in the endoscopy center of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University. The study will be conducted in two groups, the controlled analgesia/sedation (PCAS) group and the intravenous combined anesthesia group. The PCAS group will use a mixture of propofol and remifentanil to achieve controlled analgesia and sedation, and the intravenous combined anesthesia group will use intravenous fentanyl, midazolam and propofol to achieve anesthesia. The primary outcome is the auditory evoked potential"

The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 has become the dominant strain worldwide. The Omicron variant has a large number of mutations in the spike protein, and the mutation sites are mainly concentrated in the receptor binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain (NTD). The mutation of the RBD and NTD of the spike protein may lead to changes in the antigenicity of the virus, and the neutralizing antibody titer of the vaccine may be reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a new vaccine that can effectively prevent the Omicron variant.
The Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant new coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells) is a new vaccine developed by the Institute of Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The vaccine is a recombinant protein vaccine, which is composed of the spike protein of the Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain. The spike protein is expressed in CHO cells, and the purified spike protein is formulated with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. The vaccine is expected to induce a strong immune response against the Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain.
This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase I clinical trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant new coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells) in people aged 18 years and above. The study will be conducted in China. A total of 120 subjects will be enrolled in the study. The subjects will be randomly assigned to two groups: Group 1 will receive one dose of Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant new coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells), and Group 2 will receive one dose of placebo. The safety and tolerability of the vaccine will be evaluated by the incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). The immunogenicity of the vaccine will be evaluated by the neutralizing antibody titer against the Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain."

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia and is associated with a five-fold increase in stroke risk. Oral anticoagulants (OACs) are the mainstay of stroke prevention in AF patients. However, OACs are associated with a significant risk of bleeding, which can be life-threatening. In addition, OACs are not well tolerated by many patients, and their use is limited by drug interactions, drug-induced side effects, and the need for frequent blood tests. Therefore, there is a need for alternative therapies to reduce the risk of stroke in AF patients.
The SEPIOLA System is a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage (LAA), a structure in the heart that is the source of blood clots in up to 90% of AF patients. The SEPIOLA System is a self-expanding nitinol mesh that is delivered through a catheter and implanted in the LAA. The device is designed to close off the LAA and prevent blood clots from forming.

Psychotic disorders are among the top ten causes of long-term disability and have a high chronicity potential and a high risk of invalidity. One-fifth of all patients with schizophrenia suffer from chronic symptoms and impairments, and the disease is associated with low long-term work performance, a high degree of all mental health care resources and high socioeconomic costs. These findings demonstrate the importance of sufficient treatment for psychotic disorders and, most importantly, point to a need for research so that more effective treatments can be developed in the future. In the recent decade, various psychotherapeutic programs with cognitive-behavioral background have been developed for patients with psychosis, and their efficacy has been investigated. Meta-analyses have shown superiority of cognitive-behavioral therapy for psychosis over standard treatment, both in combination with antipsychotic medication and without. Many of the psychological approaches have focused primarily on treating the deficits associated with psychosis, as for example cognitive remediation or social skills training. However, these methods are not feasible in the acute setting and there are only a few psychotherapeutic instruments that can be used within a short period of time for inpatient treatment. The guidelines for the treatment of schizophrenia recommend a combination of antipsychotic medication and psychosis-specific cognitive behavioral therapy. This includes all stages of the illness, also in the acute phase of the disease. The Swiss Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy (SGPP) has stated in its treatment guidelines for schizophrenia that our group recommends a structured psychotherapeutic approach even in the acute phase of the disease. The best evidence currently exists for cognitive-behavioral approaches, […]. In any case, the psychotherapeutic procedure must be adapted to the circumstances of the acute phase and there is an urgent need for research on how this can be arranged in the setting of an acute care unit. (p.10).

Despite this explicit recommendation, to our knowledge there have been no studies that have systematically investigated this in the acute setting and results of which could therefore inform future treatment recommendations. As proposed by the SGPP, we would like to systematically test and evaluate psychotherapeutic interventions in the setting of an acute care unit in an initial pilot trial.

Biliary tract carcinoma (BTC) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive system, with high mortality and poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and treatment are the key to improve the survival rate of patients. However, the early clinical symptoms of BTC are not specific, and the diagnosis is often delayed. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new method for early diagnosis of BTC.
Chromosomal instability (CIN) is a common feature of cancer cells, and it is closely related to the occurrence and development of tumors. CIN is characterized by chromosome structural and numerical abnormalities, which can be detected by whole-genome sequencing. BileCAD is a new method to detect CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from bile, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of biliary tract carcinoma patients.
The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing bile samples from gallbladder cancers and cholangiocarcinoma patients and control groups that without any tumor in the Bile duct and gallbladder or other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of BileCAD test for diagnosing biliary tract carcinoma to other modalities, such as pathological diagnosis. At the same time, the consistency of BileCAD microbial analysis results and clinical microbial culture results was compared, so as to provide more reference for clinical diagnosis."

Schizophrenia is one of the leading causes of disability due to mental disorders in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs), such as India, with this burden disproportionately impacting lower income individuals who primarily access health care services through publicly run facilities. In 2017, it was estimated that there were over 3.5 million people in India living with schizophrenia, with an increasing prevalence of schizophrenia observed from 1990 to 2017 as the population ages and disease burden shifts to chronic conditions experienced in adulthood. Importantly, the burden of disability due to schizophrenia is often underestimated as many epidemiological studies do not adequately account for the added burden of chronic medical conditions, such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes that disproportionately impact individuals living with schizophrenia. Globally, the dramatically reduced life expectancy observed among individuals living with schizophrenia is largely due to preventable and treatable medical conditions. Recent epidemiological studies in India have further observed a mortality rate among individuals living with schizophrenia that is twice the rate observed in the general population, with calls for greater efforts to address this significant health disparity. In addition to recognizing the need to address the alarming care gap, where in India it is estimated that upwards of 75% of individuals living with schizophrenia do not have access to essential mental health care, urgent attention is also needed towards responding to the medical and physical health needs of this vulnerable patient population. Psychosocial interventions, focused on rehabilitation and skill-building, engaging in social activities, managing mental health symptoms, and promoting recovery and community reintegration, hold potential to reduce disability and improve mental health and functioning for individuals living with schizophrenia. Furthermore, building on recent compelling evidence from higher-income countries, community-based programs could be augmented with additional content aimed at addressing risk factors for early mortality, such as lifestyle behaviors, tobacco use, and management of co-occurring chronic medical conditions. Therefore, our study seeks to evaluate the use of a digital platform for supporting the clinical effectiveness and integration of an evidence-based psychosocial rehabilitation intervention for patients with schizophrenia in primary care settings in India."

Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) are a multifactorial disease with complex etiopathogenesis. The main symptoms are persistent pain in the masticatory muscles and preauricular region, limitations in jaw function, and sounds in the temporomandibular joints. The most commonly used therapy is the occlusal splint (OS). The therapeutic effect of OS is attributed to various factors, however the exact mechanism is still unknown. One of the potential diagnostic methods is the use of molecular biomarkers. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between inflammatory cytokines and pain in TMD patients compared to healthy controls. Molecular biomarker levels can be determined from tissue samples and body fluids. Gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) is a serum exudate that enters the gingival sulcus from the gingival plexus of blood vessels and contains proteins, various cell types, electrolytes, cytokines, etc. Considering its composition, wide availability, non-invasive method, and speed of collection, GCF could be a new source of TMD biomarkers with potential diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes.
The aim of the study is to determine the changes in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, IL-7, IL-8, IL-13, TNF-alpha) in the blood and GCF of patients with TMD after treatment with a stabilization occlusal splint.
The study will be conducted in the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, Medical University of Gdansk. The study will include 30 patients diagnosed with myalgia, arthralgia, headache attributed to TMP and painful disc displacement (with and without reduction) according to Axis I diagnostic criteria for temporomandibular disorders (DK/TMP).

Cardiac transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with an inexorably progressive clinical course and poor prognosis. The disease is caused by misfolding of the liver-derived precursor protein transthyretin as a result of an acquired wild-type variant (ATTRwt) or as a hereditary mutant variant (ATTRm). Application of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides greater anatomic resolution, enabling the assessment of amyloid burden within individual left ventricle segments. This study aims to describe the pattern of regional myocardial distribution of 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanedicarboxylic acid (DPD) SPECT uptake among patients with ATTRwt and ATTRm. It will investigate the clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic, including left ventricle longitudinal strain profile in ATTRwt and ATTRm. Moreover, we will evaluate the presence and extent of DPD cardiac uptake among asymptomatic ATTRm variants carriers. This is a prospective multi-center observational study. The study, after obtaining prior written informed consent, will include consecutive patients who have Grade 1-3 cardiac DPD retention in scintigraphy. In addition, first-degree relatives of patients with ATTRm are going to be enrolled. Patients are going to undergo TTR gene sequencing to assess the presence of pathogenic variants associated with ATTRm. Both planar scintigraphy, SPECT and speckle-tracking echocardiography will be reviewed and interpreted using visual and quantitative approaches. The collected data will be analyzed statistically to verify research hypotheses. Approval from the local Bioethical Committee will be obtained before carrying out the study. All procedures performed are going to be in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments, or comparable ethical standards."

Hip fracture is a common injury in older people, and is associated with a high risk of death within a month of surgery. Anaesthesia is given to help with pain relief during surgery, and can also cause low blood pressure. Low blood pressure is common during surgery, and is associated with a higher risk of death.
The investigators have found that low blood pressure is very common during surgery for hip fracture, and appears to be significantly linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery. There are 2 main ways of managing low blood pressure during surgery: treatment and prevention. Treatments (fluids, drugs) have side effects in the older, frailer population with hip fracture, including fluid overload with heart failure, and cardiac/kidney/gut ischaemia. Prevention involves giving anaesthesia at lower doses. UK national guidelines recommend that lower doses are given (< 2mls 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine), but this recommendation is based on historical research selectively involving younger, fitter people having hip fracture surgery. Importantly, these studies did not record blood pressure either accurately (i.e. invasively) or often enough (i.e. > every 5 minutes). The ASAP 2 study suggested that a safe level of low blood pressure occurs when only 1.44 mls 0.5% hyperbaric/normobaric spinal anaesthesia is administered, and the investigator has been using this amount (1.5mls) in Brighton since 2011. Recently, it has become possible to transfer vital signs data from anaesthetic monitors to storage computers for medicolegal purposes (eg in Coroner's investigations - approximately 4000 people in the UK die annually within a month of hip fracture surgery). However, analyzing such observational medicolegal data should also allow accurate description of how blood pressure changes around the time of surgery, and in patient groups that are normally excluded from prospective research (eg the very old, the very frail, people with dementia). By comparing this data to published national data from the ASAP 1 study, it should be possible to determine whether lower doses of spinal anaesthesia are linked with a lower rate of low blood pressure during surgery."

The investigators hypothesize that malaria and intestinal parasitic diseases may result in enhanced or tolerogenic innate immune responses that decrease the risk of symptomatic COVID-19. On the other hand, these conditions and deficiency of micronutrients may decrease the acquisition and longevity of antibodies induced by natural infection and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, increasing the risk of re-infection and breakthrough infections to vaccination. To test these hypotheses, up to 200 symptomatic individuals (index cases) will be enrolled, their household contacts (anticipated 700), and up to 600 vaccinees. The specific innate immune phenotypes that differentiate uninfected Malawians from Western controls (based on samples from blood banks) and whether those responses are protecting Malawians from infection and/or progression of disease will be assessed. Infected participants and vaccinees will be followed for up to 1.5 years to assess acquisition and longevity of Ab responses and memory B cells."

Postoperative urinary retention (PUR) is a common complication after surgery. It is defined as the inability to urinate within 8 hours after surgery. It is reported that the incidence of PUR is 6-40% in orthopedic surgeries. The most common cause of PUR is spinal anesthesia. The risk of PUR increases with the duration of surgery, the use of opioids, and the presence of comorbidities. The most common complication of PUR is urinary tract infection. The management of PUR is based on the use of non-invasive methods (bladder massage, mobilization, hot-cold application, relaxation, and listening to water sound) and invasive methods (urinary catheterization, intermittent catheterization, and suprapubic catheterization). The aim of this study is to determine the effect of hot-cold application to the bladder on postoperative urinary retention in orthopedic surgery patients. This study is a single-blind randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of hot-cold application to the bladder on postoperative urinary retention in orthopedic surgery patients. The sample of the study was determined as 60 patients. The data of the patients were collected by the researchers using the data collection form.

Prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) is defined as the need for mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. It is a major problem in intensive care units (ICUs) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after acute illness is increasing. Their long-term outcome is poor and has not improved significantly over the past 20 years. The symptom burden for patients is considerable, and family members often suffer from significant physical and emotional strain. Long-term survivors report lasting physical limitations, but their emotional health is generally good. Care for many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is shifting t post-intensive care unit settings. While this trend has resulted in cost savings for hospitals and payers, it has not had a major impact on patient outcomes. Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources and clinician time. Measurement and knowledge of their outcomes will guide efforts to improve their care. This study will be conducted in Dessie Comprehensive Specialized Hospital from August 2023 to January 2024. A retrospective cohort study will be conducted. Data will be checked, coded, entered, and analyzed using SPSS version 22 software. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data, tables, and figures for display results. Bivariate and multivariate analyses will be used to see the effect of the independent variable on the outcome variable. Variables that are significant on bivariate analysis at a p-value less than 0.2 will be taken to multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, a p-value of less than 0.05 will be used as a cut-off point for the presence of association. The strength of the association will be measured by 95% confidence interval and odd ratio."

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the standard of care for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition. To this extent, two strategies have both proven to be effective in reducing bleeding complications while preserving efficacy compared with maintaining long-term DAPT with aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor: a) DAPT de-escalation (i.e., switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel while maintaining aspirin) and b) potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (i.e., maintaining prasugrel or ticagrelor"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a new virtual reality-based training system for upper limb amputees. The training system, called MyoTrain AR, is designed to improve the ability of amputees to control their myoelectric prosthesis. MyoTrain AR is a virtual reality head-mounted display (HMD) that uses four SteamVR kinematic trackers, eight surface EMG electrodes based on the Element hardware platform, and a desktop computer to facilitate wireless communication between the various hardware components. From a software perspective, MyoTrain AR was developed in the cross-platform Unity 4.0 game development engine.
The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will involve a small sample of 10 participants who will be randomized to either the MyoTrain AR training system or a control group. The control group will receive motor imagery training. Both groups will be assessed before and after training using the Assessment of Capacity for Myoelectric Controls (ACMC) and the Goal-directed Arm Movement Assessment (GaMA). The GaMA is a functional task assessment that involves moving a cup from one location to another. The primary outcome measure will be the time to complete the task. Secondary outcome measures will include the time spent in grasp phase relative to the entire movement, the ability to coordinate two DoF (hand + wrist movements), and the need for external support.
Phase 2 will involve a larger sample of 20 participants who will be randomized to either the MyoTrain AR training system or a control group. The control group will receive motor imagery training. Both groups will be assessed before and after training using the ACMC and the GaMA. The primary outcome measure will be the time to complete the task.

Adhesive Capsulitis (AC) is a common shoulder disorder characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function. It is a self-limiting condition, with the majority of patients experiencing spontaneous resolution within 12-18 months. However, the duration of symptoms can be prolonged, and the condition can cause significant disability. Physical therapy is an essential component of treatment for AC, aiming to reduce pain, improve range of motion (ROM), and restore function. Manual therapy techniques, such as joint mobilization, are commonly used in physical therapy to improve ROM and reduce pain. Two of the most widely used techniques are Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization.

Gong's mobilization is a gentle technique that involves applying pressure to the humerus in a side-lying position. The therapist applies anterior to posterior pressure on the humerus for 10-15 seconds, followed by a 5-second relaxation. Actions include pressing the shoulder joint, extending the articular capsule, and performing shoulder medial rotation. To enhance ROM, oscillation at Maitland's grades 3 and 4 was followed by 7 seconds of prolonged stretching at the grade 4 technique.
Kaltenborn mobilization involves KM Grade III posterior translation for sustained stretching. With the patient supine and a wedge under the damaged scapula, the therapist abducts the humerus, flexes the elbow, and rotates the forearm for end-range glenohumeral joint positioning. Posterior translation is applied in 30-sec sets, repeated 15 times over 10 mins, with 10-sec rests.
The aim of this study is to compare the effects of Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization techniques on pain, range of motion, and function in patients with Adhesive Capsulitis. The study will follow a single-blind design, with the assessor remaining unaware of the treatment group assignment. Participants in both groups will also receive routine physical therapy, including 15 minutes of electrical muscle stimulation with heat therapy.
The study will be conducted over a period of 9 months, with data collection points at baseline, the end of 1.5 weeks, and the conclusion of the 3rd week. Outcome"

This is a Phase 3 study of disitamab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy in subjects with previously untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (LA/mUC) that expresses HER2 (IHC 1+ and Greater).
Disitamab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets HER2. It is designed to deliver a toxic drug (monomethyl auristatin E) to cancer cells.
Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the PD-1 protein. PD-1 is a protein that is found on the surface of some T cells, a type of immune cell. It is thought that PD-1 helps tumors evade the immune system. By blocking PD-1, pembrolizumab may help the immune system attack the cancer.
The study will compare the effectiveness of disitamab vedotin in combination with pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy in subjects with previously untreated LA/mUC that expresses HER2.
Subjects will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests.
Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.
Subjects in the disitamab vedotin + pembrolizumab group will receive disitamab vedotin and pembrolizumab.

Dental erosion (DE) is a multifactorial disease that is becoming increasingly prevalent in the general population. It is a non-bacterial, non-infectious, non-inflammatory disease that is caused by the loss of tooth structure due to the action of acids. The most common cause of DE is the consumption of acidic drinks, such as fruit juices, soft drinks, and sports drinks. The acid in these drinks dissolves the minerals in the enamel, causing the tooth to become thinner and more susceptible to decay.

The opioid epidemic in the USA, characterized by opioid use disorders and addiction, has resulted in high mortality rates and a public health crisis. In 2017, opioid dependence outside the USA was estimated to account for over 1% of age-standardized years lived with disability in 135 countries. Considering the devastating impact of the opioid epidemic in the USA, it is imperative to draw lessons from these experiences and implement preventive measures to avoid a similar crisis in other countries.
The aim of this study is to explore if a Pain and Coordination Plan (PAC-plan) for patients after accidental injury can reduce opioid use and improve quality of life.
The study is designed as a prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT) to evaluate the effect of a PAC-plan. The PAC-plan consists of three main elements: an opioid management plan upon discharge from the hospital, an appointment with the participant's regular GP within 2-4 weeks after discharge and an opportunity for increased collaboration between GP and hospital specialists.
Patients will be recruited from the Division of orthopaedic surgery, Oslo University Hospital (OUH), Norway. OUH is a highly specialized hospital in charge of extensive regional and local hospital assignments in the South-Eastern Health region in Norway and is described as a level 1 trauma centre.
The primary outcome is oral morphine equivalent (OMEQ) consumption 6 weeks after discharge from the hospital. Secondary outcome measures are OMEQ 52 weeks after discharge. In addition, registry-based OMEQ, pain, health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and other Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 6 and 52 weeks.
The registry-based OMEQ will be collected from the Norwegian Prescription Database (NorPD). Data will also be collected from the Norwegian Patient Registry (NPR).
The study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study will be approved by the Regional Committee for Medical and Health Research Ethics (REC) and the Norwegian Data Protection Authority (DPA)."

Intracranial aneurysm (IA) is a common cerebrovascular disease. The incidence of IA is 3%-5% in the general population, and the incidence of rupture is 1%-2% per year. The rupture of IA is the most common cause of non-traumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which is a common cause of stroke and death in young and middle-aged people. The treatment of IA is divided into two categories: conservative treatment and surgical treatment. Conservative treatment is mainly used for small aneurysms with a diameter less than 5 mm, and surgical treatment is mainly used for large aneurysms with a diameter greater than 5 mm. In recent years, with the development of endovascular technology, endovascular treatment has become an important treatment method for IA. The stent-assisted coil embolization and flow diversion are the two main endovascular treatment methods for IA. The stent-assisted coil embolization is to place a stent in the aneurysm neck and then place a coil in the aneurysm sac to achieve the purpose of occlusion. The flow diversion is to place a stent in the aneurysm neck to achieve the purpose of occlusion by inducing thrombosis and fibrosis. The stent-assisted coil embolization and flow diversion are both invasive procedures, and the occurrence of thrombotic events after the operation is one of the most important factors affecting the prognosis of patients. Therefore, the use of antiplatelet drugs is very important in the prevention of thrombotic events after the operation. The current standard antiplatelet regimen for IA is dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT), including aspirin and clopidogrel. However, the incidence of thrombotic events after the operation is still high, and the incidence of bleeding events is also high. Therefore, it is very important to find a more effective antiplatelet regimen to reduce the incidence of thrombotic events and bleeding events after the operation. The LTA test is a new method to evaluate the platelet function. It can be used to evaluate the platelet function in real time, and the results"

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive motor disorder that affects the development of movement and muscle tone, leading to limitations in activities and participation. Children with CP often experience motor impairments that affect their gross motor function, leading to limitations in activities and participation. These motor impairments can also have a negative impact on bone health, resulting in reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased risk of skeletal complications. Gross motor function (GMF) refers to the ability to perform coordinated movements using large muscle groups, such as walking, running, and jumping. It is a key aspect of physical ability and independence in daily activities for children with CP. Previous research has shown that gross motor function is closely associated with bone health in this population. However, further investigation is needed to explore the specific nature of this correlation and its implications for intervention strategies. Gross motor function is commonly assessed using standardized tools such as the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) or the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM). Quality of life is a multidimensional construct that encompasses physical, psychological, and social well-being. In the context of cerebral palsy, understanding the impact of gross motor function on quality of life is crucial for comprehensive care and intervention planning. Children with CP may face limitations in mobility, participation in activities, and social interactions, which can significantly affect their overall quality of life. Exploring the relationship between gross motor function and quality of life can provide valuable insights into the factors influencing the holistic well-being of children with CP. The quality of life in children with CP is not only influenced by their motor function but also by their overall health and well-being. Bone health plays a crucial role in maintaining the physical abilities and independence of individuals, as well as their overall quality of life. Impaired bone health in children with CP can lead to limitations in mobility, increased pain, and reduced participation in activities, which can have a significant impact on their overall well-being. Bone mineral density, on the other hand, is an important measure of bone strength and overall skeletal health. Children with CP often exhibit lower BMD compared to typically developing peers due to factors such as reduced weight-bearing activities, muscle weakness, altered biomechanics, limited mobility, and hormonal imbalances. This reduced BMD increases their susceptibility to fract"

Hypertension is a major public health problem in adults and is associated with cardiovascular organ damage, which in turn may lead to cardiovascular disease (CVD) and acute events in adulthood. Over the past few decades, the prevalence of hypertension has progressively increased in children and adolescents, generating a significant public health issue and considerable amount of research. BP values among adolescents tend to be less heterogeneous than in adults, and the impact of genetic factors, even if small, may be the expression of pathogenic mechanisms that have been present since birth. With this study, named HYGEF (Hypertension in high school students: Genetic and Environmental Factors), authors wanted to: 1. determine the prevalence of obesity and hypertension (HT) in a cohort of adolescents, 2. perform genetic analyses to determine a link between specific polymorphisms of genes involved in the development of HT in adults like the Adducin genes and Endogenous Ouabain (EO) and HT and 3. explore whether urine Na+/K+ excretion and urinary markers of inflammation and oxidative stress are linked to HT and cardiovascular risk in participants with the selected genotypes. Adolescents will be enrolled for the study in high schools in the north (Milan), center (Livorno) and south (Grottaglie) of Italy, to obtain a sample that could be representative of the italian adolescents. During the visit at the high school investigators obtain questionnaires to have some information about eating habits, lifestyle and family history, two (or three in they were very discordant) blood pressure measurements, weight and height of the students, a sample of urine and a sample of saliva to extract DNA. Genotyping: On the basis of our previous genetic studies carried out in adult patients with hypertension and cardiovascular and renal related diseases, 15 SNPs located in 13 candidate genes have been selected: rs1045642 in ABCB1, rs4343 in ACE (angiotensin converting enzyme), rs4961 in ADD1 (alpha-adducin), rs4984 in ADD2 (beta-adducin),"

Hypothyroidism is a thyroid disorder and one of the most common endocrine disorders. Hypothyroid patients have a thyroid hormone deficiency characterized by a shortage of thyroid hormone (TH) in the circulation and at the organ level and are normally treated with a synthetic form of thyroid hormone (L-T4 or levothyroxine). Thyroxine (T4) is a prohormone, produced by the thyroid gland and converted into the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3) in peripheral tissues. A minor percentage (20%) of circulating T3 is directly produced by the thyroid gland. Although L-T4 treatment accounts for all patients with hypothyroidism, the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism differs. Most patients suffer from primary hypothyroidism (Hashimoto's disease), which is an auto-immune disorder, but also central hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma or hypothyroidism due to therapy of Graves' disease are commonly seen. Currently, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and/or free T4 (fT4) are measured in serum to monitor the treatment efficacy of L-T4. TSH is produced by the pituitary to stimulate the production of thyroid hormones by the thyroid gland and due to the negative feedback loop considered as a good reflection of thyroid hormone status. Target concentrations of TSH and fT4 differ depending on the cause of hypothyroidism. In patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism, TSH concentrations are measured to monitor treatment and TSH levels within the reference intervals are pursued. TSH is measured to monitor treatment in patients with hypothyroidism after total thyroidectomy due to thyroid carcinoma as well, although a suppressed TSH is warranted in this group. The extent of TSH suppression is determined based on the type and stage of the carcinoma. In patients who are hypothyroid due to therapy of Graves' disease, other target values apply. Patients who are just diagnosed with Graves' disease start with thyroid suppressive therapy together with thyroid hormone supplementation (L-T4) and show a"

A hip fracture in a select group of frail elderly people can indicate an approaching end of life. These patients do not benefit from an operative treatment that aims to restore mobility. The FRAIL-HIP study has shown that palliative non-operative management (PNOM) can be a good alternative for this group. By shared decision making between the patient/family and the medical specialists involved, surgery or PNOM was chosen. Half of the patients opted for PNOM. Quality of life was valued equally by patients in both groups. The majority of the next of kin in both groups rated the quality of dying as very good.
The aim of this project is to implement PNOM in all Dutch hospitals as part of shared decision-making in a select group of frail patients with a hip fracture. The treatment decision is made through shared decision-making.
Objective(s):
The primary and main aim of this study is to implement PNOM in all hospitals in the Netherlands, so that the selected frail elderly people with a limited life expectancy who fracture a hip receive the care that best meets their needs in the last phase of life. The treatment decision is made through shared decision-making.
Secondary aims, needed to achieve the main aim, are:
1) to enriching the draft version of the PNOM protocol, and test results of the PNOM protocol draft;
2) to develop educational modules for the curriculum of residents Surgery and Orthopedics;
3) to create awareness and a sense of urgency for PNOM implementation in this select group of patients by organizing PNOM informational sessions during annual conferences of the scientific associations involved;
4) to improve the PNOM protocol on a smaller scale based on implementation of the PNOM protocol in selected hospitals across the country; and
5) to facilitate the scaling up of the implementation of the PNOM protocol to all hospitals in the Netherlands that treat the targeted patient group.
Study design: This project is an implementation project, consisting of 4 phases. The main design is a multicenter prospective cohort study.
Study population: The target population are frail (institutionalized) elderly who have a limited life expectancy and fracture their proximal femur. The population that meets this criterion are persons of 70 years or older,"

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common and aggressive type of brain tumour. After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with GBM is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients. Generating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation. We aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma."

Adolescent obesity is a public health concern. Diet quality is an important component of obesity treatment, but time and knowledge are barriers for pediatric providers. Digital-based interventions have been shown to improve fruit and vegetable intake in adolescents. However, it is unknown if a digital-based diet quality intervention is feasible or effective for adolescents with overweight or obesity.

A diagnosis of cancer reverberates throughout the family. Family caregivers take on a wide range of responsibilities, such as monitoring medical symptoms, communicating with the patient's medical team, managing insurance claims, providing transportation, and assisting with activities of daily living. Psychological distress is common. Caregivers often feel unprepared for their role, and socially isolated from others. Physical impacts have also been documented, from fatigue to sleep disturbance to immune dysfunction. To alleviate some of these difficult sequelae of cancer caregiving, we propose to test the utility of a brief, low-cost, non-pharmacologic, behavioral intervention for persons providing care for a loved one with cancer. Specifically, we will test the effects of an expressive writing (EW) intervention. The basic paradigm asks participants to write for 20 minutes on four separate occasions about a trauma or stressor. Initial work conducted with undergraduate samples showed benefit of EW. Since then, EW studies have been conducted across a variety of populations including persons coping with chronic illness. Benefits have ranged from better lung function among asthmatics to fewer physical symptoms among women with breast cancer. One meta-analysis of 146 studies across 10,994 participants reported positive effect sizes (mental or physical health benefits) for 102 of the studies (70%). Notable gaps in this literature include testing with cancer caregivers (with some exceptions) and use of novel delivery formats. Specific aims are: (1) To examine the effects of a group-based, videoconference-delivered EW program on emotional, social, and physical well-being among informal caregivers of persons diagnosed with cancer; (2) To identify social and linguistic mechanisms by which participation in the group-based EW intervention may improve distress; and (3) To identify potential moderators of benefit including age, gender identity, relationship to the patient, and baseline social constraints."

Gender Affirming Mastectomy (GAM) is a common procedure for transgender women. It is performed to remove the breasts and achieve a more masculine chest contour. GAM is typically performed in two stages: a mastectomy followed by a chest reconstruction. The mastectomy is performed to remove the breast tissue, and the chest reconstruction is performed to create a more masculine chest contour. GAM is a safe and effective procedure, but it can be associated with significant bleeding. Bleeding can lead to complications such as hematoma, seroma, and wound infection. Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a medication that is used to prevent bleeding. It is commonly used in orthopedic surgery, but it has not been studied in the setting of GAM. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of IV TXA during GAM can reduce bleeding and improve outcomes.
The study will be conducted at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). Patients who are scheduled to undergo GAM will be eligible for the study. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive IV TXA or a placebo during their surgery. The study will measure the amount of bleeding during surgery, the amount of bleeding after surgery, and the number of complications. The study will also measure the amount of pain after surgery, the amount of time it takes to recover from surgery, and the patient's satisfaction with the results of surgery."

Sudden smell loss (SL), a hallmark feature of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-coV-2/COVID), frequently persists well past the initial recovery; rates of unresolved anosmia (total loss) are 21%, with unresolved hyposmia (reduced smell) or parosmia (distorted smell) higher at nearly 50%. SL is now recognized as a core symptom of long COVID (LC), which also includes other impairments in mood, cognition, and sleep. Given that SL itself can negatively impact many of the same problems being recognized in the symptomatology of LC, it is likely that SL is both a symptom of LC and a contributing factor that worsens other LC symptoms. As such, successful treatment of SL could also help to improve these other LC symptoms. Smell/olfactory training (ST) is currently being studied as a treatment for COVID-related SL. ST requires twice daily practice of sniffing odorants over the course of 3 months to regenerate olfactory neurons, engage smell-related cognitive functions, and retrain the brain to smell. ST is promising as a stand-alone treatment. However, its limitations include the burden of many months of daily practice that often leads to sub-optimal compliance and dropout. The current study aims to determine whether the benefits of ST can be accelerated and enhanced by using a novel, adjunct neuromodulatory intervention to conventional ST. Trigeminal nerve stimulation (TNS) is a non-invasive, pain-free, method of neuromodulation that delivers low levels of electrical stimulation to the trigeminal circuit, having potential to enhance smell function through activation of the highly connected olfactory-intranasal trigeminal brain circuits. Prior work demonstrated TNS-enhanced psychophysical detection of odorants. Yet the effects of TNS are extensive, i.e. improved executive functioning (e.g. attention), sleep quality, and daytime sleepiness, as well as therapeutic efficacy across a number of neuropsychiatric disorders. Thus, TNS-enhanced effects of ST on SL, and TNS+ST may not only improve overall efficacy and speed of recovery of SL, but may"

The Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP) is a three-year, intensive case management intervention for pregnant and postpartum individuals who have used substances during their current or most recent pregnancy. PCAP provides mothers with a case manager with whom they meet biweekly, in the home or in other community settings. Case managers coach mothers in setting their own goals and taking steps to achieve them, provide practical assistance, serve as role models, and offer emotional support and encouragement. They connect mothers to community resources and recovery supports tailored to the participant's needs and goals. On average, case managers carry a caseload of 16 mothers/families, receive at least biweekly individual clinical supervision by a master's-level clinician, biweekly group supervision, and individual consultation with their supervisor whenever needed. Case managers work with the mother and the child with prenatal substance exposure and other family members in support of the participant's goals and recovery. This project seeks to evaluate a one-year version of PCAP (PCAP-1), aligned with the time frame of the FFPSA federal matching funds for prevention programs with evidence of effectiveness. PCAP was originally designed to be a three-year intervention as it was theorized that three years comprised a realistic time frame during which a mother can form a strong therapeutic alliance with a case manager and undergo the developmental process of making gradual behavioral changes. Indeed, for many clients, who may never have known the steady presence of a trusted parent or other individual in their lives, the beginning of that process is slow and tentative. The three-year duration was also chosen to provide clients with ample time to make fundamental changes in their lives. In the standard PCAP program, preparing for post-intervention does not begin until Year 3. The investigators now theorize that the most significant changes happen within the first year, and a one-year intervention is more consistent with the parameters of the FFPSA as the FFPSA provides matching funds for one year of evidence-based in-home services to child welfare-involved families to prevent the need for foster care. Using the recruitment strategies described above, 40 eligible people will be recruited into PCAP-1 at a third PCAP site. The one-year intervention will take place over the three-year project period, with en"

Background:
Splenic marginal zone lymphoma (SMZL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that is incurable and has a poor prognosis. The current standard of care for SMZL is rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 protein found on the surface of B-lymphocytes. Rituximab is approved for the treatment of SMZL, but it is not very effective.
Objective:
To test whether the combination of rituximab and zanubrutinib is more effective than rituximab alone in treating patients with previously untreated SMZL.
Eligibility:
Adults ages 18 and older with previously untreated SMZL.
Design:
Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests. They will have a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. They will have a bone marrow biopsy.
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups.
Group 1: Participants will receive rituximab and zanubrutinib.
Group 2: Participants will receive rituximab.
Both groups will receive treatment in cycles of 28 days.
Participants will receive rituximab through a vein (intravenous infusion) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each cycle.
Participants in Group 1 will receive zanubrutinib by mouth (orally) twice a day (BID) on days 1 to 28 of each cycle.
Participants in Group 2 will receive zanubrutinib by mouth (orally) twice a day (BID) on days 1 to 28 of each cycle.
Treatment will continue until the disease gets worse or the participant has unacceptable side effects.

Background:
Thoracotomy is a major surgery that is associated with significant postoperative pain. The current standard of care for postoperative analgesia is thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA). However, TEA is associated with some complications such as hypotension, bradycardia, and epidural hematoma. Serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) is a novel regional anesthesia technique that has been used for postoperative analgesia in thoracotomy.
Objectives:
To compare the efficacy of SAPB versus TEA in postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracotomy.
Methods:
This is a randomized double-blind controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either SAPB or TEA. The primary outcome is postoperative total morphine requirement. Secondary outcomes include intraoperative fentanyl requirement, time to the first analgesia requested by the patient, postoperative pain scores, length of hospital stay, and patient satisfactory score.
Discussion:
The results of this study will help to determine whether SAPB is a safe and effective alternative to TEA in postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracotomy."

This project addresses an urgent need to engage stakeholders as part of the research process from conceptualization to dissemination and the need for culturally sensitive evidence-based interventions for Hispanic/Latino autistic children. This project is being developed by a skilled and experienced team of investigators.
The aim of this study is to improve the health and well-being of Hispanic/Latino autistic children by improving the utilization of the evidence-based autism intervention Ayres Sensory Integration and to improve stakeholder engagement in the research process for effective outcomes. Specific aims of this project are:
Compare DT and FG on measures of stakeholder engagement
Compare the acceptability and feasibility of the adapted intervention manuals (one based on FG and another based on DT data)
Design: A randomized mixed methods design is used to evaluate stakeholder engagement. Phase one will compare two stakeholder engagement methods (Design Thinking -DT, and Focus Group - FG) and evaluate stakeholder engagement. Phase two uses data from phase one to culturally adapt the intervention (two separate intervention protocols will be adapted, one from FG data and another from DT data) and obtain stakeholder input on acceptability and feasibility for the Hispanic/Latino population. This provides a second way to measure the effectiveness of each stakeholder engagement method as we will have data to indicate which method (DT or FG) resulted in the highest-rated protocol. The data provided by this study will be used as a basis for a later comparative effectiveness study that will study the culturally adapted protocol's outcomes.
All sessions will be held in Spanish and/or English based on the groups' preferences. Since our intent is to hear the voices of Hispanic/Latino stakeholders, it seems valuable to hold focus groups in Spanish when the participants are Spanish as first language speakers (hereafter referred to as Spanish-first) with audio recordings and later transcription into English for analysis. To accommodate those who prefer English, we will make every effort to group these participants together. When, and if, the Spanish-first groups include participants who prefer English, we will have a Spanish to English translator available. In other words, we will be respectful of each participant's language to optimize their comfort in the engagement sessions.

The flipped learning model offers students and faculty members the opportunity to teach a course other than the traditional one. It is a blended teaching method in which the activities carried out in the classroom are integrated outside the classroom and the teaching activities carried out outside the classroom are integrated into the classroom. In this model, students can access videos, presentations or recordings prepared as course materials before coming to class, through technological devices such as computers, tablets and smartphones. Students have the opportunity to watch and listen to the prepared course content wherever and whenever they want, as many times as they want. Watching as many resources as they want according to their own learning speed brings about effective and easy learning. Afterwards, when the student comes to the classroom, the information learned is reinforced by the instructor, and the areas that are not understood are solved with questions and answers. Lesson hours for students who take an active role in the classroom are also important in terms of using time effectively. The student is at the center of this learning method and the student assumes individual learning responsibility. Considering nursing education within the scope of all these beneficial results, it is obvious that effective learning will be achieved. This study aimed to help students easily adapt to the principles of asepsis. Videos containing the principles of asepsis will be presented to the experimental group students 2 weeks before the infection control course (11/11/2023). Normal lecture and practice periods will begin between (11/11/2023-12/12/2023) and the education will last 4 weeks in total. When the study period ends, students will be given a knowledge test and then again 2 weeks later. The implementation period of the study will last until 20/12/2023. Control group students will be educated only during the normal course. The research will be conducted with first-year students of Bilecik Şeyh Edebali University Nursing Department."

The purpose of this study is to test the effects of the Mentored Planning to be Active + Family (MPBA+F) intervention on physical activity outcomes (MVPA, exercise bouts, sedentary behavior) and health outcomes (body composition: BMI, body fat, % body fat, weight) among rural Appalachian 7/8th grade children suffering from overweight and obesity. Having teens deliver the content via structured peer mentoring increases social support, motivation, and self-regulation to sustain PA behaviors to improve health outcomes as children enter high school. Using local residents for intervention delivery leverages rural Appalachians' preference to receive health information via established social networks and extends delivery of the program into the community. This study is a community-based randomized controlled trial targeting 7th grade students in rural Appalachia. Half (n = 144) will receive MPBA+F; the other half (n = 144) will receive self-guided (usual care) modules. Tenth-grade (n = 73) students from the same rural Appalachian counties will serve as peer mentors delivering MPBA for the peer mentoring group. Parents will provide a family reinforcement program during 8th grade and provide assessments of child behaviors and health outcomes. The long-term goal is to reduce the high rates of OW, OB/EO and type 2 diabetes in Appalachia youth through effective, sustainable interventions. Improving self-regulation, self-efficacy, and social support to increase intentional exercise and MVPA among underserved youth suffering from early-onset OB/EO builds healthier lifestyle behaviors at a critical development time."

The main objective of this study is to analyze the blood samples obtained from patients with brain tumors in order to detect and quantify the circulating DNA (ctDNA) of tumor cells on it. These DNA fragments are expelled into the bloodstream by mechanisms still unknown as a result of numerous processes of apoptosis and necrosis of tumor cells. By analyzing them through a ddPCR, the investigators will try to detect the specific mutations present in this tumoral ctDNA, allowing the team to confirm the presence of a glioma-type tumor, and providing real-time information of its classification as astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma.
The secondary objectives are:
To correlate the results of the tissue samples with those of the blood samples, the concentration of ctDNA found, and the magnetic resonance images prior to the biopsies.
To compare other variables such as time, money, and the impact on the patient (recovery time after biopsies, pain, sequelae,...) between the liquid biopsy procedure and the conventional tissue biopsy procedure.

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a leading cause of preventable death in the United States. Young adults (ages 18-24) are at particularly high risk for AUD, with 40% of young adults meeting criteria for AUD. AUD is a chronic relapsing disorder, and relapse is a major problem for young adults with AUD. The investigators have developed a new behavioral intervention, called Cognitive-Motivational Positive Reinforcement (CM-PST), that is designed to increase alcohol abstinence in young adults with AUD. CM-PST is a tailored behavioral intervention that enables young adults with AUD to successfully manage and overcome everyday life challenges influencing their alcohol intake. CM-PST is designed to be delivered remotely via videoconferences in individual sessions over 12 weeks. The first 4 sessions will be delivered weekly, and the remaining 4 sessions every other week. CM-PST will teach participants problem-solving skills using a structured 5-step method. In addition, participants will receive incentives for alcohol abstinence and submission of urine samples twice/wk. The investigators will test the efficacy of CM-PST in a 2-arm randomized control trial (R00 phase) in young adults aged 18-24 yr who meet AUD criteria. Participants will be randomized to either CM-PST (42 participants) or CM-only (42 participants) control group.

During hemodialysis (HD) the blood of the patient pass an extracorporeal circuit that contains a dialyzer for rinsing and a venous chamber (air trap) to prevent from air embolism through the return blood into the patient. However, air traps in clinical use have limited capacity to prevent from microemboli of air to enter the return bloodline and deposit as emboli in the body such as lungs, heart and brain. The Investigator developed the air trap Emboless that was patented in Europe, USA and India. In vitro studies showed significantly better reduction of microemboli contaminations than air traps compared to that in clinical use. The present randomized clinical trial compares two different air traps used by the same patients in a cross-over design (as pairs) using the Emboless compared with the Fresenius 4008/5008 (F5008). Chronic HD patients are randomized to perform the first HD with either their standard air trap (F5008) in the venous bloodline tubing or using the Emboless bloodline and vice versa. Each patient is included to make two paired series. A maximum of 30 patients are planned. Each with 2 series of each two different sets of air traps that would give a total of 120 dialyses. A safety committee evaluates if significantly worse outcome appears especially with the Emboless. During HD the microbubbles are counted by a GAMPT ultrasound device using two probes. One probe is set at the inlet side of the air trap and the second at the outlet side. The outlet side represents data of microbubbles in the blood that are entering into the patient. Comparative non-parametric paired analyses are performed between the air traps. Monitoring of the study is performed."

Pancreaticoduodenectomy is the most common pancreatic surgery for malignant tumors of the pancreas and periampullary region. The pancreatic neck transection level is an important factor affecting the postoperative morbidity and mortality of pancreaticoduodenectomy. The current standard of pancreatic neck transection is the conventional pancreatic neck transection level, which is 10-15mm from the left side of the portal vein. However, the conventional pancreatic neck transection level is too close to the portal vein, which may increase the risk of pancreatic fistula and postoperative bleeding. The extended pancreatic neck transection level is ≥5mm and ≤10mm beyond the left side of the portal vein. The extended pancreatic neck transection level is more than 10mm from the left side of the portal vein, which may reduce the risk of pancreatic fistula and postoperative bleeding. However, there is no consensus on the extended pancreatic neck transection level.
This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial. The subjects are patients with benign or resectable malignant tumors of the lower common bile duct, Vater ampulla, head or uncinate process of the pancreas. The subjects are randomly divided into two groups: the extended pancreatic neck transection group and the conventional pancreatic neck transection group. The extended pancreatic neck transection group obtains extended pancreatic neck transection during laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The conventional pancreatic neck transection group obtains conventional pancreatic neck transection during laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy. The primary outcome is the incidence of clinically relevant pancreatic fistula. The secondary outcomes are the location of the pancreatic duct in the pancreatic transverse section, surgical performance of pancreaticojejunostomy, postoperative morbidity and mortality."

The scientific literature points to the beneficial properties of probiotics in the process of regulating metabolism, yet at the same time, some scientific papers question the effectiveness and the safety of probiotics. In turn, postbiotics and metabiotics are preparations of inanimate microorganisms and / or their components, which are directly identified with the safety of their use and the health benefits of the host. Due to the chemical structure of postbiotics and metabiotics, it is found that they have many health benefits; in particular, they have a local effect on certain tissues of the intestinal epithelium, and influence on many other organs and tissues. It is postbiotics metabolites and metabiotics structural cell fragments that create the appearance of a therapeutic effect of probiotics, which, in turn, limits the risk of introducing living microorganisms into a weakened immune defence.
The practical use of probiotics and the study of the mechanism of their action made lately to find that a certain level of biological activity is preserved by dead probiotic cells and even their lysates, which are the natural mixes of metabiotic and postbiotic substances; a biological activity which is strongly oriented toward gut health and immune system regulation. Because probiotic lysates demonstrated biological activity without any of the potential adverse side effects associated with live bacterial cells, one of the future goal is research of the novel postbiotics and metabiotics substances, their individual structures and biological characteristics for understanding their way of communications with host cells and microbiota representatives.
Considering the high biological activity and safety of postbiotics and metabiotics, it can be concluded that such a treatment vector will be promising in the near future. That's why our investigation will concentrate on postbiotic, a supplement containing dry fermented cell lysate and DNA fragments of the probiotic strain L. rhamnosus DV - NRRLB-68023. Recent scientific animal studies on the stated issues point to the benefits of some postbiotics in treating metabolic disorders.

The main purpose of this project is to investigate the accuracy of pocket-sized ultrasound (PsUS) in the diagnosis of pediatric elbow fractures. The primary research objective is to determine the test performance characteristics of PSUS performed by pediatric emergency medicine physicians compared to radiography for the detection of pediatric elbow fractures. The project will consist of two parts, first involving a feasibility study and followed by an active study. This project will consist of two parts, involving first a brief feasibility study followed by a pilot study conducted in an urban pediatric emergency department (Comer Children's Hospital in Chicago, IL). For the feasibility phase, the purpose is to demonstrate that novice PsUS users are able to obtain accurate and adequate imaging for interpretation. This phase will initially involve the study providers receiving the elbow PsUS exam training. Once trained, each study provider will obtain 3 elbow exams of participants between the ages of 1-16 years old. Providers will use the standardized views reviewed in the ultrasound training to perform the exam, with verbal consent obtained from each participant's parent for inclusion in the feasibility study. These images will be reviewed by study staff to ensure US examiners are obtaining the correct standardized views. Once the feasibility exams are completed, the study providers are able to begin active study recruitment which will involve recruiting children between the ages of 1-16 years old with isolated acute elbow pain. Parents will initially be approached in the emergency department (ED), with written consent obtained if interested and eligible. Once consented, patients will undergo bilaterally standardized elbow exams using the pocket-sized ultrasound. All images will be stored on a password protected, cloud-based imaging database with all identifying information removed. After the exam, a basic assessment of the images will be made by the bedside ultrasound provider, as positive, negative or equivocal for signs of elbow fracture, but before reviewing any radiographic imaging. Following the ultrasound exam, patients will undergo standard clinical care for acute elbow injury per primary ED team which may consist of Xray or possible bedside nursemaid reduction. When applicable, study investigators will review the final blinded radiology readings of the initial or subsequent x-ray images after the patient encounter.

Gambling addiction is a major public health problem. Although a number of studies have provided support for the hypothesis that gambling addiction is the result of reward processing dysfunction in the brain, neuroimaging studies have produced inconsistent results, suggesting either hypo- or hyper-reactivity to rewards in gambling addiction. These inconsistencies have been the subject of intense debate, but remain unexplained to this day, hampering our understanding of the disease and the development of effective therapeutic strategies. The aim of this project is to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to reconcile these inconsistencies. A particular feature of this model is that it takes into account inter-individual differences, as well as the multifactorial nature of gaming addiction.
Objectives:
Primary objective: This project will test the hypothesis that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyper-reactivity to emotional stimuli. The investigators further hypothesize that these two brain phenotypes characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers, so-called impulsive vs. emotional, respectively.
Secondary objective: This project will also seek to determine whether the brain phenotypes proposed above are capable of predicting gambling behavior outside the laboratory. To do this, the investigators will use Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA), which involves using participants' smartphones to perform repeated, real-time sampling of their gambling behavior and emotions in real life. The investigators hypothesize that a significant difference in reactivity between the striatum and the amygdala will be associated with a strong correlation between 1) gambling behavior and positive emotions in impulsive gamblers, and 2) gambling behavior and negative emotions in emotional gamblers.
Study design:
The primary hypothesis will be tested using cognitive tasks performed by participants in an fMRI scanner. In order to assess striatal reactivity to reward, the investigators will use fMRI combined with a reward task. The investigators will use fMRI combined with a facial emotion recognition task to measure the reactivity of the amygdala to emotional stimuli. These tasks will allow the investig"

Primary ovarian cancer (OC) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy. The 5-year survival rate of patients with stage I OC is 90%-95%, but the 5-year survival rate of patients with stage II-IV OC is only 30%-40%. The standard treatment for stage I OC is surgery alone, but the recurrence rate is still high. Therefore, adjuvant chemotherapy is recommended for patients with high risk of recurrence. However, the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy is still controversial. In addition, the toxicity and side effects of chemotherapy are also very serious, which seriously affect the quality of life of patients. Therefore, it is very important to find a safe and effective adjuvant treatment for patients with stage I OC.

SIBO occurs when the homeostatic mechanisms of the small intestine are disturbed. The two main conditions that favor microbial overgrowth in the small intestine are decreased acid secretion from the stomach and small bowel dyskinesia. The literature is scarce concerning the effects of SIBO on critically ill patients. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effects of SIBO on mechanically ventilated patients. It is a non-invasive observational study employing a modified technique to obtain exhaled air from the ventilator tubes to perform a standard hydrogen breath test for SIBO diagnosis. Lactulose is used as a substrate. Specifically, each patient is administered 20 g of lactulose diluted in 400 ml of water through the nasogastric tube. Measurements are performed at 0-15-30-45-60-90-120-180 min from lactulose administration. During measurements, a valve attached to a collecting bag at the end of the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, is kept open and the collecting bag is filled by several patient exhalations. After valve closure and bag isolation, the air is drawn by a 50 ml polyethylene syringe which is connected to the valve system to prevent losses and/or contamination. Then the air is blown into the breath hydrogen monitor and the expired hydrogen measurement is recorded. The hydrogen breath test is repeated at predetermined, protocol-based time intervals for all participants included in the study; 1st/day of admission, 3rd, 5th and 7th day of ICU stay. The 1st day measurement serves as a measure of eligibility, and patients exhibiting abnormal values of hydrogen breath testing at Day 1 are excluded from the study. An increase by more than 20 ppm of eH2 from baseline within 90 min was considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. Moreover, an increase by more than"

The aim of this study was to investigate whether exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is present following exercise in patient after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and if so, if it changes with exercise intensity.
Methods: A repeated measures and single-blinded randomized study were done. Thirty-eight patients 24 hours after TKA were randomly assigned to either low intensity exercises (LIE) group or high intensity exercises (HIE) group. An exercise programs lasted for five days during the hospitalization period. Pain severity was assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 mm). Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured over quadriceps and biceps brachii and muscles immediately before and after exercise.
Results: The results of the study showed that EIH was present in both groups. However, the EIH was more pronounced in the HIE group."

Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide. In Nigeria, BC is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall. The incidence of BC in Nigeria is rising rapidly, and the disease is now the leading cause of cancer death in women. The rising incidence of BC in Nigeria is due to a combination of factors, including the increasing prevalence of risk factors, such as obesity and reproductive factors, and the lack of organized screening programs. The rising incidence of BC in Nigeria is also due to the increasing prevalence of high-risk human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) mutations, which are more common in African populations than in other populations.

The goal of this new model is to improve food security and quality of life in persons older than 60 years of age discharged from the hospital with a diagnosis of malnutrition. The model has been developed to facilitate cross-referrals and transmission of structured nutrition care documentation from an acute care hospital setting to a meal provision organization and then for the meal provision organization to use the referral data to increase delivery of nutrition care (medical nutrition therapy- MNT) and meals (medically tailored meals - MTM). The primary subjects for this study are adults older than 60 years of age with malnutrition, with particular emphasis on recruiting sites who serve individuals who are Black, Latino, Indigenous and Native American, and individuals living in rural areas of the country. The components of the proposed new model of cross-referral, data reporting, and communication (including data transfer) have the potential to be scalable throughout the US. However, barriers and facilitators to data transfer and MNT/MTM provision, cost of implementation, and potential impact on outcomes must be evaluated for the model to be replicable. The results of this study will generate new data on the model of care feasibility, rates of malnutrition within older adults at the study sites, impact of MNT with MTM provision on food security, determinants of malnutrition, and quality of life to inform future scalability of the model."

Background:
Reduction mammaplasty is a common procedure performed in adolescents. Post-operative pain is a significant concern for patients and their families. The investigators hypothesize that intra-operative subpectoral bupivacaine will reduce post-operative pain and narcotic use in adolescents undergoing reduction mammaplasty.
Objectives:
To determine if intra-operative subpectoral bupivacaine will reduce post-operative pain and narcotic use in adolescents undergoing reduction mammaplasty.
Eligibility:
Female patients undergoing bilateral reduction mammaplasty at Connecticut Children's Medical Center from 1/1/2022-12/31/2025.
Design:
Patients will be randomized into either the study group (receiving intraoperative subpectoral bupivacaine) or the control group (will not receive subpectoral bupivacaine.) Block randomization will be performed using randomizer.org. For every forty patients, twenty will be randomized into the control group, and twenty into the bupivacaine group. Patients will be blinded to the which group they are placed in. The PI and study staff are not blinded.

Per standard protocol, patients will undergo urine pregnancy testing in the pre-operative area. If results are positive, patients will be informed of the results in a private area. Surgery will be postponed and patients will be then excluded from the study. Patients will undergo their procedure with their assigned intervention. Intra-operative anesthetic and pain control regimens will otherwise be standardized with the anesthesia team to remove other confounding factors/variables. Administration of the saline/bupivacaine will be just below the fascia of the pectroalis major. This will occur following resection of the specimen and achievement of hemostasis, prior to closure of the wounds. Injections will be in a fan-like pattern, beginning at the inferolateral border of the pectoral is muscle, extending superomedially with injection, spanning the anterior surface of the pectroalis major. This will be performed under direct visualization; no imaging assistance is necessary. Each patient"

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Radiation therapy is a common treatment for breast cancer. It is used to treat the tumor and reduce the risk of the cancer coming back. Radiation therapy can cause side effects, such as skin reactions. These side effects can be uncomfortable and can affect the patient's quality of life. Researchers want to see if a new technique called Spot Delete can reduce the amount of radiation that reaches the skin. This technique is used in proton therapy, a type of radiation therapy that uses protons instead of x-rays. Protons are positively charged particles that are smaller than x-rays. They can be aimed more precisely at the tumor, which may reduce the amount of radiation that reaches the skin.
The researchers will compare the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy with the Spot Delete technique to the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive regular proton therapy. The researchers will also compare the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy with the Spot Delete technique to the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive x-ray radiation therapy.
The researchers will also compare the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy with the Spot Delete technique to the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy without the Spot Delete technique.
The researchers will also compare the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy with the Spot Delete technique to the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy with a different type of proton therapy called intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT).
The researchers will also compare the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy with the Spot Delete technique to the amount of radiation that reaches the skin in patients who receive proton therapy with a different type of proton therapy called pencil beam scanning (PBS).

The EMBOL-AF is a multicenter, international, observational study designed as a retrospective registry that will investigate the characteristics of systemic arterial embolic events after treatment of atrial fibrillation by catheter ablation. Due to the retrospective nature of the study, the registry is specially focused on cerebral embolism (stroke and TIA) because these are not only the most frequent and clinically relevant but also the most susceptible to underreporting. However, all embolism associated to AFAbl will be included. This study will gather all clinically relevant aspects and data of all cases of arterial embolism that have occurred over the last 5 years in the centers that will participate in the registry. Based on these reported cases, the incidence, management and outcomes of embolic events (particularly stroke and TIA) will be studied.
The primary objectives of the study are:
To study the acute clinical profile, symptoms, signs and results of image techniques of stroke/TIA associated to AFAbl (or technically akin procedures such as left atrial macroreentry mapping and ablation).
To study the acute therapeutic management of these events.
To study the sequelae and clinical consequences at 3 months of follow-up.
Secondary objectives:
To study whether the risk of stroke/TIA is more frequently associated to any AFAbl technique.
To study whether the severity of stroke/TIA is associated to any specific AFAbl technique.
To study whether other measures associated with AFAbl procedures have any impact on the incidence and severity of stroke/TIA namely transesophageal echocardiography, discontinuance of oral anticoagulants, target intraprocedural anticoagulation, and use of general anesthesia.
Primary and secondary objectives are applicable to other symptomatic systemic arterial embolic events."

Cellulitis is a common cause of emergency department (ED) visits, and many patients are hospitalized. Current evidence is lacking regarding the optimal management of cellulitis. If high-dose cephalexin is found to be superior to standard-dose cephalexin, this will change practice, with the potential to reduce unnecessary IV antibiotic use, hospitalization, and costs. The results will help inform future skin and soft tissue infection treatment guidelines.
The investigators will conduct a multicentre, parallel-arm double-blind, individually randomized trial comparing high-dose (1000 mg) cephalexin to standard-dose (500 mg) cephalexin to treat ED adult patients with cellulitis. This is a superiority trial. The trial will be conducted at 8 Canadian EDs. A total sample size of 446 patients (223 per group) will be required.
The investigators will include adults (age ≥18 years) diagnosed with non-purulent cellulitis and determined by the treating emergency physician to be eligible for outpatient oral antibiotics.

The aim of this study is to compare the amount and type of biofilm on zirconia vs. titanium implants.
The study will be carried out in the Master of Oral Surgery and Implantology of the Faculty of Dentistry of the Complutense University of Madrid (Spain).
This study will be carried out in accordance with the principles established by the Declaration of Helsinki and will be conducted under the approval of the Clinical Trials Committee of the Hospital Clínico San Carlos of Madrid.
The selection of subjects with indication for osseointegrated implant placement will be based on a previous oral and radiological examination by means of a periapical radiograph and a panoramic radiograph and/or Cone Beam Computed Tomography , together with the completion of a clinical questionnaire.
For implant placement, a linear incision of the edentulous ridge and an intrasulcular incision of the adjacent teeth will be made using a #15 scalpel blade and a #3 Bard Parker scalpel handle.
Once this is done, a full-thickness flap will be raised and the alveolar ridge will be reamed, following the manufacturer's indications, to place a titanium implant (Phibo® Aurea Evolution) of adequate dimensions in the control group or a zirconia implant (Z system®) in the test group, checking that there is an adequate insertion torque of 30Ncm or more and a cover screw will be placed.

Finally, physical anti-inflammatory measures (intermittent local icing for at least 30 minutes) and salt and water rinses 3 times a day for 7 days will be prescribed.
Three months after implant placement in the mandible and four months in the maxilla, the final screw-retained metal-ceramic crown will be loaded with a transepithelial abutment made of titanium for titanium implants or zirconia for zirconia implants.

Puzzles, which are among the active learning tools, are frequently preferred today because they make learning fun, are economical, improve problem-solving skills and offer understandable learning. Puzzles increase students' motivation and self-confidence by turning complex concepts into a hobby. In the literature, studies investigating the learning situation with puzzles have examined undergraduate students in different sciences. Even though there are different disciplines, undergraduate students' efforts to search for the right answer, their self-confidence in finding the right answer, and their involvement in the active learning process rather than passive memorization reveal the increase in their knowledge levels. It has been observed that the teaching method with puzzles not only facilitates learning, but also guides students to better recognize their knowledge gaps and weaknesses. Considering nursing education, it is obvious that teaching concepts encountered for the first time with puzzles by providing an active environment in the classroom will increase students' motivation and knowledge level. Despite research conducted with different disciplines in the literature, there are few studies examining the effect of puzzles on the level of learning concepts related to the nursing profession. In this research, the concepts of vital signs, which have an important place in both the student life and professional life of first-year nursing students, will be discussed. An active and fun environment will be provided to students with puzzles on the subjects of respiration, pulse and blood pressure, where students have difficulty in learning the conceptual structure. In this context, it is predicted that the education provided with puzzles will contribute positively to the knowledge level of the students. A pre-test will be given to all groups before the theoretical lesson on vital signs. Afterwards, the students in the experimental group will apply puzzles for two weeks (12-27/11/2023). Afterwards, final tests will be performed. The work will continue until 10/12/2023. Control group students will be educated only during the normal course. The research will be conducted with first-year students of Bilecik Şeyh Edebali University Nursing Department."

Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory skin disease of unknown etiology, characterized by facial erythema, telangiectasia, papules, pustules, and facial swelling. The pathogenesis of rosacea is not fully understood, but it is believed that it is multifactorial, with genetic, environmental, and immunological factors playing a role. The treatment of rosacea is challenging, and there is no universally accepted standard of care. The current treatment options include topical and oral antibiotics, topical retinoids, and laser therapy. However, there is a need for more effective and safer treatment options.
Ivermectin is a drug that is commonly used to treat parasitic infections. It has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, and it has been used to treat a variety of skin conditions, including acne, psoriasis, and eczema. Ivermectin has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects in rosacea.
The investigators hypothesize that the combination of ivermectin and laser therapy may be more effective in treating rosacea than laser therapy alone. The investigators will conduct a randomized, split-face clinical trial to test this hypothesis.
The investigators will recruit 20 patients with rosacea who will be randomly assigned to receive either laser therapy alone or laser therapy combined with ivermectin 1% cream. The investigators will assess the efficacy of the treatment regimens using a variety of clinical and laboratory measures.
The investigators believe that the combination of ivermectin and laser therapy may be a safe and effective treatment option for rosacea."

May-Thurner syndrome (MTS) is a condition where the left common iliac vein (LCIV) is compressed by the right common iliac artery (RCIA). This compression can cause symptoms of left leg swelling, pain and cramping. The diagnosis of MTS is based on the presence of symptoms and the demonstration of compression of the LCIV by the RCIA. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of MTS is computed tomography (CT) angiography. However, this is an invasive test and is not available in all hospitals. Duplex ultrasound is a non-invasive test that is widely available in the NHS. It is used to assess the blood flow in the arteries and veins. It is not currently used to diagnose MTS. The investigators aim to assess the accuracy of duplex ultrasound in the diagnosis of MTS. The investigators will also assess the reproducibility of the measurements taken by the investigators. The investigators will recruit 100 patients who are referred to the vascular ultrasound department for a scan of the LCIV. The investigators will measure the diameter of the LCIV using duplex ultrasound. The investigators will also measure the diameter of the LCIV using CT angiography.

Convergence insufficiency (CI) is a common binocular vision disorder in children and adults. It is characterized by a decreased ability to converge the eyes, which can lead to symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, and eye strain. CI can be caused by a variety of factors, including eye muscle weakness, neurological disorders, and trauma. Symptoms of CI can be debilitating and can interfere with daily activities.
Visual training is a common treatment for CI. It involves exercises to improve eye muscle coordination and binocular vision. The goal of visual training is to improve the ability of the eyes to work together and reduce symptoms.
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of visual training in improving the quality of life of patients with CI. The study will compare the quality of life of patients who have received visual training to the quality of life of patients who have not received visual training. The study will also evaluate the relationship between the severity of CI and the quality of life.

The NHS is facing a crisis in staff well-being. The investigators aim to explore the impact of FitnessGenes' personalized recommendations, through genetic and lifestyle data, to improve health and well-being of NHS staff. The investigators will recruit NHS staff from multiple NHS trusts to partake in the study. Following consent to partake in the trial, participants will be asked to complete a pre-trial questionnaire which will explore health and wellbeing interests and motivations, alongside taking a baseline measure of mental and physical wellbeing using the 5-item World Health Organization Well-being Index (WHO-5) which has been clinically validated. This, and all further questionnaires, will be completed online. Participants will undertake a DNA test provided by FitnessGenes, free of charge. This test will require participants to provide a saliva sample via a spit test. This sample will then be analysed at an ISO-accredited laboratory and results provided back to the participant within 2-3 weeks. Test result data is stored in an encrypted format and saliva samples are anonymized using unique barcodes printed on the collection tubes, which do not contain any Personal Information. User identity data (email, name, address, contact info etc.) is kept in a separate database to user personal data (demographic, biometric, lifestyle, genetic etc.). This means all personal data is already kept in an anonymised form. Once their genetic data is added to a participant's FitnessGenes account, they will be asked to spend a week exploring this upgraded information. A feedback questionnaire will be completed, 3 weeks after they have received their results, to assess participant's experiences of the platform and their results. At this stage, some semi-structured interviews may be conducted, to those who consent to this, to gain further insight. A 3-month follow up, after the baseline measures were taken, will be completed to assess whether the platform has had any long-lasting impacts on participants' health and wellbeing. This follow up will be completed via a short online questionnaire.

Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis (IPA) is a life-threatening fungal infection that occurs in patients with a weakened immune system. It is a major cause of death in patients with acute leukemia, and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). The diagnosis of IPA is based on clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria, but these are often inconclusive. The development of non-invasive diagnostic tools for IPA is a major unmet need.
The investigators propose to study the role of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the diagnosis of IPA. VOCs are organic compounds that are released in the exhaled air. The investigators will collect breath samples from patients with acute leukemia and HSCT and analyze the VOC profile in these samples. The investigators will compare the VOC profile in patients with IPA to the VOC profile in patients without IPA. The investigators will also compare the VOC profile in patients with IPA to the VOC profile in patients with other lung diseases.

Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is the most common cause of neurologic chronic disability in young adults. Fatigue is one of the principal symptom in this disease. Fatigue in a subject with MS is present every day, gets worse as the day progresses, with the heat and humidity, it is sudden and more severe than normal, it interferes with physical performance. Fatigue is prevalent in the MS population and is a significant health problem, negatively impacting activities of daily living, ability to work, social life and quality of life. In 1963 it was demonstrated how mechanical vibration, applied to a single muscle, at suitable amplitudes and frequencies, was capable of selectively and differentially activating primary (Ia), secondary (IIb) or GTO spindle afferents, depending on the characteristics of the stimulus. So with appropriate frequencies and amplitude of vibration, it is possible both to select the activated afferents, and to determine the frequency of action potentials sent to the Central Nervous System. The purpose of this study is to verify how the use of vibrations can induce positive effects on the mobility and postural control of patients with MS, as well as reduce fatigue. The study is an interventional type. The subjects are undergoing to baseline examinations (T0) including 3D gait analysis (using a BTS system), stabilometric analysis, and a battery of neuropsychological assessments. Subsequently, eligible subjects are undergoing to intensive multidisciplinary training for a total of 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks, with a total of 20 treatment sessions. The experimental group receive additional vibration treatment. At the end of the treatment cycle (T1), the patients will undergo the same evaluation tests as at baseline.

Lung transplantation is the only effective treatment for patients with end-stage severe chronic respiratory diseases. However, the long-term survival rate of lung transplantation is still low, and the main cause of death is chronic rejection. Therefore, it is very important to monitor the rejection of lung transplantation. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of lung transplantation rejection is the lung biopsy. However, the traditional transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB) is limited by the small amount of lung tissue obtained, the high risk of bleeding, and the low diagnostic efficacy. Therefore, the investigators propose to use transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBCB) to obtain lung tissue samples for the diagnosis of lung transplantation rejection. The investigators will conduct a prospective, randomized, controlled study to compare the diagnostic efficacy of TBCB with that of traditional TBLB. The investigators will also compare the incidence of complications and the sample size of the two methods. The investigators will also compare the number of alveoli, blood vessels, and the percentage of the area of lung parenchyma without artifacts in the biopsy samples of the two methods. The investigators will also compare the number of attempts to get five samples. The investigators will also compare the diagnostic efficacy of the two methods in the diagnosis of acute rejection, chronic rejection, and rejection with infection.

Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) in monochorionic twins may negatively impact the pregnancy. There is a substantial risk of fetal deterioration resulting in (iatrogenic) preterm birth or even intrauterine demise of one, or both fetuses. There are important unresolved challenges on a diagnostic level and underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of sFGR have not been fully clarified. The current diagnostic classification system based on three different umbilical artery flow patterns has no increasing scale of severity and the observed flow patterns may be volatile in nature. This hinders optimal diagnostic management and complicates outcome prediction as the survival outcome differs per umbilical artery flow type. Consequently, parents encounter a great deal of uncertainty during the pregnancy. Since there is no treatment available for sFGR, predicting fetal deterioration is key in preventing single or double demise. By testing several predictors, the investigators are aiming to improve outcome prediction at the time of sFGR diagnosis. The investigators furthermore hypothesize that additional ultrasound parameters could be of benefit in making the current classification system more accurate and less variable. Extensive histological placental examinations will shine a light on microscopic abnormalities which can increase our knowledge of the pathophysiology. Examining neurodevelopment of sFGR twins at two years of age will additionally be of great value for our understanding of the impact of sFGR and contribute to adequate patient counselling.
Our study will evaluate the impact of a sFGR pregnancy on parental mental health and parent-to-infant(s) attachment, which has not been carried out this extensively before."

Transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) youth are at high risk for suicidal ideation and behavior. The investigators propose to develop and test a digital platform to improve mental health outcomes for TGD youth and their caregivers. The platform will be designed to provide TGD youth and their caregivers with information and skills to improve mental health and reduce suicidal ideation and behavior. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of the platform. The investigators will recruit 500 TGD youth and their caregivers and randomly assign them to an immediate access group (n=250) or a deferred access group (n=250). The immediate access group will have access to the platform immediately after enrollment. The deferred access group will have access to the platform at 6 months. The investigators will assess the primary outcome of suicidal ideation at 12 months post intervention. The investigators will also assess secondary outcomes of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and family communication and acceptance. The investigators will use a mixed methods approach to assess the acceptability of the platform and the mechanisms by which the platform improves mental health outcomes. The investigators will also conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the cost of the platform and its impact on health care utilization. The investigators will use a community-based participatory research approach to develop the platform and to ensure that it is culturally appropriate and acceptable to TGD youth and their caregivers.

The Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment (ANCA) is a comprehensive assessment of substance use and related disorders. The ANCA is a set of neuropsychological tests that assesses the cognitive, emotional, and behavioural processes that are involved in substance use and addiction. The ANCA is designed to be used in clinical settings to help clinicians better understand the underlying causes of addiction and to develop more effective treatment plans. The ANCA is also used in research studies to help scientists better understand the neurobiology of addiction.
The ANCA is a set of computerized tests that assesses a variety of cognitive and emotional processes. The tests are designed to measure the way the brain works when it is processing information related to substance use. The tests are also designed to measure the way the brain works when it is processing information related to emotions.
The ANCA is a valuable tool for clinicians and researchers who are interested in understanding the causes of addiction and developing more effective treatment plans. The ANCA can help clinicians better understand the underlying causes of addiction and to develop more effective treatment plans. The ANCA can also help researchers better understand the neurobiology of addiction."

The term contextual effect has been used to reinforce the view that the placebo effect should be understood as an effect related to the therapeutic context, and not restricted to the use of inert treatments. Thus, the placebo effect is inherent to any therapeutic context and also can be used to enhance the effects of treatment with active components. There is evidence of the effectiveness of manipulative therapy in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP), however, for most physical therapy interventions, its effect is small. Thus, strategies to enhance the effects of this therapy, such as through the use of context factors, may contribute to better therapeutic outcomes. The literature describes that positively induced expectations can trigger a placebo effect. There are previous studies that investigated the effect of different speech on SMT in patients with chronic neck pain, but there is no study in CLBP. In addition, no previous study investigated further the perceptions of patients regarding the content and perceptions of the videos. The objective of this study will be to identify the short-term impact of positive, neutral, or negative speech on pain intensity (primary outcome). The secondary outcomes assessed will be the global perceived effect of improvement, patient's expectations regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) intervention, and perception of empathy in the therapeutic encounter in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Methods: it will be a randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor. It will be investigated the effect of the use of a hidden conditioning procedure and the induction of positive expectations on pain intensity after the administration of a manipulative therapy approach. This is an exploratory randomized clinical trial. The three groups will receive one session of SMT after watching the video proposed for their group. First participants will be assessed for pain intensity, low back pain disability, psychosocial aspects, and expectations related to treatment. Secondly, a researcher not involved in the recruitment of patients will randomly allocate the participants into three different groups (G1- group submitted to positive expectation speech, G2- group submitted to neutral expectation speech, and G3- group submitted to negative expectation speech). After the allocation, the participants will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering positive, negative, or neutral messages regarding SMT. And finally, a physiotherapist will administer one session of SMT and participants will be re-assessed"

The goal of this study is to evaluate the effects of transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) on functional connectivity in the brain. tFUS is a new technology that is both noninvasive and may be focally applied to deep brain targets. tFUS utilizes transducers which contain piezoelectric elements to produce pulses of ultrasonic waves that summate deep in the brain. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) uses a single transducer fixed in a head-worn apparatus on the scalp to produce ultrasonic waves deep into the brain.
The investigators will use tFUS to stimulate the nucleus accumbens (NAC), a brain region that is involved in reward and motivation. The investigators will use a neuroimaging technique called resting state functional connectivity to measure the strength of the functional connectivity between the NAC and connected areas, including the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and sensory areas of the brain at baseline, and then will determine whether tFUS increases or decreases the resting-state connectivity between these regions after the NAC has been stimulated."

Depression is the leading mental health contributor to the Global Burden of Disease. The World Health Organization's mhGAP initiative advocates the use of brief psychological therapies such as behavioral activation or antidepressant medications as first-line options for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in primary care settings, but not all patients will fully remit on either treatment. It is likely that different patients will respond to different treatments, but the optimal treatment for each individual remains unknown (and which patients are unlikely to respond to either treatment and should be referred to specialist care). Enhancing our ability to determine the optimal intervention for a particular patient has the potential to enhance the overall effectiveness of mental health care delivery in a more cost-efficient manner. This is a critical gap in knowledge in the treatment of depression across clinical settings globally. The main objective of the OptimizeD study is to determine whether different patients respond differentially to brief psychological treatment or a widely used generic SSRI and, if so, whether one can optimize outcomes in a cost-effective fashion for primary care patients with moderate to severe depression. The study has two specific aims and two exploratory aims:
Specific Aim 1 (Clinical and Functional Outcomes): To evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a precision treatment rule (PTR) on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either psychotherapy based on behavioral activation called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) or antidepressant medication (fluoxetine). The study will use machine learning to develop the PTR, using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not.
Specific Aim 2 (Cost-effectiveness Outcomes): To assess the costs of optimal vs. non-optimal treatments and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing relative costs and effectiveness between those who were randomly allocated to their optimal treatment with those who were randomly allocated to a non-optimal treatment, based on the PTR developed in Aim 1. The investigators hypothesize that optimizing will be more cost-effective than not.

Pulmonary function is an important factor affecting the recurrence of incisional hernia. The investigators found that the incidence of pulmonary function impairment in patients with incisional hernia was higher than that in the general population, and the incidence of recurrence was also higher. The investigators found that the incidence of pulmonary function impairment in patients with recurrent incisional hernia was higher than that in patients with primary incisional hernia.

The purpose of this protocol is to determine the frequency and the mapping of unstable coronary plaques highlighted by 18F-Na PET in patients at intermediate and high risk, as well as their evolution under treatment.
Aside from traditional risk factors collection and related biological assessments, risk establishment is based on calcium score, a simple non-injected and very little irradiating scanner which measures coronary calcifications, stigmata of healed atheroma plaques and, as a rule, non-evolving. Calcium score, which is interpreted according to age, sex and ethnicity, therefore makes it possible to assign a percentile within the distribution of all the patients and to classify patients in: Group I: absence of atheromatous plaques: Score 0 Group II: patients generating few plaques (low risk): calcium score above zero and classifying the patient below the 40th percentile of a similar population; Group III: patients generating moderate plaques (intermediate risk) with a calcium score classifying the patient equal or above the 40th percentile and less than the 65th percentile; Group IV: patients generating a lot of plaques (high risk): calcium score classifying the patient equal or above the 65th percentile.
These are more likely to be patients who will come from the cardiology / check-up sector because of a higher probability of symptoms or of already being treated for primary prevention.
Study assumptions are: apart from any hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis, the instability of a plaque can lead to symptomatic but transient micro-thrombotic phenomena which are spontaneously (or under the effect of an anti-aggregation/anticoagulation) resorbable. Regardless of this plaque fate (most frequently scarring, with calcifications, or much more rarely inaug 18F-Na PET scan will be performed in the event of an abnormal examination.
Secondary prevention treatment will then be administered in the event of an abnormal examination."

Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common cause of dementia. The pathophysiology of SVD is not well understood. White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are a common marker of SVD. WMH are visible on brain MRI scans and are caused by damage to the small blood vessels in the brain. WMH are associated with cognitive impairment and dementia. The investigators want to study how different pathological mechanisms in cerebral SVD influence WMH shape.
The investigators will study WMH shape and its association with other SVD markers and cognition. The investigators will also study the association between WMH shape and novel MRI markers of glymphatics. Glymphatics is a recently discovered mechanism that is important for the clearance of waste products from the brain. The investigators will study if different WMH phenotypes can be identified (by machine learning models).
The investigators will study WMH shape and its association with other SVD markers and cognition in patients with memory complaints and/or vascular brain abnormalities (n=50; over 65 years of age) from the memory clinic (or geriatric clinic) at one of their first visits, prior to any diagnosis."

The incidence of esophageal cancer is high in China, and the incidence of esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJAC) is increasing year by year. The early diagnosis of EGJAC is very important for the prognosis of patients. The current standard for the diagnosis of EGJAC is endoscopy combined with pathological diagnosis. However, the diagnosis of EGJAC is still difficult for endoscopists, and the accuracy of endoscopic diagnosis is low. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop an accurate and reliable diagnostic method for EGJAC.
In this study, the researchers will use the deep learning method to develop an AI model for the diagnosis of EGJAC. The researchers will collect a large number of endoscopic images of EGJAC and benign esophageal and gastric lesions. The researchers will use the deep learning method to train the AI model. The researchers will use the AI model to diagnose EGJAC. The researchers will compare the diagnostic results of the AI model with the diagnostic results of endoscopists of different levels. The researchers will evaluate the clinical auxiliary value of the AI model for endoscopists."

The power of music to raise the spirits and to heal the soul should not be underestimated. There is growing recognition of the significance of music as a complementary treatment in palliative care, which is reflected in the growing body of scientific literature on the subject and in the popularly of music therapy among palliative care patients themselves. Palliative care describes the holistic approach in the treatment of patients with advanced or incurable diseases, such as terminal cancer. In Germany, national oncological guidelines currently recommend music therapy as a treatment option to alleviate anxiety and existential fear. Music therapy is defined as the systematic use of music within a therapeutic relationship which aims at restoring, maintaining and furthering emotional, physical and mental health. The aim of music therapy in palliative care, in contrast, is to relieve symptoms of distress and improve quality of life among patients in the advanced stages of oncological disease. In cancer patients, the focus is placed primarily on music-assisted relaxation, generation of imagery, songs and improvisation. This heterogeneity of techniques studied in the literature on music therapy precludes an understanding of precisely what aspects of music therapy are most beneficial. Despite a diversity of approach, findings are promising, which in itself may be an indication as to whether the whole of music therapy is perhaps greater than the sum of its parts. To practice music therapy according to the standards of evidence-based medicine, it is necessary to specify the intervention performed as well as the musical instrument(s) used. Moderators such as individual patient preferences and experience with music also may play an appreciable role; however, these are rarely systematically investigated. Music therapy is conventionally administered by a trained music therapist and individual therapy sessions typically last 20 minutes. Training backgrounds of therapists vary, whereby in the United States a bachelor's degree in music therapy is the minimum requirement and board certification must follow in order for professional practice. Few studies have investigated the efficacy of music therapy in palliative care patients. An emerging body of scientific literature in this clinical population suggests that music therapy may alleviate physical pain as well as psychological, social and emotional suffering. Music therapy may favour various routine overarching themes in palliative care as well, such as pain management, relaxation, joy, hope, intensified spirituality and improved quality of life and may reduce anxiety and depression. Music therapy may out"

Cataract surgery is one of the most performed surgical procedures worldwide. It is a safe and effective procedure, but it can be complicated by postoperative infectious endophthalmitis and toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS). Reusing the operative supplies during cataract surgery, especially in developing countries, will have a treble impact in lowering the financial costs of surgery, the emissions of greenhouse gas, and environmental waste.
Nearly half the waste of cataract surgery is recyclable, as reported by a prospective Malaysian study. Despite the increasing evidence of reusing the operative supplies, numerous healthcare professionals may be reluctant to consider it due to worries about cross-contamination among patients.
According to the Aravind Eye Care System (AECS) in Tamil Nadu, India, endophthalmitis rated 0.02% in over a million consecutive cataract cases despite the observation that cannulas, irrigation/ aspiration tubing, gowns, surgical gloves, irrigating bottles, as well as topical and intraocular drugs are normally recycled to cut cost and waste. On the other hand, health care plays a key role in climate change, as well as financial and environmental waste. Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, making cataract surgery one of the most performed surgical procedures. The carbon footprint of cataract surgery, especially phacoemulsification, is a significant research field. In the United Kingdom, cataract surgery releases 180 kg of CO2- equivalents per eye, causing over half of the emissions due to obtaining large disposable medical equipment. In ACES, phacoemulsification generated 5.9 kg of carbon emissions4. In comparison to the United Kingdom and the United States of America, the cataract surgery's low rates of infection in AECS were accomplished with 1/10 supply costs and 1/20 global warming emissions6. Being the most performed operation, cataract surgery and ophthalmology, in general, can meaningfully influence lowering environmental and economic waste in their surgical services1.
The aim of this work is to show if reusing the operative supplies to reduce financial costs, especially in developing countries, and to lower global warming and climate change will affect the rate"

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a common eating disorder with high mortality and morbidity. The pathogenesis of AN is still unclear, and there is no effective treatment for AN. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is closely related to the core symptoms of AN, and proposed the hypothesis of AN-ACC pathological network, suggesting that ACC overactivation and abnormal functional connectivity with other brain regions (anterior frontal lobe, parietal lobe, precuneus, and striatum) is the neuropathological mechanism for the onset of AN. Currently, rare studies have been conducted on dTMS targeting ACC as an intervention in patients with AN. In this research, dTMS, a neuroregulatory technology, was used for the first time to intervene with ACC in the treatment of adult AN. A randomized controlled study design was adopted, in which patients with AN were divided into the dTMS treatment group and the pseudo-stimulation group by 1:1 randomization, followed by 6-week intervention and half-year follow up, to clarify the near-term and long-term efficacy and safety of the dTMS treatment. Psychometric and fMRI examinations are performed at baseline in both groups. The rest of the time follow-up of symptoms and psychometrics and side-effects questionnaires are performed at week 2, 4, and 6 (during treatment) as well as at week 4, 12, and 24 ( after completion of treatment). Meanwhile, baseline fMRI data were extracted and combined with clinical features to establish an efficacy prediction model. We will explore factors predictive of dTMS efficacy in AN patients of dTMS treatment group, divided into two groups according to whether dTMS was effective or not at the end of treatment (week 6) (effective is defined as BMI increasing by ≥1.2 kg/m2 at the end of treatment), using pre-treatment (baseline) demographic information, psychological assessment questionnaires, and neuroimaging data in the two groups. This will provide theoretical and practical basis for the pioneering ACC-targeted dTMS treatment in China, helping to establish a new type of intervention program for AN, with expected results of innovation."

Low back pain (LBP) is a common and costly health problem. The prevalence of LBP is high, with 80% of the population experiencing LBP at some point in their lives. LBP is the leading cause of disability worldwide, and it is the most common cause of job-related disability. The annual cost of LBP in the United States is estimated to be $100 billion. The most common treatment for LBP is physical therapy, but there is a need for more effective and accessible treatments. Tai chi and Qigong are ancient Chinese practices that involve gentle movement, meditation, and breathing exercises. Tai chi and Qigong have been shown to be effective in reducing pain and improving function in people with LBP. The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a 12-week Tai chi and Qigong program for people with LBP. The investigators will recruit 100 adults with LBP and randomly assign them to either the Tai chi and Qigong group or the usual care group. The Tai chi and Qigong group will receive 12 weeks of Tai chi and Qigong instruction, while the usual care group will receive usual care from their primary care physician. The investigators will measure pain, function, and quality of life at baseline and 3 months. The investigators hypothesize that the Tai chi and Qigong group will have greater improvements in pain, function, and quality of life than the usual care group."

This is a UK-based observational study that aims to discover novel predictive biomarkers with the potential to guide treatment decision making and prolong PFS and OS in patients with advanced TNBC. Patients will undergo a mandatory, study-specific core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration of the breast tumour or metastasis before commencing their next line of therapy. The research sample will be run on Pear Bio's test whilst the patient receives therapy as per their physician's choice. This study will not use Pear Bio's tool to inform the choice of treatment, with the treating oncologist being blinded to the test results. Treatment response data will be collected at multiple timepoints to conduct analyses on the study's secondary and tertiary objectives. Fresh tissue resections that arrive at Pear Bio's lab will undergo processing, cell culture and various drug dosing and omics assays (depending on extracted cell numbers). Tumour samples will be processed using a cell isolation kit to retrieve a viable single-cell suspension. A minimum of 100,000 cells (10,000 viable cells per chip) will be used for staining with live and dead cell-tracking dyes. In parallel, blood vials will be processed for PBMCs and further effector cell extraction (flow cytometry, Dynabeads, etc). The remaining cells will be used for sequencing (DNA/RNA), fixed for immunofluorescence characterisation of biomarkers/receptor status or used for further omics assays (if cell numbers allow). This may include tumour mutational burden and microsatellite instability testing. The stained cells will be cultured in a biomimetic hydrogel within Pear Bio's organ-on-a-chip to provide a physiological 3D environment for drug dosing experiments. Using a microfluidic device, samples in each chip will be exposed to approved therapies (either as monotherapy or combination therapies, as outlined below) over multiple days.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic disease that affects the gastrointestinal tract. The most common symptoms are diarrhea, abdominal pain and weight loss. The disease is treated with medication, but sometimes surgery is needed. The surgery is usually performed when the disease is active and the patient is in pain. However, there is a risk of complications if the surgery is performed when the disease is active. Therefore, it is sometimes necessary to wait for the disease to calm down before surgery can be performed. This can take a long time.
The aim of this study is to investigate how health economy including quality of life is affected when surgery is delayed. The study will also investigate whether waiting for surgery affects the result of the surgery.
The study will include patients with IBD who are waiting for elective surgery and patients who have already had elective surgery. The study will also include patients who have not been diagnosed with IBD but have been referred for elective surgery.

Background and aims. Population-based newborn screening (NBS) is an important public health program that has vastly improved the course of several diseases through early detection. The selection of screened disorders generally follows the 10 principles outlined by Wilson and Jungner. In Germany, NBS has been a voluntary National Health Service program since 1969 which currently covers 17 disorders. Current NBS methods, which employ tandem mass-spectrometric analysis of newborn dried blood spots, cannot detect many potentially treatable genetic conditions. At the same time, molecular-based NBS is increasingly feasible because DNA can be extracted from a dried blood spot, next generation sequencing has become economical, and molecular diagnostics have greater reliability and increased validity as genetic databases become more refined and comprehensive. Nephropathic cystinosis and hyperoxaluria (PH) are eligible for molecular-based NBS because effective therapies are available. In a first pilot project, the scientific basis for NBS for cystinosis could already be established. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the transferability of genetic NBS for Cystinosis to other laboratories and to lay the scientific basis for screening for PH. By observing the identified infants in comparison to patients symptomatically diagnosed outside of the pilot project, it will be determined whether and to what extent early diagnosis and therapy lead to a more favorable prognosis. Cystinosis Nephropathic cystinosis, due to impaired transport of cystine out of lysosomes, occurs with an incidence of 1 in 100-200,000 live births. It is characterized by renal Fanconi syndrome in the first year of life and glomerular dysfunction progression to end-stage kidney disease by approximately 10 years of age. Treatment with oral cysteamine therapy helps preserve glomerular function, but affected individuals eventually require kidney replacement therapy Cysteamine treatment generally begins at the time of diagnosis in the second year of life, but some glomerular and tubular damage has already occurred by then. This situation could be ameliorated by diagnosing patients shortly after birth, employing molecular genetics-based newborn screening. Standard mass spectrometry-based methods for newborn screening cannot detect the increased c"

The 3 FDA-approved CDK4, 6 inhibitors, palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, all provided progression-free survival benefits when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. But, not all of them provided overall survival benefit in the same setting. One of the proposed mechanisms that influence the overall survival difference is from the different influence of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors on tumor microenvironment and/or immune system. However, there was no head-to-head comparison of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors in the same study. Neoadjuvant therapy provides a window to obtain tissue samples before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment.

Postpartum depression is a common problem in women after childbirth. It is a major public health problem that affects the health of the mother and the child. It is a serious problem that can lead to long-term mental health problems for the mother and her child. Postpartum depression is a type of depression that occurs after childbirth. It is a common problem that affects about 10-15% of women after giving birth. Postpartum depression can occur at any time during the first year after giving birth. It can start right after delivery or it can start weeks or months later. Postpartum depression can be mild, moderate, or severe. The symptoms of postpartum depression can include feeling sad or hopeless, crying a lot, feeling irritable or angry, having trouble sleeping, losing interest in activities you used to enjoy, having trouble concentrating, and feeling overwhelmed. Postpartum depression can also cause physical symptoms, such as headaches, back pain, and fatigue. Postpartum depression can be treated with medication, psychotherapy, or both. Treatment can help improve the symptoms of postpartum depression and make it easier for the mother to care for her child.

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Diosmin/Hespiridin combination on the clinical outcomes in patients with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).
PCOS is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age. It is characterized by hyperandrogenism, oligo-ovulation and polycystic ovaries.
The pathogenesis of PCOS is not fully understood, but it is known that it is a multifactorial disorder with a strong genetic component.
The main clinical manifestations of PCOS are menstrual irregularities, hirsutism, acne and obesity.
The treatment of PCOS is based on the use of oral contraceptives, which are effective in the control of menstrual irregularities and hirsutism. However, they do not improve the other clinical manifestations of the disease.
The use of metformin has been shown to improve the clinical outcomes of PCOS. However, its use is limited by the occurrence of gastrointestinal side effects.
Diosmin/Hespiridin is a flavonoid complex that has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.
The investigators hypothesize that the use of Diosmin/Hespiridin will improve the clinical outcomes of PCOS.
The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effects of Diosmin/Hespiridin on the clinical outcomes of PCOS.
The investigators will recruit 120 women with PCOS and randomize them to receive either Diosmin/Hespiridin or placebo for 4 months.
The primary outcome measure will be the improvement of the inflammation. The secondary outcome measures will be the improvement of glycemic index, the improvement of PCOS status levels and the improvement of patient's quality of life."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the European Union (EU) (267,000 deaths/year) and the fourth most common cancer (321,000 new cases/year). To date, radical surgery remains the best curative option in patients with early-stage lung cancer. Moreover, cancer screening programs have led to frequent diagnoses of indeterminate lung lesions, many requiring surgical biopsy for diagnosis and intervention. Nevertheless, the increase in the utilization of minimally invasive procedures (e.g., video-assisted thoracic surgery -VATS- and robotic-assisted thoracic surgery -RATS- ) remains mandatory in order to reduce the significant morbidity of classic surgery, the surgical trauma, to preserve organs function and to improve patient's quality of life. Nevertheless, minimally invasive surgery does not consent to manual lung palpation, making localizing the not superficial lung nodule problematic. Several approaches have been developed to enhance the localization of indeterminate lung nodules and decrease the time to diagnosis and rate of conversion to open surgery. Nevertheless, none of these is 100% sensitive or without complications, also of severe grade. Numerous pre-operative methods are being employed, including percutaneous CT-guided placement techniques, encompassing the use of microcoils, hook-wires, and spiral-wires. These devices can support nodule localization during minimally invasive lung procedures; nevertheless, they could be easily displaced during patient transport and positioning, intraoperative atelectasis, single lung ventilation, and surgeon manipulation. Moreover, all these pre-operative localization techniques require two different procedures, one for the CT-guided referral placement and one for surgical treatment. Finally, the rate of pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and subcutaneous emphysema are not insignificant, and these complications are mandatory to avoid in several sub-groups of patients. On the other hand, clinical pre-operative staging and surgical planning are based on pre-operative images taken before surgery, either by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment after pancreatoduodenectomy is undetermined as previous research reported conflicting results regarding infectious complications. Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis (formally pre-emptive antibiotic treatment) after pancreatoduodenectomy might reduce the rate of surgical site infections in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile (predominantly patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy). Current national and international guidelines lack clear recommendations regarding pre-emptive antibiotic treatment leading to substantially varying antibiotic prophylactic regimes between institutes.
Objective: This trial evaluates the additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment on clinically relevant organ/space surgical site infections (OSIs) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile.
Study design: This multicenter, randomized controlled, superiority trial compares perioperative versus pre-emptive antibiotic treatment during five postoperative days after pancreatoduodenectomy in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile.
Study population: Adult patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile (patients with preoperative biliary drainage or an ampullary malignancy). Patients with a contraindication for the study antibiotics or a preoperative indication for antibiotics (e.g. cholangitis of preoperative abscesses) are excluded.
Intervention: Participants will be randomized to either perioperative prophylaxis (cefazolin, metronidazole and a single dose of 5-7mg/kg gentamicin, control arm) or additional cefuroxime and metronidazole for five postoperative days (experimental arm).
Main study endpoints: The primary endpoint are organ/space infections (OSIs) within 90 days after surgery requiring a therapeutic intervention. Secondary endpoints are OSIs, isolated OSIs, wound infections, postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile or enteric anastomotic leakage,"

This study will examine the effectiveness of a psychosocial group therapy intervention for inpatients with limb loss. The investigators will conduct a two-arm pragmatic trial to evaluate if the group intervention leads to better mental health outcomes (depression and anxiety) for inpatients with limb loss compared to those patients who receive treatment as usual (TAU). The proposed intervention is based on the evidence-based supportive-expressive (SEGT) approach and was designed by an interprofessional team from psychiatry, social work, physiatry and occupational therapy, along with patient advisors. The SEGT approach fosters mutual support, promotes openness and emotional expression. It has been shown to yield improvements in anxiety, psychosocial functioning, health literacy, and social support in breast cancer survivors. This SEGT approach has been modified, in both content and process, to specifically address the needs of limb loss inpatients. SEGT will be delivered and co-facilitated by either a psychiatrist and/or two allied healthcare professionals supervised by a psychiatrist on a rolling basis for a duration of 1 year or until the intended sample size is achieved. Typically, it is a 6-module program held over a 3-week period (approximately 1 hour sessions X 2 week) that is framed within social cognitive theory, whereby resilience to adversity (limb loss in this instance) relies on personal enablement. For the purposes of this trial, SEGT sessions will be offered on a rolling basis - which means it will be offered once a week, and participants may join the sessions at any time as the sessions will follow a similar framework over a six-modules. As infection control protocols allow, inpatient participants will participate in a large room setting at St. John's Rehab seated at least six feet apart and masked, with staff facilitators. SEGT groups will be capped to having 8 participants per session. If the pandemic conditions do not enable us to have an in-person group event, the investigators will explore delivering the intervention via Zoom onsite at St. John's Rehab (delivered by tablets), where patients can log in private rooms across St. John's Rehab to participate. SEGT groups will be facilitated by two allied healthcare professionals or one psychiatrist and an allied healthcare professional,"

Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a severe disease of the newborn, which is the leading cause of death in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The incidence of NEC is 1 to 10 cases per 1000 live births. The mortality rate is 20 to 30%. The pathophysiology of NEC is not well understood. It is a multifactorial disease, with a strong inflammatory component. The inflammatory response is responsible for the intestinal lesions and the systemic complications. The treatment of NEC is based on the management of the inflammatory response. The medical treatment is based on the administration of antibiotics and the withdrawal of enteral feeding. The surgical treatment is indicated in case of failure of the medical treatment. The surgical treatment is based on the resection of the necrotic intestine and the creation of a stoma. The stoma is a temporary diversion of the intestine, which allows the healing of the intestine. The stoma is created by a laparotomy. The laparotomy is a surgical procedure that allows access to the abdomen. The laparotomy is performed under general anesthesia. The laparotomy is associated with a pneumoperitoneum, which is the insufflation of the abdomen with carbon dioxide (CO2). The pneumoperitoneum is responsible for the distension of the abdomen. The pneumoperitoneum is associated with a risk of cardio-respiratory complications. The pneumoperitoneum is responsible for a decrease in cardiac output and a decrease in oxygen saturation. The pneumoperitoneum is also responsible for an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. The increase in intra-abdominal pressure is responsible for a decrease in venous return and a decrease in cardiac output.

The most used laser is the diode laser, which has a wavelength of 808 nm and is indicated for the treatment of dark hair. However, there are other types of laser that have been used in the treatment of hair, such as the intense pulsed light (IPL), which has a wavelength of 500 to 1200 nm and is indicated for the treatment of light hair. The IPL is a device that emits a broad spectrum of light, which is absorbed by the melanin in the hair follicle, causing thermal damage to the follicle and thus preventing the growth of new hairs. The IPL is a relatively new device, and there is still little scientific evidence about its effectiveness in the treatment of hair. The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the IPL and the diode laser in the treatment of hair in the axillary region of women. The study will be a randomized controlled clinical trial, with 40 volunteers divided into two groups: the IPL group and the diode laser group. The volunteers will be evaluated before the treatment, after the treatment, and at 30 days and 6 months after the end of the treatment. The evaluation will be performed by a blinded evaluator, who will not know which treatment the volunteer received. The primary outcome measure will be the number of hairs in the axillary region. The secondary outcome measures will be the hair thickness, the pain score, the quality of life, the satisfaction level, and the self-esteem."

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Despite major advancements in reperfusion therapies, a large proportion of patients still experience a poor outcome. The investigators hypothesize that brain-derived tau (BD-tau) rises immediately after onset and plateaus between three and 48 hours after onset. The investigators will thus assess BD-tau levels every hour from admission to 48 hours from stroke onset in patients that present with the clinical diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke due to a large- or medium-vessel occlusion within 9 hours of symptom onset. The investigators will also assess other suggested markers of brain injury (e.g. NfL) and routinely collected clinical data including from neuroimaging. Clinical follow-up will be performed at 3 months."

The investigators will perform basic experimental studies involving humans (BESH) designed to quantify the perceptual experiences of retinal and cortical prosthesis patients. These experiments will follow standard procedures for collecting behavioral data, and involve simple perceptual tasks (e.g., signal detection, object recognition) and behavioral tasks (e.g., walking towards a goal location). The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when sending pulses to the VPU by directly specifying pulse trains (e.g., send a 1 s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12 of an Argus II implant). Important parameters for safety include a) pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), b) charge density should be limited. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust"

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common cancer in the United States. The majority of cSCCs are cured with surgery alone. However, some cSCCs are high risk and require additional treatment. The most common high risk cSCCs are those that are large, deep, or recurrent. These cSCCs are also more likely to spread to lymph nodes. The standard treatment for high risk cSCCs is surgery to remove the tumor and the lymph nodes in the area. However, this surgery can be disfiguring and has a risk of complications.
The investigators are studying a new approach to treating high risk cSCCs. This approach involves using ultrasound to look for lymph node involvement. If the lymph nodes are not involved, the investigators will use a procedure called sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to remove the lymph nodes. SLNB is a less invasive procedure than surgery.
The investigators will also study the use of ultrasound to monitor the lymph nodes after surgery. This will allow the investigators to detect any lymph node involvement early, before it spreads to other parts of the body.
The investigators will compare the outcomes of patients who have SLNB with the outcomes of patients who have surgery alone. The investigators will also compare the outcomes of patients who have ultrasound monitoring with the outcomes of patients who do not have ultrasound monitoring.
The investigators hope that this study will show that SLNB and ultrasound monitoring are safe and effective ways to treat high risk cSCCs."

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a common disease in infancy, with a prevalence of 20-40%. The diagnosis of GERD is based on the presence of typical symptoms (vomiting, regurgitation, irritability, failure to thrive) and the exclusion of other diseases. The gold standard for the diagnosis of GERD is the 24-hour esophageal pH-metry (MII-pH), which is an invasive procedure that requires hospitalization and sedation.
The aim of this study is to identify salivary biomarkers of GERD in infants, in order to develop non-invasive diagnostic strategies and to detect personalized therapeutic treatments.
The study will be conducted on a cohort of infants with symptoms of GERD, undergoing MII-pH of the esophagus 24 hours, at least 2 hours after the last meal, so as to study the circadian variations of their composition.
Saliva samples will be collected at different time points during the MII-pH of the esophagus, and the biochemical profile of the saliva will be analyzed.
The biochemical profile of the saliva will be compared to that of healthy infants, in order to identify any differences in the biochemical profile of the saliva of GERD infants.
The biochemical profile of the saliva will be correlated to the onset of symptoms and nutrition, in order to identify any changes in the biochemical profile of the saliva that are associated with the onset of symptoms and nutrition."

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Presently, relative clinical guidelines focus on weight loss through apporopriate diet and lifestyle. The Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 receptor agonists and the Sodium-Glucose Co-transporter 2 inhibitors constitute novel agents that seem to exert beneficial effects beyond glycemic control. Dulaglutide will be used from the GLP1-ras family and Empagliflozin from the SGLT2-is family.
The aim of the study is to compare the effect of Dulaglutide and Empagliflozin in liver fat fraction of diabetic patients after a year of treatment.
The investigators hypothesize that both Dulaglutide and Empagliflozin have a role in treating patients with DM2 and NAFLD.
The study will be conducted in the 2nd Department of Internal Medicine of Hippocration General Hospital, and the Therapeutic Department of General Hospital Alexandra, Athens, Greece.
The study will be conducted in a prospective open-label observational manner.
Subjects allocation: Group 1: patients will receive oral Empagliflozin, as add-on to their previous treatment regimen, for 52 weeks. Group 2: patients will receive subcutaneous Dulaglutide, as add-on to their previous treatment regimen, for 52 weeks.

The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to assess the feasibility of surgical exposure for open eruption of palatally impacted canines with open-eruption technique using a surgical template. The secondary purpose of this study is to compare this method with the conventional free-hand surgical exposure. Our null-hypothesis is that there will be no significant differences in the outcome measures between the two methods.
Materials and methods
Groups
Group 1 (test group): Surgical exposure for open eruption of palatally impacted canines following virtual planning using a surgical template.
Group 2 (control group): Surgical exposure for open-eruption of palatally impacted canines using the conventional free-hand method.
Simple randomization is performed to determine whether patients are included in the test or control group. 20 patients are recruited per group. During continuous recruiting, sample size calculation is to be carried out to determine the actual number of patients included in this study.

The upper jaw of the patient is scanned using an intraoral scanner (IOS, Trios 4, 3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark). Cone beam tomography (CBCT) scans (Green X, Vatech, Hwaseong, Korea) are performed before surgical exposure to assess the position, angulation, possible dilaceration, and bone coverage of the impacted canines. The scanning conditions are constant at 200 μm isotropic voxel size with 360◦ rotation, 94 kiloVolt (kV) tube voltage, 7.2 miliAmper (mA) tube current, and 9 s exposure time with a field of view of 15 × 8 cm.

The present study aims to determine if the manualized brief psychotherapy Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure-Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) can be administered to violence-exposed mothers and their young children (ages 1-5 years) in the ambulatory care center of a Swiss public hospital (SUPEA, CHUV) during a psychotherapy of 16 sessions. CAVEAT is based on an amalgam of four existing evidence-based psychotherapy models (Child-Parent psychotherapy, Parental Mentalization, Interaction Guidance, Prolonged Exposure) for parents, infants and young children and traumatized adults that led to the novel, core therapeutic technique developed by Prof. Schechter and colleagues Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure-Sessions or CAVES which has been shown to be successful in positively altering mothers' perception of their young children in two open trials. From the existing literature, the investigators know that parent-child relationship-based psychotherapies improve significantly maternal sensitivity to her child's communication, which is in part based on maternal capacity to perceive more accurately the young child's emotional communication and to take the child's perspective. Moreover, dyadic psychotherapy models using video-feedback and support of parental mentalization have been shown across models more generally to improve the quality of mother-child interaction. Risk / Benefit Assessment The risks of participating in this study are estimated as minimal (category A). The proposed intervention involves standard, validated psychotherapeutic procedures with the addition of clinician-assisted videofeedback exposure to naturalistic challenges that are typically stressful for young children and that are in situation by the clinician in collaboration with the child's mother during the filmed parent-child interaction sessions. This latter technique has been used without complication in both mental health referred and non-referred pediatrics samples with positive clinical effects in both studies. The investigators estimate that the risks of such an intervention are therefore limited. Though, if a matter arises that is severe, urgent or cannot be dealt with in the psychotherapy as conceived in the model, based on the therapist assessment, proper interventions and/or referrals will be made.

The overall goal of this study is to reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and pre-diabetes in Asian women and their children by focusing upon a major high-risk group - women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) in Singapore. GDM is diabetes diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy and has traditionally been considered a benign condition because typically glucose levels return to normal after delivery. Women with pregnancies complicated by GDM often progress to develop T2D later in life. There is evidence that holistic lifestyle modifications that include strategies to improve dietary intake, physical activity, and mental well-being can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. The use of digital health interventions can also assist in the prevention of T2D. However, limited studies have been conducted with Asian populations. This study aims (1) to identify post-GDM women from large community settings in Singapore and to assess the efficacy of a holistic lifestyle digital intervention (focusing on diet, physical activity, sleep, and mental well-being) on glucose regulation with those identified women. Secondary objectives are: (a) to examine the potential impacts of the proposed intervention on the health and well-being of subjects' family members (e.g., children); (b) to determine the diabetes risk of the subjects over a 3-year follow-up period; (c) to explore potential economic impacts of the proposed intervention (e.g., healthcare expenditures); (d) to study the importance of gut microbiota and epigenetic factors in relation to changes in glucose metabolism, and (e) to ascertain the safety of the proposed intervention. The study is a 1-year randomized controlled trial with three years of follow-up. The primary outcomes involved the incidence of Type 2 diabetes confirmed by a 2-hr 75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) over a 4-year period. Secondary outcomes are (1) incidence of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance; (b) changes in cardiometabolic variables (e.g., body weight, HbA1c, insulin, blood lipids, blood pressures) in the women; (c) changes in women's body composition; ("

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of dry heat and dry cold applications on pain, anxiety and fear levels before blood sample collection in school age children.
The study was designed as a randomized controlled study. The sample of the study consisted of 120 children aged 7-12 years old who were hospitalized in the pediatric clinic of the hospital. The children were divided into 3 groups as dry heat application, dry cold application and control group.
In the dry heat application group, the region where the invasive intervention will be performed will be determined by the nurse in charge of the shift. The researcher will heat the thermoregulated electric pad and set it to 42°C. After making sure that there are no contraindications in the application of the electric pad device, a dry heat of 42°C will be applied to the determined area with the electric pad for 5 minutes. In the dry cold application group, dry cold will be applied to the determined area with the gel pad for 3 minutes after the researcher is sure that there are no contraindications in the application of the gel pad. In the control group, blood sampling was performed according to the clinical routine, and no heat or cold application was made.
The pain felt due to the blood sample collection process was evaluated with the Wong Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale. The fear and anxiety levels of the children were evaluated with the Child Fear Anxiety Scale and the Medical Procedures Fear Inventory."

Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, thus being the focus of extensive research. The primary treatment goals of this disease consist in controlling local disease, reducing the risk of distant metastases, and avoiding enucleation whenever possible. Plaque brachytherapy is currently the standard treatment for small and medium-sized uveal melanomas. In clinical practice, ruthenium (Ru-106) or iodine (I-125) are the most commonly employed radioisotopes. Ruthenium is the most utilized radioisotope in Europe and South America due to its availability and good clinical outcomes. It is currently the only available option in Brazil's public health system (SUS). However, its use for large tumors (greater than 10 mm in thickness and/or 22 mm in diameter) is limited by the inability of delivering an adequate therapeutic dose of radiation without causing further damage to the surrounding retinal tissue. For this reason, researchers in medical physics have been investigating new treatment options in the last decades, including external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), radiosurgery (gamma knife or linear accelerator), and proton beam therapy. Although gamma knife radiosurgery and proton beam therapy are effective treatments with reliable tumor control rates, they are associated with poor visual outcomes, inadequate globe retention, and their use is reportedly limited in public health systems of low- or middle-income countries. EBRT carries potential side effects related to a broader radiation field, with an increased risk for complications in ocular and periocular structures, such as eyelids, sclera, lens, and retina. Finally, enucleation is an effective management for very large tumors, but it is usually a last resource. Considering the above-mentioned treatment limitations for large choroidal melanomas, our group explored an alternative approach using intra-arterial melphalan for tumor chemoreduction, aiming to reduce thickness and allow subsequent brachytherapy using a Ru-106 plaque. Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) with melphalan has been used to treat multiple cancers, including liver metastases from uveal and skin melanomas, but"

Trauma is a leading cause of global mortality or incapacitation in survivors. The population involved is mainly young adult men affected by preventable injuries. Knowing the incidence of injuries, mechanisms of wounds, approaching strategies, and outcomes is essential to review individual interventions and collective policies to improve prevention. Casualties in Colombia had a high incidence in previous decades; injuries and attributable deaths have recently decreased, but they are still the third cause of mortality. Contrary to high-income countries, interpersonal violence is the predominant mechanism involved. Data registries are used worldwide in specialized centers that focus on providing healthcare in trauma. Nevertheless, it is necessary also to know the incidence in community and non-dedicated general hospitals. Determining the characteristics of patients admitted to the emergency ward by injuries will provide essential information on the severity, mechanisms, type of population affected, immediate or consequential care delivered, and outcomes. Such an analysis will give knowledge to prioritize policies, resources, upgrade clinical practice guidelines, and improve results."

Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS) is a common cause of disability in older adults. It is a degenerative condition of the spine that causes narrowing of the spinal canal. This narrowing can cause pain and weakness in the legs and back. It is often treated with surgery, but surgery is not always successful. There is also a risk of complications from surgery.
Researchers want to see if a new treatment can help people with LSS. The new treatment is called non-invasive postural therapy (NIPT). NIPT is a combination of devices and training. The devices are used to help people maintain a certain posture. The training teaches people how to use the devices and how to maintain the posture.
The study will test the effectiveness of NIPT in people with LSS. The study will also test whether NIPT is safe and whether it can improve mobility.
Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have imaging tests of the spine.
Participants will be asked to wear a device called an actigraph for 7 days. The actigraph will measure how much they move.
Participants will be asked to wear a pedometer for 7 days. The pedometer will measure how much they walk.
Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about their pain and mobility.
Participants will be asked to come to the clinic for 6 weeks. During this time, they will use the NIPT devices and receive training. They will also be asked to wear the actigraph and pedometer.

The purpose of this study is to learn more about the effects of self-administered nitrous oxide (SANO) on the urodynamic study (UDS) procedure. The UDS procedure is used to evaluate the function of the bladder and the bladder outlet. It is a common procedure for patients with urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, and other bladder problems. The UDS procedure involves placing a small catheter (plastic tube) into the bladder through the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). The catheter is connected to a machine that fills the bladder with liquid and measures the pressure in the bladder. The UDS procedure can be uncomfortable and cause anxiety for some patients. SANO is a gas that is used to reduce pain and anxiety during medical procedures. It is commonly used in dentistry and has been used in other medical procedures. SANO is safe and has been used in the UDS procedure in other studies. The investigators want to learn more about the effects of SANO on the UDS procedure.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is worldwide the second and third cancer-related cause of death in men and women, respectively. For the detection of lesions in the mucosa (premalignant and malignant), colonoscopy has been considered the gold standard. However, up to 25% of lesions can be missed during conventional colonoscopy. Some technical (i.e., bowel preparation) and operator-related (i.e., expertise, and fatigue) factors are related to these missing lesions. During the rapid-growing technological era, new tools were launched to improve the quality and performance of colonoscopies. Through the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) an identification of a pattern can be achieved after a previous training from a large dataset of images. The DiscoveryTM AI-assisted polyp detector (Pentax Medical, Hoya Group, Tokyo, Japan), is a computer-assisted polyp/adenoma detection system based on AI. It detects classic adenomas and flat lesions, distinguished features like mucus cap or rim of debris with the advantage of a real-time and simultaneous multiple polyp detection. It was developed to minimize the missed lesions increasing as a result the polyp detection rate (PDR) and the adenoma detection rate (ADR). Lately, published data evaluating the AI-assisted polyp detectors has demonstrate high sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver agreement. Due to the importance of CRC diagnosis and prompt treatment, and taking advantage of the newly introduced DiscoveryTM AI system, the investigators aim to assess the real-world effectiveness of this AI-assisted polyp detector system in clinical practice and compare the results between expert (seniors) and non-expert (juniors) endoscopists."

People with epilepsy who are planning for pregnancy or are pregnant have concerns about anti-seizure medication (ASM) treatment, as some ASMs increase the risk of major congenital malformations and can negatively influence cognitive outcomes in developing offspring (Tomson et al., 2018, Meador et al., 2021). Non-pharmacologic epilepsy treatments, such as specialized diets like the low glycemic index diet or the modified Atkins diet, are not well studied in pregnant people with epilepsy but have proven to be effective in reducing seizures in the non-pregnant population. Dietary influence on seizure control is likely multifactorial, and recent studies have shown that one mechanism of action is to cause changes in the gut microbiome and alter neuroactive downstream bacterial metabolites, such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (Olson et al., 2018). The low glycemic index diet is one of the most flexible dietary therapies for epilepsy, and it appears to be safe in pregnancy with positive health outcomes for both the mother and baby (Walsh et al., 2012). Unfortunately, little is known about the effectiveness and mechanism of the LGI diet in pregnant patients with epilepsy. Therefore, the investigators propose this study in which the LGI diet will be initiated in the first half of pregnancy and explore LGI diet tolerability, seizure frequency, and potential underlying mechanisms in the pregnant epilepsy population.

Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal cancers. The 5-year survival rate is less than 10%. The standard treatment for pancreatic cancer is surgery. However, only 15-20% of patients are suitable for surgery. Neoadjuvant therapy can improve the rate of R0 resection and overall survival. However, the role of neoadjuvant therapy in pancreatic cancer is less certain.

Metastatic breast cancer (MBC) is an incurable condition wherein pharmacological interventions are directed towards deferring disease progression and alleviating symptoms, thereby extending survival rates and preserving the quality of life (QoL) and psychological well-being. Clinical advancements in anticancer treatments have notably augmented survival rates among MBC patients. However, accruing evidence reported that adherence to medications is a critical issue in the disease trajectory of breast cancer patients, particularly in the context of oral anticancer treatments (OATs). Emerging evidence indicated that patients with advanced cancer, such as those with MBC, often exhibit significant levels of nonadherence. MBC patients encounter various barriers to the daily management of OATs, including emotional and physical distress associated with side effects, dosage variations, treatment interruptions, and a lack of disease-related knowledge. Prediction models for adherence have been previously developed and tested across diverse scenarios and diseases. Even so, existing studies have yet to systematically address medication adherence among MBC patients by designing and implementing a decision support system (DSS) that integrates risk predictive models alongside educational and training tools. The current protocol aims to assess the efficacy of the DSS web-based solution and machine learning web application (TREAT - TREatment Adherence SupporT) in fostering adherence to oral anticancer treatments within a sample of MBC patients over a three-month period. This protocol is part of a project titled Enhancing Therapy Adherence Among Metastatic Breast Cancer Patients (Tracking Number 65080791). The overarching goal of this project is to develop a predictive model of nonadherence, an associated DSS, and guidelines to enhance patient engagement and therapy adherence among MBC patients.

Cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a high-risk procedure. The main risk is related to the CPB itself, which is a non-physiological support that can induce multiple organ dysfunctions. The most common complication is acute kidney injury (AKI), which is associated with a significant increase in morbidity and mortality. The incidence of AKI is estimated to be 10 to 30% in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. The main risk factors for AKI are hypoperfusion, hypoxia and hypothermia. The main risk factor for hypoperfusion is the use of a low flow rate during CPB. The main risk factor for hypoxia is the use of a low oxygen flow rate during CPB. The main risk factor for hypothermia is the use of a low temperature during CPB. The main risk factor for hypothermia is the use of a low temperature during CPB. The main risk factor for hypothermia is the use of a low temperature during CPB. The main risk factor for hypothermia is the use of a low temperature during CPB.

Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine therapy that has been used for thousands of years. It is based on the concept of Qi (vital energy) and meridians (channels) that connect the body. Acupuncture is used to treat various diseases and conditions by inserting needles into specific points on the body. Auricular acupuncture is a form of acupuncture that involves stimulating points on the ear. It is often used to treat pain, anxiety, and other conditions.
The investigators want to study the effects of auricular acupuncture on the temperature of the skin in the lumbar region. The investigators will use a thermal imaging camera to measure the temperature of the skin in the lumbar region before and after auricular acupuncture. The investigators will also measure the temperature of the skin in the lumbar region before and after sham auricular acupuncture. Sham auricular acupuncture is a placebo form of auricular acupuncture that does not involve inserting needles into the skin.
The investigators will recruit 30 healthy volunteers for this study. The volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the auricular acupuncture group or the sham auricular acupuncture group. The volunteers in the auricular acupuncture group will receive auricular acupuncture at the Kidney point on the left ear. The volunteers in the sham auricular acupuncture group will receive sham auricular acupuncture at the Kidney point on the left ear.
The investigators will measure the temperature of the skin in the lumbar region before and after auricular acupuncture and sham auricular acupuncture. The investigators will also measure the temperature of the skin in the lumbar region before and after the volunteers rest for 30 minutes. The investigators will compare the temperature measurements to see if there is a difference between the two groups."

The aim of the study is to compare three different strategies of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) management during Cardiopulmonary Bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery patients.
The study is a randomized controlled three parallel groups trial. The patients enrolled to elective cardiac surgeries will be evaluated during a pre-operative outpatient visit and widely informed about the chance to participate in the study. When patients undergo to the elective surgery general anaesthesia is administered and CPB is installed. The nominal flow for each patient will be 2,4 l/min/m2. To keep the MAP values around those corresponding to the randomized group, vasodilator (if MAP overcomes the assigned MAP value) or vasoconstrictor drugs will be used (if MAP value is lower than the assigned group).
The primary outcome is the serum lactate peak (Lmax) detected during CPB time. The mean of this value will be compared in the three groups of treatment.
The secondary outcomes are: the area under the curve (AUC) of the serum lactate values measured during CPB, the number of cases with serum lactate peak > 3 mmol/l during CPB, the evaluation of intraoperative cerebral perfusion (through monitoring of NIRS), the intraoperative and postoperative low cardiac output syndrome (through the calculation of VISmax), the postoperative and 30-day LVEF (%) and the evaluation of pulmonary injury (through the LIS)."

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by impairment in communication and social interaction, and repetitive behaviors. 1%-1.5% of children in developed nations has ASD, This rate is said to range between 0.15% and 0.8% in low- and middle-income countries. Over the past decades, the prevalence of ASD has increased worldwide. Scientists have been trying to explore the molecular mechanisms behind the pathology of ASD. Several evidence suggests that genetic factors such as chromosomal abnormalities and environmental factors like diet and stress are involved in the pathogenesis and advancement of ASD. Accumulating research has demonstrated the gut-brain axis or multiple biochemical signaling pathways that take place between the gastrointestinal tract (GI tract) and the central nervous system (CNS), and its possible association with ASD. Mounting evidence explains that gut microbial dysbiosis is implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBS), coeliac disease (CD), and ASD. A Recent Egyptian study showed that an evidence of changes in the gut microbiome of ASD children compared to the unrelated controls. However, the microbiome profile of siblings was more like that of autistic children than that of unrelated controls. These observations may highlight the importance of the interplay between environmental and host genetic factors in shaping the gut microbiome. The study also emphasized the importance of identification of microbiome and specific microorganisms' changes that can be targeted for diagnosis as well as for treatment of ASD. This study aims to investigate clinical risk factors of autism and to elucidate the changes in gut microbiome in Egyptian autistic children and their possible correlation with clinical outcomes and the severity of the disease."

Stroke is the leading cause of disability in the United States. Individuals with stroke are at risk for developing severe upper extremity (UE) impairment, which can lead to functional limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs). The investigators propose to evaluate the effectiveness of START (Startle Adjuvant Rehabilitation Therapy) in enhancing UE function post-stroke. START is a non-invasive, inexpensive, and mobile intervention that represents a loud, acoustic stimulus timed with planned motor activity. START is applied via headphones and can be administered by clinical staff. START is safe and has been shown to enhance training outcomes in individuals with stroke. The investigators propose to evaluate the capacity of START to enhance training outcomes in individuals with stroke (Aim 1) and to evaluate the generalizability of START training to untrained tasks (Aim 2). The investigators hypothesize that START will enhance training outcomes and will show higher skill transfer (e.g. time to complete sorting/dressing task) compared to training without START. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of START in enhancing UE function post-stroke using a randomized, single-blind, parallel, controlled trial. The investigators will also evaluate the generalizability of START training to untrained tasks. The investigators will recruit 60 individuals with stroke (i.e. 30 participants in each group) and will randomize participants to either START or control (control will receive training without START). Participants will be assessed before and after training on a functional reaching task and on untrained tasks (sorting and dressing tasks).

Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a life-limiting genetic condition that affects the lungs and digestive system. The condition is caused by a defect in a protein called CFTR which is responsible for the movement of salt and water in and out of cells. This defect causes the body to produce thick, sticky mucus which can block the airways and the tubes that carry food to the stomach. This can lead to lung infections and problems with digestion.
Currently, there is no cure for CF. However, there are treatments available that can help to improve lung function and reduce the number of infections. These treatments include inhaled medications and physiotherapy.
In recent years, a new type of medication called CFTR modulators has been developed. These medications work by correcting the defect in the CFTR protein. They are taken as tablets and are usually given to people with CF who have at least one copy of the most common CF-causing mutation, called Phe508del.
CFTR modulators have been shown to improve lung function and reduce the number of infections in people with CF. However, their effect on the digestive system is not well understood.
This study will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look at the digestive system in people with CF who are taking CFTR modulators. MRI is a safe and non-invasive imaging technique that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the body.
The study will look at the following:
The movement of food through the digestive system
The amount of fluid in the digestive system
The size of the liver
The amount of air in the lungs
The study will also look at the effect of CFTR modulators on the digestive system.
The study will last for 1 year. Participants will be asked to attend the hospital for 3 visits. During each visit, they will have a physical examination and blood tests. They will also have an MRI scan.

Hypospadias repair surgery is an invasive surgery that results in significant postoperative pain. Pain alters the quality of life and satisfaction of the patients and results in manipulation of wounds, infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence leading to unfavorable surgical outcome. As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedetomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting. A vast majority of literature supports the efficacy of particulate steroids like methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions. Aim of the work and hypothesis: To the best of our knowledge, this is"

Lung transplantation has become a standard treatment for patients suffering from end-stage lung diseases. One of the major obstacles in the modern transplant era is the fact that the need for organs by far exceeds availability. This leads to growing waiting lists with mortality rates ranging between 10-30%. On the other hand, up to 80% of offered lungs from brain dead donors are rejected because they do not meet predefined donor selection criteria. Recently, ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) has become available as a tool to expand the donor pool. Based on experimental work by Stig Steen, the Toronto lung transplant group developed an EVLP system with the purpose to evaluate lungs with uncertain quality. Consequently, Aigner et al. have expanded the indications for EVLP by showing that primarily unacceptable donor lungs can be reconditioned and then become suitable for transplantation. This concept of organ repair by EVLP has recently been highlighted by a number of publications.
In this study, we will evaluate the impact of hemodiafiltration (HDF) on the regeneration of marginal donor lungs. HDF is a variation of conventional hemodialysis (HD). By the addition of a substitution solution, convection forces are significantly increased. This substitution solution is added to the blood and is completely removed again in the dialyzer. This increases the negative pressure on the dialysate side and the removal of toxins through convection. The substitution solution can be added in a pre-dilution (before the dialyzer) or post-dilution (after the dialyzer) manner. Pre-dilution is associated with longer run times, less filter clotting, but is also less effective in removing toxins. Post-dilution offers a better toxin clearance capacity, but is associated with an increased risk of filter clotting. Several studies have shown that HDF provides higher clearance rates for both small and middle molecule solutes. Moreover, effective cytokine removal has been shown in HDF both in acute and chronic renal disease patients.
In this study, we will evaluate the impact of HDF on the regeneration of marginal donor lungs. We will perform a prospective randomized pilot study in patients receiving lung transplantation. The lungs will be perfused"

Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for retinopathy examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The examination success rate was defined as the ability to complete the retinopathy examination without disturbances caused by infant distress or movement. The study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed retinopathy examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated retinopathy examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensory stimulation during retinopathy examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population."

Knee surgeries are associated with severe postoperative pain. Improper pain management affects patients' psychological status with prolongation of hospital stay time and rehabilitation period, with the possibility of progression of the acute pain to chronic pain. Many Pain management options following these surgeries are available: non-opioid analgesics, opioids and regional anesthesia techniques (epidural and peripheral nerve block). Multi-modal analgesia is considered the best option for pain management in knee surgeries. As non-opioid analgesics alone are not effective enough while opioids alone are associated with many risk factors: nausea, vomiting, decrease intestinal motility and respiratory depression with possibility of addiction (Goode VM, Morgan B, et al, 2019). Regarding the functional anatomy of the nerve supply to knee joint: The knee is innervated by genicular branches from the nerve to vastus medialis, saphenous nerve, sciatic nerve and the posterior division of obturator nerve. The skin around the knee is supplied by the cutaneous branches from the femoral nerve and the saphenous nerve (Ritesh Roy, Gaurav Agarwal, et al, 2018). The widespread use of ultrasound to advance peripheral nerve block techniques over the past decade has led to enormous growth in the utilization and efficiency of regional anesthesia (Cozowicz, Crispiana & Poeran, et al, 2015). The adductor canal block (ACB) is an interfascial plane block performed in the middle third of the medial side of the thigh. The adductor canal bounded anteriorly by the sartorius muscle, posteriorly and medially by the adductor longus and magnus muscles, and laterally by the vastus medialis muscle. It contains the femoral vein and artery, the saphenous nerve and the nerve to the vastus medialis, both are sensory branches of the femoral nerve. In some individuals, the obturator sensory branch (also a femoral nerve branch) can be affected by local anesthetic infiltration into this area. It can be noted that this block affect sensory branches and avoid blocking the majority of motor branches. The block is"

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is a standard treatment for breast cancer patients with axillary lymph node metastasis. However, ALND can cause arm lymphedema, which is a major problem for breast cancer patients. The incidence of arm lymphedema after ALND is 10-30%. Arm lymphedema can cause pain, swelling, and loss of function, which can lead to decreased quality of life.
Immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) is a new surgical technique that can be used to reduce the risk of arm lymphedema after ALND. ILR involves creating a new lymphatic channel from a healthy lymph node to the arm. This new lymphatic channel can help drain lymph fluid from the arm, which can reduce the risk of arm lymphedema.
The purpose of this study is to determine whether ILR can reduce the risk of arm lymphedema in breast cancer patients after ALND. The study will be a randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either ILR or standard ALND. The primary outcome measure will be the occurrence of arm lymphedema. Secondary outcome measures will include drainage amount, seroma or lymphocele, and patient reported outcome measures.

Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide. It is a chronic, progressive disease of the optic nerve that can lead to irreversible vision loss. The most common type of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is characterized by increased pressure within the eye. This increased pressure can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.
Cataracts are a common age-related eye condition that causes cloudy vision. Cataracts can also increase the pressure within the eye, which can worsen glaucoma.
Cataract surgery is a common procedure to remove the cloudy lens and improve vision. In some cases, cataract surgery can also be used to treat glaucoma.
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two different surgical techniques for treating glaucoma in patients undergoing cataract surgery.
The first technique is called OMNI canaloplasty. This procedure involves using a small tube to open up the drainage channels in the eye.
The second technique is called OMNI canaloplasty with Hydrus microstent. This procedure involves using a small tube to open up the drainage channels in the eye and placing a small implant in the eye to help keep the channels open.
The study will compare the effectiveness of these two techniques in reducing eye pressure and improving vision in patients with glaucoma.
The study will also compare the safety of these two techniques.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States. Screening for CRC is recommended for all adults over the age of 50. The most common screening test is colonoscopy, which is a procedure that allows the doctor to look at the inside of the colon and rectum. The doctor can also remove growths called polyps during the procedure. Polyps can turn into cancer over time. Removing polyps can prevent CRC.
The American Cancer Society recommends that people at average risk of CRC should have a colonoscopy every 10 years. People at high risk of CRC should have a colonoscopy every 5 years.
The investigators are interested in using text messages to remind people to get their colonoscopy. The investigators will also use text messages to help people prepare for their colonoscopy.
The investigators will compare the number of people who get their colonoscopy after receiving text messages to the number of people who get their colonoscopy without receiving text messages. The investigators will also compare the number of people who have adequate bowel preparation after receiving text messages to the number of people who have adequate bowel preparation without receiving text messages.
The investigators will also ask people who receive text messages about their experience with the text messages."

Incomplete early miscarriage is defined as early miscarriage with persistent intrauterine material on ultrasound. Intrauterine retention of trophoblastic debris is not an uncommon phenomenon. These retentions may initially be asymptomatic but are often responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis. This symptomatology often accentuates the psychological distress of patients mourning the pregnancy. Incomplete miscarriages are mainly managed by the gynecological emergency department. The recommendations of the Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care. The choice between the two is left to the discretion of the doctor and the patient.
The aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound.
The secondary objectives are: the comparison of the rate of complications of the two techniques, during and after surgery the comparison of the rate of recourse to a second line surgical management between the two arms, the comparison of the rate of synechiae diagnosed by hysterosonography between the two techniques at 6 weeks after surgery, the comparison of the time to conception in the two arms during the 2 years after surgery in the ITT population, the comparison of the fertility rate at 2 years after surgery in the ITT population.
The study will be conducted in 10 centers in France.
The study will be conducted in 2 arms: Arm A: 110 patients treated by operative hysteroscopy Arm B: 110 patients treated by endo-uterine aspiration
The study will be conducted in 2 phases:
Phase 1: Pre-operative consultation, surgical management of trophoblastic retention, post-operative consultation at 6 weeks after surgery, telephone consultation at 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.

The goal of this study is to use on-line crowdsourcing to study human inference strategies. We will use a task in which subjects are shown a pair of jars each filled with the same absolute number but different ratios of red/blue balls. Three blocks of trials exist, short-term inference (subjects must identify which of the equally likely jars is currently in use), long-term inference (subjects must predict the subsequent jar in use on the next trial, where jar switches are correlated across trials), or multi-timescale inference (subjects must both report the current jar and predict the subsequent jar, combining the short and longterm inferences). Subjects will draw balls as many balls as they wish with replacement (free response) during the short-term and multi-timescale blocks but will know the current jar in use for long-term inference. We will use a Bayesian model to estimate the inference strategies used by subjects. We will also use a psychophysical model to estimate the sensory parameters of the task."

Insomnia is a highly common, chronic disorder that is distressful for the patient but also for caregivers and can give rise to a heavy burden on the healthcare team. Sleeping aids like benzodiazepines and other sedatives (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone) have been widely used to help treat insomnia. However, sleeping aids are also known to cause adverse drug reactions such as drowsiness and dizziness, that increases the risk of falls, driving impairment, visual impairment, cognitive impairment, and upon discontinuation may cause paradoxical rebound insomnia, delirium, and nightmares all of which exacerbate the initial insomnia. All of the negative aspects of sleeping aid use are exaggerated for older, frail adults. Some patients experience an early (young-age) onset dementia with a substantial component of insomnia. Due to the many risks associated with traditional sleeping aids they are often inappropriate in adults living with cognitive impairment and/or frailty. Lemborexant comes from a new class of medications for insomnia. Lemborexant is a dual orexin receptor antagonist that blocks the binding of wake-promoting neuropeptides orexin A and orexin B to their receptors orexin 1 receptor (OX1R) and orexin 2 receptor (OX2R), which is thought to suppress wake drive. Unlike other traditional sleeping aids, lemborexant has not shown to be significantly associated with driving impairment, rebound insomnia, or dependence/withdrawal symptoms. Also, in clinical trials it only rarely causes the types of adverse events associated with benzodiazepines and other traditional sedatives and is less often associated with discontinuations due to adverse events. While lemborexant is available on the Canadian market it is unclear how this medication will be tolerated by patients living with dementia and insomnia. Understanding the effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of lemborexant will be helpful in an N of 1 trial to understand the details of effect and effectiveness in individual patients living with dementia."

Breathing exercises are the most important part of pulmonary rehabilitation for COPD patients. It helps patients to increase their lung capacity, allowing them to breathe more easily. At the same time, since the patient can easily do breathing exercises by himself, it is also beneficial to provide disease control and self-management. Although breathing exercises are simple and easy to apply, difficulties in the disease process can prevent the individual from doing this. For this reason, there is a need for applications that will attract the attention and interest of the patient, direct them, but that will not create commitment to the hospital. In this sense, it has been reported that breathing exercises to be applied through virtual reality glasses will attract the attention and interest of the patient, increase their motivation and make breathing exercises more regular. Therefore, this study was planned to determine the effect of breathing exercises applied with virtual reality glasses on dyspnea, anxiety and quality of life in COPD patients.

Material and Method: The study was conducted in a single-blind pre-test post-test parallel group randomized controlled experimental design. The sample size of the study was determined as a result of the power analysis made by taking FEV1% in a study, and considering the losses, it was planned to form the sample of the study of 48 patients, 24 in the experimental and 24 in the control group. In the study, block randomization was chosen to reduce selection bias and distribute patients equally to groups. Patients who accept to participate in the study who meet the inclusion criteria will be pre-tested and assigned to the groups. Since the intervention will be applied in the research, investigator blinding will not be possible, and it is planned to blind the participants, whose consent forms have been prepared separately for the patients in the experimental and control groups. Statistician will be blinded.

The goal of this study is to understand the multilevel determinants of cardiovascular health in Black women. The study will use a biobehavioral approach to examine the interplay of biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that influence cardiovascular health. The study will also examine the impact of racial discrimination and microaggressions on cardiovascular health.
The study will be conducted in two phases. Phase 1 will involve a series of lab-based assessments to evaluate cardiovascular health. Phase 2 will involve a 10-day free-living monitoring period with mobile and wearable devices.
Participants will be recruited from the community and will be asked to complete a series of lab-based assessments to evaluate their cardiovascular health. These assessments will include: heart rhythm/rate, blood pressure, large blood vessel flow, central aortic blood pressure and pulse wave velocity, brain blood flow, carbon dioxide concentration, flow mediated dilation/blood vessel responsiveness, breathing rate, and cerebral vasomotor reactivity. In addition, venous blood sample will be taken to identify biomarkers that are associated with elevating blood pressure and decreasing blood flow.
The 10-day monitoring period will include a wrist-worn activity tracker and a blood pressure monitor bracelet; a smartphone app that will prompt surveys up to 6 times a day to assess behaviors, social/physical context, mood/stress, and experience of racial discrimination/microaggression. Participants will also collect saliva samples on three consecutive days during the 10-day monitoring period."

Hot flashes are the most common symptom of menopause and affect almost 75% of menopausal women. Clinical evidence indicates potent antagonists of 5-HT2a are more likely to cause hypothermia. Risperidone is a potent 5-HT2a and a dopamine D2 receptor antagonist and is proposed to have effect on reduction of hot flashes through its dopaminergic and serotonergic antagonism. Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women, according to the cancer registration report of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW), in 2014, up to 11,976 women suffered from breast cancer, which meant 33 women suffered from breast cancer daily. Recent epidemiology further disclosed that the incidence of breast cancer was top-ranked (70.74 per 100,000) among cancers of Taiwanese women in 2014. Due to the fact that majority of breast cancers are estrogen-receptor and/or progesterone receptor positive, tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are among the mainstay therapies to treat breast cancer. Prior clinical studies of tamoxifen suggested that up to 80 % of patients experienced hot flashes during therapy with tamoxifen, and 30 % defined their symptoms as severe. Despite the high efficacy of tamoxifen, the harmful side effects have been identified in previous studies as a significant reason for not persisting with the treatment in 16 - 30 % of breast cancer patients. Therefore, a new therapy for treating hot flashes in breast cancer patients without increasing the risk of cancer recurrence is needed for such patient population, for example, a non-hormonal therapy. FDA approved low-dose paroxetine capsules (Brisdelle®) as a non-hormonal therapy for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause, despite the modest efficacy as compared with placebo, suicidal ideation and the drug-drug interactions (i.e., Brisdelle® and tamoxifen) .

Neck pain is one of the most common and painful musculoskeletal conditions. Point prevalence ranges from 6% to 22% and up to 38% of the elderly population, while lifetime prevalence ranges from 2% to 71%. For the majority of the neck disorders there is an absence of an identifiable underlying disease or abnormal anatomical structure. From this perspective .NS-NP is mainly 'diagnosed' on the basis of clinical grounds, provided there are no features to suggest a specific or more serious condition. The symptoms of nonspecific neck pain are similar to those of whiplash associated disorders (WAD) grade I and II but there is no traumatic event involved. Nonspecific neck pain (NP) is defined as pain in the posterior and lateral aspect of the neck between the superior nuchal line and the spinous process of the first thoracic vertebra with no signs or symptoms of major structural pathology and no or minor to major interference with activities of daily life as well as with the absence of neurological signs and specific pathologies. Chronic nonspecific neck pain is diagnosed as cervical pain without a known pathological basis as the underlying cause of the complaints. Characteristic of chronic nonspecific neck pain are heavy pain, worsening with exertion and relieve with rest. In some cases the cause may be sprain or overstretch of a ligament or muscles. Nonspecific neck belongs to the group of musculoskeletal disorders, which include diverse conditions affecting muscles, bones, and/or joints of the limbs or the spine. As for most other musculoskeletal disorders, nonspecific neck pain is multifactorial. A variety of different types of exercise have been explored to treat chronic nonspecific neck pain, including low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise, high intensity aerobic exercise, stretching exercise and muscular strength exercises and isometrics. However, the most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain is unknown reflecting its complexity and more research is require. The rationale of the study is to compare the effects of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy on pain, range of motion and functional disability in chronic nonspecific neck pain.

All patients will undergo a baseline clinical examination, with computed tomography or MRI to assess cerebral lesions, and health records will be collected. Clinical variables will be measured with standard procedures after overnight fasting. Patients with evidence of heart failure, valvular defects, malignant neoplasms, or secondary causes of hypertension will be excluded. Specimens of the portion of carotid bifurcation that showed maximum disease will be obtained from atherectomy and will be cut in two halves and frozen in liquid nitrogen or fixed in in 10% buffered formalin for subsequent analyses. Plaque specimens will be then used to assess the presence and the amount of volatile organic compounds and microplastics through pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. To corroborate these findings, plaque specimens will be also observed with transmission electron microscopy to visually identify microplastics within the atheroma and obtain further evidence and structural insights.

Background:
Colorectal cancer is the second most common cancer in the world. The liver is the most common site of metastases. The prognosis of patients with liver metastases is poor. The median survival time is 6-12 months. The standard treatment for patients with liver metastases is surgical resection. However, only 10-20% of patients are eligible for surgery.
Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a new treatment for patients with liver metastases. It is a minimally invasive procedure that delivers radioactive microspheres to the tumor through the hepatic artery. The microspheres are small beads that are made of glass or resin. They are coated with a material that allows them to be delivered to the tumor through a catheter. The microspheres are then released into the tumor. The radiation from the microspheres kills the tumor cells.
TARE is a promising treatment for patients with liver metastases. It is less invasive than surgery and can be performed on an outpatient basis. It is also well tolerated by patients.
Objectives:
To investigate the effectiveness of TARE in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
To investigate the safety of TARE in patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer.
Eligibility:
Patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer who are not eligible for surgery.
Design:
Patients will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests.
Patients will undergo a CT scan of the liver to determine the size and location of the tumors.
Patients will be admitted to the hospital for TARE.
The procedure will be performed under local anesthesia.
A catheter will be placed in the femoral artery.
The microspheres will be delivered to the tumor through the catheter.
The procedure will take about 2 hours.
Patients will be monitored in the hospital for 24 hours after the procedure.
Patients will be followed up with CT scans every 3 months for 2 years.

The study aimed to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF). The platform was integrated with the hospital's electronic medical record system and used a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 smartwatch for remote monitoring. The study was conducted at the Heart Institute of the Clinics Hospital of the Medical School of the University of São Paulo (InCor - HCFMUSP). It was a single-center study divided into six phases. The first phase involved outpatient preoperative care, where patients underwent a comprehensive anamnesis during the preoperative consultation and were informed about the study. In the second phase, patients were hospitalized and provided with the Informed Consent Form (ICF) if they met the inclusion criteria. Demographic data were collected during this phase. During the surgical phase (third phase), intraoperative data were collected after cardiac surgery. The fourth phase focused on postoperative care, where patients were evaluated, and health measures such as blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) were collected using the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smartwatch and reference devices. After discharge, the fifth phase involved a 30-day telemonitoring period, where patients were remotely monitored using the smartwatch. Health data, including BP, HR, ECG, and SpO2, were collected three times a day during this phase. The medical team provided clinical interventions when alerts were received via the FAPO SI³ platform. In the final phase, patients returned for an outpatient visit at InCor, where health measures were collected again using the smartwatch and reference devices. Additionally, a World Health Organization Quality of Life (WHOQOL) questionnaire was administered to assess patients' quality of life. ECG reports issued by the smartwatch were also reviewed.

The program involves coherent groups of motivated participants in smaller groups of 7-10 persons. Participants are adults with body mass index (BMI) in the range of overweight or obese and are motivated to change their lifestyle. During the five days of the program held outside the medical facility positive interaction and mutual support of the participants develop in the group together with education and an informal approach, along with practical workshops on nutrition, daily physical activity and psychological support, patients receive practical recommendations for life. Follow-up continues in the form of short additional educational lectures, support, and body weight measurement after one month, three months, six months and after a year. Participants are encouraged to stay in contact between the meetings using the same instant messaging platform in a form of a closed group, and a leader of the program is sending inspirational messages and advice regularly. Initially, after 3 and 6 months a metabolic parameter evaluation is performed (fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile) as well as blood pressure is measured. Individual anthropometric measurements of the participants are carried out on the first day of the program and continued at every visit. The parameters taken are body height (cm), body mass (kg), waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm), BMI (kg/m2), the proportion of fat tissue (%) and muscle tissue (%), basal metabolism (kcal) and visceral adipose tissue. On the first day of the program, an initial questionnaire is filled out exploring sociodemographic and health data, data on eating habits, physical activity and psychological. Education During the 5-day participants have lectures explaining in a simple short interactive lecture a different topic related to obesity followed by discussion. Topics explain concerns about obesity as a disease, the background of obesity, metabolic and cardiovascular consequences of obesity, nonverbal communication and obesity, the plateau phenomenon and the epidemiology of obesity.

Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP); It is a disease characterized by incomplete vascularization of the retina seen in premature and low birth weight infants, the etiology and pathogenesis of which are unknown, causing vision loss. There is an increase in the incidence and severity of ROP development in direct proportion to the decrease in the week of birth and birth weight. While ROP is a problem below 32 weeks of gestation in developed countries, it is reported to develop severely up to 34 weeks of gestation in developing countries. In a multicenter study conducted by the Turkish Neonatology Society in our country, the frequency of ROP in very low birth weight preterm infants was found to be 42%, and the frequency of advanced ROP was 11%. The frequency of ROP was found to be 6.1%, and advanced ROP was 6 per thousand in babies with a birth weight of 1500-2000 grams. The frequency of ROP was found to be 10.3% in babies with a gestational age of 33-35 weeks at the time of examination. Thanks to the increasing frequency of preterm birth in recent years and scientific and technological advances in neonatology, life expectancy is extended up to the 23rd week of gestation. However, this increased the incidence of retinopathy. Therefore, it is of great importance for neotologists, pediatricians and nurses who care for preterm newborns to know the pathophysiology, staging, risk factors and principles of appropriate care for them in reducing the incidence, possible complications and mortality rates of ROP. ROP examination is a procedure that causes pain, deterioration in comfort and physiological changes in preterm newborns. After this examination, an increase in blood pressure and heart rate and a decrease in oxygen saturation are observed. These physiological changes observed after the examination continue for 24 hours. Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (non-pharmacological) methods are used to reduce pain. As a pharmacological method, there is no other routine method used to reduce pain other than the administration of local anesthetic drops before the examination. Because of this situation, nurses apply various non-pharmac"

Stroke is a leading cause of death and disability in the United States. The annual cost of stroke is estimated to be $34 billion. The incidence of stroke is expected to increase by 2050 to 4.5 million. The global burden of stroke is nearly 4-fold greater than hemorrhagic stroke with close to 87% of the total incidence of stroke attributed to acute cerebral ischemic stroke (ACIS). ACIS is a critical care emergency caused by a significant reduction in blood flow to the brain by a blood clot or embolism. This nearly halts cerebral blood flow to the affected region leading to neuronal death. Neuronal cell death is followed by plasma membrane disruption, swelling of organelles, leaking of cell contents into extracellular space, and loss of neuronal function. Other events that take place include inflammation, excitotoxicity, free radical mediated toxicity, cytokine mediated cytotoxicity, impaired blood-brain-barrier, and oxidative stress. Therapeutic management of ACIS is a multidisciplinary approach with a primary goal of revascularization and limiting neuronal injury. A stroke team consists of emergency medicine physicians, neurologists/neurosurgeons, radiologists, nurses and advanced care providers, clinical pharmacists, therapists, technicians, and laboratory personnel. Currently, the only FDA-approved pharmacological agent for ischemic stroke is tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). It is a thrombolytic agent which restores blood flow by breaking down a clot. However, timing is crucial in administration of t-PA in ACIS as the therapeutic time window is very narrow and the patient must receive it within 4.5 hours of onset of stroke symptoms. Therapeutic administration after this timeframe can result in hemorrhagic transformation, leading to additional brain damage. Nevertheless, even upon timely administration of t-PA in ACIS, only about 30% of patients obtain stroke resolution having minimal or no disability at the 90-day mark.

Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is a severe mental illness with high morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of BPD in the general population is 1.6%, and the prevalence in psychiatric hospitals is 10-20%. The prognosis of BPD is poor, and the mortality rate is 4-10 times higher than that of the general population. The main causes of death are suicide and accidents. The main clinical manifestations of BPD are impulsive behavior, self-injury, and unstable interpersonal relationships. The main treatment methods are psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. The current study is an ambispective cohort study. The information collected in the retrospective part mainly included demographic data, comorbid psychiatric diagnosis, psychotherapeutic and pharmacotherapeutic data, times of hospitalization and patients' contact information. The above data were derived from electronic medical records. After informed consent, prospective follow-up was initiated primarily by telephone interviews and web-based questionnaires, or by in-person assessments at hospital return visits. Enrolled patients will be followed up at 6-month intervals after the first follow-up to assess psychiatric diagnosis, social function, and quality of life. The researchers are senior psychiatrists, all of whom received training on the use of questionnaires and inter-investigator consistency before the follow-up. Cox Proportional Hazard Model is used to analyze the influencing factors of remission of BPD, and Generalized Estimating Equation Model is used to analyze the influencing factors of the patients' social function and quality of life."

Evaporative dry eye (EDE) is the most prevalent form of dry eye disease (DED), which is primarily caused by meibomian gland hypofunction or meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is defined as ''a chronic, diffuse anomaly of the meibomian glands, often characterized by terminal duct blockage and/or qualitative/quantitative alterations in glandular secretion'' by the International Workshop on MGD. These glands are modified sebaceous glands that release meibum directly onto the ocular surface. Signs and symptoms of EDE and MGD can be addressed by improving the quality and quantity of meibum secretion. Intense pulsed light (IPL) is widely used to treat dermatological conditions, and its noncoherent polychromatic light source with wide wavelength range of 500-1200 nm has been reported to stimulate facial sebaceous glands. The photothermal effect of IPL is postulated to relieve inflammation by removing aberrant surface microvasculature and enhances meibomian gland function. Furthermore, an increase in fibroblast proliferation, collagen formation and local blood flow has been associated with the application of IPL on the skin. Diquafosol ophthalmic solution (DQS) is a dinucleotide polyphosphate which a purinoceptor agonist, when administered to the ocular surface, it binds to P2Y2 receptors and stimulates mucin and tear secretion. The corneal epithelium, conjunctival epithelium, lacrimal gland ductal epithelium, meibomian gland sebaceous cells, and meibomian gland ductal cells all express the P2Y2 receptor. Subsequently, enhanced secretion of mucin and tear secretion due to DQS ophthalmic solution leads to stabilization of the tear film, minimizes tear evaporation, and reduces mechanical friction thereby protecting the corneal epithelium. The purpose of this study is to assess the management of dry eye with Intense Pulsed Light in combination with Diquafosol."

Background:
Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are a new class of drugs that have shown promise in treating patients with cancer. However, they can cause side effects that affect the immune system. One of these side effects is inflammation of the joints (irritable arthritis or arthralgia). This can cause pain and swelling in the joints.
The purpose of this study is to see if methotrexate can help relieve the symptoms of irAEs in patients with cancer who are taking ICI therapy. Methotrexate is a drug that is commonly used to treat arthritis. It is also used to treat other conditions, such as psoriasis and Crohn's disease.
The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part, patients will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. They will also have blood and urine tests.
Patients who are eligible for the study will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Group 1 will receive methotrexate 20 mg once a week for 12 weeks. Group 2 will receive methotrexate 20 mg once a week for 12 weeks, plus prednisone starting at 20 mg once a day for 8 weeks, then tapering the dose over 4 weeks.

Sleep is one of the basic physiological needs of man and is necessary for the normal functioning of the body. Sleep disorders can impair cognitive function, decision-making ability, exercise capacity, and immune system. Sleep disorders, which may occur in the perioperative period as short-term or long-term, affect many patients. Studies have shown that approximately 8.8-79.1% of patients experience perioperative sleep disorders, and this situation can continue for a long time after surgery. According to animal and human studies, anesthetic agents may cause sleep disturbances in the postoperative period. Anesthetics can disrupt the normal sleep-wake cycle and thus cause sleep insufficiency and poor sleep quality. Pain is the most important risk factor for sleep disturbance in the perioperative period. There is a very serious interaction between pain and sleep. Pain can exacerbate sleep disorders. At the same time, sleep disorders can make the pain worse. Perioperative pain accompanies physical discomfort and is very common, especially in osteoarthritis patients. The goals of total hip arthroplasty (TKA) include relief of these pains and improvement of physical function. Different types of surgery have varying effects on sleep quality. Patients report that they experience more sleep disruption due to pain after orthopedic surgery. Depending on the greater trauma caused by major surgery, the sleep quality of the patients may be worse. The elderly and female gender are more likely to experience sleep disorders. Environmental factors and healthcare practices in the hospital may contribute to sleep disorders. Postoperative environment change, inadequate beds, noise and lights in the ward, medical staff, night treatment and nursing controls, machine noises, postoperative diets and warnings from the urinary catheter are additional factors that affect patients' sleep. Evaluation of sleep disorders is mainly based on clinical symptoms (difficulty falling asleep, early awakening, night terrors, nightmares or abnormal behavior during the sleep period) and auxiliary objective scales. Subjective sleep quality assessment mainly scales: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index questionnaire (PSQI), Pittsburgh Insomnia Rating Scale (PIRS), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Athens Insomnia Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), General Sleep Disturbance Scale (GSDS)."

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a rare, but serious, autoimmune disorder that causes weakness and paralysis. It is the most common cause of acute flaccid paralysis in the United States. The cause of GBS is unknown, but it is believed to be triggered by an infection. The most common infections associated with GBS are Campylobacter jejuni, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae.
The standard treatment for GBS is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). IVIg is a blood product that contains antibodies. It is thought to work by neutralizing the antibodies that are attacking the body's nerves.
Efgartigimod is a new drug that is being studied as a possible treatment for GBS. It is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn is a protein that helps to recycle antibodies. By binding to FcRn, efgartigimod prevents antibodies from being recycled. This may help to reduce the amount of antibodies that are attacking the body's nerves.
The purpose of this study is to see if efgartigimod is safe and effective in treating GBS. The study will also look at how well efgartigimod works compared to IVIg.
The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either efgartigimod or IVIg. In the second part, patients who received efgartigimod in the first part will be randomly assigned to receive either efgartigimod or IVIg.

Cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP) is a rare complication of pregnancy, occurring in 1-2% of all pregnancies after cesarean section. The incidence of CSP is increasing due to the increasing number of cesarean sections performed worldwide. CSP is a life-threatening condition for the mother and the fetus. The treatment of CSP is based on the use of methotrexate (MTX) and the evacuation of the products of conception (POC). The aim of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of adding letrozole to the protocol of combined treatment of CSP. The study is a prospective cohort study. Women with CSP confirmed on pelvic ultrasound and increasing B-hCG concentrations are included. Two study arms were planned: women treated with a single dose of 100 mg MTX intravenously and 50 mg MTX in intra-amniotic injection (day 0), along with 30 mg potassium chloride in case of positive fetal heartbeat (FH) women treated with a single dose of 100 mg MTX intravenously and 50 mg MTX in intra-amniotic injection (day 0), along with 30 mg potassium chloride in case of positive FH (FH) with additional use of letrozole 5 mg orally (from day 0) for 10 days. Blood parameters (B-hCG, hemoglobin, total blood count, creatinine, urea, alanine/aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin) were tested on days 0,4,7, followed by B-hCG concentration measurement every 7 days until surgery. After obtaining satisfactory decrease in B-hCG and POC vascularization, women underwent hysteroscopic evacuation of POC. Blood loss parameters, frequency of conversion from hysteroscopy to laparoscopy and laparotomy were measured. The women were given the option to choose the treatment used in the study.

Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an emerging breast imaging modality that is based on dual-energy mammography and the injection of iodinated contrast agent. A typical CEM study consists of a low-energy image (equal to a FFDM image) and a recombined image (in which areas of contrast enhancement can be appreciated). However, the situation can occur that lesions are visible only on the recombined (contrast) images (in this protocol defined as 'recombined-only lesions' or ROLs). In these cases, we need to perform 'contrast-enhanced stereotactic biopsy' (CESB), in which CEM is used as a targeting modality. However, experiences with CESB are still limited and one of the most urgent questions that need to be answered is the amount of tissue sampling that is required to reach a final diagnosis. We aim to study where the cut off will be in terms of tissue sampling volume needed (i.e., number of biopsies) for a reliable diagnosis.
Objective: To determine the minimum number of CESB-guided tissue samples needed to establish a final histopathological biopsy diagnosis for ROLs.
Study design: Prospective, single center, observational cohort study.
Study population: Non-pregnant women (>18 years) able to provide written informed consent and with a ROL recently observed during a regular CEM examination.
Intervention: Included subject will undergo CESB, consisting of an intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent prior to image acquisition. After administration, a contrast-enhanced stereotactic localization will be performed of the ROL to determine the location and depth of the lesion within the breast. After targeting, 18 samples will be acquired using a 9 Gauge vacuum-assistend biopsy (VAB), collected in six separate and numbered cassettes, to be able to determine the chronological order of the tissue sampling. Each specimen will be histologically analyzed in this chronological order and findings will be compared with the final histopathological result after assessment of all 18 specimens.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative joint disease that causes other joint tissues to lose gross cartilage and to experience morphological damage. Pathological changes seen in knee osteoarthritis joints include progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage, thickening of the subchondral bone, formation of osteophytes, variable degrees of inflammation of the synovium, degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee and hypertrophy of the joint capsule. Biomechanical factor that is assumed to contribute to the etiology of OA is laxity of knee joint, which is described as the rotation or displacement of femur from tibia. One research found that Varus-valgus laxity in patients with unaltered knees and unilateral OA is wider than in stable healthy participants, indicating knee joint laxity may be disease predisposing. The progress of the lateral and medial knee OA, as defined by narrowing of joint space and a degradation of physical activity, was found to have been linked with lower limb valgus-Varus alignment. The main focus in OA management is on promoting self-management, reducing pain, optimize function, and modifying the disease process and its effects. The primary treatment for OA knee conservatively is physiotherapy which includes strength training, modalities, knee bracing, resistance training and Kinesiotaping. Resistance exercise can reduce knee pain severity and leg strength in participants with symptomatic knee OA. Exercise interventions using free weights or machines have generally focused on movements with concentric muscle contractions. Previous interventions were developed based on loads lifted during the concentric phase. Kinesiotape (KT), is an elastic woven-cotton strip with a heat- sensitive acrylic adhesive structure. Kinesiotape is applied on the anterior thigh (quadriceps) region starting at 1/5 of the distance between anterosuperior iliac spine (ASIS) and tibia tuberosity.

The study - interventional, nonpharmacological, using medical devices, nonprofit - is aimed at evaluating the potential effectiveness of a multimodal intervention for the treatment of unipolar depression. The intervention involves the use of a neuro-stimulation technique, the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS), combined with a psychotherapy intervention, metacognitive therapy (MetaCognitive Therapy, MCT). TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique involving the transcranial application of a low-amperage electric current at a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been demonstrated how such stimulation has a neuromodulating effect on synaptic plasticity, with efficacy in unipolar major depression. The technique also has a good safety, as it is not associated with major side effects. MCT is based on the metacognitive model, according to which psychopathological processes are consequent to a cognitive style characterized by repetitive forms of thinking (such as rumination) and maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and thought suppression. The MCT, through attention training techniques, detached mindfulness and behavioral interventions on metacognitions, has shown effectiveness in major depressive disorder comparable to that of psychotherapeutic interventions considered, within psychotherapies, to be first-line such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. The experimental design will be that of a randomized, double-blind study with three arms of treatment, each consisting of 8 sessions, involving the administration of 1) the neurostimulation intervention (tDCS), 2) of the psychotherapeutic intervention alone (MCT), 3) of both techniques in consecution (tDCS-MCT). This design is aimed at evaluating a potential additive/synergistic effect of the two interventions when combined. During the tDCS sessions, each lasting 20 minutes, the patient will apply the technique of attention training, aimed at further activating the region stimulated by neurostimulation, so as to amplify the plasticity stimulated by tDCS, achieving a synergistic effect.

HIV infection is a chronic disease that can affect the central nervous system (CNS) and cause a wide range of neurocognitive disorders. The most common of these are mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and dementia. The most frequent cognitive impairment in HIV+ patients is a deficit in executive functions, which are a set of cognitive processes that allow the individual to plan, organize, and execute complex tasks. Executive functions are also involved in prospective memory, which is the ability to remember to perform a task at a specific time in the future. Prospective memory is a fundamental component of everyday life, and it is essential for the successful performance of daily activities.
The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between prospective memory and executive functions in HIV+ patients. The investigators will also investigate the relationship between prospective memory and global cognitive performance, and between prospective memory and hot and cold cognition.
The investigators will recruit 30 HIV+ patients and 30 healthy subjects. All subjects will be administered the Memory for Intentions Screening Test (MIST) to assess prospective memory. The investigators will also administer the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) to assess global cognitive performance, the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) to assess hot and cold cognition, and the Modified Five Point Test to assess cold cognition.
The investigators hypothesize that HIV+ patients will have a deficit in prospective memory, and that this deficit will be related to executive functions and to global cognitive performance. The investigators also hypothesize that prospective memory will be related to hot and cold cognition."

Celiac disease (CD) is a common autoimmune disease of the small intestine. The prevalence of CD in the general population is estimated to be 1% in the United States and Europe. The diagnosis of CD is based on a combination of clinical, serological and histological findings. The gold standard for the diagnosis of CD is the detection of intestinal damage by histology and the presence of anti-tissue transglutaminase (tTG) antibodies. The diagnosis of CD is often delayed due to the lack of specific symptoms and the need for invasive intestinal biopsies. The development of a rapid, non-invasive and cost-effective method for the detection of intestinal anti-tTG antibodies would be of great clinical value.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a rapid technique for the detection of intestinal anti-tTG antibodies in patients undergoing an elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) for suspected CD.

Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and is associated with a 4-fold increased risk of stroke. The annual stroke risk in untreated patients is 4.5%, but varies 10-fold based on risk factors captured in clinical prediction tools. Given that oral anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk by 65%, the majority of AF-associated strokes are potentially preventable. All current Canadian and international AF guidelines strongly recommend use of clinical prediction rules to assess stroke risk, and anticoagulation of high-risk patients. However, population-based studies continue to document significant rates of risk-discordant stroke prevention therapy. Addressing this care gap is a major knowledge translation challenge. Patient decision aids are knowledge translation tools that can facilitate a process of shared decision-making to improve patient knowledge and decision quality. These tools have the potential to improve both initial therapy selection and adherence, ultimately reducing the risks of AF-associated stroke and unnecessary bleeding. We have developed and performed initial user testing for a new, web-based decision aid, called Risk Assessment and Personal preferences to Improve Decisions for Atrial Fibrillation (RAPID AFib). The tool has 3 sequential functions: (1) it estimates an individual's risk for stroke and for bleeding using published risk scores; (2) it allows them to interactively compare OACs to select one or more therapies that best matches their risk profile and individual preferences ; and (3) it summarizes the risk information and their selected therapy to facilitate discussion with their physician in a Summary Report. This study represents the next step in this program of research, by performing a formal evaluation of the performance of this tool in a real-world clinical setting. Primary Objective: To conduct a pilot study to establish the acceptability of the RAPID AFib tool and its impact on the process of shared decision-making for stroke prevention therapy in patients with recent onset AF Hypothesis: The RAPID AFib decision aid will be acceptable for both patients and clinicians, and will lead to more effective shared decision-making than standard care among patients with AF who are considering OAC. Methods: Study Design: Prospective, randomized pilot study. Study procedures: Clinic staff will screen referred patients, then the research team will approach them to confirm elig"

Kienbock's disease is a common cause of wrist pain in young adults. It is a disease of the lunate bone, which is the most common carpal bone to be affected. The disease is caused by a lack of blood supply to the lunate bone, which can lead to death of the bone tissue. This can cause the bone to collapse, leading to pain and loss of function.
There are several treatment options for Kienbock's disease, but the most effective treatment is still unclear. One treatment option is to shorten the radius bone, which is the bone on the thumb side of the wrist. This can help to relieve the pressure on the lunate bone and reduce pain. Another treatment option is to shorten the capitate bone, which is the bone on the pinky side of the wrist. This can also help to relieve the pressure on the lunate bone and reduce pain.
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of these two treatments in patients with Kienbock's disease. The study will also compare the amount of pain and disability experienced by patients after each treatment.
The study will be conducted at the University of Michigan. Patients with Kienbock's disease will be screened with a medical history and physical examination. Patients who are eligible for the study will be randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups.
Patients in the radius shortening group will undergo surgery to shorten the radius bone. Patients in the capitate shortening group will undergo surgery to shorten the capitate bone.
After surgery, patients will be followed for 1 year. During this time, they will be asked to complete questionnaires about their pain and disability. They will also be asked to have x-rays of their wrist taken.

Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the 7th most common cancer and the 4th leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The 5-year survival rate is less than 10% and the median survival time is 6-12 months. The standard treatment for PC is surgery, but only 15-20% of patients are eligible for curative resection. The remaining patients are treated with palliative care. The main risk factors for PC are obesity, diabetes, smoking, and alcohol consumption. These factors are also associated with cancer-related cachexia, a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive weight loss, muscle wasting, and functional impairment. Cancer cachexia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in PC patients and is associated with a worse prognosis.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal prehabilitation program in localized PC patients undergoing surgery. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomized (ratio 1:1) and allocated either to the intervention group (Multimodal Prehabilitation) or to the usual care group. The intervention will consist of a multimodal prehabilitation, a 4-week long preoperative intervention including exercise training, nutritional therapy and anxiety reducing techniques, aimed at preventing or attenuating surgery-driven functional decline. The usual care group will receive usual preoperative care.
The primary outcome is the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI) at 90 days after surgery.

The study uses a longitudinal, within-person design with two parallel conditions. In one condition, youth receive a 6-week canine therapy intervention. The other condition consists of treatment as usual. The subject population are youth that are in a full-time residential treatment facility in Lawrence Hall. All studies activities take place in Lawrence Hall. Youth will be assigned to the Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy intervention group or the treatment-as-usual group. The Recovery & Care Canine-Assisted Therapy intervention is a 1.25 hour structured curriculum that will occur weekly across a period of 6 weeks. The program will be delivered by the Canine Therapy Corps (CTCorps). Youth will work with CTC-affiliate staff, including trained dog-handler teams, a canine behavior expert, and a clinical supervisor to engage in a series of structured activities progress throughout the intervention. Week 1 is a meet-and-greet session where youth are introduced to all dog-handler teams participating in the program and will be asked to select a team to work with for the following sessions. Each youth is assigned their own dog-handler team. Weeks 2 cover activities regarding dog obedience, building from mastering basic commands which the dog already knows (such as sit, stay') to the introduction of new tricks that the dog has not yet learned. In Weeks 3, youth will continue to work on mastering the new tricks with their dog-handler team and will also begin dog agility training. The agility training session progress in terms of complexity of number and types of obstacles. Week 4 is for proofing all skills (obedience, trick, agility) learned in previous weeks. Week 5 continues proofing all skills and is discussion of the graduation structure and dress rehearsal, and Week 6 is a graduation ceremony where family and friends are invited to observe the progress each youth has made with their dog-handler team.

Pes planus is a common foot problem in the general population. It is defined as a decrease in the longitudinal arch of the foot. It is seen that the prevalence of pes planus is 10-15% in the general population. Although it is seen that the prevalence of pes planus is higher in women, it is seen that the prevalence of pes planus is higher in men in young adults. Pes planus is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. However, it is known that it can cause pain in the foot and ankle in some cases. It is known that the foot core muscles are weak in individuals with pes planus. Foot core exercises are recommended to strengthen the foot core muscles. Myofascial release is a method that is used to release the tension in the fascia. It is known that myofascial release is effective in reducing pain and improving function in individuals with foot and ankle problems. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of myofascial release in addition to foot core exercises on lower extremity performance in young adults with asymptomatic flexible pes planus. The study will be carried out with a Randomized Controlled Prospective Study design. For this study, individuals between the ages of 18-25 years with a fall amount of 10 millimeters or more according to the navicular fall test and flexible pes planus according to Jack's finger lift test will be informed about the study and consent for participation will be obtained. Demographic information of the individuals who accept participation will be collected. This study, 2 randomized groups of young adults with flexible pes planus will be formed and one group will be applied an exercise program including only foot core exercises, while the other group will be applied self myofascial release with foam rollers, which is a myofascial release method, in addition to foot core exercises. Both the experimental and control groups will receive a program consisting of 7 different foot core exercises, each of which will be progressed gradually for 6 weeks, 3 sets of 10 repetitions per day. A brochure for the exercises will be prepared and given to the participants to do at home.

Early pregnancy loss is very common, approximately one in four women will experience a miscarriage in their lifetime. The etiology of pregnancy loss remains largely unknown, although genetic, anatomical, endocrinological and immunological abnormalities have been implicated. It is known that embryonic/fetal chromosomal aberrations contributed to approximately 50% of early pregnancy loss, among which 60-70% were aneuploidies, largely can be detected by the current gold standard karyotyping approach recommended by various international societies. However, the drawbacks of conventional karyotyping include the risk of culture failure, maternal cell contamination (MCC), limited detection resolution (5-10 Mb), and differential growth of specific cell lineages which could hinder the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities, particularly mosaicisms. Additional genetic factors beyond the resolution of karyotyping are not well studied. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has brought genetic testing to new frontiers, expanding the scope of detectable genomic variants. Moreover, its significant reduction in costs over the years has facilitated the implementation of genetic diagnostic testing. Our customized shallow read-depth genome sequencing analytical pipeline, namely low-pass genome sequencing (GS), enables efficient and cost-effective detection of genome-wide copy-number variants (CNVs, >50 kb) and low-level chromosomal mosaicisms (as low as 10%). Furthermore, the roles of cryptic structural rearrangements, absence of heterozygosity (AOH), and single-nucleotide variant (SNV) were less understood in current studies. Various versions of sequencing platforms targeting at different variants were already established and validated in the Prenatal Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, including FetalSeq, ChromoSeq, and 30xWGS. Human endometrial and decidual tissues, containing a myriad of immune and inflammatory populations, are immunologically dynamic.

Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is recommended for all patients with respiratory disease, e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis, but is not available to all patients that need it. The PR programme involves two, in-person, exercise classes per week over a period of 8 weeks after which the patient is discharged to self-care. While retaining some in-person contact, technology could increase access and automate delivery of education and exercise by overcoming shortages of skilled staff. New technology exists to allow the delivery of a hybrid PR programme which may be used to support a move to a remotely delivered service (with patients having the opportunity to attend in-person PR sessions during the programme if they need the motivation or support of an in-person session). This study will use a real-world study design drawing largely on routinely collected data to compare outcomes for patients recruited to a hybrid pulmonary rehabilitation programme with a propensity matched control group that has previously received standard pulmonary rehabilitation as part of usual care. Additional data will be collected from the Hybrid PR Group (via Active+me REMOTE App and Trial Surveys) to provide supporting evidence relating to uptake, adherence, clinical outcomes (not routinely recorded in standard practice), and usability/acceptability of the Hybrid PR programme. Patients with chronic respiratory disease who are referred to the Harefield Pulmonary Rehabilitation Programme will be screened for eligibility to participate in the Hybrid PR Trial. Informed consent will obtained in eligible patients who wish to take part. Recruited participants will follow a hybrid PR intervention involving two exercise classes per week. While this is an 8-week programme, this may be extended to up to 12 weeks for some patients (for example, if the patient is not able to attend 2 sessions per week). After completing the Hybrid PR programme, the participant will have a discharge assessment (as part of routine care). Demographic data from routine medical records and data on service location (i.e. hospital vs community setting) will be collected at baseline for the Hybrid PR Intervention and the Control Group. Data from routine medical records will be collected both at baseline and on completing the Hybrid/Standard PR programme. These data will include measures of exercise capacity"

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms. Motor symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor, which can lead to impaired manual dexterity and impaired touchscreen skills. The latter is a major problem in PD, as touchscreens are increasingly used in daily life. The investigators have recently shown that PD patients have impaired touchscreen skills, which can be improved by targeted training. However, the investigators have also shown that the training effects are not retained over time. Therefore, the investigators aim to examine the effects of a 2-week home-based training program with a 4-week follow-up on touchscreen skills in PD. The investigators will examine the training effects on the Swipe Slide Pattern (SSP) task, which is a touchscreen task that resembles the unlocking of a smartphone. The investigators will also examine the retention effects and the consolidation effects of the training program. The investigators will include 36 PD patients, who will be randomized (strata: age, H&Y stage) in the experimental or control group. The experimental group will train the SSP-task for a duration of two weeks, whereas the control group will not receive any intervention. Both immediately after training (T1) and after a four-week retention period (T2), touchscreen motor skills will be re-assessed at home. The most appropriate linear mixed models will be used to analyse SSP performance, with group (intervention - control) as between-subject factor and time (baseline - post - retention) as within-subject factor. LEDD and other confounders will be included as covariates. PD is a highly heterogeneous disorders, not only affecting motor but also cognitive functions. In fact, up to 80% of patients develops dementia over the disease course. Previous studies have identified global cognitive function as important determinants of training success. Therefore, cognitive function will be assessed extensively during the baseline session to investigate the association with training responsiveness. A global cognitive screen will consist of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Moreover, 2 specific tests will be used to assess each cognitive subdomain.

Postpartum depression, anxiety, and psychosis are frequent, burdensome disorders acknowledged by WHO. Investigations into their mechanisms, possible causes, and treatments are strongly needed.
The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of intensified tactile contact with a newborn on the emotional transformation of women after physiological delivery.
The study is a non-randomized quasi-experimental design. The dependent variables are: the level of emotions in the designated 'negative' domain (depression, anxiety, negative affects); the level of emotions in the designated 'positive' domain (satisfaction, sense of effectiveness, positive affects). Their values were measured with the use of four standardized, self-reported questionnaires two times, i.e. before and after the 12-week observation period.
The participants were selected from the local population of pregnant women who volunteered to provide experimental intervention to their children after birth. Purposive sampling was utilized based on specified eligibility criteria. The intervention (see below) started on the 3rd day after birth and lasted until the end of the 12th week after birth. Finally, 43 participants completed the procedure.
The intervention was applied in the form of intensified tactile contact between a mother and the newborn. It was done by means of Shantali massage applied at least in 2 sessions a day, 10 min each. Additional, spontaneous sessions were allowed. This started on the 3rd day after birth and lasted until the end of the 12th week after birth. A total of 169 mandatory sessions should have been provided plus spontaneous sessions, if any. No intervention was applied in the control group.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the health of Canadians. While most people recover from COVID-19 within a few weeks, some people continue to experience symptoms for months after their initial infection. These symptoms are referred to as post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). PACS is a complex condition that can affect many different parts of the body and can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life.
Osteopathic medicine is a form of manual therapy that focuses on the musculoskeletal system. Osteopathic physicians use a variety of techniques to treat pain and improve function. Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) is a type of manual therapy that involves gentle manipulation of the joints and soft tissues. OMT has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of conditions, including back pain, neck pain, and headaches.
The purpose of this study is to explore the potential benefits of OMT in the treatment of PACS. The study will be conducted at the University of Alberta Osteopathic Medical Clinic. Participants will be adults who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and are experiencing symptoms of PACS. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either OMT or standard care.
The study will measure the change in symptoms over time. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires before and after their treatment. The questionnaires will measure symptoms of PACS, as well as quality of life and functional status."

Frostbite is a multiphase process that starts with systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury, but it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia. At Regions Hospital, the main diagnostic method that has been used for over 20 years is conventional angiography. This clearly demonstrates the microvasculature of the tissues and allows the intra-arterial catheter directed sheaths to be placed to start thrombolytics, heparin, and vasodilators to treat the tissue ischemia. Other diagnostic modalities used elsewhere include Technetium 99 triple phase bone scans, SPECT imaging, and indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography. All of these imaging modalities demonstrate the perfusion of the affected tissue but do not allow for directed delivery of thrombolytics. In institutions that use these imaging modalities, thrombolytics are typically delivered in an intravenous fashion rather than intra-arterial. ICG microangiography is a technology that has had rapidly expanding applications in recent decades. These have included retinal imaging, determining perfusion of colorectal anast"

American football is one of the contact sports with the highest risk in terms of exposure to repeated head impacts and the formation of neurodegenerative diseases that negatively affect the quality of life in the later stage of life. According to studies conducted in recent years, these athletes have a high risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) later in life. It has been reported that there are increases in the levels of oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers and that some other biomarkers (BDNF, zonulin, telomere length, etc.) that may be associated with these may be adversely affected in American football players. It is necessary to develop new approaches to determine the preventive factors against the risk of neurodegenerative diseases that may occur in the later years of life due to contact sports such as American football. The Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) diet has antioxidant (vitamins, flavonoids, phytosterols, minerals, terpenes and phenols) and anti-inflammatory (oleic acid, polyphenols and unsaturated fatty acids) properties that are thought to be effective in improving oxidative stress, inflammation and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers. The MIND diet can also reduce intestinal permeability with its abundant fiber content (prebiotic effect). It has been reported that the supplementation of some nutrients (docosahexaenoic acid, eicosapentaenoic acid, etc.) that have an important place in the composition of the MIND diet in this group of athletes has a positive effect on some of these biomarkers. However, the studies in the literature are limited, and there is no study involving the MIND diet in American football players. This study was planned considering that the MIND diet may have positive effects on oxidative stress, inflammation, and neurodegenerative risk biomarkers in American football players, who are exposed to repetitive head impacts as a nature of this contact sport. American football players playing in the pro league will be included in this study. The"

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease that causes lung disease. The lungs of people with CF are damaged by a thick, sticky mucus that clogs the airways and traps bacteria. This makes it hard to breathe and causes lung infections. The damage to the lungs can lead to permanent lung damage and death.
The goal of this study is to learn more about the lungs of people with CF. Researchers want to see if a new imaging test can help them better understand how the lungs are damaged.
The new imaging test uses a gas called perfluoropropane (PFP). PFP is a safe, non-radioactive gas that is used in other imaging tests. It is inhaled through a mouthpiece.
Participants will be asked to breathe PFP through a mouthpiece for 5 minutes. They will be asked to hold their breath for 10 seconds while a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is done. The MRI scan will take about 1 hour.
Participants will be asked to come to the clinic for 3 to 5 visits over 1 year. At each visit, they will be asked to breathe PFP through a mouthpiece for 5 minutes. They will be asked to hold their breath for 10 seconds while a MRI scan is done.
The MRI scans will be used to create a 3-dimensional image of the lungs. The images will be used to measure how much of the lungs is damaged."

The double-lumen endobronchial tube (DLT) is the most commonly used airway management device in thoracic surgery. The DLT is a special endotracheal tube with two lumens, which can be used to selectively ventilate the right and left lungs. The DLT is used to provide a clear surgical field and protect the non-operative lung. The DLT is usually used in the lateral position, and the position of the DLT is very important for the success of the surgery. The DLT is prone to malposition during the change of the patient's position, which may affect the surgical field and the safety of the surgery. The incidence of DLT malposition is 10%-30%. The most common malposition is the right main bronchus (RMB) and the left main bronchus (LMB) are not in the correct position.

Sarcomas are rare cancers that can appear anywhere in the body where there is soft tissue such as muscle or fat. While sarcomas are rare, benign lumps in soft tissue are common and it is currently very difficult to tell the difference between the two using imaging. This means many patients with benign masses are referred for painful biopsies and waiting lists for biopsies are long due to the large diagnostic workload. This research aims to develop an AI algorithm that can differentiate between benign and malignant soft tissue masses. While an algorithm can be developed using existing routine data the researchers would like to investigate if adding quantitative MR images could make it more accurate. Patients who are already having a scan for sarcoma will be asked if they consent to extra MR images being acquired. These images will be used to provide extra information to the AI. The extra images will add a maximum of 10 minutes to the patients' standard MRI scan, meaning patients will not need to make an extra trip or undergo any extra procedures. Study participants will not need to receive MR contrast as part of this research. The extra images will not be used to make a diagnosis during this research. A small subset of patients will be asked if they would be willing to come for a second scan so that the researchers can see how reliable the measurements are, but this will be entirely optional."

Migraine is a neurological disease/disorder originating in the central nervous system with difficulty modulating responses to common sensory stimuli. It is characterized by being unilateral, frontotemporal, pulsatile, of moderate or severe intensity, nausea and/or vomiting, sensitivity to movement, visual, auditory, and other afferent stimuli may appear. In addition, other symptoms such as fatigue, neck stiffness, decreased concentration, mood swings and yawning may appear, and the headache may be anticipated up to 48 hours. It has been hypothesized that the possible relationship between the eyes and the pathophysiology of migraine is due to the trigeminal-cervical complex, since if there is an alteration it would be established by a nociceptive impulse that can trigger central sensitization in the trigeminal nuclei. Today, the quintessential treatment is pharmacological where the excessive use of medications can trigger possible side effects such as depression, anxiety, weight gain, fatigue and drowsiness, among others, causing an alteration in the patient's quality of life more than of the migraine attack. Several studies show that there are other non-pharmacological treatment options such as manual physiotherapy and therapeutic exercise for migraines, and that it is effective for reducing the intensity and frequency of attacks, the use of medication and improving the quality of life. At present, the role of oculomotricity in headache, although it may be promising, has not been extensively studied. In the literature that the investigators have reviewed, the investigators have found very few studies that investigate manual therapy directly on the eyeball, despite the great relationship of the trigeminal-vascular nerve with migraines and how it influences the different variables. The main objective of the present study is to investigate the impact and possible additional benefits of adding an oculomotor treatment to a manual therapy protocol of the cervical region in patients with migraine."

The purpose of this study is to determine if pre-operative pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) can reduce stress urinary incontinence (SUI) and improve patient quality of life (QoL) following holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). HoLEP is a minimally invasive surgical procedure for treatment of BPH and associated lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). It is a prostate size-independent procedure with excellent durability, high efficacy, and low complications rates. However, transient SUI following HoLEP may last for several months after surgery and can lead to diminished patient QoL during the recovery period. Measures to prevent or reduce post-operative SUI following HoLEP, including PFPT, may improve patient outcomes. SUI is also commonly documented after radical prostatectomy (RP) for prostate cancer. The mechanism for incontinence in both RP and HoLEP is thought to at least partially be related to temporary weakness of the external urinary sphincter, which is part of the pelvic floor musculature. While it is unclear if post-operative PFPT alone reduces SUI for patients who have undergone RP, there is evidence that PFPT started pre-operatively and continued post-operatively can decrease SUI following RP. The utilization of pre-operative PFPT for patients undergoing HoLEP to reduce post-operative SUI is currently not well documented. We propose a prospective randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of standardized pre-operative PFPT in reducing SUI and improving patient QoL following HoLEP. This study will help determine the role of pre-operative PFPT in the management of HoLEP associated SUI."

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. The pathogenesis of CD is multifactorial and involves genetic, environmental and immunological factors. The role of the microbiome in the pathogenesis of CD is increasingly recognized. The microbiome is a complex ecosystem of microorganisms that colonize the human body. The microbiome is essential for the proper functioning of the human body. However, in the case of CD, the microbiome is altered and this alteration is associated with the development of the disease. The microbiome is also involved in the recurrence of CD after surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the bacterial translocation in the mesentery of CD patients requiring surgery. The bacterial translocation is the passage of bacteria from the intestine to other parts of the body. This can lead to the development of infections and inflammation. The mesentery is a fatty tissue that surrounds the intestine. It is also the site of bacterial translocation in CD. The investigators will collect samples of mesenteric fat, intestinal tissue and blood from CD patients before and after surgery. The investigators will also collect samples from healthy volunteers. The investigators will use DNA sequencing to identify the bacteria present in the samples. The investigators will also use DNA sequencing to identify the genes that are responsible for the development of CD. The investigators will compare the bacterial translocation in CD patients before and after surgery. The investigators will also compare the bacterial translocation in CD patients and healthy volunteers. The investigators will also compare the bacterial translocation in CD patients with different genetic profiles.

The study hypothesis is that a lower starting dose of anticancer tablet treatments can lead to better treatment tolerability in older patients, while the benefits of treatment can be the same. The trial population consists of 30 patients aged 65 years or older, who are starting treatment with one of these anti cancer tablet treatments: pazopanib, olaparib, lenvatinib, sunitinib or palbociclib. This is a randomized study with 1:1 randomisation, stratified by type of anti-cancer treatment. The control group (half of the participants) will be treated with the standard-of-care, that means with the recommended starting dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose can be adjusted (lowered) if this is necessary, for example because of side effects, based on the judgment of the treating physician. The interventional group (half of the participants) will start with the lowest dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose will be increased every 2 weeks in case of good tolerability. Results of this pilot study will be used to inform the design of the larger randomised phase 2 trial, for example the primary endpoint, the amount of investigations and the size of the study population. Study visits are planned every 2 weeks for a total study duration of 12 weeks, the time point for analysis of the primary endpoint. Blood samples for PK analysis are collected every 2 weeks. A baseline blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic analysis."

Depression is a leading cause of disability worldwide. In India, the treatment gap for depression is estimated to be 80-90%. The investigators propose to implement a community-based intervention to reduce the treatment gap for depression in primary care settings in India. The investigators will implement a stepped wedge cluster randomized trial in 120 villages in Goa, India. The intervention will be delivered by existing healthcare workers (called counsellors from here onwards) within the health centres who will be trained to deliver the Healthy Activity Program (HAP). The HAP is a manualized and evidence-based psychological treatment based on behavioural activation. The investigators will also implement a community intervention to enhance demand for the HAP treatment and promote engagement with, and completion of, the HAP treatment. The community intervention is co-produced with local community members and includes strategies such as activities to increase awareness about depression (community meetings, street plays and health camps), and dissemination of psycho-educational materials (i.e., leaflets and posters), identify people with possible depression in the community, and facilitate access to HAP in the health centres. Additionally, the Sangathis will coordinate continuing care of people receiving HAP, through home visits to encourage behavioural activation, homework completion and following up with the counsellor, and engaging family members to support the patient in achieving treatment goals. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of the community intervention in increasing the uptake of the HAP treatment. The investigators will also evaluate the effectiveness of the HAP treatment in reducing the severity of depression. The investigators will also assess the cost-effectiveness of the community intervention."

Background:
Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common type of lymphoma in the Nordic countries. The standard first line treatment for patients with symptomatic disease is immunotherapy with or without chemotherapy. The most commonly used treatment regimens are rituximab plus bendamustin or CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), rituximab plus lenalidomide or rituximab monotherapy. The long-term outcome is similar for these regimens; 75-80% of patients are alive 10 years after initial treatment. A subgroup of 20-40% of patients does not respond to or relapse within 24 months of initial treatment (abbreviated POD24 for progression of disease within 24 months), and they risk poorer effect of second line treatments and shorter survival. Only 30-70% of these patients are alive 5 years after initial treatment, depending on the type of first line treatment.
The main hypothesis of this trial is that mosunetuzumab is better than standard 2nd line salvage regimens in terms of progression free survival 2 years after the initiation of 2nd line treatment in POD24 patients.
Objectives:
The main objective is to investigate the efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) mosunetuzumab monotherapy in follicular lymphoma (FL) with POD24.
The secondary objectives are to investigate safety of mosunetuzumab in patients with a current POD24 event prognostic significance of 18F-FDG-PET-CT response to mosunetuzumab rate of transformation to higher grade lymphoma following mosunetuzumab patients´ self-reported quality of life during and after mosunetuzumab resource usage related to mosunetuzumab

Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) remains a significant burden in the Australian population. Moreover, based on recent local data, it is clear that there are still opportunities to improve the management of this condition in Australia. In collaboration with leading experts in the field, analysis of the gaps in management of cholesterol in Australia has been undertaken. Key areas identified include Lack of regular lipid testing in general practice, Limited access to full range of management tools, current therapies aren't achieving clinical guidelines and poor medication adherence. To address these pain points, the ASCERTAIN study will implement a new model of care that has been co-created with leading cardiologists in Australia and feedback has been provided by a General Practitioner (GP) Advisory Committee. As the primary purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a new model of care implementation strategy compared to usual care in patients who have not reached their LDL-target, inclisiran and its approved Product Information will be made available in both arms to be used as per the treating physician's discretion. Participants taking part in this study will receive maximally tolerated statin and/or ezetimibe therapy with or without other LDL-C lowering therapies as per the treating physician's discretion. The study will include male and female participants ≥18 years of age with a history of ASCVD (coronary heart disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease or peripheral arterial disease) or ASCVD-risk equivalents who have elevated LDL-C (≥1.8 mmol/L).

The investigators propose to develop and evaluate a novel in-vehicle driving assessment system to provide actionable driving safety data and rehabilitation strategies tailored to ICU survivors, the participants' care partners and clinicians. The investigators will conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of a novel in-vehicle driving assessment system to provide actionable driving safety data and rehabilitation strategies tailored to ICU survivors, the participants' care partners and clinicians. The investigators will enroll a cohort of older ICU survivors (n=24) with risk factors for ICU-acquired cognitive impairment to complete neurocognitive measures and participate in driving data collection via in-vehicle sensors over a 6-month post-hospital discharge period. The investigators will evaluate the relationship between neurocognitive assessments and driving behavior and safety in older ICU survivors. The investigators will conduct stakeholder advisory panels on the priorities and data presentation needs of driving assessments for older ICU survivors. The stakeholder advisory panel insights will provide scientific justification and protocol feasibility to evaluate recruitment, acceptability and attrition for future full-scale implementation. As the population of older drivers grows, almost doubling in size from 2012 to 2040 there is an immediate and critical need to address this impactful issue. This work is designed in response to the NIA Strategic Plan (Goal C-1-9 Safety of Older Drivers) to contribute to a critical gap in health promotion to develop an evidence-based, in- vehicle driving assessment system to provide actionable driving safety data and rehabilitation strategies tailored to ICU survivors, the participants' care partners and clinicians."

Obesity is a serious public health problem that is associated with increased risk for a number of physical and mental health conditions. Although there are many effective treatments for obesity, most people do not seek treatment and many who do seek treatment do not achieve long-term weight loss. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a promising approach to obesity treatment that has demonstrated efficacy in a number of studies. ACT is a transdiagnostic approach that focuses on increasing psychological flexibility, which is the ability to engage in valued behaviors in the face of obstacles. ACT interventions have been shown to be effective in increasing psychological flexibility and improving weight-related outcomes. ACT interventions are also scalable and can be delivered in a variety of settings. The goal of the present study is to examine the efficacy of a brief ACT workshop for women with obesity. The workshop will be delivered in a group format and will focus on increasing psychological flexibility and improving weight-related outcomes. The workshop will be compared to a wait-list control condition. The primary outcome will be psychological flexibility, and secondary outcomes will include weight-related outcomes (e.g., weight loss, diet quality, physical activity, body image, and emotional eating). The study will also examine the mediating role of psychological flexibility in the relationship between the workshop and weight-related outcomes. The study will be conducted at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Participants will be recruited from the community and will be screened for eligibility. Participants will be randomly assigned to the workshop or the wait-list control condition. The workshop will be delivered over the course of 4 weeks, and the wait-list control condition will receive the workshop after the 4-week period. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, 1 week, and 1 month post-intervention. The study will provide important information about the efficacy of a brief ACT workshop for women with obesity. The study will also provide information about the mediating role of psychological flexibility in the relationship between the workshop and weight-related outcomes."

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, and surgery is the preferred treatment method for primary resectable GIST. The guidelines recommend that patients at high risk of recurrence should be treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) such as imatinib for at least 3 years after surgery. However, in actual clinical practice, some patients face the situation of early withdrawal or prolonged medication, so the timing of drug withdrawal needs to be further studied. Recent studies have reported that some GIST patients who have achieved disease control through long-term use of imatinib can still achieve a long progression-free survival after drug withdrawal, and those who relapse after drug withdrawal can still achieve disease control after re-use of imatinib. This suggests that for some selected patients, a drug holiday treatment mode could be possible, in which drugs are discontinued when appropriate and restarted if necessary. How to select patients suitable for this mode of treatment needs further exploration. Liquid biopsy of peripheral blood circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) can be used for the diagnosis, efficacy evaluation, recurrence and drug resistance monitoring of a variety of malignant tumors. Existing studies have explored the drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection assisting patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer to use TKI. Therefore, this one-arm prospective observational clinical study will assist some high-risk GIST patients who have been treated with imatinib for 3 years after surgery and have achieved disease control to adopt the treatment mode of drug holiday based on MRD detection, aiming to evaluate the value of MRD detection in monitoring postoperative recurrence of high-risk GIST, investigate the effect of drug holiday treatment mode based on MRD detection on disease recurrence and patient survival, and to explore whether it can delay the occurrence of drug-resistant mutations."

Down syndrome (DS) is a genetic disorder caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. It is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. Children with Down syndrome have a variety of physical and mental health problems. The most common physical problems are hypotonia, cardiac defects, and gastrointestinal problems. The most common mental health problems are attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, and anxiety. Children with Down syndrome also have problems with motor skills. They often have difficulty walking and running. They also have problems with balance and coordination.
Physical therapy can help children with Down syndrome improve their motor skills. One type of physical therapy that may be helpful is Dohsa hou exercises. Dohsa hou exercises are a type of psychomotor therapy that helps improve psychological problems by using bodily movements, sensation and relaxation experience.
The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of Dohsa hou exercises on functional mobility in children with Down syndrome. The study will be a randomized control trial. Children with Down syndrome who are between 6 and 12 years old will be divided into two groups. One group will receive Dohsa hou exercises and the other group will receive standard treatment. Both groups will receive 18 sessions of physical therapy over 6 weeks.

Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy are performed for many reasons such as recurrent tonsil and adenoid infections, sleep apnea, symptomatic adenotonsillar hypertrophy, halitosis, peritonsillar abscess, and it is one of the most performed surgeries in the world. During these operations, there may be fluid and blood accumulation in the stomach. Investigators wonder whether the amount of blood and fluid accumulated in the stomach after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in children will increase the risk of aspiration. For this purpose, the aim is to compare the results with values considered risky for aspiration by evaluating the pre- and postoperative gastric volume with ultrasound in children who underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. This study will include ASA 1,2,3 patients under the age of 18 who will undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in the operating rooms of Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, after the approval of the ethics committee.

Cardiac surgery is the most important treatment for serious coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease and other heart diseases. Its postoperative mortality and serious complications have also been widely concerned, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The persistent pulmonary hypertension and systemic vascular paralysis during the perioperative period are the main causes of early postoperative death and serious complications such as organ failure.Catecholamine vasoactive drugs commonly used in cardiac surgery may aggravate the condition of pulmonary hypertension, while the use of drugs to reduce pulmonary hypertension, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may worsen the state of systemic vascular paralysis. Vasopressin and oxytocin are two effective components in pituitrin, and vasopressin is the main component that exerts strong vasoconstrictive effect.Vasopressin binds to receptors distributed in vascular smooth muscle, pituitary and kidney, and exerts its effects by regulating adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel function, nitric oxide production and enhancing vascular response to catecholamine.In addition, oxytocin can also bind to the receptors distributed in the heart and vascular endothelium, and play a role by releasing atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide.Therefore, pituitrin can not only constrict systemic circulation vessels and increase systemic circulation pressure, reduce pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, but also protect the heart and kidney. Therefore, this study intends to explore whether pituitrin has an impact on the prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery, so as to provide reference for its clinical application."

Children with medical complexity (CMC) are increasingly prescribed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) for chronic respiratory failure. In our clinical experience, patients and families would prefer NiPPV initiation in the home environment but this is not standard of care. This proposal will evaluate the feasibility and safety of an innovative model of care for NiPPV initiation in the home environment utilizing remote telemonitoring compared to usual care which is in-hospital polysomnography (PSG) laboratory-based initiation. The incidence of CMC requiring NiPPV is exponentially growing. NiPPV effectively corrects abnormal gas exchange, improves sleep quality, and reduces symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. The use of NiPPV has been associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To ensure effectiveness, NiPPV must be used for all periods of sleep and settings must be individually-titrated. Unfortunately, poor adherence results in many CMC being undertreated for chronic respiratory failure. Successful NiPPV initiation is critical because early negative experiences are commonly reported barriers to adherence6 and early usage predicts longer term use. Standard of care is the initiation and titration of NiPPV during a one-night in-hospital PSG, during which NiPPV settings are titrated during the night by a PSG technologist to determine optimal settings according to current international guidelines. A PSG is challenging for CMC and families due to their medical fragility and lasting effects of travel and a disrupted routine, the significant amount of equipment and supplies that must be brought to the study as well as the financial implications and additional psychosocial stress for caregivers. Furthermore, negative experiences with NiPPV may be exacerbated by introduction of the therapy in an unfamiliar PSG laboratory with burdensome monitoring. Recent technological advances in remote NiPPV monitoring coupled with a shift to virtual care models has enabled a patient and family centered opportunity to bypass the PSG laboratory and initiate NiPPV at home. Home NiPPV initiation is increasingly being requested by patients and caregivers. The potential benefits of this innovative care model include increasing patient and family empowerment, improving the delivery of high quality patient-centred care at home, and optimizing NiPPV use.

Background:
Radioactive iodine (RAI) is a common treatment for thyroid cancer. RAI is taken by mouth and travels through the bloodstream to the thyroid gland. RAI is used to treat thyroid cancer that has spread to other parts of the body. RAI is also used to treat thyroid cancer that has come back after treatment. RAI is a radioactive substance. It is not harmful if it is taken by mouth. However, it can be harmful if it gets into the eyes. RAI can cause damage to the eyes and the glands that make tears. This damage can cause dry eyes and blurred vision.
Objective:
To see if artificial tears can prevent damage to the eyes and the glands that make tears in people who are treated with RAI for thyroid cancer.
Eligibility:
People ages 18 and older who are being treated with RAI for thyroid cancer.
Design:
Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.
Participants in the first group will receive artificial tears to be administered in the 4 days immediately following RAI therapy. The schedule of administration will be as follows: Day 1 (day of RAI therapy): Every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for at least 4 hours or until bedtime at night Day 2: Once every 1 hour for 12 hours Day 3: Four times (approximately morning, lunch, dinner, and evening) Day 4: Two times (morning and evening)
Participants in the second group will not administer artificial tears in the 4 days immediately following RAI therapy.

This study will test the hypothesis that atorvastatin, a drug that is commonly used to treat high cholesterol, can prevent melanoma from coming back after surgery. The study will also test the hypothesis that atorvastatin can prevent melanoma from spreading to other parts of the body.
The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part, the investigators will use a test called DecisionDx Melanoma to identify patients with high-risk melanoma who are most likely to benefit from atorvastatin. The DecisionDx Melanoma test is a blood test that measures the activity of 15 genes in melanoma cells. The test can predict the likelihood that a patient's melanoma will come back after surgery.
In the second part of the study, patients with high-risk melanoma who are most likely to benefit from atorvastatin will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Patients in the first group will receive atorvastatin by mouth once a day for up to 5 years. Patients in the second group will receive a placebo (a pill that looks like atorvastatin but has no active drug) by mouth once a day for up to 5 years. Both groups of patients will be followed for up to 5 years.
Patients will be followed with imaging scans (e.g., CT or MRI scans) and medical record reviews. The investigators will also collect blood samples from patients in the study."

Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of language abilities. The current treatment of PPA is limited to symptomatic management. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation technique that has been shown to improve language abilities in patients with stroke and other neurological disorders. The investigators hypothesize that TMS can improve language abilities in patients with PPA. The investigators will conduct a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study to test this hypothesis. The investigators will recruit 30 patients with PPA and randomly assign them to one of two groups: active TMS or sham TMS. Both groups will receive 12 sessions of TMS over 6 weeks. Each TMS session will be followed by language training. The investigators will assess language abilities before and after the TMS sessions. The investigators will also assess brain metabolism using positron emission tomography (PET) scans before and after the TMS sessions. The investigators will compare the changes in language abilities and brain metabolism between the two groups. The investigators will also assess the changes in daily-living activities and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The investigators will use the results of this study to develop a new treatment for PPA."

Post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) is a common condition that affects up to 40% of patients with mild COVID-19. Neurological symptoms, particularly cognitive deficits and fatigue, are common in PCS, with a higher prevalence in female patients. The underlying causes of PCS remain unclear, but some evidence suggests autoimmune mechanisms may play a role. Currently, there are no proven treatments for PCS, leading to a need for effective therapies. This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aims to investigate the impact of Methylprednisolone, a generally well-tolerated and affordable drug, on cognitive deficits in PCS patients with suspected autoimmune involvement. The objective is to demonstrate improvement in memory satisfaction as measured by the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ) in patients with post-COVID-19 syndrome treated with Methylprednisolone compared with placebo. Methylprednisolone is a well-known immunosuppressant used for multiple diseases of (suspected) autoimmune etiology. This clinical trial is of significant importance as it has the potential to benefit individuals with post-COVID-19 syndrome (PCS) by exploring the effects of Methylprednisolone on cognitive impairment and fatigue. Additionally, it may provide crucial insights into PCS's pathophysiological processes, leading to the development of more effective therapies and improved patient outcomes."

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that is markedly increasing in prevalence amongst older adults. Older adults with MS present with poor health status and functioning, cognitive and ambulatory difficulty, dependence for activities of daily living, and reduced physical activity participation. The common approach for managing MS involves disease-modifying drugs, yet this first-line approach for medical management has little efficacy in older MS age groups (i.e., those 50+ years of age). Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for maintaining and/or restoring physical and cognitive health in older adults from the general population and younger adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. The current study proposes a remotely-delivered exercise training program for improving cognition and mobility among older adults with MS. The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach (via telerehabilitation) with rigorous design for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based exercise intervention program in older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful aging with MS."

Hysterectomy is one of the most commonly performed gynecological operations. It is carried out because of a variety of indications, such as presence of dysfunctional uterine bleeding, myoma uteri, adenomyosis and adnexal mass. Hysterectomy can be performed using abdominal, vaginal, laparoscopic or robotic methods. According to the results from a study performed in the United States, the incidence rates for hysterectomies using abdominal, vaginal and laparoscopic methods are 66%, 22% and 12%, respectively. There is still no consensus on which of these approaches is the optimum surgical method for hysterectomy. Abdominal hysterectomy is the most frequently performed approach, but current clinical practice mandates that, when appropriate, the surgical method should be vaginal rather than abdominal, since the former is associated with better outcomes and lower complication rates. Moreover, when vaginal hysterectomy is not feasible or not indicated, the surgical method should be laparoscopic, because total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) provides a faster return to normal activity, shorter hospital stays, lower intraoperative bleeding and fewer wound infections, compared with abdominal hysterectomy. However, longer operating times and higher incidence of urinary system damage are seen in laparoscopic hysterectomies.

Cesarean section (CS) is the most commonly performed surgery on women and has increased significantly in the last 15 years. Various reasons account for the increase in CSs, including an increase upon maternal request, changes in maternal demographics (e.g., increasing maternal age), changes in physician practice patterns, more conservative practice guidelines, and mounting legal pressures. Because of the gradually increasing rates of cesarean sections (CSs) over the last two decades, the number of hysterectomized patients with previous CSs has increased. In a recent review article, previously performed CSs were demonstrated to be an important risk factor for lower urinary tract injuries, and the recommendation that abdominal hysterectomy might be preferable for these patients was emphasized. TLH may be technically difficult in patients with previous"

Asthma is a common chronic disease of the airways. It is characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyper-responsiveness and airway obstruction. The disease is heterogeneous and can be mild, moderate or severe. The current standard of care for asthma is based on the use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) and long-acting beta-agonists (LABA). However, there is a significant proportion of patients who remain symptomatic despite optimal treatment. In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that suggests that the microbiome plays an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. The investigators aim to study the role of the lung microbiome in asthma and its influence on treatment response. The investigators will recruit 100 patients with asthma and will collect samples of the lung microbiome, host immune response and host transcriptome. The investigators will also collect clinical data and will perform pulmonary function tests. The investigators will compare the microbiome signature of patients with mild, moderate and severe asthma.

Cricket is a popular sport in Pakistan. It is a team sport that requires a high level of physical fitness. The players need to be strong and have good endurance. Resistance training is a type of exercise that can help improve strength and endurance. It is also a good way to prevent injuries.
Resistance training can be done in different ways. One way is to do split-body resistance training. This means that you train different muscle groups on different days. For example, you might train your upper body on Monday and your lower body on Tuesday.
Another way to do resistance training is to do full-body resistance training. This means that you train all of your muscle groups on the same day.
Researchers want to compare the effects of split-body resistance training and full-body resistance training on strength and functional performance in cricket players.
The study will be a randomized controlled trial. This means that the researchers will randomly assign the participants to one of two groups. One group will do split-body resistance training and the other group will do full-body resistance training.
The participants will be asked to do 6 weeks of resistance training. After the 6 weeks, the researchers will measure the participants' strength and functional performance.
The researchers hope that the study will help to improve the way that resistance training is used in cricket."

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common disease in the world. It is characterized by inflammation of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, which can cause nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, facial pain, and loss of sense of smell. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is the most effective treatment for CRS. However, the recurrence rate of CRS is still high, and the recurrence rate of CRS after FESS is as high as 20%-30%. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new methods to prevent the recurrence of CRS.
The investigators have developed a bioabsorbable steroid-releasing stent (Novabel) for the treatment of CRS. The Novabel stent is made of a biodegradable material, which is safe and will be completely absorbed by the body over time. The stent is designed to release a steroid called mometasone furoate, which is commonly used to treat CRS. The stent is placed in the sinuses during surgery, and it releases the steroid over a period of time. The investigators believe that the stent will help to reduce the inflammation in the sinuses and prevent the recurrence of CRS.
The investigators will conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Novabel stent. The trial will be conducted at the Beijing Tongren Hospital. The investigators will enroll 100 patients with CRS who are scheduled to undergo FESS. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the Novabel stent or a standard stent. The investigators will evaluate the patients at 30 days, 90 days, 180 days, and 1 year after surgery. The investigators will also evaluate the patients' quality of life and sense of smell.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects 1 million people in the United States. Exercise is a key component of PD management, but many people with PD do not meet the recommended amount of exercise. The purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people with PD manage their physical activity and exercise participation with different levels of support from their communities and clinicians. We will evaluate exercise and physical activity every 3 months in a cohort of people with PD from two clinics in the Chicagoland area: Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest and University of Chicago Medical Center. During this study, we will evaluate differences in 12-month physical activity trajectories between groups enrolled during each of three conditions: (1A) standard care (condition 1, year 1), (1B) written exercise guidance (condition 2, year 2), and (1C) Consultative PT (condition 3, year 3). People with PD will be enrolled each year into an activity and exercise tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. The platform allows for synchronization of patients' activity data from their fitness tracker or smartwatch to the secure cloud-based platform. The platform can summarize steps per day, activity intensity, minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day based on target heart rate zones (including an ability for physical therapists to customize the target heart rate zone). At the 2 sites of care (Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital and University of Chicago), participants will be recruited based on contacting consecutive patients who meet the inclusion criteria based on scheduling and EMR screening prior to their visit with their neurologists. Contacting consecutive patients will ensure greater potential equity of enrolling participants rather than only patients engaged in support groups and exercise classes. However, after 3 months of recruitment, we will conduct a preliminary analysis of the numbers, recruitment rates, and characteristics (age, sex, race, ethnicity, disease duration, education) of the enrolling participants compared to the demographics of each clinic as a whole. We will then determine if we should use targeted recruitment strategies to increase sample size more rapidly. Consecutive patients meeting the eligibility criteria"

Perioperative stroke is a significant complication after surgery. Unfortunately, covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline. Further, perioperative overt stroke is associated with an 8-fold increase in perioperative mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay, and decreased quality of life. For shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position, due to systemic hypotension and reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral desaturation events and impaired cerebral autoregulation can occur in up to 80% of patients. Most perioperative stroke in non-cardiac surgery is ischemic and is related to brain hypoperfusion. Importantly, brain hypoperfusion is potentially modifiable with simple measures such as increasing systemic blood pressure (BP) if brain ischemia is identified early enough. However, deliberate hypertension is not devoid of risk and there is currently no effective monitor that can detect brain hypoperfusion during surgery. Cerebral oxygenation has been used clinically as a measure of adequate brain perfusion during surgery. An early clinical trial at Western found that monitoring cerebral oxygenation was associated with fewer cases of major organ dysfunction in cardiac surgery patients. Despite this promising initial finding, current commercial cerebral oximeters have a number of limitations that prevent reliable perioperative neuromonitoring, including non-specificity due to signal contamination from extracerebral tissue, especially during administration of vasoconstrictors or hypothermia. In addition, current commercial cerebral oximeters only have two channels to monitor the frontal lobe regions (i.e., anterior cerebral artery territory). This monitoring strategy assumes that cerebral oxygenation is homogenous across different brain regions so that measurements from the frontal lobe regions can be used clinically to represent the adequacy of global brain oxygenation. Such a limited spatial coverage may result in undetected stroke, despite the patients having apparently normal cerebral oxygenation in the frontal regions throughout surgery.

Functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is a common complication of heart failure (HF) with preserved ejection fraction (EF). Functional TR is associated with a poor clinical outcome and is a strong independent determinant of mortality in patients with HF. However, there have been no proven medical therapies for TR and only loop diuretics are cautiously recommended for relief of congestive symptoms in patients with severe TR and signs of RV failure. In patients with functional TR associated with systolic dysfunction, medical therapy for HF with a reduced EF may diminish functional TR by improving LV systolic function. Otherwise, the morbidity and mortality of patients with functional TR remain high and a novel therapeutic agent is needed to improve clinical outcomes of HF patients with functional TR and a preserved LVEF. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors induce urinary excretion of glucose and sodium by blocking the SGLT2 transporter in the proximal tubule (8). SGLT2 inhibitor-induced natriuresis lower cardiac preload and reduce pulmonary congestion and systemic edema. SGLT2 inhibitors also restore tubuloglomerular feedback and lower the intraglomerular pressure by vasoconstriction of the afferent arterioles and consequently reduce hyperfiltration-related renal damage. The beneficial effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on the heart and kidneys may halt the vicious cardiorenal cycle in patients with functional TR (9), which results in deterioration of renal function, hospitalization for heart failure, and cardiovascular mortality. Accordingly, the Enavogliflozin Outcome Trial in Functional Tricuspid Regurgitation (EVENT) will test the hypothesis that, compared with placebo, therapy with the SGLT2 inhibitor enavogliflozin for 18 months would improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients with functional TR and preserved LVEF."

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a condition that occurs in women of reproductive age and is characterized by physical and psychological symptoms that occur before menstruation. It is a condition that affects the quality of life of women and causes them to have difficulty in their daily lives. Emotional eating is defined as a person's use of food as an escape from negative emotions and can lead to many conditions such as obesity, eating disorders and hormonal problems. Health promotion means increasing one's control over one's health by improving one's own health. It enables the individual to improve their physical and social environment, change their behavior, and reach the best level of physical and mental health. The Philips 66 technique is a process based on active learning, problem and collaborative learning theory, student-centered, and uses the best learning techniques to improve students' performance and realize meaningful learning activity.
In this study, it is thought that the training given according to the health promotion model will both create a resource for nurses and contribute to the literature with the results obtained by applying this training to people experiencing PMS.
The research will be conducted as a pretest-posttest randomized controlled study. H1: Education given according to the health promotion model has an effect on premenstrual symptoms, emotional eating behavior and perceived stress. H0: Education given according to the health promotion model has no effect on premenstrual symptoms, emotional eating behavior and perceived stress.

Each year between 20 and 30 thousand individuals are newly incarcerated in Dutch prisons. Common mental disorders, such as depression and anxiety, are overrepresented in prison populations. As such, mental health problems are an important target for intervention, since they have been found to be associated with re-offending. The prison period may provide opportunities for addressing mental health problems, but there may be important obstacles and barriers to the actual delivery of interventions, such as a lack of mental health care specialists in prisons due to staff shortages. Within the PROSPER study, we will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing the brief, scalable Problem Management Plus (PM+) intervention in Dutch prisons. The PM+ intervention is designed to address common mental health problems, is delivered by trained non-specialists, and will be specifically adapted for the prison setting.
Objective: The primary objective of the PROSPER study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of PM+ adapted for individuals imprisoned in Dutch prisons.
Study design: This study entails a single-blind pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) (Study Phase 2) and a qualitative study to evaluate the process following the pilot RCT (Study Phase 3).
Study population: Study Phase 2 - Dutch-speaking adults (18 years or older; N=60) who at the time of inclusion are imprisoned in a Dutch prison and have a remaining sentence length of at least 15 weeks and who report an elevated level of psychological distress (K10 >15).
Study Phase 3 - Participants (N= 20) will be from different stakeholder groups: the RCT participants, PM+ helpers, PM+ supervisors/trainers, and professionals. If permitted by RCT participants, family members, and friends are also invited.

Depression is a common and disabling mental disorder. The majority of patients with depression respond to treatment, but a significant proportion of patients do not respond to treatment or respond only partially. These patients are referred to as treatment resistant depression (TRD). TRD is a heterogeneous group of patients with a variety of symptoms, comorbidities and life circumstances. The current study aims to investigate the efficacy of Schema Therapy (ST) for TRD. ST is a long-term psychotherapy that aims to change the underlying schemas (i.e. core beliefs) that are believed to be the cause of the patient's problems. ST is a relatively new treatment for TRD, and there is a need for more research on the efficacy of ST for TRD.
The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a 12-month follow-up. The study will include 120 patients with TRD. The patients will be randomized to either ST or Treatment as Usual (TAU). The primary outcome is change in depression symptoms on the Hamilton-6 Rating Scale for Depression. Secondary outcomes include change in depression symptoms on the Hamilton-6 Rating Scale for Depression, change in subjective functional impairment, change in psychological well-being, change in personal recovery, change in repetitive negative thinking, change in anger processing, change in health-related quality of life, change in early maladaptive schemas, change in schema modes, change in negative expectancies for change in depression symptoms, change in subjective functional impairment, change in personal recovery, change in repetitive negative thinking, change in anger processing, change in health-related quality of life, change in early maladaptive schemas, change in schema modes, change in negative expectancies for change in depression symptoms, response to treatment, remission from depression, and negative effects of treatment.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute respiratory failure that is associated with high mortality. The management of ARDS is based on mechanical ventilation, which is a major risk factor for the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia and other complications. The management of mechanical ventilation is complex and requires the use of a large number of parameters, which are often not well understood by nurses. The aim of this study is to evaluate the impact of a paramedical care protocol for mechanical ventilation on the mortality rate and the number of days without mechanical ventilation in patients with ARDS.
The study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III, stepped wedge cluster randomized design. This experimental design involves the sequential implementation of an intervention in the clusters included over several periods. The order in which the clusters received the intervention was determined by drawing lots; at the end of the study, all the clusters received the intervention at some point and were observed during a pre- and post-intervention control period (each cluster is its own control).
The study will be conducted in 100 intensive care units in France. The study will include 1,000 patients with ARDS. The study will be conducted in 2 phases: a pre-intervention phase (period 0) and an intervention phase (period 1). The intervention phase will be conducted in 2 periods: a first period (period 1) during which the intervention will be implemented in 50% of the clusters, and a second period (period 2) during which the intervention will be implemented in the remaining 50% of the clusters. The intervention will be a paramedical care protocol for mechanical ventilation. The protocol will be implemented by nurses in the intensive care unit. The protocol will be based on the recommendations of the international ARDS network. The protocol will be implemented in the intervention period and will be used in the control period. The primary endpoint will be a combination of mortality and the number of days without mechanical ventilation at D28. This composite criterion will be prioritised so that survival is given priority in the analysis over the shorter duration of mechanical ventilation."

Specific Learning Disorder (SLD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder in which the individual has difficulties in reading, written expression, and/or mathematics, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders - 5 (DSM-5). SLD; According to DSM-5, the academic difficulties experienced are explained in detail by dividing them into three subgroups. These are dyslexia, dyscalculia, and dysgraphia. The incidence of SLD is approximately 33% in girls and 67% in boys between the ages of 6-12. The ethology of SLD is multifactorial. It is associated with multiple genes and environmental risk factors. Structural imaging studies in children with SLD have revealed that grey matter is reduced. As a result of low grey matter, early literacy education seems to be negatively affected, and fine motor skills such as writing play an important role in this influence. Writing is a complex activity that includes perceptual, motor, and cognitive processes. Writing activities require a high level of fine motor coordination, postural control, adjustable grip strength, visual perception, and language skills. Considering the studies, it is stated that children who go to primary school spend 31%-60% of their academic days with tasks involving fine motor skills, and most of them do activities such as writing and painting. In addition to their academic and writing performances, children with SLD perform differently in daily life compared to their healthy peers. In general, they have difficulties during self-care activities such as tying shoes, clipping their nails, buttoning/zipping, shaving, and performing activities that require sequencing. At the same time, children with SLD have difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control. Difficulties in sensory processing, balance, and postural control affect proximal stability. When proximal stability is poor, distal movements cannot be performed in good quality. Therefore, adequate postural control and proximal stability are essential prerequisites for many activities of daily living. In the literature, it has been shown that grip strength and anthropometric characteristics of the upper extremity affect distal fine motor skills. In a study by Anakwe et al., it was shown that grip strength increased as the forearm circumference measurement value increased. In a"

The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the combination of the Z-track and Airlock techniques concerning reducing pain in adult patients treated with Haloperidol decanoate.
The primary outcome measure is pain reduction, assessed using a millimeter-scale visual analogic scale (VAS) to measure pain perceived by the patient 5 minutes after the treatment. The score is between 0 (minimum) and 10 (maximum) centimeters. The higher the score, the worse the result.
The secondary outcome measures are :
- the loss (leakage) of active product when the needle is withdrawn : The outcome measure is a reduction in the loss of active product by assessing the diameter (using a millimeter scale) of active product that flow back through the puncture site using an absorbent pad.
- the impact of combining the Z-track and Airlock techniques on potential complications related to treatment : The outcome measure is the reduction in signs of secondary complications, as measured by a pre- and post-injection clinical examination and a phone call to the patient between Day 1 and Day 3.
- participant satisfaction with the combination of Z-track and Airlock intramuscular injection techniques. The outcome measure is participant satisfaction, assessed using Attkisson's CSQ-8 questionnaire. This scale comprises 8 questions. Depending on the answer, each question awards 1 to 4 points. The score is therefore between 8 (minimum) and 32 (maximum) points. The higher the score, the better the result.
- therapeutic alliance during follow-up : The outcome measure is the overall therapeutic alliance score, using the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) scale before and after intervention. This scale comprises 12 questions. Each question awards 1 to 5 points, depending on the answer. The score is between 12 (minimum) and 60 (maximum) points. The higher the score, the better the result.

The current standard approach to the management of extremity STS is a combination of radiotherapy and limb preserving surgery. Currently guidelines recommend preoperative conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, which involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. Preoperative hypo-fractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) is an approach that can shorten the duration of treatment. Clinical outcomes with preoperative HFRT in STS have been reported from retrospective case series, prospective institutional registries and phase I-II trials. However, preoperative HFRT has not been compared in a prospective randomized trial to CFRT and due to the rarity of extremity soft tissue sarcoma, attempts to develop such a trial would face feasibility challenges. Therefore, single arm trials of preoperative HFRT will be critical to defining the feasibility, toxicity, efficacy, and potential improvement in access to care associated with this approach. Radiation therapy combined with wide local excision in the preoperative or postoperative setting optimizes local control for extremity STS. Preoperative radiotherapy with CFRT given at 1.8-2.0 Gy/fx, involves 5-6 weeks of daily treatments. The burden of daily travel and time away from work or care giving can be a barrier to utilization of radiotherapy. A recent analysis of the National Cancer Database demonstrated that farther distance to treatment was a negative predictor for receipt of radiotherapy in extremity STS. Sociodemographic factors such as female sex, older age (>70 years), Black race, and noncommercial insurance coverage were also negatively associated with treatment within such centers. To address disparities in access to radiation therapy, the American Society for Radiation Oncology Committee on Health Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion has proposed studying novel HFRT schedules. As validation of this strategy, Kalbasi et al. increased retention of extremity STS patients within a HV sarcoma center by 3-fold with the utilization of preoperative HFRT. Further, the decreased time and travel associated with HFRT, can address an established barrier to clinical trial participation, particularly for those living remote from clinical trial sites.

Endometriosis is a common disease in women of reproductive age, with a prevalence of 6 to 10%. It is characterized by the presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity, which can cause pain, infertility and other symptoms. The diagnosis of endometriosis is based on the clinical history, the physical examination and the imaging. The imaging is used to confirm the diagnosis and to evaluate the extent of the disease. The gold standard for the diagnosis of endometriosis is laparoscopy. However, this procedure is invasive and requires general anesthesia. Therefore, it is not always possible to perform it in all patients.
The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive imaging technique that does not require the use of ionizing radiation. It is used to evaluate the extent of the disease and to guide the treatment. However, the MRI is not always able to detect all the lesions of endometriosis.
The dynamic MRI is a new imaging technique that allows to evaluate the mobility of the pelvic organs. It is based on the acquisition of images during the movement of the organs. This technique could be used to detect the lesions of endometriosis that are not visible on conventional MRI.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the usefulness of the dynamic MRI in the diagnosis of endometriosis. The investigators will compare the results of the dynamic MRI with the results of the conventional MRI and the laparoscopy."

Tang poems are not only for language learning but also induce people's positive emotions. Traditionally, some Chinese parents teach the very young kids to recite Tang poems even before the kids know how to read and write. Reciting Tang poems resembles singing a song without understanding the verses, and some kids can do so better than adults. Tang poems sound musical and should be easier to remember and recite than other texts. Learning and reciting poems at home could be happy and fun family activities in Chinese families. Whether using fun activities on small groups of kids in a community setting to promote Tang poem reciting and happiness could have the same effects of Tang poem reciting in Chinese kids is unknown for non-Chinese. This is a pilot pre-post interventional trial with no controls, with 10-20 South Asian children in primary schools (Grades 1-2, age 6-9) being recruited. In most primary schools, grades 1-2 students have not started learning Tang poems. Students and their parents will be actively approached by Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS). An information sheet will be provided to the parents of eligible children, and their contact information will be asked. Parents give written consent if they agree for their children to participate. Parents will be invited to join the intervention sessions to show support for students' participation but they will only sit at the back of the room without active interaction and learning requirements. The intervention comprises three 1.5-hour sessions of Tang poem reciting and one session for participant performances. Experienced instructors from Bestreben Drama Association Limited will lead each session, and adherence to the protocol will be assessed by independent reviewers. Participants will recite two poems per session, with adjustments based on performance. Body language, sound, images, and videos will be used, along with engaging games, to enhance motivation and memory. Participants will receive stamp/sticker collection books and be rewarded for their achievements. Parents are invited to attend the sessions to show support, their role will be passive, sitting at the back of the room without active interaction or learning requirements. A final session will include a 15-minute assessment of poem recitation skills, followed by a performance session where participants can recite any Tang poem. Family members are encouraged to participate, and awards will be granted to motivate"

Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth. Digital tools, especially personal smartphones, are promising avenues to address these issues and can be used to provide a unique understanding of risk factors, including psychological distress, anhedonia and behavioral withdrawal, and sleep disturbance among high-risk individuals. This project aims to enhance the effectiveness of the delivery of preventative health care to youth at risk for suicide by developing a comprehensive digital platform that allows practitioners to integrate mobile sensing data and HIPAA-compliant client communication tools into their management of these young people. Specifically, we will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT) based at the intensive outpatient services (Intensive Adolescent and Family DBT Program (Columbia Doctors)) to test the impact of using the Vira platform for patients versus treatment as usual control (TAU; i.e., not using Vira). This project will include adolescent patients (n = 200) aged 13-18-years-old randomized to: (a) Vira group (n = 100) and (b) treatment as usual control group (n = 100). Participants will include current patients receiving treatment in the intensive outpatient program, and all treatment decisions will be overseen by practitioners within the program.

The study is carried out by the Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, in collaboration with an ADHD Center run by the publicly-funded Habilitation & Health, Stockholm Health Care Services, Region Stockholm, Sweden.
The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with parallel groups, where eligible individuals are block randomized on each clinical site to one of two groups (ratio 1:1): Treatment (IPSA directly) or Control (continued routine services; offered IPSA approximately six months later). Each block includes 18 participants. Randomization is done using a digital randomization tool. Allocation (treatment or control) is masked to participants and study staff administering the screening/inclusion/assessment procedures until after the baseline assessment (including pre-intervention questionnaires) has been completed.
The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee of Stockholm, Sweden (dnr. 2017/2435-31/5, 2019-06362, and 2023-03871-02).

The study is primarily concerned with the efficacy of IPSA, secondarily with the feasibility of the program. In addition, the investigators will explore the potentially moderating or mediating effects of baseline variables and levels of active participation on efficacy outcomes.
Efficacy: The effect of IPSA is examined using self- and parental report scales administered before (pre; T1) and immediately after (post; T2) IPSA, as well as approximately 1.5-3 months after program completion, in connection with an IPSA booster session (follow-up; T3). Specifically, the investigators examine whether participation in IPSA is associated with positive treatment outcomes with respect to the study's primary outcome (parental self-efficacy) and secondary outcomes (parental stress, levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child). In addition, parents' time management and organizational skills are followed from pre to post IPSA.

Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) is a chronic, inflammatory, neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS). The disease is characterized by progressive disability, which is caused by the accumulation of irreversible damage to the CNS. There are currently no approved therapies for PPMS. The investigators believe that Remote Ischemic Conditioning (RIC) is ideally suited to be tested as a therapy for progression in MS. RIC is a simple, non-invasive, and inexpensive procedure that involves intermittent cycles of limb ischemia and reperfusion. RIC is safe and well-tolerated, and it has been shown to be effective in reducing ischemic injury in the heart, brain, and other organs. The investigators will test whether RIC can prevent disability worsening in people with PPMS. The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate non-futility of RIC for reducing progression of disability, as measured with the timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), in people with PPMS. This is a phase II open-label, single-center, single-arm futility trial. The study will follow the Simon-2-stage MiniMax design for futility studies. The study will enroll 20 participants with PPMS. The study will last 12 months. Participants will perform RIC daily for 12 months. The primary endpoint in this study will be the worsening of disability, defined as an increase by 20% or more in the timed 25-foot walk (average of two trials) at 12 months follow-up compared to baseline. If the primary endpoint is not met, the study will be terminated. If the primary endpoint is met, the study will continue for an additional 12 months."

Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe form of alcohol-induced liver injury, with a mortality rate of 20-50% within 6 months from diagnosis. The current standard of care for severe AH is corticosteroid therapy (CS), but the response to CS is highly variable, ranging from 10-80%. The Lille score is a simple and reliable tool to predict the response to CS therapy in patients with severe AH. However, the Lille score is not available in all centers and it is not always possible to perform it within the first 72 hours from diagnosis. Therefore, there is a need for a simple and reliable tool to predict the response to CS therapy in patients with severe AH.
The prothrombin time (PT) is a simple and inexpensive test that can be performed in all centers. The PT is a measure of the extrinsic coagulation pathway and it is used to monitor the response to vitamin K antagonists (VKA). The PT is also a measure of the liver synthetic function and it is prolonged in patients with liver disease.
The aim of this study is to evaluate whether the PT at diagnosis can predict the response to CS therapy in patients with severe AH.
The study is a prospective, observational study. Patients admitted with a clinical diagnosis of severe AH eligible to CS treatment will be enrolled. The PT at diagnosis will be registered to evaluate wether it correlated with Lille score at day 7 and therefore response to standard medical treatment."

Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disability in childhood. It is a non-progressive disorder of movement and posture, occurring in early childhood. The prevalence of CP is 2-3 per 1000 live births. The gross motor function (GMFCS) of children with CP is the most important factor that affects their participation in daily activities. The GMFCS is a 5-level functional classification system that is used to classify the gross motor function of children with CP. The GMFCS is a reliable and valid tool for classifying the gross motor function of children with CP. The GMFCS is used to identify the level of gross motor function and to plan appropriate interventions. The GMFCS is also used to monitor the progress of children with CP. The GMFCS is divided into 5 levels: Level I: Sit to stand, crawl, and walk with assistance. Level II: Walks without assistance, may need a hand-held mobility device. Level III: Walks without assistance, may need a walker or crutches. Level IV: Walks without assistance, but has difficulty with stairs and uneven surfaces. Level V: Self-mobility with a wheelchair.

Tetralogy of Fallot (ToF) is the most common cyanotic congenital heart disease (CHD). The primary goal of ToF surgery is to relieve the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT) obstruction and to achieve complete anatomical correction. However, the postoperative outcomes of ToF surgery are still suboptimal. The postoperative complications include reoperation, mortality, and prolonged hospital length of stay (HLOS). The postoperative complications are also associated with the preoperative risk factors. The preoperative risk factors include the age, weight, and associated cardiac anomalies. The preoperative risk factors also include the preoperative hematological parameters. The preoperative hematological parameters include the complete blood count (CBC) with differential count. The CBC with differential count can be used to calculate the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio (NLR), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and thrombocyte lymphocyte ratio (TLR). The NLR, ALC, and TLR have been used to predict the outcomes of various cardiac surgeries. However, the predictive value of the NLR, ALC, and TLR in predicting the outcomes of ToF primary repair has not been studied yet. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the predictive value of the NLR, ALC, and TLR in predicting the outcomes of ToF primary repair. This was a retrospective observational study on ToF primary repair in National Cardiovascular Center Harapan Kita between Januari 2020 until December 2022. The preoperative demographic data included were patients' gender, age, weight, oxygen saturation, and associated diagnosis other than ToF. The preoperative data of complete blood count and differential count must be tested from the most recent peripheral blood samples taken no later than 14 days before the surgery. The data obtained were the number of days of the most recent blood test including the leukocyte count, percentage neutrophil, percentage and absolute lymphocyte count, thrombocyte count, as well as the derived variables such as NLR ratio and TLR.

The aim of the study is to develop and test a smartphone addiction intervention for breastfeeding mothers. The intervention will be based on the SMaRT Mom program that we have developed. The SMaRT Mom intervention results will be measured in changes in two main outcomes: 1) reduced maternal reports of their infants' negative emotionality, and 2) increased maternal self-efficacy as distal outcomes as well as two proximal outcomes: 1) breastfeeding as a rewarding experience, and 2) maternal attention towards their infant during breastfeeding. We will then assess changes in breastfeeding mothers' neural activity, physiology and behavior before and after the implementation of the SMaRT Mom intervention, as potential mechanisms underlying changes in the main outcomes of the intervention.
The study will be conducted in two phases:
Phase 1: The first phase will be a preliminary study to assess the feasibility of the SMaRT Mom intervention. The sample will consist of 10 breastfeeding mothers with smartphone addiction. The SMaRT Mom intervention will be administered for one week during which mothers will be instructed not to use their smartphone during breastfeeding. Before and after the intervention week, two lab sessions will be take place in which mothers in both intervention and control groups will be asked to take a screen shot of their smart digital use of the past week, and will be connected to the electrophysiological monitoring systems to assess their biobehavioral responses during: baseline, the smartphone cue-reactivity task, breastfeeding and face-to-face interaction while using or not using the smartphone. Following the first lab visit, mothers will be instructed to follow the intervention program. The participants will be asked to complete three daily reports of any distractions while breastfeeding. During the intervention week, two remote sessions (20 minutes each) will be performed by a research assistance to support the implementation of the intervention plan.

Plantar Fasciitis (PF) is a common cause of heel pain in the military population. It is a common cause of disability and is the most common cause of heel pain. The condition is characterized by pain in the heel and/or bottom of the foot, which is typically worse in the morning and after periods of rest. The pain is caused by inflammation of the plantar fascia, a thick band of tissue that runs from the heel to the ball of the foot. The condition is often caused by repetitive stress on the foot, such as running or walking. Treatment options for PF include rest, stretching, and anti-inflammatory medications. However, these treatments are often not effective in relieving pain. Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a new treatment option that is being studied for the treatment of PF. LLLT is a type of light therapy that uses low-power lasers to stimulate healing. The treatment is thought to work by increasing blood flow to the area being treated and by reducing inflammation. A recent study found that LLLT was effective in relieving pain in people with PF. The study also found that the treatment was safe and well-tolerated. The study was small, and more research is needed to confirm the findings. LLLT is a promising treatment option for PF. It is a safe and effective treatment that can be used to relieve pain and improve function."

Pregnant women in need for maternal and/or fetal monitoring are hospitalized at the obstetric high care (OHC) of Máxima Medical Center (MMC). They are monitored for up to three times a day with conventional cardiotocography (CTG). In the meantime they reside at the OHC, but the status of the fetus and uterine activity (UA) is not monitored. Nemo Healthcare developed a wireless abdominal electrode patch for measuring fetal heart rate (FHR) and UA: The Nemo Fetal Monitoring System (NFMS). Previous research on non-invasive electrophysiological CTG (eCTG) has yielded promising results in monitoring FHR and UA both during pregnancy and labor. With the use of eCTG technology, safe continuous 24/7 monitoring is possible, which is not possible with conventional cardiotocography. The investigators hypothesize that by introducing continuous antepartum eCTG monitoring perinatal and maternal outcomes will improve. The investigators aim to include 1911 pregnant women ≥18 years old with a singleton pregnancy between 23+0 and 32+0 weeks of gestation requiring hospitalization to the OHC for maternal or fetal surveillance (including 1400 historical controls). Additional objectives: The collected NFMS and demographic data will be used to develop and verify a mathematical model for the prediction of time until (preterm) birth, which may be used in clinical practice to reduce unnecessary OHC admissions and facilitate a better timing of interventions. Furthermore, data collected in this study (NFMS, accelerometric, annotated ultrasound) will be used for the development and verification of a mathematical model for the automated detection of fetal movements in NFMS data. This latter model might provide new opportunities in non-invasive monitoring of fetal health."

Urinary incontinence (UI) is involuntary urinary leakage. This condition causes physical, psycho-social, and economic problems.1 It is more prevalent in women than in men. It occurs in women during pregnancy, childbirth, or menopause. It can also be triggered by factors such as advanced age, diabetes mellitus, chronic urinary infections, hysterectomy, and obesity.2,3 While urinary incontinence is not a life-threatening condition, it significantly impacts the quality of life for women. It leads to social phobia, social isolation, reduced self-confidence and self-esteem, embarrassment, psychological issues, as well as individual and societal costs.2-4 Urinary incontinence represents a growing burden in numerous countries.5 (Milsom et al., 2014). Urinary incontinence constitutes a significant public health issue when considering the global female population, their participation in the workforce, and their role in social life.6 Urinary incontinence afflicts more than 40% of women worldwide.7 (Liu et al., 2014). The prevalence of UI is 48.3%, 46.4%, 31.9%, and 18.7% in women over 18 years of age living in Germany, Denmark, China, and Norway, respectively.8-10 The prevalence of UI is 23.6% in women aged 45-60 years living in Brazil.11 The prevalence of UI ranges from 16.4% and 49.7 in Turkish women.12 The projected number of women with UI in the United States is expected to reach 28.4 million by 2050.13 Investigators believe that the prevalence of UI may be underestimated because many women either seek healthcare assistance late or not at all due to fears of stigmatization and a lack of information about treatment. Furthermore, only a small fraction of women who are diagnosed with UI receive effective treatment.2,3,14 More than half of women with UI (66.4%) take approximately three years to seek medical assistance due to fears of stigmatization and a lack of information about treatment.4,15 The treatment"

The knee is the most commonly affected joint, and it is estimated that 10% of the population over 60 years of age has symptomatic OA of the knee. The main symptoms of OA are pain, stiffness, and functional limitation. The treatment of OA is based on the use of analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs, physical therapy, and intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid. However, these treatments are not always effective, and there is a need for new and more effective therapies.
The use of cellular orthobiological products (COBPs) has been proposed as a potential treatment for OA. COBPs are derived from the patient's own tissues and have the potential to promote tissue regeneration and repair. Two of the most commonly used COBPs are bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) and minimally manipulated adipose tissue (MM-AT). BMAC is obtained from the patient's bone marrow, and MM-AT is obtained from the patient's fat tissue. Both BMAC and MM-AT contain a population of cells called mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs), which have the potential to differentiate into various cell types, including cartilage cells.
The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of BMAC and MM-AT in the treatment of knee OA. The study will be a randomized controlled trial, in which patients with symptomatic knee OA will be treated with either BMAC or MM-AT. The primary outcome measure will be pain, as measured by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain subscale. Secondary outcome measures will include functional limitation, as measured by the WOMAC functional limitation subscale, and radiographic and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) parameters.
The study will be conducted at the Hospital of the University of Navarra, and patients will be recruited from the outpatient clinic. Patients will be randomized to receive either BMAC or MM-AT, and will undergo a single intra-art"

Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that is characterized by difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep, or waking up too early. Insomnia can be acute (lasting less than 3 months) or chronic (lasting 3 months or more). Insomnia can be primary (not associated with any other medical condition) or secondary (associated with another medical condition). Insomnia can be further classified as transient (lasting less than 1 week), short-term (lasting 1-3 weeks), or long-term (lasting 3 months or more). Insomnia can be caused by a variety of factors, including stress, anxiety, depression, and certain medications. Insomnia can also be caused by underlying medical conditions, such as chronic pain, heart disease, lung disease, and gastrointestinal disorders. Insomnia can lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and decreased productivity. It can also increase the risk of accidents and injuries. Treatment for insomnia includes lifestyle changes, such as improving sleep hygiene, and medications, such as benzodiazepines and non-benzodiazepines. Cannabidiol (CBD) is a compound found in the cannabis plant that has been shown to have a variety of therapeutic effects, including reducing anxiety and improving sleep. CBD is non-psychoactive, meaning it does not produce the ""high"" associated with marijuana. CBD is available in a variety of forms, including oils, capsules, and vape pens. CBD has been shown to be effective in reducing anxiety and improving sleep in people with insomnia. A recent study found that CBD was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms in people with chronic pain. The study found that CBD was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early morning awakenings. CBD was also effective in reducing pain and improving sleep quality. Another study found that CBD was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms in people with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study found that CBD was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and early morning awakenings. CBD was also effective in reducing anxiety and improving sleep quality. A third study found that CBD was effective in reducing insomnia symptoms in people with chronic pain.

Retinal detachment (RD) is a common retinal disorder that can lead to permanent vision loss. It occurs when the retina, the light-sensitive tissue lining the back of the eye, detaches from its underlying support tissue. RD is often caused by a tear in the retina, which allows fluid to seep under the retina and separate it from the underlying tissue.
RD can be treated with surgery to reattach the retina to the underlying tissue. The most common surgical procedure for RD is called vitrectomy, which involves removing the vitreous gel from the center of the eye and replacing it with a gas bubble. The gas bubble helps to push the retina back against the underlying tissue.
In some cases, a scleral buckle may be used in addition to vitrectomy. A scleral buckle is a small, silicone band that is placed around the outside of the eye to help hold the retina in place.
The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of vitrectomy alone versus vitrectomy with a scleral buckle in the treatment of RD. The study will also compare the effectiveness of two different gases used to fill the eye after surgery.
The study will be conducted at the University of Toronto. Patients with RD will be screened with a medical history and eye examination. If they are eligible for the study, they will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:
Group 1: Vitrectomy alone
Group 2: Vitrectomy with a scleral buckle
All patients will receive vitrectomy surgery. In addition, patients in Group 2 will receive a scleral buckle.
The study will compare the effectiveness of the two treatments in terms of the rate of RD recurrence and the rate of complications.
The study will also compare the effectiveness of two different gases used to fill the eye after surgery: sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and perfluoropropane (C3F8).
The study will be conducted over a period of 3 years."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the differential effects of 0.25%, 0.5%, and 1% ropivacaine on the onset time and duration of ultrasound-guided ankle blocks in patients having forefoot surgery for anesthesia and postoperative analgesia. We hypothesize that the use of 1% ropivacaine for ultrasound guided ankle blocks will result in a significantly faster onset time and a longer sensory block duration, and thus analgesia, compared to the use of 0.25% and 0.5% ropivacaine in patients having forefoot surgery. The primary outcome is the difference in the duration of the sensory blocks. The secondary outcomes are the difference in onset time of the sensory block, the postoperative pain scores, and the opioid consumption.
This is a randomized, triple-blinded, parallel-group interventional study. The study will be conducted in the ZOL Genk, Belgium. The study will include 120 patients aged 18 to 65 years, scheduled for elective forefoot surgery for hallux valgus repair under unilateral ankle block at ZOL Genk. The patients will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups: 0.25%, 0.5%, or 1% ropivacaine. The patients will receive a total of 15 mL of the assigned ropivacaine solution. The solution will be administered and distributed strategically among the specific nerves: 6 ml for the tibial nerve, 3 ml for the deep peroneal nerve, and 2 ml each for the superficial peroneal nerve, saphenous nerve, and sural nerve. The sensory and motor block will be assessed by the patient at home at postoperative day 0 to 2. The duration of the sensory block will be measured by the time from the start of the block to the time when the patient can feel the sensation of light touch, cold, and pinprick on the dorsum of the foot. The onset time of the sensory block will be measured by the time from the start of the block to the time when the patient can no longer feel the sensation of light touch, cold, and pinprick on"

Lumbosacral spine surgeries are commonly performed under general anesthesia. Perioperative pain following spine surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pre-emptive caudal epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in lumbosacral surgeries and to compare the effect of adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine with respect to quality of analgesia, duration of analgesia, hemodynamic effects and associated side effects. Patients will be allocated in one of the two groups, I and II, consisting of 30 each, using a lottery based random number.

The administration of intravenous anesthetics in the elderly population requires adequate titration to avoid deleterious effects derived from overdosing or underdosing. Older patients show greater sensitivity to similar doses of propofol compared to younger patients. In addition, there is extensive interindividual variability among older patients, which would also explain the different responses to the same dose of drugs. This variability would be secondary to differences in comorbidities and physiological age, in contrast to chronological age, which would not explain the differences found in response to anesthetics in these patients. One way in which an attempt has been made to make the doses of anesthetics in different patients comparable is the use of models that predict what infusion rate is required to maintain a given concentration at the site of drug action. The relationship between a propofol effect site concentration (Ce) with a given effect can be represented by pharmacodynamic (PD) models. Recently, Eleveld et al. created a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for the administration of intravenous propofol in a population of wide ages, including neonates to older patients. However, the pharmacodynamic parameter used in this model was the BIS index, which has been questioned for its use in older adults. In addition, the creation of this PKPD model only included 3 patients older than 70 years, so the underrepresentation of this age group in the construction of the model could affect its performance, making it even more difficult to correctly predict the effect in this population. Anesthetic drugs exert their desired hypnotic effect on the brain. Brain electrical activity can be monitored non-invasively by recording electrical potential on the cranial surface using electrodes. The electroencephalographic (EEG) changes observed with the administration of anesthetics are usually systematic across different patients. Within the EEG patterns described for anesthetic maintenance with propofol, the alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations stand out. However, the power of alpha oscillations decreases with age and with other changes that are associated with age, such as decreased cognitive ability, increased comorbidities and brain vulnerability. Therefore, guiding our administration of propofol"

Acute cholangitis is an infection of the biliary tract which is managed with biliary drainage and antibiotic therapy (ABT). Currently the international Tokyo Guidelines 2018 (TG18) recommend 4 to 7 days of ABT after source control. The national SWAB guideline of 2020 suggests a course of one to 3 days after biliary drainage. There are no randomized studies to guide the duration of ABT for acute cholangitis. Our recent retrospective study in the Netherlands showed that a short course of ABT seems safe and more evidence is available showing that other bacterial infections, including abdominal and bloodstream infections, can be treated with a short antibiotic course than previously assumed. Hence, the hypothesis is that a very short-course of ABT for acute cholangitis is non-inferior to a course of 4 to 7 days after adequate biliary drainage. This study is designed as a multicenter non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (one day of ABT after ERCP) or the comparator group (4 to 7 days of ABT after ERCP)."

Obesity is a major public health problem. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for morbid obesity. However, it is associated with several complications, including postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs). PPCs are the most common complications after bariatric surgery, with an incidence of 20-30%. PPCs are associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and hospital costs. The incidence of PPCs is higher in morbidly obese patients. The most common PPCs are atelectasis, pneumonia, and respiratory failure. Atelectasis is the most common PPC, occurring in up to 50% of patients. Atelectasis is caused by the compression of the lung by the enlarged liver, which leads to the collapse of the lung. The incidence of atelectasis is higher in morbidly obese patients. The treatment of atelectasis is the re-expansion of the lung by the application of a lung recruitment maneuver (LRM). The LRM is a mechanical maneuver that is used to re-expand the lung by increasing the pressure in the airway. The LRM is usually performed by manual inflation of the lung with a pressure of 40 cmH2O for 4-6 seconds. However, the LRM can be associated with adverse effects, such as hypotension, bradycardia, and oxygen desaturation. The use of ultrasound to guide the LRM has been proposed as a safer alternative. Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess the lung. It can be used to detect areas of atelectasis and to guide the LRM. The investigators hypothesize that the use of ultrasound to guide the LRM will reduce the incidence of adverse effects associated with the LRM. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the use of ultrasound to guide the LRM with the conventional method of manual inflation. The investigators will recruit 60 morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The patients will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the ultrasound group and the conventional group.

Heel spur (HS) is a common cause of heel pain. The prevalence of HS is estimated to be 10% in the general population. The most common treatment for HS is conservative, including rest, analgesics, orthopedic insoles, and physical therapy. However, these treatments are often ineffective. Radiation therapy is an effective treatment for HS, but the standard treatment regimen is 6 Gy in 4 fractions of 1.5 Gy twice weekly. This study aims to determine whether a single fraction of radiation therapy is non-inferior to fractionated radiation therapy in terms of pain relief for HSS patients. The study will be conducted at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Masaryk Memorial Cancer Institute (MMCI), Brno, Czech Republic. Patients with HSS will be randomized into six groups based on the total dose of radiation therapy. Patients in these groups will receive a total dose of 6 Gy in 4 fractions of 1.5 Gy twice weekly (arm A), a total dose of 3 Gy in 2 fractions of 1.5 Gy twice weekly (arm B), a single fraction of 0.5 Gy (arm C), a single fraction of 1.0 Gy (arm D), a single fraction of 1.5 Gy (arm E), and a single fraction of 2 Gy (arm F), respectively. The regimen in arm A (6 Gy in 4 fractions) is commonly used in MMCI and considered as the standard arm. In the event of inadequate pain relief, reirradiation will be performed with a total dose of 6 Gy in 4 fractions of 1.5 Gy twice weekly after a waiting period of three months in any of the aforementioned groups. The primary goal of this research is to determine whether one-day irradiation (a single fraction) is non-inferior to fractionated radiation therapy over a three-month period in terms of pain relief for HSS patients. The secondary goal is to compare the need for reirradiation between fractionated vs. single fraction radiotherapy and between different single fraction radiotherapy prescription.

Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a complex disorder which is difficult to treat. Exercise therapy is an evidence-based treatment for CLBP both general exercises and cognition-targeted exercise therapy have shown beneficial effects on pain in patients with CLBP. Unfortunately, current treatments for CLBP apply a 'one-size-fits-all' approach and do not address comorbidities like obesity. This knowledge gap is now acknowledged internationally: overweight and obesity are increasingly recognized as a plausible therapeutic target for people with CLBP.
The primary objective is to examine if a behavioral weight reduction program combined with Pain Neuroscience Education (PNE) and Cognition-Targeted Exercise Therapy (CTET) is superior to reduce pain at 12 months follow-up compared PNE and CTET alone, in overweight or obese people with CLBP. Secondary objectives are to examine the effects of adding a behavioral weight reduction program combined with PNE and CTET, compared to PNE and CTET alone, on 1) other pain related outcomes (pain interference, pain distribution and pain beliefs), 2) on anthropometrics (body weight/composition, muscle thickness and fat distribution), 3) on energy balance related behavior (24h continuous activity monitoring, dietary intake and sleep) and finally 4) on health economics (heath care utilization, productivity loss and quality of life) at 12 months follow-up.
Intervention: Both interventions (experimental and control) are organized equally: all participants will receive 18 treatment sessions over a 14-week period. The first part will consist of chronic-pain-focused interventions: firstly, 3 sessions of PNE in the first 2 weeks & secondly, 15 sessions of CTET in the remaining 12 weeks. The second part will consist of a more weight-reduction-focused intervention.

Gastroparesis is a chronic disease of the stomach that causes delayed gastric emptying without stenosis. It is a chronic alteration of gastric motility that leads to a delay in stomach emptying. It is an underdiagnosed condition. The prevalence is estimated at around 3% in the United States (mean age of 37.7 years, with an F: M ratio of 4:1. It is mainly an idiopathic condition; however, it can also be caused by diabetes mellitus and post-surgical conditions, such as fundoplication, vagotomy, bariatric surgery, and esophagectomy. Less frequently by conditions like post-infectious gastro-paresis, neurological or autoimmune diseases. The clinical symptoms of gastroparesis include nausea, vomiting, early satiety, post-prandial fullness, bloating, belching, and upper abdominal discomfort. The gastroparesis cardinal symptoms index (GCSI) is a reliable, reproducible, and valid instrument for measuring symptom severity in patients with gastroparesis. It is based on three sub-scales (post-prandial fullness/early satiety-4 items; nausea/vomiting-3 items; bloating-2 items), and each item ranges from 0 (none) to 5 (severe). GCSI is not a diagnostic tool, but it is helpful to measure the severity of the disease and the post-treatment improvement. Though the prevalence of gastroparesis has significantly increased over the last decade, management is still challenging. Patients with mild symptoms can be referred for dietary modifications coupled with medical therapy with prokinetics, especially metoclopramide. However, the response to prokinetics decreases over time. Surgical approaches have been proposed; however, the invasive nature of those procedures and the low rate of clinical success have made them less favorable.

Anesthesia is a state of controlled unconsciousness, analgesia, and muscle relaxation induced by anesthetic agents. During general anesthesia, the brain is deprived of oxygen and nutrients, which can lead to brain injury. To prevent brain injury, anesthesiologists monitor the brain's blood flow and oxygen consumption during surgery. However, current monitoring techniques are limited by their invasiveness and lack of sensitivity. In this study, the investigators will use a new non-invasive technology to monitor the brain's blood flow and oxygen consumption during surgery. The investigators will also investigate how anesthetic agents and vasopressors affect the brain's blood flow and oxygen consumption.
The investigators will recruit 80 adult patients who are scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia. The investigators will randomize these patients into one of the four groups in 1:1:1:1 ratio for one of two choices of anesthetic maintenance agents and vasopressors.

Cognitive dysfunction is a core pathophysiological feature of psychosis and one of the strongest predictors of functional outcomes. Several studies indicate that current early intervention programs may not significantly alter long-term clinical outcome, suggesting that critical treatment target(s), beyond symptoms and functional status, are not being addressed. Evidence strongly indicates that, along with cognitive dysfunction, impaired motivation is also a critical target and unmet therapeutic need. The application of effective treatment to improve cognition in early phases of psychosis has a very high likelihood of significantly improving long-term community functioning. The investigators have demonstrated both behavioral gains and improved neural system functioning after neuroscience-informed cognitive training in schizophrenia, in both chronic and early phases of the illness. In young recent-onset individuals (average age of 21 years), the investigators' multi-site double-blind randomized controlled trial showed that 40 hours/ 10 weeks of cognitive training delivered at home over a laptop resulted in significant gains in global cognition, verbal memory, and problem solving compared to a computer games control condition. Cognitive gains were significantly correlated with enhanced thalamic volume and thalamo-cortical connectivity, as well as increased white matter integrity. A meta-analysis of 11 RCTs in early schizophrenia has also indicated the benefit of cognitive remediation approaches. Impaired motivation is also a core feature and very strong predictor of functional outcome in early stages of psychosis. Some studies have shown positive effects in improving motivation immediately after the intervention, but treatments that induce enduring improvements in motivated behavior are scarce. Disturbances in motivated behavior reflect a range of factors, including diminished anticipatory pleasure, difficulty learning from rewarding outcomes, reduction in effort expended to obtain rewarding outcomes, and impairment and disconnection between components of social motivation. This makes it difficult to determine optimal therapeutic approaches. However, some headway is starting to appear in the literature. For instance, social cognition impairments appear to play a specific contributing role to dysfunctions in motivated behavior, and are amenable to intervention. The investigators have found that ratings of motivated behavior improve after social cognition training, and are significantly greater in subjects who performed cognitive training combined with social cognition training, than in those who completed only cognitive training. The investigators have also"

Prehabilitation is a relatively new and evolving concept in patient care. Prehabilitation utilises prescribed exercise in the time prior to surgery with the aim of improving a patient's functional capacity enabling them to better withstand the stress of surgery. 1-3 This is required due to the physiological insult cause by surgery, particularly in those with cancer, which in turn results in a decline in patients' function. Post-operative restorative rehabilitation programmes such as Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) are commonplace and used with the aim of returning the patients' function towards their preoperative baseline. ERAS has been shown to improve post-operative outcomes, including length of stay, re-admission, and complication rates.4 Prehabilitation has been shown to both improve cardiovascular fitness prior to surgery and like ERAS reduce post-operative complications.7,8 However, despite this and unlike ERAS, it's use is still patchy, with no national protocols in existence.

Physical activity is a core component seen across all reported prehabilitation programmes. However, heterogeneity is seen across multimodal programmes, meaning the type of exercise, duration and supervision of physical activity is inconsistently administered between studies. Additional interventions such as dietary support, psychological wellbeing and smoking cessation are also variably addressed in some studies.
Accurate, reliable, and reproducible assessment of cardiopulmonary fitness is required to effectively prescribe and monitor patients as they progress through a prehabilitation programme. Currently, cardiopulmonary fitness assessment requires patients to attend for in person assessment to undergo Maximal or Submaximal exercise testing.

Pilonidal disease (PD) is a common disease of the natal cleft. The prevalence is estimated at 23 per 100.000 persons. The disease is characterized by the formation of sinus tracts and abscesses in the natal cleft. The disease is often recurrent and can cause a significant impairment of quality of life. The current standard treatment is surgery. The most common surgical procedure is the open and closed excision of the sinus tracts. This procedure is associated with a high recurrence rate and a long recovery time. Therefore, new minimally invasive techniques have been developed. The most promising technique is pit-picking surgery. This technique is performed under local anaesthesia and is associated with a short recovery time. However, the recurrence rate is still high. Therefore, a new technique has been developed, called Sinus Laser assisted Closure (SiLaC). This technique is performed under local anaesthesia and is associated with a short recovery time. The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of pit-picking surgery with SiLaC. The primary outcome is the success rate of treatment, defined as wound healing outcomes at 1 year. Secondary outcomes are pain scores, patient reported outcome measures, wound healing and complications, work rehabilitation, return to daily activities, recurrence rate, need for secondary or revision surgery, patient satisfaction and quality of life."

Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use of a substance despite its harmful consequences. People with SUD have an intense focus on using a certain substance(s) such as alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs, to the point where the person's ability to function in day-to-day life becomes impaired. People keep using the substance even when they know it is causing or will cause problems. Drug use brings with it the likelihood of several negative health consequences. These can include a wide range of physical and mental health disorders, foremost of which are dependence, HIV infection, hepatitis-related liver diseases, overdose and premature death. The problem of substance use is becoming one of the most serious and rapidly growing phenomena all over the world. It accounts for substantial global morbidity, mortality, and financial and social burden. Implementation of scientific evidence-based drug prevention interventions remains low overall. In Egypt, SUD is a serious public health threat. Recent studies have demonstrated increases in the prevalence of the use of tobacco, illegal drugs, and over-the-counter drugs, particularly among youth. Drug treatment registers are often used as a proxy indicator of treatment demand. This information is useful for analysis of service utilization and can be used as an indicator of trends in prevalence and patterns of high-risk drug consumption. Assiut University Hospital is the biggest hospital in Upper Egypt, and it provides health services for Assiut city and most of the neighboring governorates. Addiction management unit of Assiut University Hospital contains 16 beds, based on paid service and about 400 patients have been admitted per year. SUD is a dynamic process that changes constantly over time with new trends of drug dependence emerge every now and then, thus timely information about trends in psychoactive substance use could yield tailored interventions and reduce potential harms. Identifying personal, social, and demographic characteristics of patients with this disorder at the local, regional, and national levels helps physicians, health authorities, and policy-makers detect early emerging trends and enable them better plan and implement prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs. This study aims to identify sociodemographic, personal characteristics, as well as patterns of illicit drug abuse in patients admitted for addiction treatment."

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most intractable primary malignancies in the hepatobiliary and pancreatic tract with a poor overall survival worldwide. Surgery in the form of hepatectomy or liver transplantation provides the best chance of cure for early-stage disease. Unfortunately, the vast majority of HCC patients suffer from advanced unresectable or metastatic disease at diagnosis. Currently targeted therapy alone, or in combination with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antagonist, is the standard first-line treatment for metastatic HCC. On the other hand, there is growing evidence suggesting that radiation therapy (external or internal) with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors can produce or even augment abscopal effect in which the tumours away from the radiation field also show significant tumour shrinkage. The underlying mechanism of eliciting abscopal effect includes the increased antigen presentation by the myeloid cells within the tumour stroma leading to enhanced tumour cell killing. Previous case reports showed that radiation therapy alone can induce abscopal effect in mice and human models. However, a robust and concrete evidence of abscopal effect with combinational immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation or external radiation therapy in hepatocellular carcinoma is still lacking. This phase 2 single-arm study will investigate the efficacy and safety of combination of immune checkpoint inhibitors and radioembolisation for previously untreated metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma."

The extremity artery is the peripheral blood vessel of the whole body, and it is often involved early in the diseases that are easy to damage the small vessels, such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases. Early lower limb atherosclerosis mainly occurs in the dorsal foot artery, which is commonly seen in people with diabetes and long-term smoking. Connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus also mainly involve small blood vessels, and vascular lesions may appear earlier than those of other specific organs such as heart and lung. Because of its shallow location, the extremity artery can be better used as a screening site for vascular diseases, and it is the window for early reaction of vascular diseases.
However, the early stage of extremity artery disease is easy to be ignored, and patients often have pain and numbness of the affected limb. When the disease is severe, it can lead to ulcer not healing, and even limb gangrene and amputation, which greatly affects the quality of life and brings huge troubles and economic pressure to the patients. Therefore, early diagnosis of extremity arterial lesions is of great significance for early diagnosis of microvascular injury diseases such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases, reducing the incidence of complications, and reducing the rate of amputation and mortality.
Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in clinic. In recent years, with the development of ultrasound technology, the frequency of ultrasonic probes has been increasing. Because of its higher resolution, high-frequency ultrasound can clearly display the superficial vascular structure and blood flow, detect vascular lesions early, and accurately quantify the degree of stenosis, providing a new and beneficial tool for clinical observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities.
The purpose of this multi-center clinical study was to establish the normal value of high frequency ultrasound for the structure and blood flow of the extremities of Chinese Han adults, and to explore its influencing factors, so as to provide a quantitative reference for the early diagnosis, degree evaluation and curative effect observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities."

The purpose of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of STERIFY GEL in promoting healing of periodontal pockets following SRP, compared with treatment with SRP alone. With specific visco-elastic and mucoadhesive properties, STERIFY GEL easily penetrates into the deepest and hard-to-reach areas of periodontal and peri-implant pockets, adhering to the gingival tissue and alveolar bone, providing complete coverage of the pockets. The effect of STERIFY GEL is promoted by a physical mechanism of action. After SRP, the gel is applied into the gingival pocket, where it acts primarily as a filler to restore volume, physically preventing bacteria from entering and reinfecting the pocket. STERIFY GEL can thus mechanically protect treated pockets and bone defects, promoting tissue healing. The occluding action at the level of periodontal and peri-implant gingival pockets, in synergy with the accessory action of hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, prevents bacterial recolonization and promotes subsequent tissue regeneration.
Although SRP surgery is considered a gold standard treatment for periodontitis, it may in some cases be insufficient to decontaminate the pocket allowing bacteria to recolonize the tissues promoting new inflammation that can worsen the clinical picture.
STERIFY GEL may find useful application in cases of moderate to severe chronic periodontal disease as an adjunctive treatment following SRP to improve and accelerate healing parameters and prevent recurrent inflammation and infection.
In addition, antimicrobial control action prevents antibiotic use and the risk associated with antibiotic resistance.
Such control of periodontal disease also allows for the maintenance of patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment (e.g., patients on bisphosphonate therapy, defected etc.)."

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder that can be considered a prototype disorder in which a stressogenic event leads to hippocampal malfunction and mal-encoding of a traumatic memory. Persistent hippocampal dysfunction contributes to the unremitting nature of PTSD years after the acute event. The upshot is not only amnesia, but also difficulty in memory integration in the context of time and location, and the feeling that the traumatic event is present all the time and everywhere. Improved hippocampal function may contribute to better access to memories of a traumatic event and to memory contextualization and neutralization. Memory processing is essential for PTSD recovery. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) includes the inhalation of 100% oxygen at pressures exceeding one atmosphere absolute. HBOT has been applied worldwide, mostly for chronic non-healing wounds. Our team demonstrated that HBOT induced hippocampal neuroplasticity in veterans with long-standing treatment-resistant PTSD; this led to enhanced memory recovery and significant improvement in PTSD symptoms. The investigators also demonstrated effects of HBOT on memory recovery among women with fibromyalgia due to childhood sexual abuse. Both physical activity, such as aerobic exercise, and cognitive training were shown to support neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Therefore, the current study aims to evaluate whether hippocampal training, induced by physical and cognitive training, will augment the hippocampal neuroplasticity effect of HBOT and further enhance recovery of inaccessible memories in veterans with PTSD. The protocol will include forty male veterans aged 25 to 60 years, with combat-associated PTSD and peritraumatic amnesia, who will receive either HBOT alone or HBOT and hippocampal training. The HBOT protocol will consist of 60 daily sessions, 90-minutes each, five days a week. Hippocampal training will combine physical and cognitive training 3 times per week, prior to HBOT sessions. Detailed psychological evaluation, anatomic and functional MRI, electroencephalogram and autonomic nervous system data will be obtained at baseline, and during and after treatment. The proposed"

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology. The disease can involve any organ, but the heart is the most common extrapulmonary site. The diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis is based on clinical suspicion and supported by characteristic findings on cardiac imaging. The most commonly used imaging modality is 18F-FDG PET/CT, but it has shown limitations in the evaluation of cardiac sarcoidosis due to the high physiological uptake of FDG in normal cardiac muscle. Elaborate preparations are required for patients including either a low-carbohydrate diet followed by long fasting or heparin loading before FDG-PET. In heparin loading, the rare adverse effect of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia should be considered. Therefore, it is of interest to find a PET/CT tracer that displays high sensitivity and specificity without requiring thorough patient preparation and minimizing any adverse effects. A potential tracer is the somatostatin-based tracer 64Cu-DOTATATE, which is routinely used for the diagnosis and monitoring of treatment response in patients with neuroendocrine tumors. Inflammatory cells, including macrophages that are found in sarcoid granulomas, express somatostatin receptors on their surface, whereas normal cardiomyocytes do not. This allows for the potential use of macrophage imaging in cardiac sarcoidosis. In the CuDOSIS trial, groups A and B (suspected and confirmed cardiac sarcoidosis, respectively) will be scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT in addition to the routinely performed 18F-FDG PET/CT. Further, to examine whether the macrophage infiltration pattern is different in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis and other inflammatory heart diseases, a group of patients with confirmed or clinically suspected myocarditis will be included (group C); this group will only be scanned with 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT. Finally, data from a group of patients with neuroendocrine tumours (negative controls) who have previously been scanned with 64Cu-"

Renal transplantation is the preferred treatment for patients with end-stage renal disease. However, immunosuppressive drugs are necessary to prevent rejection of the transplanted kidney. Immunosuppressive drugs are associated with a variety of side effects, including diarrhea. Diarrhea is a common problem in renal transplant recipients, with an incidence of 30-60%. Diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. It is also associated with poor quality of life, increased risk of infection, and decreased adherence to immunosuppressive medications. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host. Probiotics have been shown to improve gastrointestinal function and reduce the incidence of diarrhea in renal transplant recipients. The investigators propose a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center pilot/exploratory trial to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in reducing the incidence of immunosuppressive drugs-associated diarrhea in renal transplant recipients. The investigators hypothesize that probiotics will reduce the incidence of diarrhea in renal transplant recipients. The investigators will also explore the relationship between inflammation and the gut microbiome in renal transplant recipients. The investigators will recruit 60 renal transplant recipients with diarrhea. Participants will be randomized to receive either probiotics or placebo for six months. The investigators will collect stool samples and blood samples at baseline, three months, and six months. The investigators will also collect data on diarrhea frequency and severity. The investigators will use statistical methods to analyze the data. The investigators will also use statistical methods to explore the relationship between inflammation and the gut microbiome.

Peri-implantitis is a common complication of dental implants, with a high prevalence among the population. The diagnosis of the disease is based on traditional clinical indices, similar to assessment of periodontal disease. However, recent studies question the diagnostic accuracy of clinical indices as such, supporting that the diagnosis of the disease is far more complex. In addition, novel diagnostic methods have been utilized in order to achieve an early and proper diagnosis of the disease.

The UP is based on the third-wave of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) and is designed to target the common underlying mechanisms of anxiety and depression. The UP has been adapted for children and adolescents and has shown promising results in a small number of studies. However, there is a need for more research on the UP in this population. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, treatment facilitators and treatment effects of the UP in a clinical open trial in primary care. The study is conducted at 2 primary care clinics with patients and parents seeking for routine care. The study is a within group design where one clinical manualised intervention, the UP-C/A, is offered in a 11 session group format to children and adolescents. Parent training is at the same time also offered in a group format. Therapists are trained in the method and receive regular supervision adhering to the evidence-based manual. The group treatment and parent training is delivered face-to face. Feasibility, acceptability and effect of the intervention will be studied, with child self-report, parent-report and therapist assessment. The study will also include a qualitative interview study with the therapists to explore their experiences of the treatment. The study will provide important information on the feasibility and acceptability of the UP in a clinical setting and on the treatment facilitators and effects of the UP in children and adolescents. The study will also provide important information on the experiences of the therapists delivering the UP."

The aim of this study is to assess the pain and stress level of preterm infants during less-invasive-surfactant-administration (LISA) using skin conductance measurement and the Neonatal Pain and Sedation Scale (N-PASS).
LISA is a non-invasive method of administering surfactant to preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It is performed via a small tube placed in the nose or mouth of the infant. The tube is connected to a machine that delivers the surfactant into the lungs.
The investigators hypothesize that the pain and stress level of preterm infants during LISA is higher than the pain and stress level at baseline.
The investigators will measure the pain and stress level of preterm infants during LISA using skin conductance measurement and the N-PASS. The investigators will also record a video of the LISA procedure.
The investigators will compare the pain and stress level of preterm infants during LISA with the pain and stress level at baseline. The investigators will also compare the pain and stress level of preterm infants during LISA with the pain and stress level during other painful procedures."

The study seeks primarily to determine less tibial tunnel widening when a bone/PrP-composite is applied directly in the tibial tunnel compared to the same surgery without using the composite, measured with CT and MRI. Secondary study objectives are to evaluate femoral tunnel widening, tibial and femoral graft incorporation, graft maturation and knee function (clinical, functional, patient reported) over the course of 24 months follow-up and to evaluate occurrence of procedure- and product-related adverse events and complications.
This is a prospective, single-center, single-blinded, 2-arm-parallel, randomized, controlled study with 24 months follow-up. Participants will be recruited from the Knee Surgery department at Schulthess Klinik when scheduled for ACL reconstruction. The study sample comprises 107 patients, allocated 1:1 on experimental and control arm. Outcome measures are taken at 0, 6, 12, and 24 months. The total study duration is 48 months. The study duration per patient is 24 months.
The study is designed to compare the efficacy of augmented ACL integration via PrP enriched collected autologous bone vs standard ACL technique. The study hypothesis is that the augmented ACL integration via PrP enriched collected autologous bone will reduce the frequency of tunnel widening and therefore improve graft-bone-integration."

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is a standard technique for induction of general anaesthesia in children. It is a combination of rapid intravenous induction agent (ketamine, propofol) and neuromuscular blocker (rocuronium, suxamethonium). The main goal of RSI is to secure the airway and to prevent aspiration of gastric contents. The most important part of RSI is preoxygenation, which is done by face-mask or bag-mask ventilation. The preoxygenation is done to increase the oxygen reserve in the lungs and to prevent hypoxia during the induction of anaesthesia. The most common method of preoxygenation is face-mask ventilation. The high flow nasal cannula (HFNC) is a new method of preoxygenation, which is used in adults and children. The HFNC is a heated and humidified high flow oxygen (HFNO) delivered through a nasal cannula. The HFNO is able to provide high flows of heated and humidified oxygen, which can be used for preoxygenation and oxygenation.

This study utilizes the Near-Infrared Functional Imaging System (fNIRS) as a biological marker for psychotherapy. The investigators propose the following scientific hypothesis: In patients with depression, levels of oxygenated hemoglobin and deoxygenated hemoglobin in different brain regions may fluctuate at different stages of the disease progression and treatment, along with changes in the activation levels of different brain regions. Neuroimaging studies on the neurobiological mechanisms of depression suggest a reduction in gray matter volume in emotion processing areas such as the limbic system, hippocampus, anterior cingulate cortex, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia. Previous neuroimaging studies have found that successful cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) accompanied changes in gray matter volume in the brain, as observed through fMRI. Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), which is a component of the third wave of CBT, is expected to exhibit more significant expression in cognitive task-based fNIRS during IPT treatment for depression. In this project, the investigators will implement medication therapy, psychotherapy, and a combination of medication therapy with psychotherapy, specifically utilizing IPT, in patients with depression. Simultaneously, the investigators will conduct comprehensive fNIRS assessments on all patients to evaluate changes in their brain function and determine the level of effectiveness of psychotherapy. The investigators will also employ standardized psychological assessments to evaluate patients, allowing for a comparison of the effectiveness of fNIRS assessments and providing clarity on the efficacy of psychotherapy. Additionally, the investigators will collect blood samples, cranial magnetic resonance images, and electroencephalograms from patients before and after treatment, which will contribute to further exploration of treatment mechanisms in the future."

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a common mental disorder with a high prevalence rate and a high disability rate. Although there are many effective treatments for GAD, there are still many patients who are difficult to treat or have poor treatment outcomes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new treatment methods for GAD. Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a new non-invasive treatment method that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression and anxiety. However, there is still a lack of research on the efficacy and mechanism of tVNS in the treatment of GAD. This study will use a double-blind, randomized controlled design to investigate the efficacy and mechanism of tVNS in the treatment of GAD. A total of 60 patients with GAD will be recruited and randomly divided into two groups: the medication-combined tVNS group and the medication-combined sham stimulation group. Both groups will receive antidepressant and anxiolytic medication for 4 weeks. The tVNS group will receive active tVNS stimulation, and the sham stimulation group will receive sham stimulation. The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD) will be used to assess the severity of anxiety and depression symptoms before and after treatment. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and event-related potentials (ERP) will be used to assess brain function before and after treatment. The incidence of adverse events in each group will be recorded and used to evaluate the safety of the intervention. The results of this study will provide a new reference for the clinical treatment of GAD."

Lacrimal drainage obstruction can manifest as epiphora or recurrent infections with mucopurulent discharge and may even cause social embarrassment. Obstruction can occur at any level along the lacrimal drainage system: punctum, canaliculus, nasolacrimal duct, or nasal ostium. It is seen more often in females, especially in postmenopausal women. The etiopathogenesis of lacrimal passage obstruction appears to be multifactorial. Chronic inflammation has been suggested to be the most causal. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a standard surgical procedure used to treat nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO), with a reported success rate of more than 90%. Knowledge concerning the morphological characteristics of lacrimal passage obstruction using traditional diagnostic methods (e.g., lacrimal irrigation, probing, dacryocystography) is limited. Dacryoendoscopy was originally described in 1979 and has recently matured for use in lacrimal drainage system imaging. It has been proved to be a useful instrument not only for understanding differences in the etiology of obstructions but also for treating LD obstructions. On the other hand, semiconductor diode laser can achieve more effective tissue dissection than direct probing technique with minimal hemorrhage and improved intraoperative view. Hence, dacryoendoscopic-assisted laser dacryoplasty with silicone intubation (DLDI) offers direct therapy to the obstructed site, leading to minimal collateral damage external to the target zone. In addition, this procedure can be performed under local anesthesia as an outpatient procedure in the office, and it has advantages such as short surgery time and less risk of bleeding during surgery, resulting in its increasingly widespread use in China. Although the silicone intubation using dacryoendoscopy has increased the success rates, the success rates vary from a low of 51% to a high of 90%. The difference in success rates seems to depend on the site of obstruction, differences in the surgical technique, stringency of definitions of success, and duration of follow-up.

Stroke is a type of stroke that occurs when a blood vessel in the neck or brain becomes blocked. Blockage can be due to thrombosis, embolism and narrowing of artery (stenosis).Hemorrhagic stroke is because of bleeding into the brain through the rupture of a blood vessel. Hemorrhagic stroke can be in addition subdivided into intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The concord symptom is abrupt numbness or weakness in the face, arms, or legs, especially on one side of the body. Sudden disorientation or difficulty speaking or understanding language. sudden loss of vision in one or both eyes; sudden difficulty walking, lightheadedness, or loss of balance or coordination; sudden severe headache of unknown cause.
The most common risk factor for stroke is hypertension.Upper motor neuron lesion due to stroke outcomes in a constellation of sensorimotor impairments which includes muscle weakness, impaired selective motor control, spasticity, and proprioceptive deficits that intervene with normal gait.Gait is one of the most important aspects of a stroke rehabilitation program. Patients with stroke are characterized by decreased ankle dorsiflexion during the swing, which leads to a decrease in gait ability. Hemiparetic gait is a combination of deviations and compensatory movement dictated by way of residual functions.

Mental health problems are common among young people and many youth in need of treatment for mental health problems do not meet criteria for any mental health disorder or they meet criteria for several disorders. Most existing treatments focus on a subset of mental disorders and do not address subthreshold or multi-disorder mental health problems. Furthermore, available treatments are limited in efficacy and most youth in need do not receive treatment due to social stigma and structural barriers such as geographical distance to treatment providers. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of a digital emotion regulation treatment in adolescents with mental health problems. Participants will be randomized to a digital emotion regulation treatment or to an active comparator. Treatments in both conditions will include therapist support, and will be delivered in a blended treatment format combining asynchronous therapist-guided online modules with one synchronous session delivered over video-link. The primary endpoint is at post- treatment. Primary objectives: To test the effects of POET on mental health problems. To test the effects of POET on emotion regulation. Secondary objectives: To test if emotion regulation mediates reductions in mental health problems during treatment. To test if POET is cost-effective. To test if POET works better for some individuals than others. To test if there are detectable differences in distal outcomes between POET and active control 12 to 60 months post treatment and if individual baseline characteristics moderate these effects. Research questions: What are the effects of POET on mental health problems? What are the effects of POET on emotion regulation? Are reductions in mental health problems during the POET treatment mediated through emotion regulation? Is POET feeling cost-effective? Does POET work better for some individuals than others? Are there detectable differences in distal outcomes between POET and active control 12 to 60 months post treatment and if individual baseline characteristics moderate these effects?"

Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence as well as morbidity rates are high in older patients. Surgery is the standard of care. About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk clinico-pathologic features that can increase risk of local recurrence (LR). Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence. Despite the lack of high level evidence, ART is indicated in patients according to unfavorable prognostic factors. ART benefit is generally questioned in regard to the potential degradation of the patient's quality of life (QoL). Currently there is no prospective trial or recommendations that take into account geriatric patients' evaluation and profiles during the management of NMSC. In addition, there is no data that could help to define the subgroup of elderly patients who will benefit from ART in tumors with unfavorable prognostic factors. In terms of ART, multiple fractionation schedules are available, ranging from standard fractionation (45-60Gy in 5-6 weeks) to the extreme hypofractionation (HF) delivering 16-18Gy in one fraction. In routine practice, HF is mainly preferred in elderly patients for more convenience by reducing the number of transports and increase health related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is no data on the fragility profiles of these patients, nor validating any HF schedule in terms of efficacy, acute toxicity, cosmetic results, and impact on HRQoL.
The proposed study will include R0-high risk of CBC and CEC of the skin in elderly patients. There is no risk regarding the design of the trial as the last will respond to two important unknown questions regarding the utility of RT and its fractionation in this population. Moreover, it is an excellent opportunity to collect prospectively geriatric evaluation and HRQoL data that are lacking in the literature for skin cancers.
No constraints are seen neither in the design, nor in the potential recruitments.

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death in the United States (US), with 149,500 new CRC cases, and 52,980 deaths expected in 2021. Surveillance colonoscopy is recommended for adults age 75 and older (older adults) who have had a polypectomy (removal of precancerous polyps) in the past. However, the incremental benefit of surveillance after polypectomy on reducing CRC risk is uncertain. For adults age 75 and older (older adults) considering surveillance colonoscopy, these issues are of particular importance. Harms associated with colonoscopy increase dramatically with age, with 3.8% to 6.8% of older adults experiencing an emergency visit or hospitalization within 30 days of colonoscopy. Older adults also are less likely to live long enough to benefit from interventions such as surveillance colonoscopy, due to competing, non-CRC mortality risks. The well-established age-related increasing risks for competing causes of mortality and colonoscopy-related harms stand in sharp contrast to major evidence gaps: it is unclear whether CRC risk is clinically significant among older adults with prior polypectomy, and whether exposing older adults to surveillance reduces CRC risk. Yet, the default clinical paradigm is for many older adults to receive surveillance colonoscopy. In the VA, surveillance is a very common indication for colonoscopy among older Veterans, with an estimated >17,400 exposed to surveillance annually. The mismatch between available evidence and current clinical practice, coupled with extreme constraints on colonoscopy resources in the VA, make the surveillance colonoscopy paradigm an ideal focus area for quantifying risks and benefits to optimize health outcomes. The Overarching Aim is to advance knowledge on CRC risks among older adults with prior polypectomy and potential benefits of surveillance colonoscopy, with the goal of informing policies and clinical strategies that optimize benefits, risks, and resource utilization. The Specific Aims are to: Aim 1. Compare cumulative CRC risk after age 75 in a cohort of older adults with history of normal colonoscopy (n=101,328) vs. colonoscopy with polypectomy ("

Paclitaxel is a taxane used in the treatment of breast cancer. It is a microtubule stabilizing agent that is used in the adjuvant and neoadjuvant setting. Paclitaxel is a well-known drug that is associated with peripheral neuropathy. The incidence of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is 60% in patients receiving paclitaxel 80 mg/m2. Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is a dose-limiting toxicity that can lead to discontinuation of therapy. The pathophysiology of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is not well understood. It is thought that paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy is due to the accumulation of paclitaxel in the dorsal root ganglion. The investigators hypothesize that the use of losartan will prevent the development of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. Losartan is an angiotensin receptor antagonist that is used in the treatment of hypertension. It is also used in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy. The investigators hypothesize that the use of losartan will prevent the development of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to test this hypothesis. Patients will be randomized to receive either losartan or placebo. The primary outcome will be the development of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy. Secondary outcomes will include the grade of neuropathy and the quality of life.

Aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare hematopoietic stem cell disorder characterized by pancytopenia and bone marrow hypocellularity. The incidence of AA is 1-2/million per year. The incidence of AA increases with age, and the median age of patients with AA is 50-60 years. The treatment of AA is divided into two stages: induction and consolidation. The induction therapy is the first-line treatment for patients with severe AA (SAA). The first-line induction therapy is ciclosporin A (CsA) + anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin (ATG) + thrombopoietin receptor agonists (TPO-RA). However, the adverse effects such as hepatotoxicity and gastric disorder limit its application in elderly SAA.
Compared with TPO-RA, AVA has no hepatotoxicity and less other adverse effects, but there was few studies for AA. Our previous study demonstrated that AVA was effective in 55% of refractory AA. Since the action mechanism of AVA and TPO-RA is not exactly the same, and the metabolic level of the elderly is not the same as that of younger patients, it is unknown whether there are predictive factors of efficacy in the treatment of AVA.
Thus, we wondered whether CsA+AVA could achieve an efficacy similar to CsA+ATG+AVA in the Elderly."

The massive scale-up of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLIN) has led to a major reduction in malaria burden in many sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. This progress is threatened by the wide scale selection of insecticide resistant malaria vectors.
The study will be conducted in the department of Tiebissou (Gbeke Region in Lac district) Southern Bouake city, central Côte d'Ivoire. The Lac district is characterized by intense indoor malaria transmission with a prevalence of malaria reaching 51.3% in 2021 in children of under 5 years of age and extremely high pyrethroid resistance intensity in the main malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii.
The study will be conducted in 33 villages (1 village = 1 cluster) with an average of 200 households. Nets will be distributed at a central point following national guidelines with 1 net for every 2 people. To compare incidence of malaria cases between each intervention study arm and the control arm, a cohort of 50 children (45 + 5 to account for loss to follow up) will be recruited per cluster in 33 clusters for 12 months follow up to be able to detect a 35% relative reduction in malaria cases per child per year (rate ratio 0.65) between the intervention and the reference arms, assuming transmission in the control arm is 1.2 malaria cases per year with a coefficient of variation of 0.29 between clusters. The children will be visited twice a month during the transmission season (April to November) and once a month during the dry season. Malaria infection prevalence cross-sectional surveys will be conducted, at baseline, 6 and 12 months after LLIN distribution. 50 people of all ages will be randomly selected from each of the 33 clusters (11 clusters per arm x 3 arms) and tested for malaria using RDT. The study will have 80% power to detect a relative 35% lower prevalence (prevalence ratio 0.65 in each intervention arm (VEERALLIN or Interceptor G2) relative to standard LLIN, assuming a prevalence of 50%"

Prostate cancer is the commonest male cancer and sadly more than 10,000 men die each year from the disease in the UK. This is actually a greater number than women who die from breast cancer each year in the UK. If diagnosed at an early stage, the chances of being cured of the disease are high through either surgery (prostatectomy) to remove the prostate or through radiation treatment (radiotherapy). Both treatment options are associated with quality of life changing impacts on sexual, bowel and bladder function, with survivors having to manage these side effects for the rest of their lives. It is a key area of research to try and identify who may be at particular risk and to minimize these risks. The development of increasingly sophisticated radiotherapy machines (linear accelerators) which can deliver radiotherapy more precisely has allowed the radiotherapy for prostate cancer to be transformed over the last decade. The number of treatments required for cure has been reduced from 39 over nearly 8 weeks, to 20 over 4 weeks, and more recently to only 5 over 1-2 weeks, greatly improving patient convenience through less travel, days off work, or time in hospital away from loved ones. Importantly technology has reduced but not removed the risk of both initial and then longer term permanent side effects. In this study the investigators want to reduce the number of treatments down to only 3, given on consecutive days, further enhancing the patient experience and providing evidence that this number of treatments could become the new standard of care. In this study the investigators will be using the very latest state of the art radiotherapy machines and the unique RayPilot system, adopted for routine use by a small number of global radiotherapy centres when delivering prostate SBRT. The ability to track the position of the prostate cancer throughout the radiotherapy treatment using RayPilot allows the treatment to be given more precisely with less dose being given to the surrounding bladder and rectum. It also ensures that all the intended dose is given to the cancer as the treatment can be interrupted should the cancer move due to rectal gas, changes in bladder filling or simply the patient moving position on the treatment bed, maximizing the chances of cure and minimizing the risk of life changing side effects. This is a single arm 2 stage Phase II study that will test the safety of the 3 fraction radiotherapy schedule. It has built in safety"

Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a common complication of pregnancy, occurring in 2-3% of pregnancies. PPROM is associated with preterm birth, which is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for cervical evaluation in PPROM is a sterile speculum exam. However, the use of a speculum is uncomfortable for patients and can be traumatic to the cervix. Digital exams are a less invasive alternative to speculum exams. The investigators hypothesize that digital exams are non-inferior to speculum exams in the evaluation of the cervix in PPROM. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the two methods of cervical evaluation. The investigators will enroll 100 patients with PPROM who require cervical evaluation. Patients will be randomized to receive either a digital exam or a speculum exam. The primary outcome is pregnancy latency, defined as the time from admission to delivery. Secondary outcomes include maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, maternal satisfaction with the exam, and maternal and neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) admissions. The investigators will also compare the two methods of cervical evaluation in terms of cost and resource utilization.

The incidence of liver cancer ranks sixth in the world, and the mortality ranks fourth in the world. In China, liver cancer deaths account for the second largest cause of all cancer deaths. Surgical resection of liver cancer is still the main treatment, but the five-year survival rate is only 50%-70%. Liver transplantation can remove tumours and the underlying liver disease at the same time, and has become an important means for the radical treatment of liver cancer. However, the original intention of liver transplantation was to treat unresectable liver cancer, but due to the high recurrence rate and metastasis rate of postoperative tumors, many centers list liver cancer as a contraindication to liver transplantation. Therefore, it is urgent to formulate liver transplantation criteria that meet China's national conditions. In 2006, the Shanghai Fudan criteria was proposed based on the clinical data of liver transplant patients in China, which further expanded the scope of indications for liver transplantation of liver cancer, and did not reduce the overall survival rate and tumor-free survival rate of patients after surgery, and was also verified in the Western population. Since then, Kyoto standards, Hangzhou standards, Up-To Seven standards, and Toronto standards have been proposed around the world. These criteria have been relaxed to varying degrees in the size and number of tumors. At present, except for the Milan criteria and UCSF criteria, other standards have not been uniformly recognized. However, it is difficult for patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma to enroll in the above transplant criteria, and many patients lose the opportunity to obtain liver transplantation, so the biggest problem faced by patients with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma is the shortage of donor liver. Also, cirrhosis with hepatocellular carcinoma is often considered a contraindication to liver transplantation, making it more difficult to obtain a donor liver. Therefore, expanding the donor liver pool is urgently needed for the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC. In 2015, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment 2-3 transplantation with delayed total hepatectomy (RAPID)"

Mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection are among the most frequently performed surgeries today, and pain control is an important problem affecting patient comfort in the postoperative period in these patients. Postoperative pain is an acute pain associated with the inflammatory process that occurs due to surgical trauma and gradually decreases with tissue healing. Several analgesic drugs such as opioids are used to prevent this pain, but these agents have many unwanted side effects. Successful postoperative analgesia occurs in the patient due to pain; it is a known fact that it prevents many of the effects such as not being able to breathe easily and delayed mobilization. Regional techniques can be used for postoperative pain control following breast surgery. Ultrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSPIPB) is a new interfacial plane block defined by Tulgar et al in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain. The SPS muscle is located at the C7-T2 level. It attaches to the lateral edges of the second and fifth ribs. It is innervated by the lower cervical and upper intercostal nerves. With the SPS block, these nerves are blocked and analgesia is provided. In the cadaveric study of Tulgar et al., it was determined that the spread of serratus posterior superior interfacial plane block; 7-10 intercostal levels on the left side only in the superficial fascia of the trapezius muscle. Spread dye was observed at intercostal levels, absent on the right. There was prominent staining on both sides of the deep trapezius muscle. Both the surface and skin of the rhomboid major were clearly stained, while the rhomboid minor was only stained in the skin. SPSP block will provide successful analgesia in procedures involving the thoracic region such as chronic myofascial pain, breast surgery, thoracic surgery, and shoulder surgery.

Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common problem in women, with an estimated prevalence of 15-25%. SUI is defined as involuntary leakage of urine on effort or exertion, or on sneezing or coughing. SUI is a significant problem for women, as it can lead to embarrassment, social isolation, and decreased quality of life. The most common treatment for SUI is pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), which involves strengthening the muscles that support the bladder. PFMT is effective in treating SUI, but it can be difficult for women to perform the exercises correctly and consistently. The investigators have developed a new device, the Pelex Upp, which is designed to help women perform PFMT exercises correctly and consistently. The Pelex Upp is a small, handheld device that is placed in the vagina. It uses biofeedback to provide real-time feedback on the strength and coordination of the pelvic floor muscles. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare the effectiveness of the Pelex Upp to standard PFMT in the treatment of SUI. The investigators will also compare the effectiveness of the Pelex Upp to standard PFMT plus pelvic floor physical therapy. The investigators hypothesize that the Pelex Upp will be more effective than standard PFMT in the treatment of SUI."

The goal of this study is to improve the attendance of participants in the Community Wise (CW) intervention. CW is a multi-level manualized behavioral intervention to decrease alcohol and substance misuse (ASM) frequency in a population of self-identified men with histories of substance use disorder (SUD) and incarceration in Essex County, NJ, U.S. The 3CB was founded in 2010 and developed and pilot-tested the original CW. Over the past six years, our team used the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), and community based participatory research (CBPR) principles to develop and optimize CW for efficacy in reducing ASM and cost. MOST guided the optimization of CW with delivery cost of less than $2,000 per intervention cycle serving up to ten individuals simultaneously (this was the Medicaid allowable reimbursement cost for SUD group treatment services in 2015). Clinical trial results showed larger ASM reduction (Cohen's d=-2∙22, P=0∙067) in the optimized CW group. Unfortunately, attendance across the 15 intervention sessions was low (only 15% of participants attended 50% of the sessions). In order to improve upon our positive results and maximize our chances to successfully obtain further external funding to test CW effectiveness, we need funding to: 1) identify strategies to improve attendance and reduce ASM, and 2) to test feasibility and acceptability of CW among men and women with a history of SUD living in marginalized communities. We will achieve these aims by conducting a 23 full factorial experiment. This study will help us identify efficient strategies for improving attendance and, hence, maximize the interventions' effect in reducing ASM. As a highly efficient experimental design, a full factorial experiment will maximize study power and allow us to examine the individual and interactive contributions of each intervention delivery strategy on intervention attendance. MOST will inform which strategies will be retained, thus minimizing waste of resources. The current proposed research will also be conducted in partnership with the 3CB. As our primary individual level outcome, we will use number of sessions attended to test if different intervention delivery strategies will result in a clinically and statistically important intervention attendance with a minimum of 50%"

Minimally invasive cardiac surgery is necessary surgery that can take steps to improve the quality of life and functional status of patients without sternotomy. However, patients may experience intense pain in the immediate postoperative period, which can lead to inactivity, increased risk of complications, and greater consumption of opioids, resulting in adverse effects and prolonged hospital stays. Pain management is challenging due to a large number of dermatomes covered. The interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block seems to cover the thoracic dermatomes. It has been the subject of many studies in the same surgical group. Minimally invasive cardiac surgery can be excruciating in the postoperative period, just like thoracotomy surgeries. What is aimed of this study is to compare it with erector spinae block in this study. Additional anesthetic techniques, such as peripheral nerve blocks, are part of the multimodal analgesic strategy and are often used to manage acute pain better. Inadequate treatment can lead to persistent pain conditions. Although numerous nerve blocks exist for this purpose, some may fail because they do not cover the thoracic dermatomes or their entire innervation. The central hypothesis of this study hypothesis, interpectoral plane block + serratus anterior plane block, defined in 2012, has been used in many previous studies as part of multimodal analgesia in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Erector spinae block was also described in 2018 with positive results that have been used in both sternotomies (open heart surgery) and minimally invasive procedures. In this randomized clinical trial, the study aims to compare the efficacy of previously known field blocks as part of multimodal analgesia in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. As presented in the literature, these techniques have been routinely performed so much that review articles have been written. Targeted in this study, preliminary results will be postoperative pain scores. At Namık Kemal University anesthesia clinic, It is regularly used as part of multimodal analgesia and resident training.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric illness that is associated with significant suffering and disability in Veterans. Current treatment options are not fully effective for all Veterans, and even when they are effective in lowering total symptom burden, many Veterans continue to experience significant symptom burden and associated functional impairment. Total symptom burden and associated functional impairment is often particularly high for those with comorbid mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Methylphenidate (MPH) is a widely available psychostimulant medication with a long track record of safety, which has been used to improve cognitive functioning in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and has also shown benefit for mood and cognitive functioning in studies of moderate or severe TBI and as augmentation in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. In a small pilot study of the efficacy of MPH for subjective cognitive impairment associated with PTSD and/or mTBI, members of the research team found that MPH resulted in not only a significant improvement in subjective and objective measures of cognitive functioning, but also a significant decrease in symptoms of both depression and PTSD. Methods: Here, the investigators propose to follow up this promising initial finding with an aggregated N-of-1 randomized placebo-controlled trial of MPH versus placebo (PBO) for PTSD and cognitive symptoms in Veterans with PTSD, with or without comorbid TBI. N=70 Veterans across two sites will each receive sequential 4-week periods of MPH and PBO, in randomized order and separated by a 1-week washout, for a total of 20 weeks. During this time, they will complete weekly or biweekly assessments. This trial design, which is particularly well-optimized for conditions in which a heterogeneous response to treatment is expected, will let us achieve a number of specific aims. First, the investigators will assess the efficacy of MPH compared to PBO for reducing PTSD and depression symptoms in Veterans with PTSD and neurocognitive complaints. Second, the investigators will assess the impact of MPH compared to PBO on neurocognitive functioning in this same population. And third, the investigators characterize the baseline predictors of treatment response to MPH in this population, including"

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by chronic abdominal pain and discomfort, changes in bowel habits, and abdominal bloating. It is a chronic condition that affects approximately 10% of the population in Korea, and its chronic gastrointestinal symptoms significantly impact patients' daily life and quality of life. Factors such as changes in the intestinal microbiota and the intestinal ecosystem are crucial in its etiology. Modern individuals, who are often exposed to numerous stressors, frequently experience persistent intestinal hypersensitivity and inflammation. Foods that are not well digested and fermented in the intestines, producing a significant amount of gas - such as those rich in seasonings, dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol - are known to trigger symptoms. Therefore, it is suggested that a controlled environment like a Temple Stay, which provides both dietary regulation and stress control, could lead to meaningful symptom improvement. However, there is currently a lack of objective scientific research on this. Our research team hypothesizes that a Temple Stay experience of more than a week could consistently change the microbiome and stabilize psychosocial factors. This might control chronic intestinal inflammation and hypersensitivity, leading to subjective symptom improvement and enhanced treatment satisfaction for patients. Through this study, we aim to validate the hypothesis that the dietary changes in a Temple Stay environment will drastically alter patients' dietary intake, enrich the composition of the gut microbiome, and consequently reduce the symptoms of IBS, thereby improving the quality of life."

The effects of climate change on population health have considerably increased as the planet warms and is thus subjected to more heat waves, extreme weather events and food insecurity. Paradoxically, healthcare systems are major contributors to carbon emissions. Within the field of respirology, choice of inhaler is a low-hanging fruit to address this issue. Metered dose inhalers (MDI) contain potent greenhouse gases and have been shown to have a significantly larger carbon footprint than dry powder inhalers (DPI). Studies from the United Kingdom have revealed that although patient awareness of the discrepancy in climate impact of inhalers is low, their willingness to change inhalers after being educated on the subject is high. An example of inhaler change is to use the Bricanyl Turbuhaler (terbutaline) instead of Ventolin (salbutamol) as a rescue medication in asthma. They are both short-acting bronchodilators (SABA) and have similar pharmacodynamics. However, use of Bricanyl for one year produces 7,183 kgCO2e or the equivalent of 59.9km by car, whereas use of Ventolin for one year produces 411,720 kgCO2e, the equivalent of 3,431 km by car. The goal of the study is to assess asthma patients' willingness to change inhalers for environmental reasons as well as prescribers' willingness to prescribe a different inhaler for environmental reasons at the patient's request. The study will also be assessing patient awareness of the climate impact of inhalers and the importance that they attribute to this issue as well as other issues (cost and ease of use)."

Obesity is a chronic disease state driven by the imbalance of caloric intake and expenditure and mediated by multiple central and peripheral pathways that may serve as targets for therapeutic interventions. The endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) is a per oral gastric remodeling technique that employs full-thickness suturing to imbricate the stomach along the greater curvature to achieve a restricted, sleeve-like configuration. Argon Plasma Coagulation (APC) is a method of non-contact thermal hemostasis which utilizes a high-frequency current applied to the target tissue through an argon plasma jet to induce hemostasis and a homogenous surface coagulation with a limited depth of penetration. APC is a widely used therapy in the luminal digestive tract to provide non-contact, targeted thermal injury for mucosal ablation and may therefore allow for a greater submucosal component of healing between tissue plications and, consequently, greater durability of the gastroplasty. Enhanced fibrosis along the site of endoscopic plications with the addition of APC could decrease the incidence of weight regain in patients undergoing ESG and capitalize on the metabolic benefits of gastric mucosal revitalization reported with APC alone. In this study, the investigators propose to evaluate the durability of endoscopic plications, weight loss outcomes, and improvements in obesity related co-morbidities for the combined hybrid argon plasma coagulation plus endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (HAPC-ESG) procedure when compared to traditional ESG. Investigators hypothesize that HAPC-ESG will provide greater durability of the gastroplasty construct than traditional ESG. This is a single-center, randomized, single-blinded clinical trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of HAPC-ESG for weight loss and improvement in obesity related co-morbidities compared to ESG alone. The study population includes adult patients who are seeking ESG at True You Weight Loss in Cary, NC with a BMI ≥ 30 and ≤40 kg/m² who have failed to achieve and maintain weight loss with a non-surgical management."

Background:
Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Approximately 20% of breast cancers overexpress the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). HER2 overexpression is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets the HER2 receptor. It is approved for the treatment of HER2-positive breast cancer.
Objectives:
To assess the effectiveness of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Trastuzumab in achieving pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.
Eligibility:
Patients with breast cancer that was found to be HER2 positive were included. Only patients who underwent neoadjuvant therapy were included.
Design:
A systematic review of the literature was conducted. The researchers identified nine clinical trials that met the inclusion criteria. These trials included patients with non-metastatic operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory breast cancer, and they evaluated the pCR as the primary or secondary endpoint. The trials utilized different chemotherapy and targeted therapy regimens, along with varying dosages of Trastuzumab.
The primary outcome of interest was the pCR rate, while other survival outcomes were not analyzed.
Among the 1,209 patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and Trastuzumab, the overall pCR rate was found to be 42%.
The review provided detailed information about the design of the selected trials, patient characteristics, disease staging, HER2 status, administered treatment regimens, and primary/secondary endpoints. It also mentioned slight variations in the definition of pCR across the trials."

The recent global pandemic has highlighted the need for health and wellness interventions that are freely accessible from a person's home; likewise, studies have shown that citizens with lifestyle related diseases are more vulnerable to infections such as COVID-19. The goal therefore is to provide accessible, expert-led motivational support to Irish citizens who need help in the community in relation to promoting healthy lifestyle and preventing lifestyle-related diseases. This pilot study is a continuation of the previously approved 'RCSI Coach Connect project' that examined the impact of a similar online coach-led app on frontline healthcare workers. Lessons from RCSI Coach Connect have shown us that intelligent assistance is required to help human coaches scale this online health solution to larger citizen groups. This project will involve a close collaboration between existing partners: the RCSI Centre for Positive Psychology and Health and Empeal in the development and implementation of a coach-led digital support platform augmented by an Intelligent Coaching Assistant (ICA) for 6-months. This digital health platform is a motivational support unit only and is not intended for use or replacement of medical or therapeutic. ICA-augmented coaching has the potential to transform the coaching profession. Having ICA as a partner can facilitate human coaches to improve the quality of their work and has the potential to increase accessibility and availability of coaching through lower costs. The ICA of this digital health platform has been developed to take time-consuming administrative tasks from the human coach so that their time can be maximised for scalability. Administrative tasks that ICA have taken include, on-boarding participants, prompting participants to complete assessments and book coaching session, reporting assessment results, and gathering data for the coach (i.e. short, medium and long-term goals and targets, along with their readiness to change and feelings of achievability and reality towards goals). All data gathered by the ICA is to be utilised by coaches to augment the one-to-one coaching experience between participants and coaches. Data is the lifeblood of ICA and must be protected and managed. The ICA will only gather data provided by the participants, and this data is completely voluntary. By collaborating with Empeal, the investigators will analyse this real-world data and apply it to the development and validation of an ICA-augmented coaching framework."

Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a common, preventable and treatable disease that is characterized by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response of the lungs to noxious particles or gases. COPD is the third leading cause of death worldwide. The most common symptoms of COPD are dyspnea, cough and sputum production. Dyspnea is defined as a subjective experience of breathing discomfort that is a consequence of an inadequate exchange of gases between the lungs and the blood. It is a multidimensional symptom that includes sensory, affective and cognitive components. It is a symptom that is experienced by 90% of COPD patients and is the most common cause of hospitalization and the main reason for seeking medical help. Fatigue is defined as a subjective feeling of tiredness, weakness, lack of energy and decreased activity. It is a common symptom in COPD patients and is associated with a decrease in quality of life and an increase in mortality. Sleep disturbance is a common problem in COPD patients. It is reported that 30-70% of COPD patients have sleep disturbance. Sleep disturbance is associated with an increase in dyspnea and fatigue.

Alzheimer's disease is an insidious onset and slowly progressive disease, characterized by the presence of cognitive, behavioral and general dysfunction. Among the neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms seen in Alzheimer's patients, apathy is the most common symptom. It is also followed by depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) affect up to 90% of people with dementia during the illness. Therefore, it brings great difficulties to both patients and their caregivers and causes low quality of life. In addition, the inability to treat the disease completely worsens this situation. Considering the pharmacological treatment of psychological symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression in AD individuals, the existence of adverse side effects, increased mortality, limited drug efficacy, relatively high cost, and the inability to effectively treat some of the most distressing behaviors, it is recommended to give priority to non-pharmacological interventions. The concept of cognitive stimulation in AD is one of the most popular approaches. It is stated that Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the best evidence-based practice with robust clinical trials, applied according to a specific guideline for individuals with mild and moderate dementia. In addition, CST is the only intervention recommended by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to promote cognition, independence and well-being for people with mild to moderate dementia. It has been determined that CST applied to individuals with AD contributes to the strengthening of cognitive, psychological and social aspects, but there are few studies applied by nurses. It is noteworthy that the studies on the CST program applied by nurses in our country are limited. Therefore, the need for more clinical studies is emphasized by nurses to build and disseminate knowledge in this area, as the intervention has been little studied. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effect of CST application on the levels of apathy, loneliness, anxiety and daily living activities in elderly individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This research was planned in a single center and experimental research design with pretest posttest control group. The research was planned to be carried out between January 2023 and June 2023 at the Moral House affili"

Chronic pain is a major health concern, impacting psychological health, functioning, and quality of life. However, its treatment is complex and is challenged by a complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors. Common pain treatments present significant medical and technological limitations, reflected in unspecific drug usage and an extremely high number of medical examinations that patients face regularly, with a huge cost burden on the healthcare system. Furthermore, the overall efficacy of pain management is often limited (73% dissatisfaction with treatment), leaving the patient in poor life conditions. Designing individualized targeted therapies requires understanding each subject's multidimensional pain experience, taking into consideration both the physical and emotional aspects involved. However, today, the golden standard measurement for pain is self-reports, which inherently suffer from subjective differences in perception and reporting. Healthcare systems advocate for the discovery of biomarkers and reliable clinical trial endpoints for pain to foster diagnosis, monitor pain progression, assess new treatments, and personalized therapeutic response. Nevertheless, most of the evidence today comes from inpatient settings or controlled laboratory environments. The pAIn-sense study aims at providing a radically novel approach in the monitoring and treatment of pain patients: a novel telemonitoring system allowing to understand the real nature of the pain (emotional vs physical), leveraging the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques and wearable sensing technology collecting biometric data, therefore enabling efficient personalized treatments. To achieve this goal, the investigators will combine real patient data both from a physical and emotional perspective, to characterize the pain nature of patients and provide a tailored continuum-of-care. The system will include: Robotic wearable sensors (Hardware): wearable technology for physiological monitoring (e.g., skin conductance, blood volume pressure and heart rate, activity) Digital platform (Software): a customized application that collects psychological assessments, psychological status, medication, subjective pain level and sleep quality. AI-based engine: advanced AI models take all the previous physical and psychological information and model it to provide an outline of what is the nature of the pain level of the subject. The system will be used to monitor the patient during normal activities (day and night) while collecting physiological, psychosocial, and pain information."

Lymphatic malformations (LM) are a group of rare congenital disorders that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. LM can be classified into three types: microcystic, macrocystic, and mixed cystic. Macrocystic LM (mLMs) and mixed cystic LM (mclLM) are the most common types of LM. The current standard of care for mLMs and mclLM is surgical resection, but this is often not feasible due to the size and location of the LM. Sclerotherapy is an alternative treatment option, but it is not always effective and can cause significant morbidity. TARA-002 is a new investigational drug that is being studied for the treatment of mLMs and mclLM. TARA-002 is a lyophilized biological preparation for injection containing cells of Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A, type 3) Su strain treated with benzylpenicillin. TARA-002 is thought to work by stimulating the body's immune system to fight the LM.
This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of TARA-002 in the treatment of mLMs and mclLM in participants between 6 months and less than 18 years of age. Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. They will also have imaging studies of the LM.
Participants will receive up to 4 injections of TARA-002 into the LM over a period of 6 weeks. The injections will be given under the skin in the area of the LM. After each injection, participants will be monitored for any side effects.
Participants will be followed for 32 weeks after the last injection. During this time, they will have regular visits with the study doctor. They will also have imaging studies of the LM to see if the LM has shrunk."

The EarSwitch is a novel assistive device which allows people with motor impairments to communicate using their ears. The device consists of a small camera which is placed in the ear canal and is connected to a computer via Bluetooth. The camera detects movement of the eardrum which is caused by the contraction of a small muscle in the middle ear called the tensor tympani (TT) muscle. The EarSwitch software then translates this movement into a virtual keypad or similar to allow the patient to communicate nonverbally.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the robustness of the EarSwitch technology in detecting voluntary eardrum movements in people with assistive needs. This is a key step to ensure a robust design informed by patients' needs. A secondary aim is to gather information from assistive device users about how well they can perform voluntary eardrum movements, as this knowledge will be used to inform what types of interfaces are appropriate for the Earswitch.
Healthy participants will also be recruited as a separate cohort, to maximise the amount of data collected which can be used to validate and inform future designs. The methodology will be the same across both cohorts with the same equipment (Earswitch, second screen, and laptop) being used, however the healthy participants will not be able to answer all questions in PART 1. Healthy participants will be invited into a University lab to undertake the study, whereas participants with assistive technology needs will be given the option of a home visit. As the same equipment will be used, only the environment (i.e., home vs lab) will change which is not anticipated to affect the study data.
At the start of the study a signal will be agreed with the participant (and carer when required) so that the participant can inform their carer and/or the experimenter if they wish to stop the study for any reason. The proposed study will take place in a single session and includes four main parts:
PART 1 - Co-design Questionnaires. The specific aims for this part are to collect data on what assistive technologies people use and gain feedback on current switch technologies to better understand how the Earswitch can be integrated in conjunction with other switch technology. The participants will be asked questions to understand the type of assistive technology (hardware and software) they currently use. This will include their"

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disease of the joints, especially the knee. The disease is characterized by cartilage loss and joint space narrowing. The current gold standard for the diagnosis of OA is radiography. However, radiography is not able to detect early cartilage loss. Therefore, new imaging techniques are needed to detect early cartilage loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a promising imaging technique for the detection of early cartilage loss. However, the current MRI protocols are not able to detect early cartilage loss. Therefore, new MRI protocols are needed.
The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of weight-bearing and flexion in the detection of early cartilage loss in knee OA.
Four MRI scans will be performed with a 0.25T scanner: weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing with flexed and extended knee. The MRI scans will be performed in patients with symptomatic knee OA. The MRI scans will be evaluated for the presence of cartilage lesions. The presence of cartilage lesions will be compared between the different MRI scans.
The results of this study will be used to develop a new MRI protocol for the detection of early cartilage loss in knee OA."

Dysphagia, or disordered swallowing, is prevalent in almost all neurodegenerative conditions and results in the inability to effectively protect the lower airways from foreign (i.e., food/liquid) and endogenous (i.e., saliva) material. An unfortunate consequence of dysphagia is aspiration pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD). Swallowing therapy has proven to be effective for the management of dysphagic symptoms in PD. Treatment is most often delivered in clinics once/week over short time periods with the expectation that exercises be completed at-home. However, these paradigms lack biofeedback to assess the accuracy and strength of the prescribed exercise and accountability to ensure completion of the exercise program. Without biofeedback or options for long-term therapeutic intervention at-home, patients often regress to baseline levels. The proposed research project seeks to test the effectiveness of a novel at-home surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback therapy tool called Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) on swallowing safety and efficiency in patients with PD. The significance of this project lies in the fact that dysphagia is expensive in terms of patient quality of life, health outcomes, and healthcare costs [10, 11] often increasing hospital costs by approximately 40% [12]. Thus, a targeted swallowing therapy system with biofeedback that can be utilized at-home may reduce hospitalizations secondary to dysphagia, help maintain therapeutic gains, and reduce the burden that dysphagia places on our healthcare system. sEMG is a therapy tool that has been used in rehabilitation practice for decades. Use of sEMG during swallowing therapy involves placement of electrodes under the chin (overlying the anterior belly of the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles) [13]. While the patient completes a swallowing task, electrodes detect collective muscle contractions associated with hyolaryngeal excursion - a biomechanical event critically important to airway safety and swallowing efficiency [14]. The patient can then see the waveform of the swallow displayed on a computer monitor. Measures of swallowing strength are derived from the amplitude of the wave"

The study will incorporate a harmonized protocol among the 8 countries to estimate point-prevalence of high-risk HPV (HR HPV) in low socio-economic populations and, among specific sub-populations, the incidence of persistent HPV infection. Due to differences in study settings, study population, targeted age-group, and eligibility criteria, country-specific protocols will be developed to complement the multi-country master protocol. In the master protocol, general principles on study design and methodology will be described, while the country-specific protocol will elaborate in more detail on methodology in each country related to subject identification, the enrolment process, and laboratory analysis. A standardized survey questionnaire, with some minor country-specific adaptations, and laboratory assays will be implemented throughout the participating countries in order to generate comparable data. Two separate approaches will be implemented to estimate prevalence and incidence respectively in each participating country. First, cross-sectional surveys (CSS) will be conducted in both urban and rural areas of selected countries in order to estimate the point prevalence of HPV infection in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The CSS will enrol girls and women aged 9-50 years, with equal sample size from four age-strata: 9-14, 15-20, 21- 30, 31-50. For specific populations, age-strata will be modified to include 12-35 years olds considering the target population characteristics and local context. Multi-stage cluster random sampling or another applicable sampling strategy will be applied to ensure representativeness. Urine samples will be collected for HPV testing, along with data on demographics, socioeconomic status, sexual and reproductive history, attitudes towards and awareness and uptake of cervical cancer screening and HPV vaccination, and potential risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer. Additional data will be collected on knowledge of HPV, and attitudes, uptake and use of vaccines, using standardized questionnaires and case report forms.

The use of cognitive functions such as memory is essential for the execution of daily activities and represents a crucial element for autonomy maintenance during aging. It is known that the physiological cognitive decline associated with aging also involves memory and can significantly impact the older person's independence. For these reasons, great interest has been generated by two tools that have proved to be decisive in supporting memory functions: non-invasive neurostimulation and memory training. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation that modulates brain activity by employing a direct current delivered through electrodes applied to the scalp. Recently, the use of tDCS has been combined with training interventions focused on working memory in healthy older adults, providing evidence of a significant improvement in memory function when memory training is associated with the use of tDCS compared to when it is performed without it. In particular, adaptive memory trainings coupled with stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex provide benefits that last also at follow-up visits after 1 or 3 months, especially in participants who exhibit a lower baseline performance. While it was observed that adaptive working memory training alone is unable to modulate brain plasticity mechanisms, it was hypothesized that tDCS can modulate brain plasticity by acting through long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms and that it can modulate brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that plays a relevant role in LTP. Several adaptive memory trainings focused on working memory, which is essential for decision-making processes and daily activities. Even if promising results have been shown so far, it appears that no study addressed the implementation of strategic memory training coupled with the use of tDCS. Adaptive memory trainings permit not only to improve the performance in each task by gradually increasing its difficulty, without however resorting to teaching a strategy. Strategic memory trainings permit not only to improve participants' performance in the practiced task but also to generalize the use of memory strategies to new tasks. Intending to prevent cognitive impairment, using these intervention methods in healthy aging population and the prodromal phases can be useful. To this end, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) indeed represents an intermediate state between normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (nMCI) and may predict the development of objective cognitive decline."

Aging is associated with a progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass and function, a condition known as sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is a major cause of disability and frailty in older adults and is associated with increased risk of falls, fractures, hospitalization and death. Sarcopenia is also associated with a reduced quality of life and increased healthcare costs. The prevalence of sarcopenia is expected to increase in the coming decades due to the aging of the population.
The loss of skeletal muscle mass and function with aging is caused by a combination of factors, including a decline in muscle protein synthesis and an increase in muscle protein breakdown. The loss of muscle mass and function is also associated with a decline in physical activity levels, which further exacerbates the problem.
Testosterone is a hormone that is important for the maintenance of skeletal muscle mass and function. Testosterone levels decline with age, and this decline is associated with a loss of muscle mass and function. Testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) has been shown to increase muscle mass and strength in older men with low testosterone levels. However, the effects of TRT on skeletal muscle mass and function in older men with normal testosterone levels are not well understood.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of TRT on skeletal muscle mass and function in older men with normal testosterone levels. The study will also investigate the effects of TRT on the epigenetic regulation of skeletal muscle genes.
The study will be conducted in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either TRT or placebo for 10 weeks. Participants will undergo a 12-week washout period, followed by a 10-week period of resistance exercise training.
Participants will undergo a series of tests to assess their muscle mass, strength and function, as well as their epigenetic regulation of skeletal muscle genes."

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a global health crisis, with more than 100 million confirmed cases and 2.5 million deaths worldwide. The pandemic has also caused significant disruption to health services, with a large proportion of health resources being diverted to the management of COVID-19. The development of rapid, point-of-care tests to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection has the potential to allow earlier detection and isolation of confirmed cases compared to PCR-based diagnostic methods performed in centralized laboratories, with the aim of cost-effective reduction of transmission field (Dinnes et al., 2020). In theory, sufficiently sensitive and specific point-of-care format tests could be implemented at PoE and used to screen low-prevalence populations effectively. In particular, rapid COVID-19 antigen tests in a lateral flow format COVID antigen RDTs or AgRDTs can play a key role in accelerating access to testing and improving turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. COVID antigen RDTs detect specific proteins known as antigens on the surface of the virus and can identify people who are at the peak of infection when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. A number of AgRDTs are now available, some of which have received emergency use authorizations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and/or the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These tests have the potential to detect an active infection with performance that is close to that of PCR in specific settings. However, the performance of COVID antigen RDTs outside of highly controlled settings is not well defined, particularly in low-prevalence groups of asymptomatic people (Bryan et al., 2020; Lassaunière et al., 2020 Linares et al., 2020; Porte et al., 2020). Antigen tests with rapid turnaround times and minimal user skill have been recently approved for emergency use listing (EUL) by the WHO. Performance data show sensitivity and specificity levels (at least 80% and 97%, respectively) sufficient for diagnostic purposes of SARS-CoV-2 in targeted individuals, but their role in population-based screening remains to be established. In this evaluation, performance characteristics of"

Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a common and debilitating condition experienced by people who have had a limb amputation. It is characterized by pain in the missing limb, which can be severe and debilitating. The current study will examine the use of operant conditioning to reduce PLP. Operant conditioning is a type of learning in which a person's behavior is influenced by the consequences of that behavior. In this study, the investigators will use operant conditioning to strengthen the weakened sensorimotor responses and reduce pain, after a limb amputation.
The study will involve three 1-hour sessions per week for 8-9 weeks, followed by 2 follow-up sessions at 3 and 6 months after the last session. Participants will be asked to be seated during the study session. Non-painful peripheral stimulation will be applied to elicit a brain response. Electrodes will be placed on the scalp to record these electrical brain responses during the study session. Visual feedback based on the response will be provided in pseudo realtime. The study will involve three 1-hour sessions per week for 8-9 weeks, followed by 2 follow-up sessions at 3 and 6 months after the last session. Assessments of pain intensity and quality, and neurophysiological sensorimotor response, will be performed before the first session, after the last session, and at follow-up sessions. Additional electroencephalography (EEG) based assessments will also be performed as exploratory measures, to assess inter- and intra- hemispheric functional connectivity and sensorimotor responses associated with amputation and operant conditioning training."

This is a Phase 2 study of cevostamab consolidation following BCMA CAR T cell therapy for relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). CAR T cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that uses a patient's own T cells (a type of immune system cell) that have been changed in the laboratory to recognize and kill cancer cells. CAR T cells are given through a vein. CAR T cell therapy is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of RRMM. CAR T cell therapy is also being studied in the treatment of other types of cancer.
Cevostamab is a monoclonal antibody that is being studied in the treatment of RRMM. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that can be made in a laboratory and can be given by IV infusion. Cevostamab is being studied in the treatment of RRMM because it may help the immune system kill cancer cells.
The purpose of this study is to see if cevostamab consolidation following BCMA CAR T cell therapy is safe and effective in treating RRMM.
Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine tests will be done.
Participants will be given cevostamab by IV infusion once every 3 weeks, starting roughly 10 weeks (day 70 +/- 4 days) post-CAR T cell infusion, with subjects planned to receive 8 cycles initially. Subjects receive a single step-up dose of 3.6 mg of cevostamab on cycle 1, day 1 (C1D1), followed by the recommended target dose (160 mg, 132mg, or 90 mg based on results of safety run-in data and safety review) on C1D8.

The purpose of this study is to test the efficacy of a new transitional care model for patients determined to be at higher risk of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission. The study will use a fallback design with two primary endpoints. The first sequential primary endpoint is 30-day post-discharge unplanned hospital readmission in the overall study population. The second sequential primary endpoint is 30-day post-discharge unplanned hospital readmission in the medium-high risk population (RecuR Score 2 & 3). The significance level (0.05) will be divided evenly between the two primary endpoints, for a significance level of 0.025 for the first primary endpoint and a reserved 0.025 significance level for the second primary endpoint.
The study will use a stratified randomization method with stratification by RecuR Score. Participants assigned to Arm 1 will receive the activities in Intervention A and the participants assigned to Arm 2 will receive the activities in Intervention A AND the activities in Intervention B. As there is an apparent difference between Arm 1 and Arm 2, neither the patients nor providers will be blinded to the study assignment. Informed consent will be obtained and documented for this study.

Worldwide more than approximately 500 million people suffer from AR (30% of the Dutch population) and its prevalence is expanding. Nasal congestion (i.e. reversible mucosal congestion/nasal mucosal obstruction) is one of the most general and bothersome symptoms in rhinitis and is associated with other medical conditions such as rhinosinusitis and otitis media. This study is relevant as in addition to the high global occurrence of AR, this disorder has substantial effects on the quality of life (QOL) (e.g. during sleep and work). AR is related to high direct medical costs (mainly prescription of medications and outpatient visits) and indirect economic costs (including productivity decrease). Current medications are undesirable due to their side-effects (such as sedation in the case of intranasal antihistamines (INAH). Acupuncture for AR in general can be considered as safe and can be seen as a potential remedial blueprint for nasal congestion. Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on specifically nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial aims to evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin®). A standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points has been established - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - and this selection of acupuncture points can be seen as a solid and profound approach from which every AR patient may benefit. This standard set opens the nose and affects the underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time to maintain its nose opening effect (i.e. to prevent recurrence of the complaint). The acupuncture protocol concerns 8 treatments during 6 weeks (i.e. 2 treatments per week during the first 2 weeks and 1 treatment per week in the consecutive 4 weeks). The positive effects of this treatment protocol (such as improvement QOL) may result in more confidence in the direct, post-treatment and long"

Perinatal depression and anxiety (PDA) is a major public health concern, affecting 15-20% of women during pregnancy and the first year postpartum. PDA is associated with adverse maternal and infant outcomes, including increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, infant mortality, and poor infant development. The gut microbiome is a key regulator of the immune system, and it is also involved in the regulation of the brain and behavior. Recent studies have shown that the gut microbiome is altered in women with PDA, and that the gut microbiome can be modified by dietary interventions. The investigators hypothesize that dietary interventions targeting the gut microbiome can improve maternal mental health outcomes. The investigators will conduct a feasibility pilot clinical trial to test this hypothesis. The investigators will recruit 100 pregnant women with a history of depression and/or anxiety and currently stable. Participants will be randomized to one of four study groups: (1) Gutopia: dietary modification, fish oil and probiotics; (2) Gutboost: probiotics and fish oil; (3) Gutless: fish oil and placebo probiotics; (4) Gutnone: standard care. All participants will be followed for 12 months after delivery. The primary outcome for this study is feasibility, measured by: recruiting the targeted number of participant within the anticipated timeframe, and completion of at least 4 of the 6 visits by each participant. The secondary outcomes are: (1) changes in the gut microbiome; (2) changes in mental health scores; (3) changes in dietary intake; (4) changes in lifestyle factors; (5) changes in infant health outcomes. The investigators will also explore the relationship between the gut microbiome and mental health outcomes. This study will provide important information on the role of the gut microbiome in maternal mental health and on the potential of dietary interventions to improve maternal mental health outcomes."

This study involves 25 inclusive preschool classrooms. The study uses an randomized controlled trial to estimate treatment impacts of a peer-mediated intervention, with 12 classrooms assigned to the treatment group and 13 to the control group. Within each classroom, the focal participants are children isolated from their classroom social network with low pragmatic language skills. One target child is selected per classroom using a priori exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. In the fall of each year, simple random assignment is used to allocate classrooms to the treatment group and to the control group. First, investigators identify all children's positions within the classroom social network using a teacher matrix conducted in fall of the academic year; from this network a child-level social network index is calculated (i.e., individual degree centrality; lower scores are characteristic of social exclusion). Second, teachers simultaneously complete the Developmental Pragmatic Profile (DPP) for each child in the classroom. Finally, among the participating focal children, investigators select the target child based on the lowest centrality scored weighted by DPP score, so that focal children represent the most socially isolated children with the poorest social-pragmatic communication skills. Children and teachers participate for a 9-month period, and the primary approach to treatment for focal children is described here. Specifically, focal children in classrooms randomized to the treatment condition receive peer-mediated pivotal response training (PRT) per procedures detailed by Brock et al. PRT procedures are facilitated by a classroom teacher or teaching assistant-who receives ongoing training and support from research staff. First, investigators provide a one-on-one 1-h training session for each facilitator that focuses on how to identify, initially train, and then support peers on a day-to-day basis during center time. Second, investigators partner with the facilitator to identify two peers who (a) demonstrate good social skills; (b) respond well to adult directions; (c) have consistent attendance; and (d) do not have a history of negative interactions with the target student. The facilitator explicitly identifies the focal child (buddy) and asks the children to use three strategies to play with the buddy during center time: (a) offer your buddy some play options; (b) show and talk about how to play with your buddy; ("

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a degenerative disease process that disrupts the transmission of nerve impulses, resulting in a range of neurological signs and symptoms. Walking-related impairment is one of the most common symptoms, reported to affect more than 90% of people with MS. The leading non-pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is rehabilitation, such as physical therapy. Rehabilitation is believed to restore function through experience-dependent neuroplasticity. There is strong evidence that physical therapy can improve mobility-related function in people with MS, and emerging evidence that motor-relearning approaches to rehabilitation may be associated with changes in brain structure and function that correlate with improvements in functional performance. The leading pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is dalfampridine. Dalfampridine improves motor function by increasing nerve conduction through demyelinated axons, however, dalfampridine alone is not likely to generate neuroplastic changes needed for lasting benefits, because neural plasticity requires salient and task-specific practice with high repetition at adequate intensity, as well as complex environments that stimulate opportunities for movement to facilitate synthesis of neurotrophic factors. Indeed, the treatment effects of dalfampridine are reversed as soon as the treatment was discontinued. However, it is possible that improved nerve conduction velocity provided by dalfampridine may accelerate neuroplasticity generated from rehabilitation. Yet, combining dalfampridine with concurrent rehabilitation has never been studied. The objective of the proposed study is to test our central hypothesis that providing a motor-relearning physical therapy intervention in combination with dalfampridine will produce superior gains to either intervention alone in mobility through augmented neuroplasticity. Aim 1 will determine if dalfampridine can augment the effects of physical therapy in restoring function in people with MS by comparing the combined intervention to physical therapy without dalfampridine. Aim 2 will explore the comparative effectiveness between the combined intervention with dalfampridine alone, and between physical therapy alone and dalfampridine alone. In Aim 3, the investigators will investigate mechanisms of treatment effects by evaluating functional connectivity"

Cleft lip and palate (CLP) is a congenital malformation of the face. The prevalence is 1 in 700 live births. CLP is a complex condition that affects the physical appearance, speech, hearing, and psychosocial well-being. The treatment of CLP is multidisciplinary and includes surgery, speech therapy, audiology, psychology, and social work. The aim of the treatment is to improve the physical appearance, speech, hearing, and psychosocial well-being. The treatment is often long-term and includes several surgeries. The treatment outcome is often evaluated by the patient's self-reported health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The CLEFT-Q is a questionnaire on HRQoL specific to patients with CLP. The CLEFT-Q has been translated and validated in several languages. The CLEFT-Q has been shown to be a reliable and valid instrument in patients with CLP. However, the CLEFT-Q has not been tested in patients with CLP who have undergone secondary surgeries. The aim of this study is to investigate the test-retest reliability, responsiveness and interpretability of the CLEFT-Q in patients with CLP who have undergone secondary surgeries. The study will include 200 patients with CLP who have undergone secondary surgeries of the nose, lips, jaw or to improve speech. The patients will answer the CLEFT-Q before and after surgery. The patients will also answer the CLEFT-Q at a follow-up visit. The patients will also be interviewed about their experiences on working with the CLEFT-Q. The study will also include 20 health care professionals who will be interviewed about their experiences on working with the CLEFT-Q. The study will be conducted at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, University Hospital of Umeå, Sweden. The study will be conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.

Primary dysmenorrhea is a common gynecological disorder among females worldwide. The pain is usually felt in the lower abdomen but sometimes it may radiate in thighs and to the back. Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common type of gynecological disorder among females worldwide. Some females may feel some associated symptoms like nausea, vomiting diarrhea, headache, dizziness and in severe conditions syncope. All of these symptoms occur usually in females with normal pelvic anatomy and symptoms occur just before menses. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs 6-12 months after the onset of ovulation cycle. Primary dysmenorrhea can be distinguished from secondary dysmenorrhea on the basis of symptoms and other pelvic or reproductive organ disorders. Endometriosis is the most common cause of secondary dysmenorrhea, in secondary dysmenorrhea pain starts few days before the onset of menstrual cycles and may last longer than the cycle. The chances of secondary dysmenorrhea are more prevalent in females above the age of 20. A complete pelvic examination should be performed in females who are sexually active and have dysmenorrhea and those who are suspected to have endometriosis. In general population the prevalence of Primary dysmenorrhea is about 47-80%. Seventy five to eighty five percent of female have said to report that the symptoms of primary dysmenorrhea are mild. Primary dysmenorrhea is not life threatening and does not cause any disabilities but some researches have said that most young girls are reported to be absent from school/college and not being able to perform any activity due to the severity of pain. Some evidence shows the link between dysmenorrhea and prostaglandin, the level of prostaglandin is said to be increased and leads to uterine contraction and ischemia. The release of prostaglandin leads to excessive uterine contraction and the constriction of small endometrial blood vessels leads to ischemia and thus pain. The level of prostaglandin is said to be increased during premenstrual phase in which progesterone level decreases and the level of prostaglandin increases in endometrial cells by the action of"

The risk associated with arterial hypotension during general anesthesia for surgery or interventional procedure has been demonstrated, but the threshold at which consequences for perfusion of one or more organs appear varies according to the mechanism of hypotension, associated abnormalities (Heart rate, cardiac output, and oxygen transport), and the patient's terrain. Currently, a mean arterial pressure greater than 60 mm Hg and a reduction of less than 30-50% from the value measured before general anesthesia are commonly used treatment thresholds to ensure good perfusion of all organs. These values are based on large cohort studies that associate these blood pressure thresholds with the occurrence of postoperative complications or during the resuscitation stay. They cannot be generalized to certain subpopulations that are underrepresented, such as women and elderly patients. Normally, cerebral blood flow is self-regulated, which allows cerebral blood flow to adapt to oxygen requirements and to different levels of high and low blood pressure. However, this protective mechanism may fail for a degree of hypotension that depends on several factors such as the age or vascular health of the patient. For example, in patients with preexisting hypertension, the autoregulatory capacity of the brain is likely impaired making organs more susceptible to ischemia at low blood pressure. Thus, current American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines in the setting of noncardiac surgery recommend individualizing care for patients with associated cardiovascular comorbidities. Arterial stiffness is currently one of the best independent, early biomarkers predictive of cardiovascular complications and cardiovascular comorbidity. Assessment of arterial stiffness is currently performed by pulse wave velocity (PWV) measurement. Therefore, higher blood pressure goals tailored to the physiology of each patient may be preferable for these high-risk patients. Because there is individual variability in cerebral autoregulation, a strategy based on a one-size-fits-all recommended blood pressure (BP) value is nonsense. What is the tolerable target BP level for a patient under general anesthesia? Is there a simple and non-invasive way to measure the level of cerebral blood flow"

Pain is a common and under-recognized symptom in children with severe neurologic impairment (SNI). The investigators have developed a novel intervention, the PediQUEST Response to Pain of Children with Neurologic Disability (PQ-ResPOND), to address this gap. The intervention combines (i) parent-mediated activation through weekly collection and feedback to parents and clinicians, via our PQ App, of parent reported child pain (Non-Communicating Children's Pain Checklist-Revised scale (NCCPC-R)) and other symptoms (PediQUEST-Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale adapted for children with SNI), with (ii) PPC team-mediated activation of primary clinicians and parents: through PPC consultation, and (iii) PPC team activation through training in a standardized approach to recurrent pain using the PQ-ResPOND Checklist (adapted by the study's interprofessional expert panel). The investigators will conduct a single site Phase II Pilot 2:1 Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) of PQ-ResPOND (intervention, n=30) vs. usual care (control, n=15) in 45 children ≥1 year-old & AYA with SNI and moderate to severe recurrent pain behaviors.

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an important treatment for patients with hematopoietic malignant tumors and hematopoietic stem cell diseases. However, the incidence of poor graft function after allo-HSCT is still high, and the treatment of poor graft function is still a challenge. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a kind of multipotent stem cells with the ability of self-renewal and differentiation. MSCs can be differentiated into osteoblasts, adipocytes, chondrocytes, and other cells, and can be used to repair damaged tissues. MSCs can also secrete a variety of cytokines and growth factors, which can promote the proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, and play an important role in the repair of damaged hematopoietic stem cells. In this study, the investigators will use MSCs to treat patients with poor graft function after allo-HSCT. The investigators will inject MSCs into the patient's body through a vein, and the investigators will observe the changes in the patient's condition. The investigators will also collect blood samples from the patient before and after the injection of MSCs to study the changes in the patient's immune system.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects 1% of the population over 60 years old. It is characterized by motor symptoms (e.g., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and non-motor symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, cognitive deficits, gastrointestinal symptoms, dopaminergic drug-induced behaviors (e.g., hallucination, impulse control issues) and mood disturbance (e.g., depression, anxiety). While 21% of individuals struggling with the disease reported at least one of these psychosocial symptoms within the initial stage of the disease, they are generally at risk for increased emotional distress, cognitive declines, and elevated stress hormone (cortisol) levels. Both motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease could affect the quality of life of individuals and that of their caregivers. A cross-sectional study conducted by our research team has explored the symptom burden and support care needs in people with PD across East and Southern Asia (n=186), revealing significant unmet needs among Hong Kong PD patients regarding their psychosocial-spiritual concerns. In particular, they experience significant, moderate palliative care needs at the early to middle course of the illness. The extent of unmet support care needs among patients with mild to moderate PD is as great as that among patients with other chronic health conditions, such as advanced cancer, late-stage lung cancer, stage 4/5 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and late stage chronic kidney disease. The visible and unpredictable symptoms of a distorted body (e.g., tremor and gait dysfunction) and the suppressed expressions due to having a masked face, reduced voice and slurred speech often results in difficulty seeking help and stigmatization of the disease. Despite the tremendous influences and common occurrence of NMS, they are surprisingly under-recognized in clinical practice because of the lack of spontaneous verbal complaints by the patients, as well as the lack of systematic questioning by healthcare professionals. A qualitative exploration of the illness experience of local PD patients highlighted the importance and urgent need for holistic PD interventions that emphasizes on early identification and preventive measures of individual who are at risk for PD patients,"

Glioblastoma is the most common primary brain tumor in adults. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival is only 15 months. The standard of care treatment for glioblastoma includes surgical resection, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy. However, the extent of resection is limited by the inability to identify tumor cells in non-enhancing (NE) regions surrounding the contrast-enhancing bulk of tumor. The investigators have previously addressed the difficulty in identifying tumor in non-enhancing (NE) T2 hyperintense regions surrounding the contrast-enhancing bulk of tumor. The investigators have applied pH sensitive amine chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST-EPI) to patients with glioblastoma. CEST imaging can utilize detection of fast-exchanging amine protons to obtain an imaging contrast that is dependent on tissue acidity. Bulk water protons undergo chemical exchange with amine protons. CEST imaging detects the attenuation of bulk water magnetization following a saturation pulse, which can vary by concentration of amine protons. This contrast can be quantitated as the asymmetry in the magnetization transfer ratio (MTRasym) relative to water proton resonance frequency. Tumor cells are known to produce elevated levels of extracellular hydrogen, given 1) a higher metabolic rate secondary to increased cell turnover and 2) an affinity for anaerobic glycolysis - the Warburg Effect. The investigators have shown active tumor burden and active replication occurring in infiltrating glioblastoma cells. and thus leveraged CEST imaging to visualize infiltrating tumor cells. 19 In newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma, higher median MTRasym at 3ppm within CEST+ NE regions p=0.007; p=0.0326] and higher volumes of CEST+ NE tumor [p=0.020; p<0.001] were associated with decreased PFS.

The study aims to examine the beneficial effects of a short playful interaction on the cognitive, social, and mood of older people. The study also aims to compare between online playful interactions to face to face. In addition, in the past two decades there has been a shift toward the development of tailor-made interventions that fit individual needs and abilities. This trend is especially important in aging, given increased variability in personality and cognitive and sensory characteristics. In the current study, the investigators aim to investigate the mediating role of personality traits and cognitive functions in connection to the beneficial effect of playful interaction on the dependent variables.
The study will take place in six sites including assisted living facilities, community centers and adults day centers in Israel. Participants will be invited by the research assistance to take part in the study. Participants who will be willing to take part in the study will meet with the research team and will read and signed an informed consent form before participating in the study. Following base line assessment participants will be randomly assigned to four arms. At first, they will randomly assign to one of two conditions (online or face t face). The interactions will be separated in a week. A random half of the participants will be assigned to practice the playful interaction at the first week and control interaction in the second week, whereas for the other half this order will be reversed. One designated experiment assigned each participant randomly to one of the two interactions (playful or control), to keep the other experiments blind to the activity. For each participant, separate interactions will be conducted by a different experimenter. These are the four arms: Playful interactions operationalized by dramatic improvisation techniques based on verbal and non-verbal elements in face to face setting Playful interactions operationalized by dramatic improvisation techniques based on verbal and non-verbal elements in online setting An active control condition that involves introductory conversation and movement exercises in face to face setting in face to face setting An active control condition that involves introductory conversation and movement exercises in face to face setting in online setting The interventions will meet the following criteria: a) ease of implementation in an online system; b) a short interaction between 15-20 minutes.

Sepsis is a common and serious disease in the intensive care unit (ICU), which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) caused by infection. Septic vascular endothelial injury is the main pathological basis of sepsis, which is closely related to the occurrence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and death. The pathogenesis of sepsis is complex, and the current research is still in the exploratory stage. The inflammasome is a multi-protein complex that can be activated by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to induce caspase-1-dependent pyroptosis. DDX17 is a member of the DEAD-box RNA helicase family, which is involved in the regulation of inflammasome activation. GSDMD is a key component of the inflammasome, which can be cleaved by caspase-1 to form a pore in the cell membrane, resulting in pyroptosis. In this study, the investigators will use ELISA to detect the plasma levels of DDX17 and GSDMD in sepsis patients, and analyze the correlation between the plasma levels of DDX17 and GSDMD and the severity of sepsis, the incidence of MODS, and the 28-day mortality. The investigators will also analyze the correlation between the plasma levels of DDX17 and GSDMD and the severity of sepsis, the incidence of MODS, and the 28-day mortality.

Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment for end-stage liver disease. However, the postoperative period is characterized by a high incidence of complications, mainly acute rejection and biliary complications. The diagnosis of these complications is based on invasive procedures, such as liver biopsy and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), which are associated with morbidity and mortality. Therefore, the development of non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of these complications is of great importance.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of non-invasive methods for the diagnosis of postoperative complications in liver transplant recipients.
The study will be conducted in a single center, and will include 100 patients who will undergo liver transplantation. The patients will be followed up for 2 weeks after surgery.
The primary outcome will be the diagnosis of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), defined by the Olthoff criteria. The secondary outcomes will be the diagnosis of acute rejection and biliary complications.
The non-invasive methods that will be evaluated are:

Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of only  5% in real-world studies. The Stupp Protocol, consisting of fractionated focal irradiation in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5 days/week for 6 weeks (a total of 60 Gy), plus concomitant daily temozolomide (TMZ, 75 mg/m2/day, 7 days/week from the first to the last day of radiotherapy) after maximal safe tumor resection, followed by six cycles of adjuvant TMZ (150-200 mg/m2/day for 5 days during each 28-day cycle), has been adopted as the standard of care for patients with newly-diagnosed GBMs (ndGBMs) since 2005. However, there have been no other treatment modalities except for tumor treating fields (TTFields) that have brought survival benefits for ndGBM patients during the past two decades. Since TTFields therapy is super expensive (about 1 million yuan/0.15 million dollars per year) and fewer than 10% of ndGBM patients can afford it around the globe, the Stupp Protocol is still being used as the first-line and the most widely-adopted treatment option for ndGBM patients around the world. Elemene, a Chinese anti-tumor medicine extracted from the plant Curcuma Wenyujin, has been isolated as a monomeric drug and has a broad-spectrum anti-tumor effect in various cancers, such as lung cancer, breast carcinoma, leukemia, and ovarian cancer. In recent years, its application in GBMs as revealed in the preliminary retrospective studies published in Chinese Journals and a few English Journals have shown survival benefits with acceptable toxicity. Elemene can pass through the blood-brain barrier because of its small molecular weight and lipid solubility and has synergistic anti-tumor effects with TMZ and radiotherapy for GBM patients. Several in vitro studies also have shown that Elemene could inhibit GBM cell proliferation, promote cell differentiation, and induce cancer cell ap"

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury, characterized by a diffuse inflammatory infiltrate, loss of lung compliance, and hypoxemia. The mortality rate of ARDS is still high, ranging from 30% to 50%. The prone position is a well-established treatment for ARDS, but its efficacy is still debated. The prone position improves oxygenation and lung compliance, but it is unclear whether these effects are due to a redistribution of lung volume or to a recruitment of previously collapsed lung units.
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of prone positioning on lung recruitability in infant/children with ARDS.
The study will be conducted in a single-center, tertiary pediatric intensive care unit (PICU).
Eligible patients will be enrolled in a 2x2 cross-over design.
At the end of the PEEP trial (i.e. at PEEP 5 cmH2O), patients will lay in the supine position for 15 minutes arterial blood gases will be performed and then a one-breath derecruitment maneuver (5-second exhalation, respiratory rate < 8 bpm) from PEEP 5 cmH2O to 0 cmH2O will be conducted to assess baseline functional residual capacity (FRC), defined as the EELI measured at 0 PEEP.
After the supine step, each enrolled patient will be placed in the prone position for 1 hour. For safety reasons, enteral feeding will be interrupted 30 minutes before prone positioning and re-established after the study ending. During pronation FiO2 will be increased up to 80% and then gradually decreased to the baseline value within the first 30 minutes of prone positioning. After 30 minutes of PEEP 12 cmH2O (provided that plateau and driving pressures did not exceed 30 cmH2O and 15 cmH2O, respectively) to stabilize lung volumes, the same measurements applied for the supine step will be performed.

The International Headache Society (IHS) reported that approximately 90% of headaches consist of tension-type headache (TTH) and migraine, which are the primary type of headache, and affect approximately 50% of the population. The incidence of headaches and migraines is to peak at the age of 20-50, and is more common in women than in men. Recurrent tension-type headaches and migraine attacks negatively affect the quality of life of individuals, reducing working capacity and participation in social and family activities. Therefore, tension-type headaches and migraines cause significant social exclusion, loss of workforce and economic burden. TTH and migraine tend to occur during the most productive and high-capacity phase of life, between ages 25-55, affecting muscle groups used in daily life activities, potentially leading to limitations in participation, coping, and self-management skills among women. In this regard, it is important to study how tension-type headaches and migraines, which have significant social and individual effects, alter the self-sufficiency and perception of activity in women.
The aim of this study is to investigate and compare the effects of Progressive Relaxation Training on pain characteristics, attack frequency, activity self-efficacy perception, and social participation in women with two different types of headaches, TTH and migraine. This study will enable clinicians working with women suffering from TTH and migraine to comprehensively evaluate them in clinical settings and provide more comprehensive intervention approaches to address challenges encountered in daily life."

Neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) is a common and serious complication of prenatal opioid exposure. NOWS is a multisystem disorder that can lead to long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. The pathophysiology of NOWS is poorly understood, and there are no established biomarkers to predict the severity of NOWS or to monitor the response to treatment. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression. miRNAs are involved in many biological processes, including neurodevelopment. miRNAs are also present in exosomes, which are small vesicles released by cells that can be detected in bodily fluids. The investigators hypothesize that miRNAs in exosomes may be useful as biomarkers for NOWS. The investigators will study miRNAs in the saliva of infants with NOWS. The investigators will also study miRNAs in the saliva of infants with NOWS who have a normal neurodevelopmental outcome and compare them to miRNAs in the saliva of infants with NOWS who have a poor neurodevelopmental outcome.

Chronic pancreatitis is an inherently complex disease requiring coordinated, multidisciplinary care. Patients suffer from constant, distressing, adverse symptoms including abdominal pain, steatorrhoea, bloating, wind, cramping, and fatigue - making it difficult to eat a normal or sufficient diet. They develop vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, and a difficult-to-manage diabetes subgroup (type 3c diabetes). There is no effective medical/surgical treatment, and the disease is progressive and incurable. The mainstay of treatment is diet, supplementation, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy- which helps patients to digest and absorb their food, alleviating symptoms somewhat. Contrary to perceptions, half of patients (or fewer) have an alcohol related aetiology. The investigators run several out-patient clinics for chronic pancreatitis including medical-led, nurse-specialist led, and type 3c diabetes clinics. A nurse specialist deal with 3-5 crisis phonically daily, each lasting up to 30mins. Patients have frequent urgent clinic attendance, A&E, and hospital admissions.
What is the intervention?
A steering group designed and developed the SmartCP mobile phone app during 2022 with the support of a government innovation grant. SmartCP consists of a symptom tracker, diet/physical activity log, alert system for escalating symptoms, quality of life assessment, red-flag alerts for diabetes/pancreatic cancer, educational content, push notifications and messaging function.
The investigators aim to conduct a study to determine if SmartCP is feasible in the management patients with chronic pancreatitis, complementing current specialist clinical care.

HIV prevention research has largely focussed on adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) in low and middle income countries and men who have sex with men (MSM) in high income countries. Research on the user experience and choice of oral PrEP or CAB-LA PrEP amongst vulnerable heterosexual men is required. Men consistently fare worse than women in levels of HIV testing and ART initiation with significant challenges in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) for engagement and persistence in HIV treatment programmes well described. Despite this, heterosexual men represent the largest unaddressed gap in HIV services in SSA.
In order to improve uptake, persistence, and effective use of all forms of PrEP, there is a need for simplified and differentiated delivery of PrEP that is person- and community-centred specifically for men. Effective use requires that all sex acts are covered by an effective prevention intervention such as PrEP. Given the importance of flexibility due to travel in this group, our hypothesis is that both oral PrEP (in particular, event-driven) and CAB-LA PrEP will be highly acceptable to men in two high-burden, resource limited, African countries, with high levels of effective use including persistence and coital coverage.
This is the first multi-country PrEP study for implementing both event-driven oral PrEP and Long-acting injectable cabotegravir (CAB-LA) in men in SSA (South Africa and Uganda). The programme will provide the evidence and cost-effectiveness analysis which is critical to decision making by African governments and donors on how to prioritise prevention resources and inform guidelines.

Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder that affects millions of people worldwide. SCD is caused by a mutation in the beta-globin gene that results in the production of abnormal hemoglobin (HbS). This abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells (RBCs) to become sickle-shaped and break down prematurely, resulting in a host of complications. SCD is a life-threatening disease that can cause severe pain, organ damage, and early death.
Currently, there is no cure for SCD. The only treatment available is to manage the symptoms of the disease. However, this treatment is not always effective and can have serious side effects.
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a procedure that can cure SCD. HSCT involves replacing a person's diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow from a donor. HSCT is a risky procedure, but it is the only cure for SCD.
The goal of this study is to test a new approach to HSCT that may be safer and more effective than current methods. The investigators will use a non-myeloablative conditioning regimen, which is less toxic than traditional conditioning regimens. The investigators will also use a new drug called briquilimab to help prevent graft rejection.
The investigators will test this approach in people with SCD who are at high risk for disease-related complications. The investigators will also test the safety and effectiveness of this approach in people with SCD who have already had a HSCT.
The investigators hope that this study will lead to a new, safer way to treat SCD."

The study aims to investigate the treatment of couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Eligible couples will be recruited for the study after providing informed written consent following counseling. The IVF protocol involves various steps. Women will undergo preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) as clinically indicated. Ovarian stimulation will be carried out using gonadotropin injections, and regular ultrasound monitoring will be conducted to track the growth of follicles. To prevent a premature LH surge, progestin primed ovarian stimulation or a GnRH antagonist will be administered. Once at least three follicles reach a size of over 17 mm, a trigger injection of either human chorionic gonadotrophin or a GnRH agonist will be given to induce final maturation. Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after the trigger under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The recruited women will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the microfluidic chip group or the density gradient centrifugation group. Randomization and blinding will be ensured to maintain the integrity of the study. Only the laboratory staff involved in sperm preparation will be aware of the group assignment, while the women and clinicians will be blinded to the treatment groups. Semen specimens will be collected by masturbation on the day of oocyte retrieval, following a period of 2-7 days of sexual abstinence. The semen samples will undergo evaluation according to WHO guidelines, including semen volume, sperm concentration, and percent motile spermatozoa. Sperm DNA damage will be assessed using an alkaline single-cell gel electrophoresis (Comet) assay. The extent of DNA damage in spermatozoa will be examined using specific parameters. Sperm preparation will be performed based on the randomization list. In the microfluidic chip group, the Sperm Separation Device will be used, and the prepared sample will be collected in a test tube. In the density gradient centrifugation group, sperm preparation will be completed using a discontinuous density gradient centrifugation method, and the resulting sperm pellet will be washed and resuspended.

Allergic rhinitis (AR) is a common chronic inflammatory disease of the upper airways. The pathogenesis of AR is complex and involves a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The pathogenesis of AR is characterized by an inflammatory response to allergens, which is mediated by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a neurotrophic factor that plays an important role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system. BDNF has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects and may play a role in the pathogenesis of AR.

Inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, leading to chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes) and contributing to the obesity epidemic. Much of the world's population is inactive and older adults are at highest risk. Inactivity in older adults is linked to age-related diseases and cognitive decline. Inactivity also imposes social costs through increased medical expenses, which are already high among the growing older adult population in the US. Incentive-based interventions have gained popularity among behavioral scientists and policymakers as a tool for improving health-related behaviors. But there are drawbacks - first, monetary incentives are often not cost-effective, and therefore scalability is limited. Second, behaviors often return to baseline when monetary incentives are removed, i.e., healthy habits are hard to maintain when incentives are limited in duration. Third, there is a concern that monetary incentives crowd out intrinsic motivation to engage in health-promoting behaviors. In light of the limited success of incentive-based behavior change programs, the investigators propose to design and evaluate alternative incentives that address these challenges of scalability, habit formation and crowd-out. The investigators will aim to encourage physical activity through alternative incentives - by making a meal donations on behalf of participants (prosocial incentives) and give participants monetary incentives (personal incentives). Both types of incentives have underpinnings in behavioral economics. Meal donations harness prosocial preferences, which may be more powerful and less likely to reduce intrinsic motivation than equivalent monetary incentives. The overall aim is to evaluate the impact of alternative incentives on step count of older adults in the short-term and long-term. Exploratory analysis will also evaluate the impact on physical and mental health. The investigators will recruit 200 older adults and randomize half of them to receive additional prosocial and personal incentives for their walking behavior. The other half will not receive these incentives. The investigators will track step count of these two groups for 8 weeks using a Fitbit device. Under the treatment functionality, participants accrue a meal donation and a point for Feeding America for each day that they meet the step goal.

The investigators will conduct a prospective interrupted time series study to evaluate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of a wireless vital signs monitor for hospitalized newborns in Kenya. The study will be conducted at the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) neonatal ward between April 2022 and June 2023. The MTRH neonatal ward is arranged in 8 sub-units which comprise our comparison sub-groups. Newborns admitted from April-November 2022 comprise the pre-intervention arm and are not exposed to neoGuard, but receive existing standard-of-care vital sign monitoring. In December 2022, neoGuard was installed in 4 sub-units (intervention group), while the remaining 4 sub-units (comparison group) continued to use standard-of-care monitoring. The measurement of effectiveness will be performed at three levels: (1) device's ability to detect abnormal physiological signals and provide alerts/alarms that notify the nurses to check on a patient's status and; (2) alarms/alerts from level one that resulted in a necessary intervention being administered to the patient (valid alarms), versus all the alarms/alerts that did not necessitate an intervention (invalid alarms); (3) the month-to-month difference in newborn complication rates and treatment outcomes between the intervention group and comparison group. Medical staff who interact with neoGuard will participate in user surveys at the end of the intervention period to capture user experience and perceptions on feasibility and sustainability."

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder in children, but many children remain undiagnosed and untreated. In a previous study, the investigators found that a clinical decision support system helped primary care providers (PCPs) identify children with OSA. In this system, parents of children report on possible OSA symptoms (e.g., snoring, sleepiness) in their child before the visit. If the child has OSA symptoms, the PCP receives an alert during the visit recommending further evaluation and a possible referral for a sleep study or to see a specialist. While this system helped increase the number of children with OSA symptoms who received a referral, many children remained unidentified. The goal of this study is to see whether involving parents in the system can identify even more children. In this study, the investigators propose to test the impact of a health communication message, designed to educate and activate parents about their child's risk for OSA. This message is an infographic that helps parents recognize nighttime symptoms of OSA and how these nighttime symptoms may be impacting their child during the day. If a child has OSA symptoms, parents would view this infographic before their child's PCP visit and could discuss OSA with their child's PCP. For children with OSA symptoms, their parents will be randomized to either: 1) view the health communication message, or; 2) usual care, in which parents are not given any additional information about OSA or their child's risk prior to the appointment. In both cases, PCPs will receive a prompt indicating that the child is at risk for OSA."

Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder with a high mortality rate. The pathophysiology of AN is not well understood and there is no specific treatment for AN. The current treatment approach is based on a combination of psychotherapy and nutritional rehabilitation. However, the success rate of this approach is low and there is a need for new treatment approaches.
Recently, the investigators have identified a new biological marker, Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF-15), which is elevated in the blood of AN patients. GDF-15 is a protein that is released from the body in response to stress and inflammation. The investigators have also found that GDF-15 is elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AN patients. The investigators hypothesize that GDF-15 is a marker of inflammation in the brain of AN patients.
The investigators will study GDF-15 in AN patients and healthy controls. The investigators will also study other markers of inflammation in the brain of AN patients. The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the volume of the brain and the amount of inflammation in the brain.

The fast growth of Decision Neuroscience is contributing to unveil the cognitive processes underlying choices and their neural bases. The results obtained so far show that decision-making involves neural mechanisms underpinning a complex balance between automatic appetitive or aversive drives generated by subcortical structures, and processes of executive control centered in fronto-parietal brain networks. While the role of meso-limbic structures in reinforcement learning have been widely investigated, it is much less clear to what extent are choices shaped by a) individual differences in executive skills; b) contextual factors potentially interfering with such skills, such as knowing that the outcome of those choices will impact only on one's own vs. another's welfare. This a critical gap, since executive abilities are known to decline even in physiological ageing, thus potentially interfering with the quality of choices. On this ground, this single center non-interventional fMRI study aims to provide novel insights into the relationship between executive and decision-making skills, and their possible changes with ageing, in 150 healthy individuals. This goal will be pursued by combining a behavioral assessment of decision-making and executive skills with a multimodal fMRI session including data concerning a) brain activity associated with decision-making and executive functioning in social vs. non-social contexts, b) brain structural morphometry (grey-matter volume/density), and c) brain structural connectivity (diffusion weighted imaging). The behavioral assessment will involve the main metric of decision-making (e.g., risk aversion, loss aversion, delay discounting) and executive functioning (e.g., selective attention and inhibitory control). MRI data will unveil the neural bases of individual differences in decision-making and executive performance in terms of performance-related patterns of brain activity, structure and connectivity. Results will provide an useful baseline for investigating alterations of decision-making and executive functioning, and of their neural bases, in pathological conditions."

The relationship between the two conditions of forward head posture (FHP) and temporomandibular joint dysfunction (TMD) have been previously stated with comparing the craniocervical angle (CVA) of TMD patients to the healthy individuals, still a clear relationship couldn't be drawn due to different study limitations such as the lack of subdivision in the TMD patients based on their diagnostic subcategories in addition to, patients' posture might have been altered while the photo was captured. Ever since, multiple researchers deliberately investigated the two conditions association and inferred the following: 1. FHP can be a risk factor resulting in TMD where any alteration in the head position produces more tension on the masticatory muscles by changing the mandible position 2. TMD origins from muscular component is more significant than articular component yet the correlation between head posture and TMD is still not clear enough, however, if FHP and myogenic TMD were linked preventive measures can be taken. recently, multiple studies established a relation between the occurrence of FHP in TMD patients which supported the suspected relation between them but without a clear association. Till present, no study has investigated the additional effect of FHP DCTO correction impact on myogenic TMD, and this is where the purpose of this study arises from.
The aim of this study is to investigate the additional effect of FHP DCTO correction on myogenic TMD.

Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease that affects 80% of the population. It is characterized by the presence of comedones, papules, pustules, and nodules. The pathogenesis of acne is multifactorial, including hormonal, genetic, and environmental factors. The most common treatment for acne is topical retinoids, antibiotics, and benzoyl peroxide. However, these treatments are not always effective and can cause side effects. Recently, a new topical drug called Dapsone has been shown to be effective in the treatment of acne. Dapsone is a sulfone antibiotic that has been used to treat leprosy and other skin diseases for many years. It is now being used to treat acne because it has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. Dapsone is available as a gel that is applied to the skin once a day. In this study, the investigators will compare the efficacy of Dapsone gel to clindamycin gel in the treatment of moderate acne vulgaris. The investigators will also compare the side effects of the two treatments. The study will be conducted at the University of Michigan Health System. Patients with moderate acne vulgaris will be screened with a medical history and physical examination. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either Dapsone gel or clindamycin gel. Both treatments will be applied to the skin once a day for 12 weeks. The investigators will assess the efficacy of the treatments by measuring the number of acne lesions.

Rotator cuff tears are a common cause of shoulder pain and disability. The severity of the tear is an important factor in determining the prognosis and treatment options. However, the relationship between rotator cuff tear severity and muscle activation patterns is not well understood. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between rotator cuff tear severity and muscle activation patterns of the scapular and rotator cuff muscles during functional tasks.
The study will be a cross-sectional study. Participants with rotator cuff tears will be recruited from the outpatient clinic of the University of Toronto. Participants will be divided into four groups based on the size of the tear: small, medium, large, and massive.
Surface electromyography (sEMG) will be used to assess the activation patterns of the scapular and rotator cuff muscles during functional tasks, such as shoulder flexion, abduction, and external rotation. The sEMG assessment will be conducted using a wireless sEMG system with a sampling rate of 2000 Hz and a bandwidth of 20-500 Hz. Pre-gelled, disposable, self-adhesive Ag/AgCl electrodes will be placed on the muscle belly according to SENIAM guidelines, with an inter-electrode distance of 20 mm.
The primary outcome measure will be muscle activation amplitude. The secondary outcome measure will be differences in muscle activation patterns between varying tear sizes.
The results of this study will provide valuable insights into the relationship between rotator cuff tear severity and muscle activation patterns, which can help in the development of more effective rehabilitation programs for patients with rotator cuff tears."

Pasta is a staple food in the Mediterranean diet pyramid. Despite this, more and more people are avoiding it because they consider it too caloric and associate it with weight gain, especially if eaten in the evening. While we know with certainty that the consumption of pasta, in the right quantities, is associated with positive health effects, there is limited information on the optimal time to consume it. The most common hypothesis is that it is better to consume it at lunch, as metabolism undergoes a physiological and progressive reduction as the evening approaches. Furthermore, recent findings in the field of chrono-nutrition have highlighted that glucose tolerance is high during the day and minimal during the night, suggesting that consuming a high amount of carbohydrates in the evening may predispose to weight gain and a worsened cardio-metabolic profile. On the other hand, according to some studies, consuming carbohydrates in the evening may ensure good sleep quality, as they are an excellent source of tryptophan, an amino acid that promotes serotonin production, also known as the sleep hormone. Recently, some studies on animal models have suggested that the timing of carbohydrate consumption could also impact the composition and functionality of the gut microbiota. For example, it has been observed that the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) fluctuates throughout the day under the control of the host's circadian rhythms. Considering that SCFA are produced from carbohydrates and are fundamental regulators for many metabolic processes, it could be extremely interesting to explore the relationship between when carbohydrates are consumed and microbial functionality.
In conclusion, to date, studies that have evaluated the timing of carbohydrate consumption are limited and rely on physiological and chrono-biological assumptions rather than experimental evidence. Consequently, it is not known whether consuming pasta at lunch or dinner, in the right quantities, may have effects on human weight and health.
The aim of this study is to assess, for the first time, whether there is a difference between consuming pasta at lunch or dinner in terms of sleep quality, anthropometric parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, composition and functionality of the gut microbiota in a sample of normal-weight subjects.

Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable malignancy of plasma cells that leads to destructive bone lesions, renal damage, anemia, and hypercalcemia. MM is the second most common hematologic malignancy. The American Cancer Society estimates that annually over 34,000 new cases of MM will occur in the U.S. and over 12,000 deaths due to MM in 2022. Overall survival (OS) has improved significantly over the past 20 years with the development of proteasome inhibitors (PIs), immunomodulatory agents (IMiDs) and anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies. However, despite these advances, patients ultimately relapse requiring multiple subsequent lines of therapy. As MM evolves, it generally becomes more refractory, and patients ultimately succumb to their disease. With multiple lines of efficacious therapies, the correct early identification of relapsed disease is important to trigger initiation of a new line of therapy. Limitations in conventional imaging highlight a need for molecular imaging agents with better sensitivity for detecting and measuring tumor burden to improve staging and treatment selection for patients with MM and plasma cell dyscrasias. 18F-fluciclovine is a radionuclide approved by the FDA for evaluating suspected prostate cancer recurrence but has shown additional ability in detecting MM lesions.

Paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM) is a condition in which the vocal folds close during inspiration, causing difficulty breathing. Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and can greatly impact daily life. Some patients experience severe respiratory distress, which can lead to emergency department visits and occasionally intubation. The standard treatment is typically behavioral therapy performed by speech and language pathologists. However, new evidence suggests that video biofeedback may be an effective alternative treatment. Video biofeedback allows patients to directly visualize their breathing while performing specific breathing exercises. This is a desirable treatment because it can be performed at the time of diagnosis and requires minimal additional time or resources. The investigators' goal is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the relative effectiveness of video biofeedback and behavioral therapy in the treatment of PVFM. The primary endpoint will be the change in Dyspnea Index score before treatment and one month after treatment. Patients will complete surveys to collate data about patient expectations of behavioral therapy, their reasons for pursuing additional treatment if applicable, and the perceived benefits of the specific intervention. The investigators hypothesize that no clinically meaningful difference will be detected between behavioral therapy and video biofeedback for the treatment of PVFM. This pilot RCT will provide critical data for designing a fully powered trial comparing these two interventions, and will advance the investigators' goal of providing clinicians with important evidence for guiding treatment."

Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to sleep disorders. In the context of critical illness and ICU admission, there is an intersection of factors contributing to this situation: pre-existing health conditions, severe acute illness, sleep-altering treatments (sedatives, analgesics, mechanical ventilation), psychiatric disorders, and the physical environment. In addition to the impact during hospitalization, the literature points to a long-term reduction in quality of life due to sleep disturbance. Recent studies following up on patients after ICU discharge reveal high rates of sleep disorders up to 6 months after hospital discharge - related or unrelated to new psychiatric disorders and even cognitive changes. Furthermore, sleep disorders are associated with an increased incidence of delirium in ICUs, which refers to altered consciousness and cognition in patients admitted to the intensive care environment, which are associated with worsened patient outcomes such as increased hospital stay and consequently the risk of fatal complications. The prevalence of delirium is around 70%, with an incidence of 89%. Delirium assessment in ICUs is usually performed daily. In order to improve the sleep quality of this population, there are modifiable factors, whether environmental (lighting, noise, general care), physiological (medications, ventilatory parameter adjustments), or psychological (anxiety, pain, absence of family members). Routines to control environmental factors in ICUs seem to have an impact on reducing the incidence of acute brain dysfunction - delirium - and could help prevent sleep disturbances in critically ill patients. These measures include dimming or reducing corridor lights at night, grouping (when possible) care activities at appropriate times, raising curtains, and encouraging mobilization during daytime shifts. For non-delirious patients, the use of earplugs and eye masks is also recommended. Therefore, the investigators have developed this research project with the aim of evaluating the implementation of a multifaceted and multidisciplinary protocol to promote an improvement in sleep quality in critically ill patients. The SPIRIT Protocol is a summary of recommendations for clinical trials, which was used as a support in this study. This is a multicenter clinical trial with a quasi-experimental design. The first step consists of assessing the sleep quality in sequential patients admitted to the ICU and characterizing the disruptive elements. After"

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. Adjuvant endocrine therapy (AET) is a treatment that is recommended for most women with breast cancer. AET is usually taken for 5 years and is very effective in reducing the risk of recurrence and death. However, adherence to AET is suboptimal, with an estimated 20-30% of women not taking their AET as prescribed. Poor adherence to AET is associated with an increased risk of recurrence and death. The investigators propose to develop and evaluate a community pharmacy-based program to improve adherence to AET among breast cancer survivors. The program will be based on the principles of motivational interviewing and will be delivered by community pharmacists. The program will be evaluated in a pilot randomized controlled trial. The investigators will recruit 66 pharmacies in the province of Quebec, Canada. Each pharmacy will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. In the first group, pharmacists will provide usual services to women. In the second group, pharmacists and women will have access to the PACHA program in addition to the usual services. The PACHA program consists, for the pharmacists, of: a 85-minutes web-based training to prepare the pharmacists for delivery of the intervention. The program comprises three main sections led by experts: 1) a review of AET pharmacotherapy; 2) information on AET consultation based on the principles of motivational interviewing and video simulations of AET consultations according to program tools and expert feedback of these simulations, and 3) access to materials geared to participating women (web-video capsules about AET, self-management strategies for coping with specific AET side effects and other AET-related concerns and list of resources). The web-based training can be completed in one or more sessions. Pharmacists who complete the program will receive continuing education credits. The PACHA pharmacists will have to complete this program in the weeks after randomization. Standardized consultation guide based on motivational interviewing to guide AET consultations (by phone or in person). This standardized consultation guide outlines the key steps that the pharmacist must cover during the AET consultation and follows the usual sequence of consultation in pharmacy.

Melissa officinalis L. is a plant belonging to the Lamiaceae family known for its beneficial properties. This plant has been used since ancient times to treat various disorders, especially those related to anxiety and sleep quality. M. officinalis contains several phytochemicals, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and many others, which form the basis of its pharmacological activities. The plant exhibits antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, antimicrobial, and neuroprotective effects. Widely used since ancient times, M. officinalis has also been studied clinically, demonstrating interesting beneficial properties in the treatment of various conditions, including anxiety, sleep disorders, palpitations, hypertension, and depression. Nutraceuticals could be an alternative option to prescription drugs for alleviating symptoms associated with mild anxiety and insomnia. M. officinalis has been shown to be a stress-reducing and anxiolytic agent; in a study [Cases et al., 2011] conducted on subjects with mild to moderate anxiety and sleep disorders, M. officinalis extract reduced anxiety manifestations by 18%, improved anxiety-related symptoms by 15%, and reduced insomnia by 42%. Among the subjects who benefited from M. officinalis extract, 70% experienced a significant reduction in anxiety and 85% in insomnia. However, a limitation of the study was the absence of a control group, thus requiring a randomized controlled study with a placebo group. In light of the above, the current study is aimed at further investigating the beneficial effects of a formulated M. officinalis extract in phytosome form (Phytosome®). The phytosome technology utilizes phospholipids derived from sunflowers as an element capable of modulating the absorption kinetics of plant-derived molecules, with the intention of optimizing the product's efficacy with the lowest effective dosage. Phytosome® is composed of a dry extract of Berberis aristata root (550mg/cpr), complexed with phospholipids (soy lecithin), Pisum sativa proteins, and proanthocyanidin"

The incidence of gastric cancer (GC) and gastroesophageal junction cancer (GEJC) ranks fifth in the world. The prognosis of advanced GC/GEJC is poor, and the 5-year survival rate is less than 10%. The current first-line treatment for advanced GC/GEJC is platinum-based chemotherapy combined with fluoropyrimidine. However, the efficacy of this regimen is limited, and the median overall survival (OS) is only 10-12 months. Therefore, it is urgent to develop new treatment strategies for advanced GC/GEJC.
The tumor microenvironment (TME) is an important factor affecting the efficacy of immunotherapy. TME score is a new method to evaluate the TME of tumors. It is a quantitative method to evaluate the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor. The higher the TME score, the higher the infiltration of immune cells in the tumor, and the better the efficacy of immunotherapy. PD-L1 is an important immune checkpoint molecule. It is expressed on the surface of tumor cells and is an important factor in tumor immune escape. The expression of PD-L1 in GC/GEJC is related to the prognosis of patients. The higher the expression of PD-L1, the worse the prognosis of patients. Therefore, the combination of PD-L1 and TME score may be a new strategy for the treatment of advanced GC/GEJC.
This study is a multi-center, prospective, phase II study. The study will be conducted in two arms. Arm I is the intensive treatment arm, and Arm II is the conventional treatment arm. The intensive treatment arm is the combination of lenvatinib and tislelizumab plus CapeOX chemotherapy, and the conventional treatment arm is the combination of tislelizumab plus CapeOX chemotherapy. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS). The secondary endpoints are overall survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), and duration of response (DoR)."

The proposed study is a single-arm trial of Social Engage Coaching (S-ENG) to increase social connection and reduce loneliness and suicide risk in older adults. S-ENG is a 10-session individual coaching intervention that addresses barriers to action plan implementation and challenges in processing positive outcomes when exposed to socially rewarding activities. The study will use smartphone-based ambulatory assessment to comprehensively assess indices of social connection. Subjects will complete Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) recordings using a smartphone daily following 3 personally-selected times for prompts (to enhance recall and ease of completion of assessments) for 10-days prior to starting study interventions, beginning the day after the baseline visit. Each EMA instance takes approximately 2-5 minutes to complete. EMA will be integrated with other smartphone technology to passively capture social behavior. The Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) will passively measure social behavior (i.e., conversation frequency, duration, and valence). GPS- will track time outside the home. Subjects will be given a study smartphone designed for older adults to use during assessment periods. All subjects who successfully complete the smartphone assessment protocol at baseline will be assigned to S-ENG. S-ENG involves 10 individual coaching sessions over (up to) 4 months. S-ENG is a stepped, modular intervention that addresses barriers to action plan implementation and challenges in processing positive outcomes when exposed to socially rewarding activities. Psychoeducational materials address the importance of social connection. Subjects complete a values clarification exercise on aspects of connection most important to participants to inform personalized activities most likely to impact loneliness. Coaches are instructed to focus action plans on activities that foster social connection. The follow-up assessments at 8- and 16-weeks include baseline measures and smartphone measures."

The aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of higher doses estrogen therapy in women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI).
The study is designed as a pilot study. Women with POI taking standard-dose estradiol hormone replacement therapy (E2/dydrogesterone (oral) (2.0/10 mg)) were invited to the study. We conducted a pilot study designed to compare the effectiveness of oral estradiol (2mg/ day) and Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% (Gel sachet 1.5mg/ day) as standard-dose estradiol hormone replacement therapy. The obtained results on the absence of a significant difference in the effect of the above therapy made it possible to justify the prescription of higher doses of estrogens without prior switching from oral to transdermal therapy in equivalent doses in all study participants.
The study participants will consistently receive Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% (Gel sachet 1.5mg/ day) and Transdermal estradiol gel 0.1% (Gel sachet 2.0mg/ day) (both with 200mg micronized progesterone administered vaginally for 14 days per cycle) with an outcome assessment at each stage of the study.
The primary outcome measures are: the severity of estrogen deficiency symptoms, the assessment of quality of life using the Short Form Health Survey-36 (SF-36) and the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) questionnaire.
The secondary outcome measures are: the level of sex hormones in peripheral blood, the level of FSH, the level of E1, the level of E1S, the level of SHBG, the BMD response to using higher doses estrogen therapy for 12 Months."

The gut microbiome is a complex and dynamic community of microorganisms that plays a key role in human health and disease. The gut microbiome is also highly variable between individuals and populations, and this variability is associated with differences in diet and lifestyle. The gut microbiome of rural Papua New Guineans (PNG) is more diverse than that of USA controls, and the species Limosilactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri) was only detectable in PNG. Interestingly, L. reuteri was also regularly detected in humans in studies conducted around 1960, but is very rarely found in contemporary humans, suggesting a recent decline of the L. reuteri population in Westerners. L. reuteri is further convincingly linked to a wide range of health benefits, such as modulating immune function and stimulating immune cell development, and it produces tryptophan metabolites that modulate the immune system. These findings provide a clear rationale to test the immunological effects of a L. reuteri strain that originates from PNG and explore nutritional strategies to potentially enhance these effects by supporting the colonisation of this strain. The main objective of this study is to systematically compare the possible immunological effects of synbiotic supplementation with a probiotic, L. reuteri PB-W1™, and a prebiotic blend (comprising 50 % raffinose and 50 % xylooligosaccharide) with that of the probiotic and prebiotic alone and characterise the mechanistic and ecological foundations of any effects."

Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease and dementia. The investigators have recently shown that urolithin A, a natural compound found in certain fruits and vegetables, improves endothelial function and cerebral blood flow regulation in healthy adults. The investigators hypothesize that urolithin A supplementation improves endothelial function and cerebral blood flow regulation in middle-aged adults with obesity. The investigators will test this hypothesis in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study. The investigators will recruit 54 adults aged 40-64 years of age with a body mass index equal to or greater than 30 kg/m2. Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group will consume 1,000 mg of urolithin A daily in the form of softgel capsules, whereas those in the control group will consume a placebo. Data collection will occur at baseline (day 0) and endpoint (day 28). The investigators will compare outcomes between control and intervention group. Researchers expect that urolithin A supplementation in middle-aged adults with obesity improves endothelial function and cerebral blood flow regulation, and that this improvement is accompanied by changes in biomarkers of NO bioavailability and mitochondrial function."

Nearly 300,000 individuals are living with spinal cord injuries (SCI), and over 12,000 new SCI occur annually in the United States. Most SCIs involve the cervical (neck) region of the spine and cause partial or complete loss of movement of both arms, both legs, and the torso (quadriplegia). Individuals with a higher-level and more complete SCI typically have greater loss of functional movement and sensation below the level of the injury. They require greater levels of assistance for self-care and mobility. Currently, there are limited options for quadriplegics to access water to perform basic activities of daily living such as drinking. Additionally, hydration packs and straws create unsanitary conditions and can be difficult to use. The aim of the project is to develop an innovative fountain faucet to enable individuals living with SCI to access water more independently for basic activities of daily living. The faucet incorporates electromechanical controls and software programs that adjust spray outlets, spray angles, and water temperatures. A proximity sensor and voice recognition function allow users to control the faucet through a smart speaker. These features enable precise dispensing of water at the desired temperature and volume, while a camera and other sensors enable hands-free operation. Subjects, including individuals living with SCI and controls, were recruited from an outpatient rehabilitation clinic to test the functionality of the faucet including eye gaze, voice, and motion sensors to control the water stream for drinking, rinsing, and grooming. The examiner screened the subjects to determine their levels of functional independence (independent, modified independent, assistance required, and dependent). The participants were also interviewed regarding their current methods of drinking, rinsing, and grooming. The percentage and standard deviation of individuals in each level of independence for each function were calculated. A t-test was conducted to determine any significant differences in the dependence levels between the tested subjects and the control group."

The aim of the study is to analyze the effect of an activity wristband-based intermittent teaching unit in Physical Education on students' physical activity and its psychological mediators. The study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial. The sample consists of 120 students from 6 secondary schools in the province of Alicante (Spain). The students were randomly assigned to an intermittent teaching unit group (n=60) or a control group (n=60). The intermittent teaching unit group students performed an intermittent teaching unit twice a week for eight weeks aimed at promoting healthy physical activity habits. Specifically, the last 15 minutes of each lesson were used. The rest of lessons' time other contents were worked on with no relation to any health physical activity habit (i.e., acrosport, badminton, basketball, volleyball, soccer and athletics). The control group students also carried out two Physical Education lessons a week during the intervention period. During these lessons, contents of handball, basketball, alternative sports and traditional games were developed. However, this group did not wear physical activity activity wristbands or receive any behavior modification specific strategy developed in the intermittent group. The primary outcome variables were the students' physical activity levels, perceived autonomy support, basic psychological needs satisfaction, motivation towards physical activity, and intention to be physically active. The secondary outcome variables were the students' habitual physical activity levels. The data were collected at pre-intervention, post-intervention and after 6-week follow-up. The results of the study will provide evidence on the effectiveness of an activity wristband-based intermittent teaching unit in Physical Education on students' physical activity and its psychological mediators."

The proposed regional mental healthcare hub aims to deliver equitable, efficacious, and cost-effective AI-driven online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific online cognitive behavioural therapy (e-CBT) programs for post-secondary students in the Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington (KFL&A) region. The initiative will target a broad population of students ranging from those interested in learning more about mental health (online psychoeducation program) to those seeking additional help for their psychiatric symptoms (e-CBT program). Our research team is strongly experienced in designing effective AI-assisted online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs for various mental health conditions in diverse populations. Therefore, being as effective as in-person methods of healthcare delivery, it is hypothesized that our online interventions disseminated via a robust implementation science and community collaboration strategy will be a feasible, cost-effective, and pragmatic solution to address accessibility issues with post-secondary student mental healthcare. The proposed mental health hub will offer a comprehensive care model using a stepped-care approach. Its implementation will be guided by a rigorous approach involving seven aims divided into three phases (pre-adoption, delivery, and post-adoption phases). (1) Pre-adoption phase: will assess post-secondary students' current mental health needs, through surveys and focus groups. Aims 2 and 3 will use the findings from the surveys and focus groups to inform the development of 6-week psychoeducation and 12-week diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs. The psychoeducation program will be followed by 6-months of AI-assisted journaling exercises to monitor the student's mental health and determine whether they would benefit from stepping up their care to receive the diagnosis-specific e-CBT program. Aims 4 and 5 will determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs by comparing them to treatment as usual. Aims 6 and 7 will use the data to monitor the success and fidelity of the programs using surveys and focus groups. As such, in contrast to other initiatives that target student mental health, this will be the first to involve students and end-users in all phases, from conception to implementation.

Atrial septal defect (ASD) is one of the most common congenital heart diseases. It is typically characterized by a left-to-right shunt which results in volume overload of the right ventricle and overcirculation of the pulmonary vascularization (le Gloan et al., 2018). This may further result in arrhythmia, right ventricular dysfunction, and pulmonary hypertension (PH). Pulmonary hypertension is caused by endothelial dysfunction, remodelling of the pulmonary vascularization, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, and eventually causes shunt reversal into right-to-left (Eisenmenger's syndrome). At this point, closure of the defect is contraindicated. Small LV, although less extensively studied than dilated LV, also implies impaired LV function. Small LV means less tolerance to volume overload, which in turn impairs cardiac output and presents higher risk of heart failure and mortality (Saito et al., 2021). ASD closure in cases with severe pulmonary hypertension (PH) presents a clinical challenge. Complete closure may cause pulmonary hypertensive crisis and low cardiac output syndrome; however, if left untreated, the disease progresses, the pulmonary vascular resistance increases, which may also lead to Eisenmenger's syndrome and shunt reversal. Today, this condition is treated with fenestrated closure, either with patch or fenestrated septal occluder. The fenestration is hypothesized to provide protective effect against pulmonary hypertensive crisis because it allows blood to flow from right to left heart. The added volume into the left heart is then, hypothesized, to provide volume training for the left heart, mainly in the case of small LV. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the effect of fenestrated closure compared to non- fenestrated closure to the left ventricular size at systole and diastole."

Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is the most common endocrine malignancy. Although the majority of patients are cured by surgery, a significant number of patients develop recurrent or metastatic disease. The molecular pathogenesis of PTC is complex and involves several genetic and epigenetic alterations. The most common genetic alteration in PTC is the rearrangement of the RAS/RAF/MEK pathway. The RAS/RAF/MEK pathway is a major regulator of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. The RAS/RAF/MEK pathway is also a major regulator of mitochondrial function. Mitochondria are the main source of cellular energy and are also involved in the regulation of apoptosis, autophagy and cellular metabolism.

Neonatal encephalopathy (NE) is a major cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. The current standard of care for moderate to severe NE is whole-body hypothermia (WBH). However, there is no evidence that WBH improves outcomes in mild NE. The investigators propose to conduct a phase III prospective multi-centre open label two-arm randomised controlled trial with an internal pilot and masked outcome assessments. The investigators will compare the efficacy of WBH versus targeted normothermia (TN) in mild NE. The investigators will also assess the safety of TN in mild NE. The investigators will recruit babies born at or after 36 weeks of gestation and requiring prolonged resuscitation at birth (defined as continued resuscitation at 10 minutes after birth or 10-minute Apgar score less than 6) or those with severe birth acidosis and admitted to the neonatal unit. The babies will be screened for eligibility using a structured neurological examination performed between 1 to 6 hours after birth. Once parental consent is obtained, babies will be randomised to whole-body hypothermia or targeted normothermia within 6 hours of birth, using a web-based program. Initial assessment and randomisation (and initiation of whole-body hypothermia or targeted normothermia) will occur at the hospital of birth. The babies in both arms, who are born at a non-cooling centre (LNU or SCBU) will be then transferred to the nearest cooling centre (NICU) for continued care at earliest. Whole-body hypothermia (33.5±0.5°C) will be initiated within 6 hours of birth and continued for 72 hours using a servo-controlled cooling machine. The duration and depth of cooling will be as per the current standards for babies undergoing hypothermia with moderate or severe HIE in the NHS. After 72 hours of whole-body hypothermia at 33.5±0.5°C, the baby will be rewarmed at 0.5°C per hour to reach 36.5±0.5°C over 8 hours. Two hourly rectal temperature data"

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of pTTL, a new type of cell therapy, in patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). pTTL is a personalised cell therapy product containing autologous T cells that have been expanded in the laboratory and stimulated with neoantigens derived from the patient's own tumour. The neoantigens are unique proteins that are produced by the patient's tumour cells and are not present in normal cells. The neoantigens are recognised as foreign by the immune system and can be used to stimulate the immune system to attack the tumour.
The study is composed of 3 parts, referred to as Part I, Part II and Part III. Part I of the trial entails patient identification, recruitment and screening of trial patients. It also comprises production of pTTL, which is performed in 3 steps: Collection of tumour samples and normal samples for NGS and neoantigen selection. Production of stimulatory NAG-coupled beads raw material TC0301. Collection of starting material for pTTL manufacturing from RLN. pTTL manufacturing. The time required from collection of tumour material and RLNs up until pTTL production and administration to the patient is approximately 8 to 12 weeks. The RLN starting material is cryopreserved after initial processing, enabling flexibility in the timing of pTLL administration. Part II of the trial entails pre-conditioning and supportive care therapy, treatment with pTLL, and 26 weeks safety follow-up. Pre-conditioning contains cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, and will be administered between Day -7 and Day -5 before scheduled pTLL administration. Supportive care treatment will start on Day -9 or Day -8. pTLL administration will normally be administered on Day 1, with the option of administration on Day -3 if cell expansion kinetics during pTLL production indicates this would be preferable. Part II will end when the last treated patient has been followed for 26 weeks or earlier in case of death or patient withdrawal. Part III of the trial is a long-term follow-up initiated after completion of the initial 26 weeks safety follow-up period. Patients will participate in Part III for"

HIV testing is a critical component of the HIV prevention and treatment cascade. However, HIV testing uptake remains low in many countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Social network referrals (SNRs) are a promising strategy to increase HIV testing uptake.

Sepsis is a life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. Septic shock is a subgroup of sepsis with a mortality rate of 30-50%. The pathophysiology of septic shock is characterized by a dysregulated immune response, which is characterized by an excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a decrease in anti-inflammatory cytokines. The excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines is responsible for the development of a hyperinflammatory state, which is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and a hypercoagulable state. The hyperinflammatory state is responsible for the development of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), which is characterized by a decrease in tissue perfusion and a decrease in microcirculation. The hypercoagulable state is responsible for the development of thromboembolic events, which are associated with a worse prognosis.
The use of vasopressors is essential in the management of septic shock, but their use is associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality. The use of vasopressors is associated with an increase in myocardial oxygen consumption, which can lead to myocardial ischemia and dysfunction. The use of vasopressors is also associated with an increase in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can lead to oxidative stress and cellular damage.
The use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) has been shown to reduce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and to improve microcirculation. The use of SSRIs has also been shown to reduce the production of ROS and to improve cardiac function.
The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of paroxetine on cardiovascular function in septic patients. The study will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The study will be conducted in a single center. The study will include 40 patients with septic shock. The patients will be randomized to receive paroxetine or placebo.

Depression is a common mental disorder, with a lifetime prevalence of 15%. It is the leading cause of disability worldwide. In France, the prevalence of depression is estimated at 10.5% of the population. Depression is a major public health problem, with a high cost for the health system and society. The treatment of depression is based on antidepressant medication and psychotherapy. However, the treatment of depression is often incomplete, with a high rate of non-adherence to treatment. The reasons for this non-adherence are complex and multifactorial. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a tele-education programme on the maintenance of antidepressant treatment in patients with a moderate depressive episode in primary care.
The study is a single-centered randomised controlled trial. The study population will be patients with a moderate depressive episode in primary care, who have been prescribed an antidepressant. The study will be conducted in the DSPP of the University Hospital of Tours.
The study will be conducted in two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The experimental group will receive a tele-education programme on depression in 5 individual remote sessions. The control group will receive usual care from their GP.
The primary endpoint will be measured by the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 6 months after inclusion in the study. This maintenance rate will be measured using healthcare reimbursement data to reconstruct exposure to antidepressant medication at 6 months following inclusion in the study.
The secondary endpoints will be measured by the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 3 months after inclusion in the study, the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 6 months after inclusion in the study, the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 12 months after inclusion in the study, the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 18 months after inclusion in the study, the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 24 months after inclusion in the study, the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 30 months after inclusion in the study, the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant medication at 36 months after inclusion in the study, the rate of maintenance on continuous antidepressant"

Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disorder of the brain that causes excessive daytime sleepiness and sleep disruption. It is estimated that 1 in 2000 people are affected by narcolepsy. The condition is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, sleep fragmentation and cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone). The cause of narcolepsy is unknown but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. The most common form of narcolepsy is narcolepsy type 1, which is caused by a deficiency of a brain chemical called hypocretin. The only treatment for narcolepsy is medication, which can help to reduce symptoms but does not cure the condition.
The investigators aim to develop a new way of diagnosing narcolepsy using a device called the Dreem headband. The headband is a wearable device that can be used at home to monitor brain activity and sleep patterns. The investigators will compare the results of the headband to the results of a standard diagnostic test for narcolepsy, which involves spending a night in hospital and having a series of sleep tests.
The investigators will also use the headband to monitor the effects of medication on narcolepsy symptoms. The investigators will ask participants to wear the headband for 7 days and take their medication as normal. The investigators will then analyse the data from the headband to see how the medication affects their symptoms.
The investigators hope that the headband will provide a more convenient and accurate way of diagnosing narcolepsy and monitoring its treatment."

Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a genetic disorder that results from a deficiency of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). PKU is characterized by elevated blood levels of phenylalanine (Phe) and its toxic metabolites. PKU is treated by a low-Phe diet, but this diet is difficult to follow and is associated with poor quality of life. Gene therapy is a promising approach to treat PKU by providing a functional copy of the PAH gene. This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a gene therapy product called SAR444836. SAR444836 is a genetically engineered virus called an adeno-associated virus (AAV). The AAV has been modified to carry a functional copy of the PAH gene. SAR444836 will be injected into the bloodstream through a vein. The goal of this study is to see if SAR444836 can reduce the amount of Phe in the blood and improve the quality of life for people with PKU.
The study will be conducted in two parts. In the first part, the safety of SAR444836 will be evaluated in a small group of people with PKU. In the second part, the effectiveness of SAR444836 will be evaluated in a larger group of people with PKU.
In the first part of the study, 3 participants with PKU will receive a single dose of SAR444836. The dose will be gradually increased to determine the maximum tolerated dose. The participants will be monitored for any side effects of the treatment.
In the second part of the study, 12 participants with PKU will receive a single dose of SAR444836. The participants will be monitored for any side effects of the treatment. The participants will also be followed for 96 weeks to see if the treatment reduces the amount of Phe in the blood."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP.
The study will be conducted in two phases:
Phase 1: The first phase will be a randomized controlled study with pre and post-intervention assessment. The participants will be recruited from students. Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention group consisting of an active break (n = 25) or the control group (n = 25). The group with an active break with postural change from sitting to standing will be recommended to take an active break for every 30 minutes of sitting. The primary outcome will be average pain intensity (Visual Analogue Scale, VAS), disability measured using the Oswestry Disability Index and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting (Borg scale) and The Global Perceived Effect (7-point Likert scale). Secondary outcome will Post-Intervention Questionnaire (5-item self-completed questionnaire).
The second phase will be a qualitative study with semi-structured interviews. The participants will be recruited from the participants of the first phase.

The vaginal microbiota has a significant bearing on a woman's mental and physical health at every stage of life. A balanced microflora of the vaginal environment (eubiosis) consists of a predominant presence of lactic acid bacteria. Lactobacilli ensure the maintenance of an acidic pH that effectively makes the environment inhospitable to pathogens by preventing infection and protecting the genital tract. At the end of the reproductive period, the reduction of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, results in a decrease in the lactobacillus component with consequent depletion of the vaginal microbiota and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Tocopherol (vitamin E) is an essential human nutrient found mainly in oily fruits. It is a fat-soluble molecule with high antioxidant power. Topically administered, it not only plays a key role in protecting epithelial cell membranes from oxidative damage but is also able to modulate bacterial growth by contributing to pH acidification. The latter feature, in the vaginal canal, creates a favorable environment for the lactobacilli flora, positively affecting the microbial population and thus contributing to the prevention of all those problems related to increased vaginal sensitivity to pathogens during menopause. In addition, recent data show that vitamin E can counteract the production of biofilm produced by certain pathogens, which has detrimental effects on the homeostasis of the vaginal environment. The period of observation is from January 1st, 2020 to December, 31st, 2022, while the Data Collection period will be from June, 30th, 2023 to July, 31st, 2023."
