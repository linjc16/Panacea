29,"This clinical trial investigates the effectiveness of Action Observation Therapy (AOT) in improving cognitive status, upper limb function, activities of daily living (ADL), gait, and balance among patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). MCI is a precursor to dementia and can impact motor functions and increase the risk of falls. AOT, which activates the brain's mirror neuron system by having individuals observe and then imitate motor actions, has shown promise in various settings but has not been extensively studied in MCI patients.

The study's hypothesis is that AOT will be effective for MCI patients, especially when they observe actions performed by other MCI patients rather than therapists. The main objective is to compare the effectiveness of AOT across three groups: patients observing therapists, patients observing non-cognitively impaired individuals, and a control group receiving standard treatment. Secondary objectives include assessing AOT's benefits on upper limb functionality, ADL, balance, cognitive status, and gait.

The trial is open to individuals aged 65 to 100 years with MCI (MoCA score <26), capable of walking without severe pain and without conditions affecting their upper limbs. The study excludes cognitively intact individuals and those with other neurological or musculoskeletal pathologies, upper limb disorders, or communication difficulties.

The study design is randomized and open-label, with a parallel assignment intervention model. There are three participant groups: one receiving therapist-led AOT, one involving peer learning from cognitively intact individuals, and a control group. The intervention lasts for five weeks, with sessions three times per week for 20-30 minutes, focusing on strengthening, balance, and functional exercises.

Primary outcomes measured include changes in cognitive impairment (MoCA), ADL (Barthel index), functionality (Fugl-Meyer scale), upper limb dexterity (Box and Block test), balance (Berg Balance Scale), and gait (10 Meters Walking Test) before and after the intervention.

31,"This clinical trial investigates the therapeutic efficacy of the Erbium:YAG (Er:YAG) laser in treating postpartum patients with episiotomy scars. Episiotomy, a surgical incision made during childbirth, often results in painful, fibrotic scars that can lead to sexual dysfunction, chronic pain, and long-term scarring. About 40% of patients experience persistent dyspareunia after six months.

The study aims to determine if the Er:YAG laser can alleviate vulvar pain and improve scar tissue healing. The laser is believed to be safe and non-invasive, promoting collagen shrinkage, neocollagenesis, elastogenesis, and neoangiogenesis in the vaginal wall, which may enhance tissue healing and reduce pain.

The trial is a randomized, sham-controlled, prospective study with two arms: an experimental group receiving the actual Er:YAG laser treatment and a sham comparator group receiving a placebo treatment. Adult female participants, 18 years or older, who have given birth via episiotomy within the last six months and experience vulvar pain and dyspareunia, are eligible. Those with certain conditions causing vulvar pain or connective tissue diseases are excluded.

Participants in the experimental group will receive three sessions of Er:YAG laser treatment at 15-21 day intervals, using specific handpieces and parameters, with pain relief measures applied. The sham group will undergo the same procedure with a sham handpiece.

85,"Title: Important Correlation Between Anxiety and Reflux Symptoms in Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

Overview: This prospective observational cohort study aims to explore the relationship between anxiety, depression, and the severity of reflux symptoms in patients with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD). The study investigates the impact of psychosocial factors on the perception of GERD symptoms, with a focus on anxiety and depression levels in patients with varying severity of esophageal acid exposure, as measured by the DeMeester score (DMS).

Participants: The study included patients presenting with reflux symptoms at the University Hospital of Cologne, who underwent Upper GI Endoscopy, High-Resolution Manometry, and pH-Impedance testing and completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. Patients were excluded if they lacked knowledge of the German language, did not complete the HADS questionnaire, or did not finish all diagnostic testing.

Methods: The investigation was conducted in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethics Committee of the University of Cologne. Patients provided online informed consent. The study did not register in any study register. The HADS questionnaire was used to assess anxiety (HADS-A) and depression (HADS-D) with a cutoff score of >8 indicating anxiety or depression. The level of anxiety and depression was categorized as mild, moderate, or severe based on HADS scores. The DMS was calculated using 24-hour pH impedance testing, with scores labeled as negative (physiological) or positive (pathological), and further categorized into mild, moderate, or severe.

Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure was the level of anxiety and depression as evaluated by the HADS questionnaire during the diagnostic workup of patients with GERD.

Results: The study established that GERD patients have higher incidences of anxiety, depression, and sleep disturbances compared to non-GERD individuals. Women and patients with a longer duration of GERD showed higher levels of anxiety and depression. Patients with NERD displayed an increased risk for anxiety compared to those with ERD. Higher HADS-A scores were reported in patients with reflux symptoms, indicating a significant association between psychosocial disorders and GERD.

Conclusion: The study confirms a significant correlation between anxiety, depression, and the severity of reflux symptoms in GERD patients, suggesting that psychosocial factors greatly influence the perception and reporting of GERD symptoms."

98,"The clinical trial titled ""Sodium Valproate Improves Clinical Outcomes in Patients With Acute Ischemic Stroke: a Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial"" aims to explore the effectiveness of sodium valproate as a neuroprotective agent in patients with acute ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study tests if sodium valproate can improve functional outcomes post-stroke by potentially increasing anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils to reduce neuroinflammation.

Eligible participants are those between 18 and 75 years old, admitted within 24 hours of stroke onset, diagnosed via CT or MRI, and not suitable for thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy. Exclusion criteria include a history of severe cardiovascular, hepatic, hematologic, or neurological conditions, among others.

The study design is a randomized, double-masked, parallel assignment with three groups: a low-dose sodium valproate group (10mg/kg), a high-dose group (20mg/kg), and a placebo group administered normal saline, all given intravenously for 3 consecutive days alongside conventional stroke treatment.

Primary outcomes will be measured by the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score≤2) at 90 days. Secondary outcomes include detailed mRS score distributions at 30 and 90 days, NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at 3 and 7 days, changes in lesion volume from baseline to day 7, and length of hospital stay.

The study is conducted by Centre Hospitalier Valida and focuses on acute ischemic stroke patients, assessing the impact of sodium valproate on clinical outcomes."
99,"The clinical trial aims to assess whether a virtual coach provides a better solution for preoperative weight reduction in patients with obesity and ventral hernia compared to standard preoperative weight loss tools. This non-randomized, parallel assignment, open-label study involves two groups: an experimental group using a MyChart-enabled virtual weight loss coach and an active comparator group using standard weight loss methods. Participants are adults aged 18 to 90 with a BMI of 30 or above and diagnosed with obesity, who are candidates for elective ventral hernia repair but are not pregnant, do not have severe mental disorders, are not on weight-affecting psychiatric medications, have no history of substance abuse, and are not on long-term steroids.

The study's primary outcome measure is the average net amount of weight loss per group over 6 months. Secondary outcomes include the number of interactions with the virtual coach, quality of life as measured by the Hernia Related Quality of Life Survey (HerQLes), and satisfaction with the virtual coach, all assessed over a 6-month period. The study accepts both male and female participants and includes healthy volunteers."

103,"The clinical trial, titled ""Feasibility of Integrating Homeopathic Approach in a Comprehensive Cancer Center,"" aims to assess the viability of incorporating homeopathy into cancer care at the Rambam Health Campus. The study responds to the rising demand for complementary and integrative medicine (CIM) in oncology and seeks to determine if homeopathy can be an effective supportive treatment for improving quality of life and symptom control in cancer patients.

Homeopathy is a debated CIM modality, known for its unique patient interviews and highly diluted substances. Some studies suggest it may improve quality of life and reduce fatigue without side effects or interfering with conventional treatments. This observational study will investigate patient concerns, acceptance, and self-administration of homeopathic remedies, as well as collect retrospective subjective data via validated questionnaires (MYCaW, Distress Thermometer, and ESAS-R).

Participants must be adults who can understand Hebrew, have an ECOG performance status of 0-2, and be treated at Rambam's Division of Oncology. Those with severe cognitive impairments, psychosis, or unstable medical conditions are excluded.

The study design includes a single arm focused on the feasibility of the supportive approach, with primary outcome measures being the feasibility based on questionnaires and the level of distress as assessed by the Distress Thermometer, both evaluated within 6-12 weeks.

Overall, the trial explores the integration of homeopathy in supportive cancer care, aiming to enhance patient well-being and potentially extend survival times."
