The primary outcome measures were the number of patients requiring redo surgery, mortality, and complications. The secondary outcome measures were hospital length of stay and postoperative length of stay. The study found that higher NLR and lower ALC were associated with increased risk of redo surgery, mortality, and complications. Higher TLR was associated with increased risk of complications. These findings suggest that NLR, ALC, and TLR may be useful in predicting the outcomes of ToF primary repair."

Participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which will receive three text messages per week with evidence-based information on healthy behaviors during pregnancy, or the control group, which will receive one text message per week with general information about pregnancy. The primary outcome measures will include changes in weight during pregnancy, attendance at prenatal care visits, and health literacy at the end of pregnancy. Secondary outcome measures will include changes in fear of childbirth, depression, anxiety, and use of tobacco, vaping, alcohol, or cannabis during pregnancy. The study will also assess the incremental costs per incidence of suboptimal weight gain and inadequate prenatal care avoided."
