0,"This is a study investigating the role of psychological factors such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences in women with chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia. The study aims to identify specific clusters of these psychological variables that may characterize or differentiate between these chronic pain conditions, which are considered subtypes of nociplastic pain. The study involves administering a battery of self-report questionnaires to four groups of women: those diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, vulvodynia, and a control group without chronic pain conditions. The primary outcomes measured include central sensitivity, traumatic experiences, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, and environmental sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include psychological symptoms, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction and functioning, and genito-pelvic pain. The study hypothesizes that specific psychological factor clusters involving high levels of traumatic events, central sensitization, and certain personality traits and defense mechanisms will characterize each of the chronic pain groups compared to controls."
1,"This clinical trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of two different mattress types in preventing pressure ulcers in bedridden patients. The study had a randomized, parallel-group design with triple masking.

Participants were adults without pressure ulcers at admission, with a low risk rating on the Braden Scale, a BMI not exceeding 30, and provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria included changing beds within 10 days, patient referral, or discharge.

12,"This clinical trial aims to investigate the effects of acute and chronic stress on Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) and its neural correlates in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and smokers, as well as the relationship between PIT and cognitive control abilities. The study consists of three experiments:

Experiment 1 assesses a general PIT task involving instrumental learning, Pavlovian conditioning with monetary and alcohol-related cues, and a transfer phase where these cues influence instrumental behavior. The effects of acute stress (induced by the Trier Social Stress Test) and chronic stress (measured by questionnaires and hair cortisol) on PIT will be examined. The hypothesis is that stress will increase PIT effects for monetary cues and decrease inhibitory effects of alcohol cues, with neural correlates in the amygdala and ventral striatum. Additionally, it is hypothesized that stronger PIT effects for monetary cues and weaker inhibitory effects for alcohol cues after stress will predict higher subsequent alcohol intake.

Experiment 2 investigates the relationship between PIT effects and cognitive control abilities (interference control and response inhibition) in AUD and non-"

963,"This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of workshops and exchange groups for laryngectomized patients in improving their quality of life. The study will include two groups: an exchange group and a control group. The exchange group will participate in four sessions over four months, covering topics such as understanding their body image and coping with the consequences of laryngectomy. The control group will not attend the sessions but will complete quality of life questionnaires at the beginning and end of the four-month period.
