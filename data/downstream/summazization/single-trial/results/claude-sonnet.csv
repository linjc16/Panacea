0,"This is a study investigating the role of psychological factors such as personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences in women with chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia. The study aims to identify specific clusters of these psychological variables that may characterize or differentiate between these chronic pain conditions, which are considered subtypes of nociplastic pain. The study involves administering a battery of self-report questionnaires to four groups of women: those diagnosed with fibromyalgia, chronic migraine, vulvodynia, and a control group without chronic pain conditions. The primary outcomes measured include central sensitivity, traumatic experiences, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, and environmental sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include psychological symptoms, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction and functioning, and genito-pelvic pain. The study hypothesizes that specific psychological factor clusters involving high levels of traumatic events, central sensitization, and certain personality traits and defense mechanisms will characterize each of the chronic pain groups compared to controls."
1,"This clinical trial aimed to compare the effectiveness of two different mattress types in preventing pressure ulcers in bedridden patients. The study had a randomized, parallel-group design with triple masking.

Participants were adults without pressure ulcers at admission, with a low risk rating on the Braden Scale, a BMI not exceeding 30, and provided informed consent. Exclusion criteria included changing beds within 10 days, patient referral, or discharge.

12,"This clinical trial aims to investigate the effects of acute and chronic stress on Pavlovian-to-Instrumental Transfer (PIT) and its neural correlates in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) and smokers, as well as the relationship between PIT and cognitive control abilities. The study consists of three experiments:

Experiment 1 assesses a general PIT task involving instrumental learning, Pavlovian conditioning with monetary and alcohol-related cues, and a transfer phase where these cues influence instrumental behavior. The effects of acute stress (induced by the Trier Social Stress Test) and chronic stress (measured by questionnaires and hair cortisol) on PIT will be examined. The hypothesis is that stress will increase PIT effects for monetary cues and decrease inhibitory effects of alcohol cues, with neural correlates in the amygdala and ventral striatum. Additionally, it is hypothesized that stronger PIT effects for monetary cues and weaker inhibitory effects for alcohol cues after stress will predict higher subsequent alcohol intake.

Experiment 2 investigates the relationship between PIT effects and cognitive control abilities (interference control and response inhibition) in AUD and non-"

The study included 54 patients, randomly divided into two groups: the ESPB group (n=27) and the control group (n=27). Both groups underwent general anesthesia, and the ESPB group received a bilateral sacral ESPB with 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine at the end of the surgery before waking up. The control group did not receive any block. All patients were given patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) devices, and their pain scores (using the Visual Analog Scale), total opioid consumption, incidence of nausea/vomiting, and patient satisfaction were assessed for 24 hours postoperatively. The primary outcomes were patient pain scores and total opioid consumption, while secondary outcomes included nausea/vomiting and patient satisfaction."
38,"This clinical trial aims to develop and validate a non-invasive, multimodal ultrasound-based imaging biomarker for myofascial pain, a contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). The study will investigate the echogenicity of trigger points, dynamic spatial-temporal tissue deformation in the thoracolumbar fascia and multifidus muscle, and viscoelastic properties of the fascia and muscles using ultrasound shear wave elastography. The study will recruit healthy individuals (n=40) and individuals with cLBP (n=120) aged 20-70 years. Participants will be classified into four groups: healthy normals, myofascial pain (MP) without trigger points, MP with latent trigger points, and MP with active trigger points. The primary outcome measure is the diagnosis of one of these four MP-related categories based on standardized clinical examinations. The secondary outcome measure is the presence of substantial MP determined by the number of active trigger points and pressure pain threshold. The study aims to integrate these measurements using deep learning to develop a predictive biomarker for MP and validate its ability to classify myofascial components of pain and response"

49,"This clinical trial aims to develop and validate a new metabolic imaging approach called activity MRI (aMRI) for evaluating neurological diseases like gliomas (brain tumors). The primary objective is to characterize how the aMRI parameter káµ¢â‚’*V differs between tumor and normal brain regions, and compare it with the standard metabolic imaging technique, 18F-FDG PET. Patients with gliomas will receive an intravenous injection of 18F-FDG, followed by simultaneous MRI and PET scanning after 60 minutes. During the scanning, they will also receive an intravenous contrast agent (gadoterate meglumine) for post-contrast MRI. The study will measure the mean values of káµ¢â‚’*V in the entire tumor region, tumor periphery, tumor core, and normal brain regions, and evaluate their correlation with 18F-FDG PET standardized uptake values (SUVmax). The secondary objectives include assessing the utility of aMRI in differentiating the metabolically active tumor periphery from the necrotic core, and characterizing káµ¢â‚’"
