Primary Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.
Secondary Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of partial breast irradiation in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.
Partial breast irradiation is a minimally invasive form of breast cancer treatment that involves the use of radiation to treat early-stage breast cancer.
Early-stage breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that is detected at an early stage and is considered to be highly treatable with radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy involves the use of high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.
Partial breast irradiation is a minimally invasive form of breast cancer treatment that involves the use of radiation to treat early-stage breast cancer and is considered to be highly effective in shrinking tumors.
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the breast tissue. It may also affect nearby lymph nodes and other parts of the body, including the lungs and liver.
Early-stage breast cancer is considered to be highly treatable with radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy involves the use of high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.
Partial breast irradiation involves the use of radiation to treat early-stage breast cancer and may also be used to treat cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes.
Early-stage breast cancer is considered to be highly treatable with radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy may also be used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or surgery, depending on the individual case.

Primary Outcome: [Patient #1]'s length of stay in the ICU will be tracked across 12 months following hospital admission with any elevated eCART score. Because death is biased toward fewer ICU-free days and is a competing outcome, patients who die prior to day 30 are assigned with 0 ventilator-free days.
Secondary Outcome: [Patient #2]'s length of stay in the ICU will be tracked across 12 months following hospital admission with any elevated eCART score.

What is the study measuring?
-----------------
| MMT: Manual Muscle Testing (MMT) is a simple and brief test of muscular strength or endurance that requires the application of resistance against the muscle. This technique includes assessing major muscles from the upper and lower limbs opposing the therapist's force and grading the patient's muscle strength on a 0 to 5 scale | Baseline and Follow-up evaluation (through study completion, an average of 6 weeks) | 
| EQ-5D: Euro-Quality of Life-5 Dimension (0-15, the higher the more depressive) Assessment of the length beyond the tip of the toes with the hand stretched out in a seated forward bending position, and measure the time to return to the left and right rear corners twice in 0.1 second units | Baseline and Follow-up evaluation (through study completion, an average of 6 weeks) |

Pembrolizumab Monotherapy for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
Pembrolizumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets PD-L1, a protein that is expressed on the surface of cancer cells. Pembrolizumab blocks the interaction of PD-L1 with its receptor on cancer cells, leading to cancer cell death. Pembrolizumab is administered every 3 weeks, during which patients are monitored for survival.
Pembrolizumab is approved for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have already tried chemotherapy.
Advanced non-small cell lung cancer is a type of lung cancer that is more advanced than others. It means that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and is harder to treat.
Pembrolizumab is the first drug in a new class of medicines called immunotherapies. Immunotherapies work by targeting proteins on the surface of cancer cells that help them grow and divide.
Pembrolizumab is the first drug in a new class of medicines called checkpoint inhibitors.

Prognostic awareness in patients with advanced cancer is an important aspect of palliative care. It has been shown that patients with advanced cancer have a poorer prognosis and are less likely to receive palliative goals of care (Dudgeon et al, 2007). It is essential that patients with advanced cancer are made fully aware of their prognostic situation in order to allow them the opportunity to discuss their preferences and values in relation to their care. This is known to be an important aspect of enhanced supportive care.

Prognostic awareness in patients with advanced cancer is known to be associated with better quality of life (Dudgeon et al, 2007). It has been shown that patients with a higher level of prognostic awareness have a better quality of life and are more likely to receive palliative goals of care.

Prognostic awareness in patients with advanced cancer is known to be associated with the patient's trust in medical professionals and their preferred mode of communication (Dudgeon et al, 2007). It has been shown that patients with a higher level of prognostic awareness are more likely to receive palliative goals of care and are less likely to experience anxiety.

Prognostic awareness in patients with advanced cancer is known to be associated with the patient's trust in medical professionals and their preferred mode of communication (Dudgeon et al, 2007).

Integrated Resistance Training
Integrated training is a combination of isolated and integrated exercises aimed at developing overall body strength and conditioning. Isolated training focuses on developing one muscle group at a time, while integrated training develops the entire body. Isolated training is considered more effective for developing strength and power, while integrated training is thought to be better for developing overall conditioning.
Proponents of integrated training believe that isolated exercises are more effective for developing strength and power, while proponents of integrated training believe that isolated exercises are more effective for developing muscle mass.
Integrated training is thought to be more effective for developing strength and power, while isolated training is thought to be more effective for developing muscle mass.
Proponents of isolated training believe that developing overall body strength and conditioning is more effective than developing strength in one area. Proponents of integrated training believe that developing strength and power in all muscles is more effective than developing strength in one area.
Integrated training focuses on developing all muscles evenly, while isolated training is thought to develop strength in one area more effectively. Proponents of integrated training believe that developing strength and power in all muscles is more effective than developing strength in one area.

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a neuromotor disorder that affects the developing child. It is a common condition that requires comprehensive care to ensure the affected child attains the maximum potential. Children with cerebral palsy often experience motor impairments that can affect their ability to participate in daily activities and impact their quality of life. These impairments can range from mild to severe and can affect the ability to walk, sit, stand, and perform fine motor skills. They might also experience difficulties with oral intake, bowel and bladder control, and social interaction. Cerebral palsy can also affect the child’s ability to perform gross motor functions such as running, jumping, and climbing. In addition, children with cerebral palsy might experience skeletal abnormalities, such as scoliosis or foot deformities. These issues can lead to further health complications, such as respiratory problems or the need for assistive devices, and should be monitored closely. It is important to note that cerebral palsy can also impact a child’s ability to perform activities of daily living, leading to reduced independence, limited mobility, and social interaction. In the context of these issues, the child might experience further health complications, such as nutritional imbalances, which can lead to reduced weight and quality of life. These health issues can be further explored in future research."

Carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive, catheter-based procedure used to treat carotid artery stenosis. This procedure involves the placement of a small, mesh-covered stent into the carotid artery. The stent is designed to help keep the artery open, allowing blood to flow more easily.
Carotid artery stenosis is a narrowing of the carotid artery, which can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the brain. This can cause symptoms such as chest pain, headaches, dizziness, and arm pain. Carotid artery stenting is a treatment option for people who have severe cases of carotid artery stenosis.
The stent used in this procedure is a mesh tube, which helps to keep the carotid artery open. This mesh tube is a small, expandable tube that is placed inside the carotid artery. The stent is designed to help keep the artery open, allowing blood to flow more easily.
People who have severe cases of carotid artery stenosis may experience symptoms such as chest pain, headaches, dizziness, and arm pain. These symptoms can be caused by a decrease in blood flow to the brain. Carotid artery stenting is a minimally invasive procedure that can help relieve these symptoms and improve blood flow to the brain.

Role of Myeloid-Derived Suppressor Cells and Cancer Stem Cells in Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)
-----------------
These cells play a key role in the immune response to cancer. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells are a type of white blood cell that reside in the tumor microenvironment and critical for the activation of immune responses. These cells are able to inhibit the growth and spread of cancer cells by producing a protein called SCF. In addition, myeloid-derived suppressor cells can inhibit the activation of cancer stem cells. These cells are able to inhibit the growth and spread of cancer by producing a protein called CD73. The mechanism behind this is that myeloid-derived suppressor cells compete with cancer stem cells for the same soluble factors. This competition leads to the development of a tumor microenvironment that is rich in nutrients and able to sustain the growth of cancer cells.
Cancer is a disease caused by abnormal cells that are able to invade and spread to other parts of the body. Cancer stem cells are able to invade other organs and tissues because they have the ability to produce their own blood supply. These cancer cells are able to produce their own growth factors and are therefore able to sustain their own growth and spread. The immune system is able to detect these cancer cells and respond by producing proteins called cytokines. These cytokines are able to activate the immune response and critical for the destruction of cancer cells.

This is a summary of the key issues relating to the use of CFTR modulators in the treatment of cystic fibrosis.
Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disorder which affects the respiratory, digestive and reproductive systems. It is caused by a defect in the CFTR gene which leads to a reduction in the production of the protein that controls the movement of salt and water in the body.
CFTR modulators are drugs which can help to increase the production of the protein, and improve the function of the digestive and reproductive systems. They work by stimulating the CFTR gene, and have been shown to improve lung function and reduce inflammation in people with cystic fibrosis.
There are two CFTR modulators which have been licensed for use in the UK - ivacaftor and tezacaftor. They act in a similar way, but there is currently no evidence to suggest that one is more effective than the other. Both are administered by injection into the vein, and are usually given every four to six weeks.
CFTR modulators have been shown to improve lung function and reduce inflammation in people with cystic fibrosis. They have also been shown to have other benefits, such as improved BMI and reduced rate of hospitalisation.
People with cystic fibrosis may have other medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease or liver disease. It is important to discuss any other medical conditions with a doctor before starting treatment with CFTR modulators.
There is currently no evidence to suggest that CFTR modulators increase the life expectancy of people with cystic fibrosis, but they have been shown to improve quality of life and reduce the need for hospitalisation.
CFTR modulators are not a cure for cystic fibrosis, and it is important to note that they do not correct the genetic defect which causes the condition.
There is currently no evidence to suggest that CFTR modulators are safe for use in children, but they have been shown to be generally well tolerated in adults.
It is important to note that CFTR modulators are not a treatment for cystic fibrosis, and that they should only be used in addition to the ongoing medical treatment which is required for people with the condition."
