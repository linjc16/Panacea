Primary Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of ultra-hypofractionated radiotherapy in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.
Secondary Purpose: To assess the safety and efficacy of partial breast irradiation in the treatment of early-stage breast cancer.
Partial breast irradiation is a minimally invasive form of breast cancer treatment that involves the use of radiation to treat early-stage breast cancer.
Early-stage breast cancer is a type of breast cancer that is detected at an early stage and is considered to be highly treatable with radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy involves the use of high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.
Partial breast irradiation is a minimally invasive form of breast cancer treatment that involves the use of radiation to treat early-stage breast cancer and is considered to be highly effective in shrinking tumors.
Breast cancer is a type of cancer that begins in the breast tissue. It may also affect nearby lymph nodes and other parts of the body, including the lungs and liver.
Early-stage breast cancer is considered to be highly treatable with radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy involves the use of high-energy X-rays to kill cancer cells and shrink tumors.
Partial breast irradiation involves the use of radiation to treat early-stage breast cancer and may also be used to treat cancer that has spread to nearby lymph nodes.
Early-stage breast cancer is considered to be highly treatable with radiation therapy.
Radiation therapy may also be used in combination with other treatments, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or surgery, depending on the individual case.
