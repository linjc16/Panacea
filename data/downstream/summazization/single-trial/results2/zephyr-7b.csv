Detailed Description
-----------------
The objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults. Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.

The study, titled ""Pilot Study for the Evaluation of Algorithms for the Detection of Subcutaneous Insulin Pump Malfunctions in Subjects With Type 1 Diabetes,"" aims to test new algorithms for detecting pump and infusion set malfunctions that result in reduced or interrupted insulin delivery in individuals with Type 1 diabetes using automated insulin delivery (AID) systems, also known as artificial pancreas. The study consists of three phases: Phase 1 involves collecting free-living data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals impact the patient's glucose levels. Phase 2 involves inducing hyperglycemia during a clinic visit by temporarily suspending insulin infusion to simulate a pump malfunction, which is closely monitored under medical supervision. Phase 3 involves a retrospective analysis of the collected data to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detecting pump malfunctions. The study's primary outcome measure is sensitivity, which is defined as the fraction of correctly detected insulin suspensions in the population, during the intervention, when insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump fault. The uniqueness of this dataset lies in the controlled induction of malfunction, achieved by disconnecting the insulin pump and monitoring the resulting hyperglycemic episode. The study's eligibility criteria include individuals aged 18 to 70 years with Type 1 diabetes, treated with AID for at least three months, using carbohydrate counting to calculate meal bolus, and experiencing mild hypothyroidism or high cholesterol. The study's primary purpose is supportive care, and the intervention involves simulating an insulin pump failure by suspending insulin infusion during the inpatient simulation of pump malfunctions to monitor the resulting hyperglycemia. The secondary outcome measure is false positive per day, which is the number of false alarms normalized by the number of days of monitoring during the outpatient data collection."

Can you provide a brief overview of the ICEBERG trial and the rationale behind choosing to measure C-reactive protein as a biomarker in relation to cardiovascular events?
Generate according to: Rationale: The concept that chronic inflammation is intimately linked with the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is not new and there is accumulating data that inflammatory markers are associated with future cardiovascular events in apparently stable patients after MI.1 C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of inflammation which is easily measured in the clinical setting. However there are no data available on its potential prognostic value and possible role in guiding pharmacological therapy after MI. These points form the rationale behind choosing to measure CRP as a biomarker in relation to cardiovascular events and possible roles for treatment strategies.
Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors, such as clopidogrel and ticlopidine are commonly used in cardiology and haematology. In the case of clopidogrel, a large body of evidence demonstrates that it is an effective anti-platelet drug. However the extent of benefit conferred by this drug is uncertain and there is considerable inter-individual variation in response which results in excess bleeding in some cases. This study aims to increase our understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for these phenomena.
Aim: The ICEBERG study aims to recruit 10,500 patients with a recent acute coronary syndrom (ACS) or who have had a coronary intervention. All patients will be randomised to either standard of care, i.e. Clopidogrel 75mg daily, or an intensive strategy, i.e. Twice daily dosing, for 9 months. The effect of this strategy will be monitored with regard to cardiovascular events, bleeding events and mortality. This will be done in order to determine whether or not intensification of anti-platelet therapy may be an effective strategy in order to optimise the net clinical benefit, or whether or not such an approach may in fact lead to excess bleeding which would result in net harm, i.e. Confer additional fatal and non-fatal bleeding events relative to the cardiovascular benefits conferred. Measures will also be undertaken with regard to CRP levels in order to determine whether or not such patients have elevated levels of CRP, and whether or not this is associated with excess cardiovascular events.

The study aims to improve the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas, a rare type of cancer, by developing an artificial intelligence algorithm using routine data and quantitative MRI images. The algorithm will distinguish between benign and malignant soft tissue masses, as current methods of diagnosis using imaging can be difficult due to similarities between the two. Patients who undergo MRI for sarcoma diagnosis will be asked to participate, with extra MRI images being taken to provide additional information for the algorithm. The study will also test the reliability of the measurements for a select group of participants. The study's primary outcome measure is the accuracy of the AI algorithm in distinguishing between benign and malignant soft tissue lesions, while the secondary outcome measure is the algorithm's accuracy in classifying malignant lesions into their pathological grade. Keywords for the study include MRI, diffusions weighted imaging, radiomics, deep learning, machine learning, and quantitative MRI. Participants must have a soft tissue mass and undergo MRI as part of their standard care. The study excludes participants with a history of surgery for the mass or those with contraindications to MRI. The overall goal of the study is to develop a more accurate and efficient diagnostic method for soft tissue sarcomas."

Can you provide a brief summary of the key findings or results from the OPTI-DOSE trial mentioned in the text? Answer according to: OPTI - DOSE: Optimal Dosing of Oral Anticancer Drugs in Older Adults

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Information about the benefits and side effects of treatments for cancer is mainly derived from studies with younger patients. It is known that elderly patients experience more side effects from treatments, which can lead to a worse quality of life. The study hypothesis is that a lower starting dose of anticancer tablet treatments can lead to better treatment tolerability in older patients, while the benefits of treatment can be the same. The trial population consists of 30 patients aged 65 years or older, who are starting treatment with one of these anti cancer tablet treatments: pazopanib, olaparib, lenvatinib, sunitinib or palbociclib. This is a randomized study with 1:1 randomisation, stratified by type of anti-cancer treatment. The control group (half of the participants) will be treated with the standard-of-care, that means with the recommended starting dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose can be adjusted (lowered) if this is necessary, for example because of side effects, based on the judgment of the treating physician. The interventional group (half of the participants) will start with the lowest dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose will be increased every two weeks in case of good tolerability. Results of this pilot study will be used to inform the design of the larger randomised phase 2 trial, for example the primary endpoint, the amount of investigations and the size of the study population. Study visits are planned every 2 weeks for a total study duration of 12 weeks, the time point for analysis of the primary endpoint. Blood samples for PK analysis are collected every 2 weeks. A baseline blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic analysis.

Can you provide a brief overview of the research study discussed in the clinical study protocol?
Generate according to: The protocol focuses on the presentation of a clinical study entitled ""Improving the Implementation and Sustainment of Alcohol and Substance Use Screening and Brief Interventions in Family Planning Settings Through Telemedicine and Telehealth: A Type III Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Design (TS-EIH)"", which has been registered in ClinicalTrials.gov under the unique identifier NCT0392314.
The study is a multi-site project that will be conducted in four community health centers throughout Pennsylvania serving populations of primarily African American and Latino women. Alcohol and other drug use are known to compound risks associated with unintended pregnancies, subfertility, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and their consequences for maternal and child health. Current guidelines recommend that all adults seeking health care services receive screening and brief interventions for these issues. However, less than 5% of family planning settings currently provide screening and brief intervention services for alcohol and drugs.

This study will establish and evaluate the implementation of comprehensive alcohol and substance use screening and brief interventions for women and men in family planning settings, and will determine an empirically derived strategy for sustainment. To achieve this, the project draws on both effectiveness and implementation science, with a study design consistent with the Type III Effectiveness-Implementation Hybrid Design, which aims to develop and test contextualized models that integrate evidence-based practices in real world settings, and to determine which implementation strategies are best suited to support and maintain adoption of those practices. The project combines (1) a rigorous effectiveness study, which involves a 1:1:1 dextrally randomized cluster design with 36 clinics in a 12-month period to compare usual care (UC) to enhanced usual care (EUC: SBIRT) to SBIRT delivered by telehealth through the TFI System, and (2) an implementation science study which employs a mixed-methods approach to determine (a) the barriers and facilitators to implementing SBIRT, (b) the impact of those barriers and facilitators on provider behavior and the utilization of SBIRT clinical services, and (c) how they may be overcome or exploited in practice settings, and (d) in a secondary analysis to compare outcomes among women within EUC clinics versus those in TFI clinics.

A secondary analysis will take place to determine whether implementing SBIRT through telehealth (TFI) results in increased utilization of alcohol and substance use screening, brief intervention and referral services for (i) contraceptive methods, (ii) sexually transmitted infection (STI) testing and treatment, and (iii) women's health, (iv) patient satisfaction, and (v) health care costs, and whether these effects are sustained over time. The project will utilize an implementation-effectiveness hybrid design that employs the framework that considers the interaction between contextual factors and implementation processes on the one hand, and the outcomes of interest on the other hand, a framework informed by Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, the Explanatory Matrix, and the Theoretical Domains Framework.

The protocol also describes an embedded process evaluation study aimed at advancing our understanding of how the barriers and facilitators of implementation to technology-based SBIRT occur at multiple levels (i.e., organizational, practitioner, patient), and how the implementation strategies adopted and adapted to mitigate or leverage those barriers and facilitators (i.e., incentives training, supervision, coaching, consultation, and feedback), how the processes of adaptation, refinement, and tailoring evolve in real-world settings, and how they contribute to, or detract from, the overall implementation outcome, namely the adoption and sustainment of SBIRT."

The study aims to improve attendance in Community Wise, a multi-level behavioral intervention for men with histories of substance use disorder (SUD) and incarceration in Essex County, New Jersey. The intervention, developed with the Critical Consciousness Collaborative Board and funded by the National Institute for Minority Health Disparities, has shown promising results in reducing alcohol and substance misuse frequency. However, attendance across the 15 intervention sessions was low due to the closed group format, study randomization strategy, and instability of the study population. The proposed study will use a 23 full factorial experimental design to identify efficient strategies for improving attendance and reducing alcohol and substance misuse, by examining intervention delivery strategies such as recruiting individuals under supervision, incentivizing attendance, and delivering the intervention in an open group format. The study will also expand eligibility criteria to include women and people with SUD living in marginalized communities who have not been previously incarcerated. The study will collect data at baseline and three months post-baseline to determine changes in attendance and alcohol and substance misuse reduction.

This clinical trial is focused on investigating cerebral blood flow variations during changes in blood pressure under general anesthesia. The study aims to measure the relationship between non-invasive measurements of cerebral blood flow, brain oxygenation, and electroencephalography (EEG) markers during controlled variations of blood pressure, which are commonly used during routine anesthesia. The study participants are adults undergoing scheduled surgeries at Lariboisière Hospital, and there is no requirement for healthy volunteers. Vital signs, including mean arterial pressure, are continuously monitored, and cerebral blood velocity, burst suppression, and 95% spectral frequency front are also monitored using Transcranial Pulsed Doppler (TCD) and electroencephalography. Cerebral oxygen saturation is measured using near-infrared spectroscopy. Data is collected and analyzed using an intraoperative data extraction system, which captures digital tracings and measurements at a fine sampling rate. The primary objective is to identify a significant linear relationship between the percentage change in mean velocity and percentage change in 95% spectral frequency front during blood pressure changes to evaluate cerebrovascular autoregulation. Secondary objectives include analysis of this relationship in relation to EEG markers, such as alpha band power, time spent in burst-suppression, and delta-to-alpha ratio. The study plan involves monitoring blood velocity during the adjustment of mean arterial pressure levels between 90% and 70% of the baseline value, while ensuring that it does not go below 60 mmHg for patients at low risk and 80 mmHg for patients at high cardiovascular risk. The trial intends to reject the null hypothesis based on the R2 measure of goodness of fit, with a sample size of 100 participants to compensate for potential confounding factors and adjustments due to cerebrovascular autoregulation impairment. The study does not involve additional interventions, and no participant will experience prolonged anesthetic procedures due to the intraoperative EEG monitoring, which is a standard practice in this type of surgery."
