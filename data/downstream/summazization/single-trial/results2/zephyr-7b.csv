This clinical trial aims to compare the effectiveness of a MyChart-enabled virtual weight loss coach, referred to as the experimental group, to standard preoperative weight loss tools, called the active comparator group, for weight reduction in adults with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 and over, and ventral hernias. The study's primary outcome measure is the average net amount of weight loss in pounds per group over six months. Secondary outcomes include the number of interactions with the virtual coach, quality of life as measured by the Hernia Related Quality of Life Survey (HerQLes), and participant satisfaction with the virtual coach. The study's design is non-randomized with an open-label intervention model, where participants in the experimental group will use the virtual weight loss coach, and participants in the active comparator group will utilize standard weight loss tools. Pregnant females, individuals with severe mental disorders, those on long-term steroid therapy, and those with a history of Substance Use Disorder or insufficient medical records are excluded."

This clinical trial compares the effectiveness of calcium silicate-based sealers (CSS) and epoxy resin-based sealers (ERS) in single-visit root canal treatment for teeth with irreversible pulpitis. A total of 60 patients with these symptoms will be randomly assigned to receive either CSS or ERS after root canal preparation. The study will measure changes in pain intensity, pain relief, and treatment outcome evaluation based on Strindberg's criteria over time using self-assessment scales, as well as swelling and sensitivity under biting pressure as binary variables. The study's primary endpoint is at 1 week, 3 months, and 6 months after treatment. Keywords for the study include calcium silicate-based sealers and epoxy resin-based sealers. All participants must be over 18 years old, have healthy periodontal tissue, and not have any exclusion criteria. The study design is parallel assignment with a single masking type."

The clinical trial, titled ""Feasibility of Integrating Homeopathic Approach in a Comprehensive Cancer Center,"" aims to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating homeopathy as a supportive approach for symptom management and improved quality of life in cancer patients at a comprehensive cancer center. Eligible participants, aged 18 and over and receiving care at the Rambam Health Campus, will provide insights into their reasons for utilizing this approach and their acceptance of self-administrating prescribed remedies. Subjective information will be obtained through validated questionnaires at baseline and follow-up visits. The study has a behavioral intervention, focused on assessing feasibility, and the primary outcome measure is feasibility, assessed through a questionnaire. Secondary outcome measures include quality of life, evaluated using the Distress Thermometer, over a 6-12 week period. The trial is observational in nature, and the intervention aims to evaluate feasibility rather than efficacy or safety. Homeopathy is considered safe, with no direct or indirect adverse effects, and this study assesses its feasibility as a potentially beneficial supportive approach for cancer patients."

The clinical trial, titled ""A Trial to Learn if Odronextamab Combined With Lenalidomide is Safe and Works Better Than Rituximab Combined With Lenalidomide in Participants With Follicular Lymphoma and Marginal Zone Lymphoma,"" is a phase 3 study that aims to compare the safety and efficacy of odronextamab (REGN1979), a bispecific antibody that targets both CD20 and CD3, in combination with lenalidomide (REVLIMID) versus rituximab (Rituxan) in combination with lenalidomide (R2) in participants with follicular lymphoma (FL) and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) who have previously been treated or have not responded to chemo-immunotherapy. The study consists of two parts: part 1 is a safety run-in with odronextamab and lenalidomide in participants with R/R indolent lymphoma, and part 2 is a randomized study with odronextamab and lenalidomide versus R2. The primary outcomes being measured include the incidence of dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) for odronextamab in combination with lenalidomide during part 1, as well as progression-free survival (PFS) in participants with R/R FL and indolent lymphoma in part 2. Secondary outcomes include the incidence and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), best overall response (BOR), duration of response (DOR), overall survival (OS), event-free survival (EFS), time to next anti-lymphoma treatment (TTNT), and various patient-reported outcomes (PROs)."
