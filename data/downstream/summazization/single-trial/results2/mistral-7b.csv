Study Overview: 

Neurologic Deficits and Recovery in Chronic Subdural Hematoma is a single arm study using ECoG monitoring to assess for the presence or absence of spreading depolarization in patients undergoing standard of care surgical evacuation of cSDH. The primary outcome measure is postoperative neurologic deterioration, and secondary outcome measures include eGOS, MoCA, NIH toolbox cognitive battery, PROMIS 29 profile, and TBI QOL to measure neurologic and functional outcomes. The study participants must have chronic/subacute subdural hematoma deemed necessary for surgical evacuation, be able to consent or have LAR consent, and have a modified Rankin Scale score of less than or equal to 2. The study is open to participants aged 40 years and above of either sex and does not accept healthy volunteers.
The trial is designed as a single-group assignment study and includes a 1-5 day post-operative ECoG monitoring period. ECoG monitoring is performed to evaluate for spreading depolarization, which is suspected to play a role in neurologic deficits in subdural hematoma patients. The study follows participants for up to 180 days for long-term monitoring and testing.

The trial's primary outcome measure is neurologic deterioration, measured using the Markwalder grading scale or Glasgow coma scale by one point within the first 1-5 days post-operatively. Secondary outcome measures include eGOS, MoCA, NIH toolbox cognitive battery, PROMIS 29 profile, and TBI QOL to assess neurologic and functional outcomes at 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days after the procedure."
