Title: Catholic Health Initiatives St. Joseph's Children's Home Visiting Program Home Visiting Group Intervention in Child Development

Study Overview:

The Catholic Health Initiatives St. Joseph's Children's Home Visiting Program Home Visiting Group Intervention is a 3-year program that aims to improve child development and school readiness for children aged 0-3 years. The intervention involves regular home visits from paraprofessionals who deliver a curriculum based on the Partners for a Healthy Baby program. The curriculum is designed to improve children's cognitive, social-emotional, behavioral, and physical development. The study aims to measure the effectiveness of the home visiting program in improving child development outcomes relative to a control group that receives standard business as usual services. The study will measure child development outcomes using validated tools such as the Child Development and School Readiness - Child Behavior Checklist, the Child Development and School Readiness - Ages and Stages Questionnaire, and the Child Development and School Readiness - School Records. Maternal health outcomes, including maternal depression and substance abuse, will also be measured using validated tools such as the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and the CAGE-AID. Positive parenting practices, parenting stress, and reductions in child maltreatment will also be measured using validated tools such as the Brief Symptom Inventory, the Abidin Parenting Stress Index Short Form, and the Conflict Tactics Scale Parent-Child Form.

Study Design:

The study will use a quasi-experimental design with a parallel comparison group. The home visiting group intervention will be provided to first-time parents of children who are aged 0-3 months at baseline, while a control group will receive standard business as usual services. The study will measure child development outcomes and maternal health outcomes at baseline and at 5, 8, 12, and 15 years after baseline. Positive parenting practices, parenting stress, and reductions in child maltreatment will also be measured at these time points. The study will use intention-to-treat analysis and multiple imputation for missing data.

Study Population:

The study will recruit first-time parents of children who are aged 0-3 months and who live within a 30-mile radius of the Catholic Health Initiatives St. Joseph's Children's Home Visiting Program office. The study will include children from a diverse range of ethnicities, ages, and socioeconomic backgrounds.

Data Collection:

Data will be collected through parent-reported questionnaires and administrative records. Questionnaires will be used to measure child development outcomes, maternal health outcomes, positive parenting practices, parenting stress, and reductions in child maltreatment. Administrative records will be used to measure family economic self-sufficiency and juvenile delinquency, family violence, and crime outcomes. Data will be collected at baseline and at 5, 8, 12, and 15 years after baseline.

Ethical Considerations:

The study will obtain ethical approval from the Institutional Review Board and will obtain informed consent from all participants. Participants will have the right to withdraw from the study at any time without penalty. Data confidentiality and privacy will be maintained throughout the study.

Sample Size:

The study will recruit approximately 250 participants in each study arm (home visiting group and control group). The study will achieve adequate power to detect medium-sized effects with a significance level of 0.05 and a power of 0.80.

Data Analysis:

The study will use descriptive statistics and inferential statistics to compare the child development outcomes and maternal health outcomes between the home visiting group intervention and the control group. Multiple regression analysis will be used to adjust for confounding variables such as age, sex, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Effect sizes will be calculated using Cohen's d. Subgroup analyses will be conducted to examine the effects of the intervention on specific subgroups of children and parents. Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation.

Conclusion:

The Catholic Health Initiatives St. Joseph's Children's Home Visiting Program Home Visiting Group Intervention is an innovative program that aims to improve child development outcomes for children aged 0-3 years. The study will provide important information about the effectiveness of home visiting interventions in improving child development outcomes and reducing child maltreatment.

==============================================================

Study Overview
================

The primary objective of the study is to assess the barriers and facilitators of integrating Horyzons, an evidence-based digital intervention, in outpatient mental health clinics in North Carolina that provide care to individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders. The study evaluates and identifies the unique barriers and facilitators in implementing Horyzons at each first episode psychosis (FEP) clinic as part of standard care and distinct implementation strategies. The secondary and tertiary aims are to evaluate client engagement with Horyzons, attrition as part of clinical care, and assess the change in clients' psychological measures across in addition to their use of state-funded services (e.g., emergency department and social services) across the 12-month intervention.

Participants
============

The study will recruit 20 clinicians and/or peer specialists from the FEP clinics and 50 individuals with FEP.

Procedures (methods)
====================

The study will involve service provider participants and client participants. Service provider participants will be recruited over a 4-6 week period at their respective clinics and will complete an adapted measure, the Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network (CPCRN) Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Survey, assessing clinical readiness, leadership, acceptance, adoption, and perspective on evidence-based practices. Service providers will then participate in implementing and integrating Horyzons within clinical practice, including preferred implementation strategy that is distinct for each clinic (e.g., Horyzons training, access to the platform by clinicians, ongoing technical support, attendance and update at monthly team meetings, etc.). Service providers will meet with research staff at approximately the 6-month timepoint (+/- 4 weeks) to complete the CPCRN FQHC Survey, and upon completion of the effectiveness trial with clients, service providers will complete this measure once again in addition to participating in a qualitative interview based on the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) around their experience with integrating the platform and identification of barriers and facilitators to Horyzons' implementation. Client participants will be recruited over a 16- to 20-week period at their respective clinic and will participate in a baseline visit to provide informed consent and complete a brief battery of measures. Participants will then meet with a research assistant, peer support specialist, or clinician to be given guidance and instruction for using the site (i.e., Horyzons onboarding). Clients will then engage in the platform, where site usage information as well as experience will be collected from participants through the Horyzons platform. Site usage and experience will be automatically collected via the platform and participants will have access and engage in this platform for approximately 12 months, depending on when recruited into trial. During this 12-month engagement period with the platform, client participants will meet with research staff at their midway point to complete the brief battery of measures assessing loneliness and social support, and subsequently participate two additional research visits to complete the battery of measures at 12-months and at a 3-month follow-up. Participants will also participate in qualitative interviews at 12-months.

Title: The Efficacy of Probiotics for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder Among Adult Males: A Comparison With Placebo and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in a Randomized Controlled Trial

Introduction: Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major public health problem that affects millions of individuals worldwide. Probiotics, dietary supplements containing good bacteria, have shown promise in the treatment of AUD, but evidence of their efficacy is limited. The purpose of this study is to determine whether Lactobacillus sp. probiotics can effectively treat AUD in adult males using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.

Methods: This RCT study will recruit adult males diagnosed with AUD who are currently hospitalized and willing to participate in a 12-week treatment program. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three arms: the probiotic arm, the placebo arm, or the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) arm. The probiotic arm will receive daily administered probiotics; the ACT arm will receive biweekly ACT sessions; and the placebo arm will receive placebo. Outcomes will be assessed at four time points: at baseline, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks after treatment ends.

Participant Eligibility Criteria: Participants must be adult males aged 18 to 55 years old who are currently hospitalized and have a diagnosis of AUD as determined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-5-TR). Participants must be able to read and write Mandarin and have a minimum of junior high school education. Participants who have a history of organic brain disease, a pacemaker, gastrointestinal surgery, severe illness, seizures, or psychiatric disorders, as well as those who have participated in alcohol-related studies or trials within the past 30 days, are not eligible to participate.

Efficacy Outcomes: The primary outcome of this RCT will be changes in the severity of AUD, as measured by the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (AUDIT) score. Secondary outcomes include changes in Craving Assessment for Alcohol and Depressive symptoms as measured by the Penn Alcohol Craving Scale (PACS) and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD). Other outcomes will include changes in blood alcohol concentration, liver enzymes, and quality of life, as well as adverse events.

Conclusion: The Efficacy of Probiotics for the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder Among Adult Males: A Comparison With Placebo and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy in a Randomized Controlled Trial is a study that aims to determine the efficacy of probiotics in treating AUD in adult males using an RCT design. The study will provide valuable information about the use of probiotics as a treatment for AUD and may contribute to the development of effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of AUD. The study will be conducted in the Second Affiliated Hospital, Xiangya University of Central South University, Changsha, China, and all participants will undergo a detailed baseline assessment, receive the assigned treatment, and be assessed at four time points to evaluate the efficacy of the study interventions. The primary outcome metric will be changes in the severity of AUD as measured by the AUDIT score, and secondary outcomes will include changes in Craving Assessment for Alcohol and Depressive symptoms as measured by the PACS and HAMD, as well as changes in blood alcohol concentration, liver enzymes, and quality of life.

445,"[/INST] Overview
========

A pragmatic trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of an inpatient psychosocial support group for addressing anxiety and depression in individuals with limb loss. The trial involved a SEGT (Supportive-Expressive Group Therapy) intervention for addressing anxiety and depression, which was delivered over a 2-year period. 

The study was conducted at St. John's Rehab, with 130 inpatients recruited and 65 in each arm of the study (SEGT and TAU). The intervention was designed by an interprofessional team from psychiatry, social work, physiatry, and occupational therapy, and the study was conducted under strict COVID-19 protocols. The primary outcome measures were changes in Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-Item (GAD-7) scores, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist-5 (PCL-5) scores.

Methodology
------------

The study was conducted according to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (SORT) guidelines and was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov. Participants were screened for eligibility and randomly assigned to either the SEGT or Treatment as Usual (TAU) condition. The SEGT intervention consisted of 8 sessions delivered over a 3-week period, held in a large room setting. The TAU condition included referral to social work and/or a psychiatrist, as well as other psycho-social supports.

Results
--------

The results of the study were mixed. While there were improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms in both the SEGT and TAU groups, these improvements were not statistically significant when compared to the TAU group alone. There was also no significant interaction effect between group and time. However, there were significant improvements in generalized self-efficacy in the SEGT group compared to the TAU group.

Conclusion
----------

Overall, the study highlights the importance of providing psychosocial support to individuals with limb loss. While the SEGT intervention did not produce significant improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms, it is possible that the intervention is more effective when delivered at a later stage or in combination with other interventions. Further research is required to determine the most effective interventions for addressing anxiety and depression in individuals with limb loss."

663,"[/INST] Title: Phase I Safety and Feasibility Study of Autologous L1CAM-Specific Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells for Severe Resistant Prostate Neuroendocrine Carcinoma

Overview:
=========

The trial is a phase I safety and feasibility study of autologous L1CAM-specific CAR+EGFRt+ T cells for the treatment of prostate cancer that has not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy or surgery and has L1CAM positivity. Patients are required to undergo leukapheresis, lymphodepleting chemotherapy, and an autologous L1CAM-specific CAR+EGFRt+ T cell infusion. The trial is evaluating the safety and feasibility of the treatment to manage the disease, and also the response of the CAR+T cells at each dose level. The trial is currently evaluating patients with metastatic or locally advanced disease with L1CAM positivity.

Eligibility Criteria:
-----------------

Patients who have been diagnosed with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and have not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy or surgery are eligible to participate in the trial. Patients must be able to understand and provide written informed consent to participate in the trial. They must also undergo additional procedures such as imaging tests, biopsies, and blood tests to determine if they qualify for the trial.

Intervention:
------------

The intervention for the trial involves autologous T-cell receptor-engineered T-cells that are specifically designed to target L1CAM on cancer cells. The T-cells are designed to recognize L1CAM on cancer cells and kill them. Patients undergo leukapheresis, a procedure to obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells for T-cell product manufacturing. After several rounds of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, the patient's own T-cells are genetically engineered to recognize L1CAM on cancer cells and are returned to the patient in an autologous L1CAM-specific CAR+EGFRt+ T cell infusion.

Primary Outcomes:
----------------

The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of the intervention. The trial will also evaluate the feasibility of the intervention by measuring the number of patients who can be treated and the time it takes to perform the procedures. The trial will also assess if the CAR+EGFRt+ T cells are able to recognize and kill L1CAM-positive tumor cells.

Secondary Outcomes:
-------------------

The trial will also evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention. The trial will assess the changes in the size and number of metastatic sites in the patient's body before and after the treatment. Additionally, the trial will assess the patient's quality of life after the treatment.

Feasibility/Study Plan:
=====================

The trial is a single-group assignment trial, which means that all participants will receive the same intervention. The trial will use an open-label design, which means that the investigators will be aware that the participants are receiving this intervention. Participants will be eligible to participate in the trial if they have L1CAM-positive tumors and have not responded to platinum-based chemotherapy or surgery.

After leukapheresis, participants will undergo imaging tests to further determine if they qualify for the trial. Participants will then undergo several rounds of lymphodepleting chemotherapy before receiving an autologous L1CAM-specific CAR+EGFRt+ T cell infusion. The participants will be followed up monthly after the infusion for a year. The participants will also be followed up annually after the first year of treatment."

Title: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Improving Parenting Skills Adult ADHD (IPSA): A New Parent Training Program for Parents Who Themselves Have ADHD

Study Overview:

* Design: An RCT with parallel groups, where eligible individuals are block randomized on each clinical site to one of two groups (ratio 1:1): Treatment (IPSA directly) or Control (continued routine services; offered IPSA approximately six months later).
* Setting: The study is carried out by the Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders at Karolinska Institutet (KIND), Karolinska Institutet, Sweden, in collaboration with an ADHD Center run by the publicly-funded Habilitation & Health, Stockholm Health Care Services, Region Stockholm, Sweden.
* Research Questions: The research questions are primarily concerned with the efficacy of IPSA, secondarily with the feasibility of the program. The investigators will explore the potentially moderating or mediating effects of baseline variables and levels of active participation on efficacy outcomes.
* Efficacy: The effect of IPSA is examined using self- and parental report scales administered before (pre; T1) and immediately after (post; T2) IPSA, as well as approximately 1.5-3 months after program completion, in connection with an IPSA booster session (follow-up; T3). The primary outcome is parental self-efficacy, and secondary outcomes are parental stress, levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child. The investigators also track parents' time management and organizational skills from pre to post IPSA.
* Feasibility: The feasibility of IPSA is evaluated based attendance records and parental reports. The investigators assess whether IPSA is an acceptable intervention (i.e., treatment satisfaction, treatment credibility), examine levels of active participation (i.e., program completion rates, levels of homework completion, use of introduced parenting skills, and management of a targeted parent-child interaction situation), and monitor potential harms (including parental reports of general perceived stress, symptoms of anxiety/depression and adverse events).
* Treatment Integrity: Intervention sessions are recorded (audio only). Treatment integrity (assessed in terms of facilitator adherence/fidelity) is examined in 20% of group sessions (randomly selected), using checklists covering program elements and content.

Participation Criteria:

* Eligibility Criteria: Adults (≥ 18 years) with a formal ADHD diagnosis (any form), having at least one child in the ages between 3 and 11 years sufficient knowledge of Swedish to participate actively in the intervention without an interpreter possibility to participate in the intervention during the intended period (regardless of allocation).
* Exclusion Criteria: Other neurodevelopmental disabilities, that is autism or intellectual disability ongoing serious psychiatric condition (e.g., major depression, suicidality, psychosis, substance use disorder) for which treatment needs to be prioritized ongoing family crisis or equivalent that needs to be prioritized with other types of interventions.

Study Plan:

* Study Design: The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with parallel groups. Participants are block randomized on each clinical site to one of two groups (i.e., Treatment or Control).
* Intervention/Treatment: Participants in the Treatment group receive the Improving Parenting Skills adult ADHD (IPSA) intervention, which is a new parent training program for parents with ADHD. The program combines structured group-based skills training with individualized support, including occupational therapist support. Participants in the Control group receive continued routine services while waiting for IPSA (offered approximately six months later).
* Measurements: The study measures primary outcome measures and secondary outcome measures at various time points. The primary outcome is parental self-efficacy, while secondary outcomes are parental stress, levels of household disorganization or frequency and perception of disruptive behavior problems in the participant's target child, and parents' time management and organizational skills. The study also measures feasibility through attendance records and parental reports.

The condition is mainly idiopathic, but it can also be caused by diabetes mellitus, post-surgical conditions, such as fundoplication, bariatric surgery, vagotomy, and esophagectomy, and post-infectious conditions, neurological, and autoimmune diseases.
* In addition to the classic double pyloromyotomy (DPM), a single pyloromyotomy (SPM) approach is also utilized in the management of severe gastroparesis. However, the efficacy and safety of SPM are still not well understood, and further evaluation is needed.

Methods:

* In this clinical trial, subjects will be randomized into two arms: single or double pyloromyotomy. The randomization process will be computer-generated, and the envelope containing the informed consent form and study allocation will be opened after informed consent has been obtained.
* The primary efficacy outcome will be the clinical success rate, defined as no nausea, vomiting, early satiety, or bloating at 3, 6, and 12 months. Secondary outcome measures will include gastroparesis cardinal symptom index (GCSI) score change, technical success, procedure time, adverse events, and recurrence of symptoms.

Conclusion:

* The results of this clinical trial will provide valuable information on the clinical effectiveness and safety of single versus double pyloromyotomy in patients with severe gastroparesis. The study will help guide clinical decision-making and improve the management of gastroparesis."

Summary
=======

Study Overview
===============

The study is a randomized clinical trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of using wearable fitness trackers to remotely monitor and improve prehabilitation in patients undergoing surgery. The study will compare the use of wearable devices to traditional self-assessment methods for determining exercise intensity and adherence. The primary outcome measure will be the total number of minutes of moderate intensity exercise achieved by participants using the wearable devices. Secondary outcomes include volume of physical activity, weekly adherence, and patient feedback on the use of wearable devices for prehabilitation.

Detailed Description
------------------

Prehabilitation is a type of exercise intervention designed to improve a patient's functional capacity prior to surgery. The study will be a two-arm, randomized, parallel group, clinical trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a control group or an intervention group. The control group will receive traditional self-assessment methods for determining exercise intensity and adherence, while the intervention group will receive a wearable fitness tracker to monitor and optimize their exercise regimen. The wearable devices will be used to track heart rate, steps taken, and other physical activity metrics. The primary outcome measure will be the total number of minutes of moderate intensity exercise achieved by participants using the wearable devices. Secondary outcomes include volume of physical activity, weekly adherence, and patient feedback on the use of wearable devices for prehabilitation.

Prehabilitation has been shown to improve cardiovascular fitness and reduce postoperative complications. Previous studies have used rating of perceived exertion (RPE) to determine exercise intensity, but self-assessment methods for RPE have been found to be inaccurate and prone to measurement bias. By using heart rate data from the wearable devices, the study will aim to achieve the prescribed exercise intensity in a more accurate and reliable way. The study will also monitor and optimize exercise routine adherence, which has been shown to be lower in home-based prehabilitation programmes and during chemotherapy. The study will use Fitbit fitness trackers to monitor the exercise routine and heart rate in real-time. The study will include a follow-up period of eight weeks, during which participants will wear the wearable devices to track their exercise routine and heart rate. The primary outcome measure will be the total number of minutes of moderate intensity exercise achieved by participants using the wearable devices. Secondary outcome measures will include volume of physical activity, weekly adherence, and patient feedback on the use of wearable devices for prehabilitation.

Rationale for Current Study
--------------------------

The use of wearable fitness trackers for remote prehabilitation is a promising area of research that has the potential to increase accessibility to prehabilitation programmes and improve patient outcomes. Remote prehabilitation programmes offer many benefits, including increased accessibility, improved patient engagement, and reduced costs. Wearable fitness trackers provide objective measurement of heart rate and physical activity, which allows for more accurate and reliable tracking of exercise routine and heart rate. The study will aim to measure the effectiveness of using wearable devices for remote prehabilitation by comparing it to traditional self-assessment methods for determining exercise intensity and adherence. A heart rate-based measurement of exercise intensity will be used to monitor and optimize exercise routine adherence in a remote prehabilitation program.

The study used dacryoendoscopic-assisted laser dacryoplasty with silicone intubation (DLDI) to manage nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO). The study included patients with confirmed NLDO or stenosis, recurrent or persistent symptomatic epiphora, and longer than 6 months of follow-up after removal of the silicone stent. The study found that the success rate of DLDI for NLDO varied from 51% to 90% and depended on factors such as site of obstruction, different surgical techniques, stringency of definitions of success, and duration of follow-up. The study used a non-randomized design with active and experimental arms and performed dacryoendoscopic-assisted laser dacryoplasty with silicone intubation. The primary outcome measure was the cumulative success rate of DLDI within 2 years of follow-up.

====================================================

Study Overview
===============

A randomized prospective controlled study was conducted to assess the effects of platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) on wound healing following palatal connective tissue harvesting using ultrasonography as the diagnostic test. Patients with Miller class 1 or 2 gingival recession who require root coverage surgery in the Department of Periodontology were included in the study. The palatal tissue was harvested with a single incision technique using L-PRF clots as the diagnostic test and sutured with sterile monofilament sutures. The patients were evaluated with an ultrasonography device to measure the palatal tissue thickness and tissue vascularization on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, and 90. A 6-18 MHz intraoral probe was used with sterile gel and stretch film to evaluate the mucosal thickness and vascularization. The mean pulsatility index (PI) values of each patient were calculated and compared between the control and test groups using independent samples t-test tests or Mann Whitney U test tests for normally distributed data and repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for within-group comparisons.

Official Title
--------------
Ultrasonographic Assessment of the Effects of Platelet Rich Fibrin on Wound Healing Following Palatal Connective Tissue Harvesting.

Conditions
----------

The study aimed to assess the effects of PRF on wound healing following palatal connective tissue harvesting in patients with Miller class 1 or 2 gingival recession who require root coverage surgery in the Department of Periodontology.

Intervention/Treatment
----------------------

The intervention for the test group was autolog PRF application, while the control group received conventional suturing without any additional material.

=====================

Patients with Miller class 1 or 2 gingival recession who require root coverage surgery in the Department of Periodontology and meet the following inclusion criteria were eligible for the study: (a) need for connective tissue harvesting for tunnel operation or coronally flap operation for the treatment of gingival recession; (b) non-smoking; (c) good oral hygiene; (d) no gag reflex; (e) no periodontal surgery before at the operation site; (f) systemic disorders (immunologic diseases, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, ongoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy), pregnancy/lactation/menstruation, or inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent were excluded. The ages of eligible participants ranged from 20 to 65 years, and both genders were acceptable.

Study Plan
------------

The study was designed as a randomized prospective controlled study, with two arms: a control group and a test group. Patients were randomly assigned to either the control or test group. The control group received connective tissue harvesting with conventional suturing, while the test group received connective tissue harvesting with autolog PRF application. The patients were evaluated with an ultrasonography device to measure the palatal tissue thickness and tissue vascularization on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30, and 90. The ultrasonography examination was performed with a 6-18 MHz intraoral probe with sterile gel and stretch film. The following equations were used to calculate the mean PI values of each patient: Pulsatility index (PI) = (Vmax-Vmin)/(Vmean) where Vmax is peak systolic flow velocity, Vmin is diastolic flow velocity, and Vmean is mean flow velocity. A statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21 software, with independent samples t-test tests or Mann Whitney U test tests used to compare the mean PI values between the control and test groups for normally distributed data and repeated measures ANOVA with Bonferroni correction used for within-group comparisons. Power analysis was performed using G*Power software, with a statistical program for sample size calculation performed using alpha = 0.05 and effect size = 0.26.
