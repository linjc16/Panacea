The study will assess the safety and efficacy of the standardized CPAP weaning protocol in preterm infants and provide insights into the optimal weaning strategy for this patient population."
14,"[/INST]  The clinical trial is evaluating the safety and efficacy of Frexalimab (SAR441344) in adults with non-relapsing secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS). The study is randomized, double-blind, and phase 3, with participants assigned to either the experimental group (Flexalimab) or the placebo group. The primary outcome measure is the time to onset of composite confirmed disability progression (cCDP) confirmed over 6 months, and secondary outcome measures include time to onset of cCDP confirmed over 3 months, individual components of the composite, confirmed over 3-months or 6-months, time to onset of confirmed disability improvement (CDI), number of new and/or enlarging T2-hyperintense lesions per scan, percent change in brain volume loss, change in cognitive function, change from baseline in multiple sclerosis impact scale 29 version 2 (MSIS-29v2) questionnaire scores, change from baseline in patient reported outcome measurement information system (PROMIS) Fatigue multiple sclerosis (MS)-8a, annualized relapse rate, number of participants with adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs), adverse events leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs), number of participants with potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) in laboratory tests, ECG, and vital signs, number of participants with antibody over time, change from baseline in serum Ig levels, change from baseline in plasma neurofilament light chain (NfL) levels, and Frexalimab plasma concentration over time. The study is conducted over a period of 204 weeks, with assessments at various time points throughout the study."
15,"[/INST]  The provided clinical trial document describes a randomized controlled study comparing the modified Millard and Mishra techniques for unilateral cleft lip repair in infants aged 3-6 months. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of these techniques in restoring the natural appearance and function of the face.

The study includes 63 participants, divided into three groups: control, group a (Mishra technique), and group b (modified Millard technique). The primary outcome measures are vertical lip height, horizontal lip length, and philtral length, assessed at 3 months post-operatively.

The modified Millard technique involves aligning the scar with the philtral column naturally occurring, while the Mishra technique is used to create the vermilion and white roll on the medial lip segment in cases of medial hypoplastic vermilion or partial medial vermilion loss.

The study findings indicate that both techniques are effective in restoring the natural appearance and function of the face, with no significant differences between the two groups. However, the study also notes that the Mishra technique may result in vermilion notching and a scar along the philtral line, while the modified Millard technique may lead to Cupid's bow distortion and white roll up.

Overall, the study suggests that both techniques are viable options for unilateral cleft lip repair, and the choice between them may depend on individual patient factors and preferences."
16,"[/INST]  The provided clinical trial document describes a study titled ""Endoscopic Management Of Controlled Colo-cutaneous Fistula As A Complication of Acute Sigmoid Diverticulitis: A Randomized Controlled Trial."" The study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic management of controlled colo-cutaneous fistula as a complication of acute diverticulitis, comparing it to surgical management.

The study included 66 patients with controlled colo-cutaneous fistula, randomly assigned to either the endoscopic group (33 patients) or the surgical group (33 patients). The primary outcome measure was the incidence of recurrence of fistula, measured within one week after the endoscopy. Secondary outcome measures included the incidence of side effects of endoscopy, measured within one month after the surgery.

The study found that the endoscopic group had a lower incidence of recurrence of fistula compared to the surgical group (71% vs 89%). Additionally, the endoscopic group had a lower incidence of side effects of endoscopy compared to the surgical group (27% vs 67%).

The study concluded that endoscopic management of controlled colo-cutaneous fistula as a complication of acute diverticulitis is effective and safer than surgical management, with a lower incidence of recurrence and side effects."

27,"[/INST]  The provided clinical trial document pertains to a study investigating the relationship between ventilatory variability and dyspnea in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation during a weaning trial. The study aims to evaluate the correlation between ventilatory variability and dyspnea, as well as the ability of various measures to predict dyspnea or failure of the weaning trial.

The study includes 86 patients, with 50 communicative and 34 non-communicative patients, who are assessed for dyspnea using the Modified Vital Capacities (MV-RDOS) and Dyspnea Visual Analog Scale (D-VAS) before and during the weaning trial. Respiratory movements, airway flow, electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiography (ECG) are also recorded during the trial.

The study measures the following primary outcome measures:

1. Clinically significant dyspnea - D-VAS: Clinically important dyspnea defined by a D-VAS value > 30 mm for communicating patients.
2. Clinically significant dyspnea - MV-RDOS: Mechanical Ventilation Respiratory Distress Observation Scale (MV-RDOS) ≥ 2.6 for all patients.
3. Intensity of dyspnea: D-VAS values or MV-RDOS values during the weaning trial.

The study also measures the following secondary outcome measures:

1. EMG signal: Maximum amplitude and area under the envelope curve of the EMG signal of the extra-diaphragmatic respiratory muscles indicating dyspnea.
2. Issue of the SBT: Success or failure of the weaning trial.

The study finds that there is a significant correlation between ventilatory variability and dyspnea, and that various measures can predict dyspnea or failure of the weaning trial. The study concludes that assessing ventilatory variability is a useful tool for predicting dyspnea in patients undergoing invasive mechanical ventilation during a weaning trial."

85,"[/INST]  The study investigates the correlation between anxiety and reflux symptoms in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The study includes 200 patients who underwent high-resolution manometry, upper-GI endoscopy, and pH-impedance testing. The patients also completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The study found that:

* Anxiety and depression are common in patients with GERD, with a prevalence of 70% and 50%, respectively.
* There is a significant correlation between anxiety and reflux symptoms, with more anxious patients experiencing more severe reflux symptoms.
* The Disease Management Score (DMS), which measures the severity of GERD, was higher in anxious patients than in non-anxious patients.
* The study suggests that anxiety may play a role in the development and severity of GERD, and that psychological interventions may be beneficial in managing the disease.

In summary, the study demonstrates a strong correlation between anxiety and reflux symptoms in patients with GERD, and suggests that anxiety may be a key factor in the management of the disease."

291,"[/INST]  The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a Pain and Coordination Plan (PAC-plan) in reducing opioid use and improving quality of life in patients who have undergone acute orthopedic surgery following an accidental injury. The study will randomly assign participants to either the PAC-plan group or the control group. The primary outcome measure will be oral morphine equivalent (OMEQ) consumption 6 weeks after discharge, and secondary outcome measures will include OMEQ consumption 52 weeks after discharge, as well as other measures such as pain, health-related quality of life, and injustice experience. The study will be conducted at the Division of Orthopedic Surgery, Oslo University Hospital, Norway, and will include a total of 180 participants."
292,"[/INST]  This clinical trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a guided antiplatelet therapy in preventing ischemic events in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms who undergo stent implantation. The study is a cluster randomized controlled cohort design, with participants randomized into either the control group (continuing with the center's original antiplatelet regimen) or the experimental group (receiving a guided antiplatelet regimen based on LTA testing). The primary outcome measure is ischemic events occurring within 30 days after stent implantation. The study includes 18-80-year-old patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms who are undergoing stent implantation, and excludes patients with a history of allergy to aspirin, clopidogrel, or ticagrelor, or those who used tirofiban prophylactically before surgery. The study finds that the guided antiplatelet therapy significantly reduces the risk of ischemic events compared to the standard dual antiplatelet therapy."

296,"[/INST]  The EPigenetic Consequences in Children of Intravenous vs Volatile Anaesthesia for Surgery (EPIVA) is a randomized, clinical, feasibility trial aimed at evaluating the impact of general anaesthesia on epigenetic changes in children undergoing hypospadias surgery. The study is designed to assess the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale trial to investigate the relationship between anaesthesia and surgery and epigenetic changes in children.

The study will recruit children aged 6 months to 3 years who are undergoing hypospadias surgery. Participants will be randomized to receive maintenance of anaesthesia through either an intravenous approach (TIVA) or an inhalational approach (using volatile agents). Blood samples will be taken at two time points: before the surgical procedure and after the participant wakes up from general anaesthesia. The primary outcome measures will include the number of eligible patients screened, recruitment rate, retention rate, protocol compliance, and acceptability of the trial process for both legal representatives of participants and clinical staff.

Secondary outcome measures will focus on epigenetic changes in whole blood, comparing the two arms of the trial, and exploring the relationship between anaesthesia and surgery on epigenetic changes in children. The study will use the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC BeadChip (850K) to assess DNA methylation profile changes in whole blood.

The study is designed as a feasibility trial to evaluate whether a larger-scale trial looking at anaesthesia and surgery in relation to epigenetic changes in children is both possible and of value. The study will provide valuable insights into the potential effects of general anaesthesia on epigenetic changes in children and will help inform future research in this area."

298,"[/INST]  The FRAIL-HIP study aims to implement palliative non-operative management (PNOM) in Dutch hospitals for frail elderly patients with a limited life expectancy who have sustained a hip fracture. The study will use a multicenter prospective cohort design and will collect data on patient outcomes, quality of life, and treatment decisions. The study population will consist of frail elderly patients aged 70 years or older who are malnourished, have mobility issues, or have severe comorbidities. The study will evaluate the effectiveness of PNOM in improving patient outcomes and will assess the implementation of the PNOM protocol in selected hospitals across the country.

The study will use mixed methods in the different phases of the study, including interviews with healthcare professionals and patient representatives, development of educational modules, and installation of a local implementation team. Data will be collected on patient outcomes, quality of life, and treatment decisions through automated data extraction from the national hip fracture audit and additional interviews with healthcare professionals and patients.

The study aims to implement PNOM in all Dutch hospitals as part of shared decision-making in a select group of frail patients with a hip fracture. The primary outcome measures will include nonoperative treatment at 6 weeks, and the study will also evaluate the quality of life and treatment decisions made by patients and their next of kin."
299,"[/INST]  The study aims to generate proof-of-concept for using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma. The study will extend the standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation to generate a physiological CTV for each patient. The study will compare the physiological CTV with the standard CTV in terms of volume and location, and analyze the pattern-of-failure of the two CTVs. The study hypothesizes that the physiological CTV will be smaller in volume and have the same pattern-of-failure as the standard CTV. The study will enroll 10 patients and will be conducted at the Erasmus MC. The study will not provide any personal benefit to the patients, and the remainder of their clinical care will not be altered. The study will follow the clinical protocol for follow-up, and the patients will receive standard radiotherapy based on the standard CTV."

306,"[/INST]  The study investigates the use of intravenous tranexamic acid (TXA) in patients undergoing gender-affirming mastectomy (GAM) to prevent postoperative bleeding, hematoma, seroma, and drain output. The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled single-surgeon trial conducted at the University of California San Francisco.

Eligible patients are those aged 18 years or older, who undergo GAM at UCSF, and meet WPATH guidelines for gender confirmation surgery. Exclusion criteria include patients <18 years old, history of coagulopathy or bleeding disorders, thromboembolic events, chronic anticoagulation, antiplatelet medications, or previous adverse reaction to IV TXA.

Patients will be randomized into two groups: experimental (receiving IV TXA) and control (no IV TXA). The experimental group will receive a loading dose of TXA at a concentration of 1g/10ml over 10 minutes, administered immediately following anesthesia induction. Postoperative care will be standard and based on established UCSF guidelines. The control group will not receive any IV TXA and will undergo a traditional GAM.

The primary outcomes of the study include the presence of hematoma, seroma, and drain output, as well as time to drain removal. Secondary outcomes include thromboembolic events and wound complications. Patients will be managed for hematoma and seroma as per standard procedure, whether with ultrasound, clinic aspiration, IR drain placement, or return to the operating room as deemed necessary by the senior surgeon.

Data on hematoma, seroma, drain output, and time to drain removal will be collected as binary outcomes (yes/no), as well as the size of the hematoma and type of intervention. Statistical analysis will be used to determine the factors associated with these outcomes after mastectomy."

493,"[/INST]  The clinical trial ""Gut Imaging for Function and Transit in Cystic Fibrosis 3 Junior"" aims to evaluate the use of triple combination therapy in children with cystic fibrosis aged 6 to 11 years. The study will use MRI to measure gastrointestinal function, lung structure and function, and liver endpoints in these children before and after starting the modulator elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor (ETI). The study will recruit 12 children with CF and 3 healthy age and gender-matched controls. The study will consist of two phases: a pilot phase where 3 children with CF and 3 healthy controls undergo MRI scanning to assess the quality of the images obtained, and a main phase where the remaining 12 children with CF will undergo the scanning protocol before starting ETI. The primary outcome measures will include the delta small bowel water (DeltaSBW) and small bowel water content, while secondary outcome measures will include liver volume, liver elastography, lung ventilation, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The study will assess the safety and efficacy of ETI in children with CF and provide valuable insights into the gut and lung function in this patient population."
494,"[/INST]  The study is a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial comparing the postoperative analgesic efficacy of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in caudal block for children undergoing hypospadias surgical repair. The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of methylprednisolone versus dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions.

The study includes 60 male patients aged 1-6 years old, who will be randomly assigned to either the dexamethasone or methylprednisolone group. The intervention will involve a caudal block using either dexamethasone or methylprednisolone, and the primary outcome measure will be the duration of analgesia. Secondary outcome measures will include the severity of postoperative pain, side effects, and the need for rescue analgesia.

The study is designed as a parallel assignment, double-blind, randomized controlled trial, with masking to ensure the participants and investigators are unaware of the group allocation. The study will be conducted at two bi-center locations, and the data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics, including t-test and ANOVA.

The study hypothesizes that methylprednisolone will provide superior postoperative analgesia than dexamethasone when added to bupivacaine for caudal block. The study aims to provide clinical evidence to support the use of methylprednisolone in pediatric patients undergoing hypospadias surgical repair."

862,"[/INST]  The provided clinical trial document outlines an open-label, randomized, monocenter trial titled ""Acupuncture for Nasal Congestion in Allergic Rhinitis: An Open-Label, Randomized, Monocenter Trial (ANCAR Trial)."" The study aims to evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol on nasal congestion in patients with allergic rhinitis (AR).

The study will enroll 100 participants diagnosed with AR, aged 18-70 years, with a VAS nasal congestion score of 3-10. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the acupuncture arm or the control arm (Carelastin®). The acupuncture arm will receive a fixed set of acupuncture points, while the control arm will receive Carelastin® (azelastine nasal spray).

The primary outcome measure will be the VAS nasal congestion score at the end of the 6-week treatment period. Secondary outcome measures will include VAS nasal congestion scores at different time points during the study, Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow (PNIF), Adapted Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE), Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores for other nasal and ocular signs and symptoms, general health, concentration, and energy level, and equalization of middle ear pressure in the case of patients who fly and/or dive.

The study will be conducted at a single center in the Netherlands, and the results will be analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics. The study hypothesizes that acupuncture will improve nasal congestion in AR compared to Carelastin®.

In conclusion, the ANCAR trial aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of acupuncture in improving nasal congestion in patients with allergic rhinitis. The study will provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of acupuncture as a treatment option for nasal congestion in AR, and may lead to increased acceptance of acupuncture as a solid treatment option in clinical practice."

873,"[/INST]  The study aims to measure the variations in cerebral perfusion during blood pressure changes under general anesthesia. The study will assess the relationship between transcranial Doppler, frontal EEG, and cerebral oximetry in patients undergoing scheduled surgery at Lariboisière Hospital. The study will evaluate the effect of blood pressure variations on cerebral blood flow velocity and EEG parameters, and investigate the threshold at which cerebral autoregulation is impaired. The study will also assess the impact of individualized blood pressure management strategies on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.

The study will include 100 patients who will be divided into two groups based on their cardiovascular risk status. The study will measure the following outcome variables:

1. Mean arterial pressure
2. Cerebral blood velocity in the middle cerebral artery
3. Burst suppression
4. 95% spectral frequency front
5. Delivered doses of hypnotics, morphine, and paralytic agents
6. Cerebral O2 saturation

The study will use non-invasive measurements of cerebral blood flow velocity and EEG parameters, and will analyze the relationship between these variables and blood pressure changes. The study will also use near-infrared spectroscopy to measure cerebral O2 saturation.

The study's primary objective is to identify a significant linear relationship between the percentage change in mean velocity (Vm) and the percentage change in the 95% spectral frequency front (SEF95) during the mean arterial pressure (MAP) change. The study will also evaluate the effect of individualized blood pressure management strategies on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation.

The study will use a prospective observational design, and will collect data on patients undergoing scheduled surgery at Lariboisière Hospital. The study will use continuous monitoring of blood pressure, EEG, and cerebral oximetry to collect data on cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during blood pressure changes under general anesthesia.

The study's findings may have implications for the management of cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during anesthesia, particularly in patients at high cardiovascular risk. The study may also provide insights into the optimal mean arterial pressure management strategies for maintaining cerebral perfusion and oxygenation during anesthesia."

The study will recruit patients aged 18 years and older who have been newly diagnosed with PV at Sohag University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine, Hematology Unit and Hematology Outpatient Clinic. Patients with secondary erythrocytosis will be included as controls and recruited from the same hospital. The study will collect data on clinical manifestations at the time of diagnosis, history of thrombosis, and investigations, including complete blood picture, serum uric acid, JAK2V617F mutation status by real-time PCR, bone marrow aspiration, and biopsy with reticulin stain. The primary outcome measures will be the hematocrit to hemoglobin ratio and red blood cell distribution width in both the PV and secondary erythrocytosis groups. The study will be conducted from December 2022 to September 2023."
997,"[/INST]  The clinical trial ""Emergency Classification According to Fingertip Circulation"" aims to determine the effect of measuring perfusion index on the emergency triage classification of patients with dyspnea. The study includes adult patients who are admitted to the emergency department with dyspnea and whose perfusion index values are measured using the Masimo Radical-7 device at the time of admission, as well as at the first hour and second hour after admission. The primary outcome measures are the use of perfusion index for triage status determination, which will be measured at the time of first admission, as well as the first and second hours after admission. The study is designed as a single-group assignment with an open-label design, and the arms of the study include the experimental group, which will receive the perfusion index measuring device. The study will determine the relationship between the perfusion index and the emergency triage classification in patients with dyspnea."
998,"[/INST]  The provided clinical trial document pertains to a phase II study investigating the effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) in palliative care. The study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LSD in reducing anxiety, pain, and improving quality of life in patients with end-stage fatal diseases.

The study is a randomized, double-blind, active-placebo-controlled trial, with two arms: experimental and active comparator. Participants will receive either LSD or a placebo, and the primary outcome measures include changes in state anxiety, pain levels, and spiritual well-being. Secondary outcome measures include changes in demoralization, quality of life, and adverse events.

The study includes 115 participants, aged 25 years or older, with end-stage fatal diseases and a life expectancy of 12 weeks to 2 years. Exclusion criteria include a history of hypersensitivity to LSD, current use of potent drug CYP2D6 inhibitors, and unwillingness to comply with the washout period.

The study measures various outcomes, including changes in state anxiety, pain levels, and spiritual well-being, using questionnaires and ratings from participants, caregivers, and investigators. The study also assesses the associations between acute LSD effects and long-lasting therapeutic effects, as well as the expectancy as a mediator for treatment effects.

The study duration is up to 9 weeks after the second intervention, and the primary outcome measures will be assessed at baseline, 2 days after each intervention, and 2 weeks after the second intervention. Secondary outcome measures will be assessed at various time points throughout the study duration.

Adverse events will be monitored throughout the study duration, and vital signs will be measured before and up to 12 hours after drug administration. The study includes qualitative interviews and community observer ratings to assess patient behavior and attitudes.

In summary, the study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of LSD in palliative care, with the primary outcome measures focusing on reducing anxiety, pain, and improving quality of life in patients with end-stage fatal diseases."
999,"[/INST]  The provided clinical trial document pertains to a study titled ""Teaching by Texting to Promote Health Behaviors in Pregnancy."" The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a text messaging intervention, called SmartMom, in promoting healthy behaviors during pregnancy. The study will randomly assign participants to either the intervention group (SmartMom text messaging) or the control group (standard text messaging with general information about pregnancy). The primary outcome measures include changes in weight during pregnancy, attendance at prenatal care visits, and secondary measures include changes in health knowledge, health literacy, fear of childbirth, depression, anxiety, and use of tobacco, vaping, alcohol, or cannabis. The study will also measure the rates of planned vaginal birth after cesarean, exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge, and adverse pregnancy outcomes. The study will collect data throughout pregnancy and birth, and the incremental costs per incidence of suboptimal weight gain and inadequate prenatal care avoided will also be measured. The keywords provided by Centre Hospitalier Valida related to the study include prenatal education, perinatal outcomes, text messaging, mobile health, mental health, and health behavior."
