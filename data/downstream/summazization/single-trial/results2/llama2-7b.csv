1,"[/INST]  The clinical trial compares the effectiveness of two mattresses with different support surfaces in preventing pressure ulcers in bedridden patients. The study randomly assigns participants to either an experimental group (massage mattress with cube/block system) or a control group (standard of care mattress). Both groups are monitored for four weeks, with daily pressure ulcer assessments conducted using a specific form. The primary outcome measure is the number of patients without pressure ulcers at the end of the four-week period. The study aims to determine whether the massage mattress with cube/block system is more effective in preventing pressure ulcers than the standard of care mattress.

Participants:

* Low risk rating on the Braden Scale
* Voluntary informed consent from conscious patients and consent from the legal guardian for unconscious or confused patients
* Absence of pressure sores upon admission to the clinics
* BMI (Body Mass Index) not exceeding 30.00 (as classified by the World Health Organization)

Exclusion Criteria:

* Patient's bed was changed in less than ten days after inclusion in the study
* Patient referral
* Discharge Exhitus was the exclusion criteria

Age:

* Minimum Age: 18 Years

Sexes:

* All

Accepts Healthy Volunteers:

* Accepts Healthy Volunteers

Study Plan:

* Design: Prevention
* Allocation: Randomized
* Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment
* Masking: Triple

Arms and Interventions:

* Experimental: Group I (Massage mattress with cube/block system)
	+ Device: Massage mattress with cube/block system
	+ Intervention: Patients with an odd number were assigned to group I, while those with an even number were allocated to group II. Patients in group I were provided with a pressure sore prevention bed featuring a support surface with vibration (massage) capabilities, a cube/block system creating a low-pressure area, and a ventilation system, routinely utilized in the unit. For group II patients, a viscoelastic pressure sore prevention mattress with an orthopedic support surface, routinely employed in the unit, was used.
* No Intervention: Group II (Standard of care)

Primary Outcome Measures:

* Number of patients without pressure ulcers

Time Frame:

* Patients were followed up for four weeks."
2,"[/INST]  The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of exercise with augmented reality glasses on metabolic parameters, anthropometric measurement values, and quality of life in children aged 10-12 with type 1 diabetes. The study is designed as a randomized controlled trial with two arms: an experimental group that will receive exercise with augmented reality glasses, and a control group that will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome measures include changes in HbA1c levels, body mass index, and quality of life scores over a 12-week period. The study will recruit 40 children with type 1 diabetes from the province where the research will be conducted, and the results will be analyzed to determine the effectiveness of exercise with augmented reality glasses on metabolic parameters and quality of life in children with type 1 diabetes."
3,"[/INST]  The study aims to investigate the effect of virtual reality on preoperative anxiety before abdominal surgery. The study will randomly assign participants into one of three groups: experimental (virtual reality), placebo (watching the same video without virtual reality), and control (no intervention). The primary outcome measures will be the preoperative anxiety level, which will be assessed using a smart wristband and the Visual Anxiety Scale (VAS-A) before and after watching the video. The study will be conducted at the Trakya University Health Research Center General Surgery Clinic between March 1, 2023, and December 1, 2023. The sample size will consist of 96 participants, with 32 participants in each group. The study will be designed as an experimental research with a parallel assignment, and the data will be analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The study findings will provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of virtual reality in reducing preoperative anxiety before abdominal surgery."
4,"[/INST]  The clinical trial ""Clinical Performance and Safety of Suture-TOOL for Abdominal Wound Closure in Men and Women Patients Undergoing Elective Open Abdominal Surgery"" aims to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Suture-TOOL device for abdominal wound closure in patients undergoing elective open abdominal surgery. The study is a single-arm, prospective, interventional study with no masking (open-label). Eligible participants are male and female patients aged 18 years or older undergoing elective open abdominal surgery with an anticipated incision length of ≥ 12 cm. The primary outcome measure is the proportion of patients with a Suture length/Wound length (SL/WL) ratio ≥ 4, which will be measured during laparotomy closure. Secondary outcome measures include stitch count, numbers of sutures used, incision closure time, surgeons' comfort with the device during closure, and surgeons' satisfaction with the final closure result. The study excludes patients with abdominal surgery, previous abdominal surgery, midline hernia, cutaneous infection, fistula, psoriasis of abdominal skin, morbid obesity, or significant history of renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, respiratory, skin, haematological, endocrine, or neurological diseases. The study plan includes screening, informed consent, and laparotomy closure with the Suture-TOOL device."
5,"[/INST]  The Immune Biomarker Study for Salivary Gland Carcinoma is a clinical trial investigating the immune characteristics of patients with primary salivary gland carcinoma in the head and neck region, as well as healthy controls. The study aims to evaluate the changes in the immune matrix and immune cell composition in response to treatment. The study will measure the observation of changes in an established immune matrix, longitudinal immunophenotyping of patients, analysis of cytokines in peripheral blood, analysis of patient's metabolic state, and analysis of patient's microbiomic state. The study will include three participant groups: Observational Arm, Control Group 1, and Control Group 2. The study will collect blood, saliva, and stool samples from the participants for immune characteristic evaluation. The study will be conducted over a period of up to 5 years."
