Background:Acetylation stimulates transcriptional activation of Tcf-4 target genes in the Wnt-signaling pathway. Results: Nuclear acetylation of b-catenin regulates recruitment of nuclear transcriptional corepressor Mdm2 and facilitates Tcf-4mediated gene repression. Conclusion: Acetylation of b-catenin is necessary for gene silencing. Significance: Inhibiting acetylation of b-catenin prevents Wnt-dependent gene silencing by increasing Tcf-4 interaction with corepressors and decreasing interaction with coactivators. . 4 The abbreviations used are: Wnt, wingless-type (Drosophila); HDAC, histone deacetylase; HDACi, histone deacetylase inhibitors; RXR, retinoid X receptor; NCOR, nuclear co-repressor; HDAC4-NT, amino terminus of histone deacetylase 4; URA, uracil-rich areas; TOPFlash, TGF␤-activated, smad-interacting transcription factor luciferase reporter.

## Modification of chromatin by histone acetylation and deacetylation regulates gene expression and affects developmental processes by influencing transcription factor (tf) access and activity. in the canonical
Wnt-signaling pathway, b-catenin-Tcf4 interaction is acetylated by histone acetyltransferase (HAT) p300/CREB binding protein, and deacetylation is reversed by nuclear corepressor (NCOR)-associated histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4, a potent repressor of Tcf4 activity. Here we found that acetylation of b-catenin was required for gene repression by NCOR at the Wnt-responsive promoters. This effect of acetylation was mediated by recruitment of NCOR-associated HDAC4 to the promoters, which resulted in decreased histone acetylation, increased histone H3K9 dimethylation, and decreased Tcf4 interaction with promoters. On the other hand, acetylation inhibited b-catenin recruitment to the active promoters that were independent of NCOR by increasing interaction with coactivator C"

Input Text: The Effect of Exercise on Metabolic Parameters, Anthropometric Measurement Values and Quality of Life

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic metabolic disease characterized by insulin deficiency. T1DM is one of the most common chronic diseases in childhood. In the 10th Diabetes Atlas (2021) data of the International Diabetes Association (IDF), it is stated that the population of children aged 19 and under is 2.61 billion in the world, approximately 1.2 million of these children have T1DM, and there are approximately 150 thousand new children diagnosed with T1DM every year in the world. In the same report, it was stated that there are approximately 26 thousand children aged 19 and under with T1DM in Turkey. T1DM, whose treatment and management is complex, causes both children and their parents to encounter many problems. These problems cause deterioration in quality of life and perceived well-being in children with T1DM. The problems experienced in this direction, adaptation problems and decreased quality of life lead to deterioration of metabolic control in children with T1DM. Children with T1DM who cannot adapt to their disease may have acute and chronic complications that lead to deterioration of metabolic control. One of the most important complications seen in children with T1DM is osteopenia, which tends to increase gradually. Proper nutrition, physical activity, insulin therapy and follow-up of complications have an important place in preventing complications that may develop in children with T1DM, ensuring metabolic control and increasing their quality of life. Exercise in T1DM; reducing the need for insulin and increasing its effect, providing blood glucose control, increasing muscle strength, providing weight control, increasing body fat and muscle mass, increasing body fluid ratio, increasing bone mineralization, positively affecting the cardiovascular system, reducing blood fats, increasing self-conditioning, It provides many benefits such as increasing confidence and reducing stress. Despite the numerous benefits of exercise, studies have shown that children with T1DM do not exercise regularly and do not want to do traditional (walking, running, cycling, swimming, etc.) exercises. In this direction, exercise that requires continuity in diabetes management can be made dynamic for children with T1DM by using different approaches. For this reason, it is thought that structured exercise with augmented reality glasses (AR) that can respond to the reactions of the child with T1DM will be more dynamic and will prevent macrovascular complications such as osteopenia and increase the quality of life in children with T1DM by providing metabolic control.

 <EOD> On the Relative Stability of Enantiomers.
In this article we report the results of a computational study of the enantiomerization of monosubituted propane (13) and pentaerythritol (19) in their gas and liquid-phase environments. The structures of these molecules are generated through the random combination of 1 or 10 isomeric atoms chosen at random; the resulting set of structures is then refined based on the conformational properties of the compounds, and the relative energies of the resulting conformers are evaluated through hybrid density functional theory calculations. A very satisfactory agreement is found to exist between the calculated enantiomer-stability ratios and the experimental trends reported in various sources. <EOD> Cerebrospinal Fluid HIV RNA Load in Neurologically Deteriorated Patients with Antiretroviral Therapy
Our objective was to study cerebrospinal fluid HIV RNA load in four cases of patients presenting a cerebrospinal fluid HIV RNA concentration greater than 10 000 copies/mL and an increase of the HIV encephalitis (HIVE) score of 2 to 3 points per month despite an undetectable serum HIV RNA level. Our results suggest that intact blood brain barrier permits a high level of HIV RNA to reach the cerebrospinal fluid in the presence of intraventricular HIV encephalitis. <EOD> The Influence of Dietary Calcium on the Phagocytic Activity of Rat Macrophages
To assess the influence of dietary calcium supplementation on the efficacy of phagocytosis in cellular immunity, macrophage phagocytosis was investigated in male Sprague‐Dawley rats fed purified diets containing either 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5% dietary calcium on a per‐calorie basis for 4 weeks. Calcium restriction induced a decrease in the per cent of circulating granulocytes and a decrease in the number of circulating monocytes. The phagocytic activity of peritoneal exudate cells from 1·5% calcium diet‐fed (rats fed calcium‐replete Purina 5020 rats 1·0 and 1·5% dietary calcium) animals was measured by the in vitro phagocytosis of heat‐killed Staphylococcus aureus. The results of these studies indicated that a moderate reduction in dietary calcium consumption results in impaired macrophage phagocytic activity. Furthermore, an increase in dietary calcium supplementation over 1% had no further beneficial effects on the percentage of macrophage monophagocytic activity in rats. <EOD> Recommendations for Echocardiographic Assessment of Native Valvular Regurgitation: a Report from the American Society of Echocardiography.

Background, rationale and objectives
====================

Disease: Laparotomy
Condition: Laparotomy


Primary: Laparotomy wound closure
Secondary: Laparotomy wound closure


Purposes: The aim of the I-SIMPLE trial is to investigate the efficacy and feasibility of the suture device Suture-TOOL ® in order to optimise wound closure after laparotomy closure. Suture device Suture-TOOL ® will be used in patients which underwent an elective open abdominal surgery. The purpose is to develop a single step suture technique with excellent cosmetic results, minimal pain, low infection rate, easy and time effective handling with minimal suture count and comparable stitch strength.


Patient population
==================

Inclusion criteria
Exclusion criteria




Design and methods
==================================
The I-SIMPLE trial is designed as a prospective, interventional, phase IV study with a single-group. It is intended to include 125 patients in total for 30 centres across 15 European countries. Patients undergoing an elective open abdominal surgery are randomised 2:1:1 into three groups for laparotomy closure and post-interventional follow ups 3 and 6 months respectively. A total of 60 laparoscopically assisted laparotomy closures and 40 laparotomy closures will be performed using Suture-TOOL ® . The trial aims to demonstrate that laparotomy closure with Suture-TOOL ® reduces suture length per cm abdominal wound length (SL/WL ratio) compared to standard closure methods. The SL ratio was identified to be the most useful outcome measure to compare efficacy and time savings in wound closure, because it combines relevant features of stitches and stitch lengths into one value. The feasibility and safety of the technique will be evaluated by the stitch count and incision closure time, respectively. Furthermore wound healing results are assessed.


Participating Investigators, Sites and Sponsor
===================================
The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that laparotomy closure with Suture-TOOL ® reduces the SL/WL ratio compared to standard closure methods. The SL/WL ratio was identified to be the most useful outcome measure to compare efficacy and time saving in wound closure, because it combines relevant features of suture stitches and suture lengths into one value. The secondary objective is to demonstrate an advantage regarding stitch count and the closure time measured in seconds.


Suture Device
==================

Suture-TOOL ® is suture device for fast and standardized closure of the abdominal fascia. The device includes individual surgical stitches which are attached to a ring for easy handling. Due to its straight and needle-like shape, Suture-TOOL ® can be inserted only in one direction.


Methodology
=============================
Laparotomy closure is performed using an abdominal suture device called Suture-TOOL ® . Suture-TOOL ® consists of 4-fold absorbable sutures (Vicryl Rapide, 7.0), which are attached to a plastic ring. The ring is available in different sizes (2, 10, 20, and 30 sutures per ring) and different lengths: 100, 140 and 180mm. Each ring is provided with 10 or 18 stitches for 10 and 18cm incision length, respectively.

 <EOD> Effect of high molecular weight dextran on human erythrocyte lipid peroxidation.
Human erythrocyte lipid peroxidation was analyzed by measuring the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in plasma and in the supernatant of erythrocyte suspensions following the addition of free fatty acids and dextran of different molecular weights. Lipid peroxidation was higher following the addition of 16:0 to 14% erythrocytes and 18:0 to 19% erythrocytes, in the presence or absence of 50% of the two concentrations of dextran tested. The results suggest that dextran, at the concentrations used, may not be considered protective or stimulatory in human erythrocyte lipid peroxidation. <EOD> A comparison of two intra-operative imaging devices for the detection of early intra-articular loose bodies in total knee arthrotomy.
Detection of loose bodies in the joint during total knee arthrotomy can be difficult, and may lead to intra-operative and/or post-operative problems. Intra-operative fluoroscopy can help surgeons to locate loose bodies, but often has limitations in the ability to detect small loose bodies. The purpose of this study was to compare the ability of hand-held and fixed arthroscopic fluoroscopic units for identification of early intraarticular loose bodies in knee arthrotomy. Fifty cases were randomly divided into two groups (25 cases each) and fluoroscopy was performed with both a hand-held and a fixed arthroscopic device in each case. In the hand-held group, intra-operative findings with the use of fluoroscopy were compared with plain radiographs obtained post-operatively, while the fixed arthroscopic images were compared with intra-operative arthroscopic images. The ability of both devices for detection of intra-articular loose bodies was graded as 0, no loose bodies; 1, loose bodies detected; 2, loose bodies not detected. For each device, the average intra-operative, post-operatively and average difference in grading, the number of cases graded as 0, 1 and 2, differences between the grading of two devices, and the time required for performing fluoroscopy were compared and evaluated. The average intra-operative and post-operative gradings of loose bodies detected were significantly higher in the hand-held group than the fixed arthroscopic device (p 24 days in the hand-handed group and between post-operative day 12 and 14 in the fixed arthroscopic device group. None of the results was significant. Intra-operative fluoroscopy with the use of either a hand-held or fixed arthroscopic device can be used for the detection of loose bodies and it has many advantages, especially in cases like small loose bodies and/or very large joints. Since it is easily available, a hand-held fluoroscope is less cost-effective but more efficient than a fixed arthroscopic device. <EOD> Pooled Analysis of the Toxicity of Hydrogen Peroxide Deposition on Human Corneas Using the Rigid Gas Permeable Lens
Purpose: To determine whether hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) diffuses into soft contact lenses when using Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) lenses and to observe the inflammatory response of the Rigid Gas Permeable (RGP) lens using staining of a human cornea with neutral red to detect dehydrogenase activity. Methods: The lenses were placed on healthy corneas for 6 hours and the change in value was observed. For 6 lenses, 3 were kept in a solution treated with the neutral red reagent and the other 3 in a neutralized buffer washed with 0.2% H2O2. Results: In the treated lens, the cornea color was green or yellowish green stained with neutral red. In the untreated lens, no color change was observed on the cornea. In the treated group, color"

 <EOD> 3D Quantum Hall State with a Broken Crystalline Symmetry and a Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy.
We show that the quantum Hall state at filling factor ν=2 on anisotropic bilayers where the two layers have different strengths of the intralayer Coulomb attraction is the ground state in the low-temperature limit. The ground state wave function is characterized by the total electron charge density σxy on the two planes with σxx=σyy, σxz=σyz. Furthermore, a magnetic field may introduce a magnetocrystalline anisotropy with four broken symmetry planes with spins in the same direction, which does not exist in 3D integer quantum Hall state. <EOD> The C-terminus of tau antagonizes the neurite inhibition: implications for filament formation and axonal transport.

Proteolytic fragments of tau appear in the brains of patients with frontotemporal dementia and Parkinson disease. The C-terminus of tau is thought to fold back to block the N-terminal region for proper incorporation of tau with microtubules. To determine whether the C-terminus of tau directly antagonizes the neurite outgrowth inhibitory activity of extracellular full-length tau, we fused the human tau isoform 0N3R with GFP and constructed deletion mutants of the C-terminus. An expression pattern and localization pattern of these fused tau proteins were examined by immunohistochemistry. All mutant taus were found to have the same localization pattern in the intracellular and extracellular environment, i.e., the mutant taus were localized in the cytoplasm and neurites when expressed in cultured cortical neurons and were found in the conditioned media of the transfected HEK293A cells. By monitoring neurite outgrowth in cultured cortical neurons, we found that the fused GFP-tau had the same neurite inhibition activity as unlabeled full-length tau, which has the highest neurite inhibition activity among the full-length tau isoforms. These results suggest that the C-terminal fragment of tau itself does not inhibit neurite outgrowth. However, it antagonizes the neurite inhibition in an additive manner with the GFPfused full-length tau. Our studies also reveal that the fused GFP alone has a direct inhibitory effect on neurite outgrowth, which is suppressed by the GFP-fused tau but not by the mutant tau that is missing the last three amino acids; therefore the tau C-terminus seems to have a stronger inhibitory activity than GFP and to antagonize the inhibition by the GFP fused tau. In addition, we found that the GFP-fused tau and the unlabeled mutants that lack the second and third serines form the fibrils that bind to and are transported by the bidirectional motors; therefore, we propose that the C-terminal fragment of tau does not interfere with the binding of filaments to the bidirectional motors, and the truncation of tau may change its properties of binding to the bidirectional motors.Keywords Tau protein ·Frontotemporal dementia ·Parkinson disease ·Microtubule assembly ·Neuronal transport Roles of the C-terminus of tau 348 J.

 <EOD> The B-type cyclin CYCB2;2 promotes cell proliferation and is transcriptionally regulated by the brassinosteroid receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1.
Flowering, or the transition from vegetative to reproductive growth, is under tight developmental, environmental, and genetic control. For most plants vernalization and a critical photoperiod are two important triggers of flowering. In Arabidopsis, the flowering pathway is regulated by a network of transcription factors, including Arabidopsis Flowering Locust protein orthologs (APETALA1 and CAULIFLOWER). Although these genes have been demonstrated to play an essential role in the flowering response, the transcriptional regulation of these genes has not been understood. Because the G-protein and Brassinosteroid receptor BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSI-TIVE1 (BRI1) and its interactor BRASSINAZOLE RESISTANT1/BAK1 (SERK3/BAK1) regulate diverse pathways in plants, we speculated that these receptors would play a role in the flowering transduction pathway. Here, we report that the brassinosteroid BRI1 receptor and the G-protein regulator Gg subunit (AGG3) promote flowering in Arabidopsis. Additionally, we report that the function of the Arabidopsis Gg subunit (AGG3 or AGG2B) as a suppressor of flowering likely reflects a general role for Arabidopsis AGG3 homologue function (or the function of Gg proteins) in repressing plant growth. We show that this receptor complex (i.e. BRI1/SERK3/BAK1) can suppress the activity of the COMPOSITUM SUPPRESSOR1 transcription factor that directly regulates the floral repressor gene FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). Our data are consistent with the model that a plant receptor complex (BRI1/SERK3/BAK1) functions to counteract the function of the FLC gene and promote flowering. BRI1 negatively regulates the expression of FLC likely through the transcription factors CYCB2;2 and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1. We propose that the flowering receptor complex, like the brassinosteroid growth receptor, has a core function in plant flowering pathways that is conserved with the animal BRI1 receptor that functions in development and cancer. <EOD> Gait Analysis Using a Smartphone Based on the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network With Transition Blocks

Drivers and passengers of the vehicle may suffer traffic accident injuries. In the future, smart mobility and safe operation of the vehicle will require reliable data for driverless cars to make safe decisions. Hence, it is necessary to build a gait analysis algorithm for smartphones to identify disequilibrium, which can be used to predict driving ability. Based on the convolutional long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM) network, the first algorithm for smartphones was developed using the U-Net, which has Transitional Blocks (TBs) to analyze the stairs down/up walking gait data in public data repository. In addition, the performance of the proposed TensorFlow software and the CNN-LSTM network was tested on an ordinary smartphone, the Asus ZenFone R 2.

Study Protocol
-------------
This protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the University Hospital Udine (IRB protocol n. 2292-2023-OSS-IR) and by the Italian Ministry of Health (approval ID: EudraCT no. 2022-001374-85). The trial design was in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki (updated version 2013) and all participants signed an informed consent form 

Background of Trial


[/CANCELLED]

[/CONTINUE]
[/INST]

### Objectives
To observe a biochemical progression-free rate of (80% ± 10%) at 3-years with the new focal boost strategy. This is an exploratory trial, and we have not chosen a control arm. However, for prostate cancer, a reduction of the Gleason score has been considered by the NCCN and ASTRO (American Society for Radiation Oncology) the only way to show the effect of a focal approach by radiotherapy on the clinical results. 


* To evaluate acute and late toxicity in terms of severity and incidence (Grade 0 to Grade 5) as defined in the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v5.0

* To evaluate acute and late patients` quality of life and patient satisfaction assessing a change in IPSS and EPIC26 scores before and after the radiotherapy


[/CANCELLED]

[/CONTINUE]
[/INST]

### Primary Endpoint
The primary endpoint of the trial is to observe a Biochemical Progression Free Rate (bPFS) at 3 years defined as:

* Phoenix definition: an increase of ≥ 2 ng/mL compared to the nadir PSA value

* Proportion of subjects achieving > 50% PSA reduction from baseline and maintaining this reduction during minimum 36 months follow-up


* bPFS at 3 years: 80% +-10% to 44%.

* bPFS at 3 years: 50% +-10% to 30%.

* bPFS at 3 years: 50% +-10% to 20%.

* bPFS at 3 years: 20% +-10% to 7%.


Secondary Endpoint

* Incidence and severity of acute urinary events (UTI) at 90 days

* Incidence and severity of acute rectal events at 90 days

* Incidence and severity of late urinary events at 2 years from the initiation of radiotherapy according to the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v5.0

* Incidence and severity of late rectal events at 2 years from the initiation of radiotherapy according to the CTCAE (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events) v5.0

### Hypotheses
It is hypothesized that a focally enhanced SBRT approach in patients with prostate cancer increases the Gleason score reducing and consequently the biochemical, clinical and/or radiological prostate cancer recurrences.

### Trial design overview
In this protocol, a single cohort design with one treatment arm and the primary outcome is used.

### Study flow chart
The study is composed of a screening phase, a treatment phase, and a follow up phase. Screening phase patients will be evaluated for suitability by all necessary assessment. During the treatment phase, patients' eligibility will be verified, and the treatment will be delivered according to the treatment plan. The follow-up phase is when patients will be seen for the study for various follow-up evaluations and any other vis"

Children will play while watching an imaginary Avatar, who shows the right movements to perform in order to collect rewards. SG will be projected with a 4K projector and controlled by the child's movements, which will be tracked in markerless mode using Azure's Kinect sensor. SG will include an adaptive tool to enable the experience based on the child's specific motor skills. The dynamics of SG will be adapted by considering real motor and physiological data acquired during each SG session via a wristband. These data are necessary to keep the child in the aerobic zone (60-80% of maximum heart rate). The movements are: Side bending: Moving an obstacle to open a passage. High jump: Overcoming a low, frontal obstacle. Side lunge: Avoiding a side obstacle. Squat: Passing under a low, frontal obstacle.<br>|

Description: [/INST]
 <EOD> Enhanced sensitivity and specificity of coccoid-phase Giardia spp. detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization.
G. duodenalis and Giardia lamblia are trophozoite-phase enteroparasites that can undergo a unique developmental phase transformation with adherence to the gastrointestinal tract in a cyst form resembling protozoan coccoids. When using G. duodenalis and G. lamblia cyst-specific DNA probes in fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays that employ microscopy to enumerate fluorescent targets, it was discovered that trophozoite-phase parasites in fecal samples that contain cysts interfere with detection of cysts. Specifically, the trophozoite fluorescence signal interfered with accurate identification of cysts that can also have a variable fluorescence signal. Thus, an FISH enhanced cyst detection method (ECeDM) was developed and validated using 385 archived stool samples that had been originally tested using both culture and a commercial ELISA kit. FISH-specificity was evaluated on samples from a murine giardiasis model and in 8 clinical samples that had originally yielded Giardia spp.-specific ELISA results. ECeDM detected significantly lower (P < 0.001) percentages of cysts (28.3 ± 1.27%) compared to that of the conventional method (63.9 ± 4.3%) (P < 0.50). This 56% reduction was predominantly influenced by ELISA positive samples (63% decrease). Compared to the conventional method, ECeDM detected higher numbers of Giardia DNA from C57BL/6 mice cysts (P < 0.05). Overall, detection increased by approximately 30% (5.2 ± 2.9 to 6.9 ± 2.2%) for C57BL/6 mice (P < 0.05), whereas Giardia numbers obtained using enriched water sample preparation in ELISA results was not significantly different to the numbers obtained using the conventional method. ECeDM significantly decreased time-to-results (P = 0.003) and increased the sensitivity (P < 0.001) and specificity (P = 0.001) of Giardia cyst detection. Specificity of ECeDM was demonstrated to be 30-fold higher (98) than detection by the conventional method (3). Enhanced cyst sensitivity and specificity of detection will have implications in improving the accuracy of Giardia spp. epidemiological data and the sensitivity of diagnostic assays. <EOD> Effects of glycerol on the free energy barrier in the active transport of phosphate by yeast phosphate carrier.
A high pressure/high concentration method was developed for the incorporation of glycerol or trimethylamine-N-oxide (TAO) into phosphate carriers for transport studies. This method greatly improved the solubility of the phosphate carrier in the media and also increased the transport rate of phosphate and inhibitory potency of TAO. The effect of high glycerol concentrations on the steady-state phosphate reaction by phosphate carrier proteoliposomes was studied at 5 degrees C, a temperature for which the kinetics of the reaction is diffusion controlled. We found that glycerol increased the free energy barrier of phosphate transport across the carrier membrane by a pH- and temperature-dependent manner. The barrier effect of glycerol was reduced with the addition of TAO. A hypothetical scheme for glycerol incorporation into phosphate carriers was proposed as follows. First, glycerol was solubilized in the membrane, thereby increasing the viscosity of the hydrocarbon region of the membrane. The hydrocarbon region near the phospholipid membrane is thought to be a main barrier for the passage of phosphate from the hydrophilic protein surface to the interior aqueous phase of the liposome. The second step is the hydration of glycerol in the hydrophobic region of the liposome, which leads to the formation of a glycerol-in-water bilayer li"

Detailed Description
-----------------
Diverticular disease is a common condition in western countries with relatively uncommon complications . Fistulae complicating diverticulitis are the result of a localized perforation into adjacent viscera, and occur in 4-23% of patients hospitalized for diverticular disease[1]. The types of fistulae include colovesical, colovaginal , colotubal, coloenteric, and colocutaneous fistulae [2]. Colocutaneous fistulae occur very rarely , accounting for only 1-4% of the total number of fistulae complicating colonic diverticular disease[3]. Here we report on the use of OVASCO clip , to avoid major surgery in a particular case of colonic diverticulitis complicated by colo-cutaneous fistula.
Background: As endoscopy is less invasive maneuver and can be done without general anathesia   Colovaginal Fistula in An Idiopathic Diverticular Disease of the Sigmoid 22 Cases..., Benjelloun H  ., the authors decided to close the fistula with a combination of endoscopic clips and surgery .

# Background
Diverticular disease of the colon is clinically and anatomically divided into two categories: diverticulosis and diverticular disease. Acute complications of diverticulitis include localized peritonitis , hemoperitoneum and abscess, and complicated diverticulosis can lead to fistula formation. Fistula formation in diverticular disease is typically colovesical however, colovaginal, colo-colonic, colonovaginal, colocutaneous, colotubal, and colorectal fistulas have been reported. Colorectal and colocutaneous fistulas are most frequent . Diverticular disease of the colon accounts for 7% of all colonic disease and in the US is the leading cause of large-bowel diverticulosis   Colovaginal Fistula in An Idiopathic Diverticular Disease of the Sigmoid, Benjelloun H  .

Given that microcosm within orthopedic implants may be a reservoir for microorganisms, antimicrobials may be an attractive addition to biomaterials, minimizing peri-prosthetic infection. Lactic acid polymers appear to be one of the most promising candidates for the future development of novel drug-impregnated, antimicrobial biomaterials. Using the bioceramic hydroxyapatite as a carrier for the polymer, a biocomposite was developed. Microcosm studies showed potent antimicrobial activity of the composite against clinically relevant strains of bacteria, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Corynebacterium jeikeium. This property is important for orthopedic implants for trauma, cancer and osteolysis therapies, as many individuals who undergo these procedures are colonized with multi-drug-resistant bacteria. Furthermore, as the bioceramics present an immunogenic response in the human body, the immobilization of the polymer eliminates these undesirable side-effects. Further studies are required to test the bioceramics in vivo to determine the toxicity and effect of the bioceramics on the microbial and immune response. <EOD> A Systematic Review of Post-Traumatic Growth in the Face of Life-Threatening Illness

In the past, research into post-traumatic growth (PTG) after experiences of life threat was rare. More recently, literature on the topic has grown rapidly, particularly in relation to cancer and other life-threatening illness. The primary purpose of our systematic review was to synthesise current knowledge on factors related to PTG in cancer and other life-threatening illness, including the prevalence of PTG, and the factors most frequently identified in the literature. The review also aimed to describe the quality of the published evidence in this area. Databases including AMED, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ProQuest, PubMed, SCOPUS and WAME were searched in summer 2021 by two reviewers. Studies published in English that reported PTG and cancer or another life-threatening illness were included. Screening, quality appraisal and data extraction were performed by two reviewers, with disputes resolved by a third reviewer. Findings showed that 25% of 594 people who experienced life-threatening illness had developed PTG. Common factors influencing PTG include demographic factors, treatment factors and psychosocial factors such as coping strategies, self-efficacy and a strong social support network. The available data are largely non-randomised and often based on self-report measures. Future studies could focus on high quality cohort study designs in order to confirm the presence of PTG, identify the factors that influence it, and develop evidence-based interventions to increase PTG and wellbeing in those suffering from life-threatening illnesses.

# Introduction
The term post-traumatic growth (PTG) was introduced in the early 1990s and is defined as a ""positive psychological change experienced as a result of coping with highly challenging life circumstances"" [1,   Posttraumatic Growth: Conceptual foundations and Empirical Evidence, Tedeschi  . Examples of highly challenging life circumstances include life-threatening illness, injury and trauma. PTG has been extensively studied in the context of traumatic experiences including war, domestic violence and the diagnosis of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Posttraumatic Growth: Reciprocal Effects and the Moderating Role..., Hiraoka  .

Input Text: Dosage of Propofol Based on Lean Body Weight Stay tuned for information overload

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Patients who will be induction of anesthesia with propofol will have a body analysis with Tanita before the operation. Patients' height, weight, age, gender and other general information will be recorded. Total body weight (TBW), ideal body weight (IBW) and lean body weight (LBW) of the patients will be calculated. Patients over the age of 18 who will be operated under general anesthesia for 2-6 hours will be included. Patients with propofol allergy or contraindicated to propofol are included in the study. In order to decide and try the most appropriate weight-based scalar for propofol dosing for anesthesia induction to be evaluated by specifying patients who need additional propofol during intubation in the study, Ingrande et al. 80 patients with a mean body mass index [BMI] between 18-35 and Bispectoral index (BIS). ) monitorization, propofol infusion (100 mg/kg/hour) will be started according to total body weight, and the infusion will be stopped with a BIS value between 50 and 40, and the elapsed time will be recorded. Routine anesthesia applications will be performed with neuromuscular blocker applied. The total dose of Propofol given; the dose applied to kilograms will be calculated according to TBW, IBW and LBW. And the relationship between the doses given and the body mass index will be evaluated. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of Propofol dose according to lean body weight by evaluating patients with bodymass index below 35.

Two methods of reporting the results of bone marrow transplantation have been compared for their efficacy in aiding patients in decision making regarding post‐transplantation participation in studies using unrelated donors as compared to the same patients reporting their results. Seventeen patients were interviewed after transplantation and results were analyzed both for patients as a whole and for those participating in different types of studies. Results show that those patients using the computer method were more likely to plan to participate in studies than were those using the printed report. The average time spent filling out the report was 58 minutes compared to an average time of less than 30 minutes for computer entry. The computer method was judged to be more enjoyable by the patients both immediately after transplantation or later. While significant improvements in marrow donations using the computer method were noted, the importance of having studies available to patients was also emphasized. <EOD> P047 Evaluation of the effectiveness of an online educational program for healthcare professionals on the approach to patients with inflammatory bowel diseases



# Introduction
Approximately 40% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD; ulcerative colitis: UC or Crohn's disease: CD) will experience a flare-up during the course of their illness. Early diagnosis is critical to achieving better patient prognosis and reducing the burden of acute and chronic morbidity. Patients with active disease report delays in starting therapy, which in turn prolongs the suffering of symptoms. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of a webinar-delivered educational program for healthcare professionals (HCPs), designed to improve the understanding and diagnosis of IBD in primary care.

## Aim
To assess the effectiveness of an online educational program for HCPs in promoting the early diagnosis of IBD in primary care.

# Methods
The study was a single-centre prospective before-and-after online survey of primary care professionals (general practitioners and nurses). Participants were invited to take part in an online educational program, designed to promote early IBD recognition and diagnosis (a 20 minute video and accompanying 5-question posttest). Following the release of the webinar, participants were emailed a link to a beforeand-after survey. A comparison of the responses in the 'before-test' in both the pre-webinar and post-webinar survey groups was performed for six key statements. Additional secondary outcomes, specifically the ability to identify and treat various symptoms of IBD, were assessed.
The data was analysed through descriptive statistics and a generalised linear mixed model. This method was chosen due to the hierarchical nature of the data (HCPs clustered within a single site). Effect size analysis was performed using Cohens

# Results

# Conclusion
Education of healthcare professionals on IBD can potentially be used to improve patient outcomes, and this online educational program was successful in improving physician knowledge on IBD. Early diagnosis is vital in promoting better patient prognosis, reduced IBD morbidity and minimising the burden of symptomatology. The webinar was able to demonstrate its value in promoting these key goals in physician education, signifying a successful educational program.

  8689: -------------------------------------------------------- <EOD> An investigation of a possible association between chronic graft-vs-host responses and chronic graft-vs-host disease after bone marrow transplantation in patients with severe aplastic anemia.
Fourteen consecutive patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who underwent bone marrow transplantation (BMT) following a myeloablative conditioning regimen from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling marrow donor were all transfusion-free and clinically stable after a mean of 23.8 months (3 to 79 months) post BMT, with the platelet count reaching a plateau of around 50 x 10(9)/l and hemoglobin levels above 9 g/dl, yet the neutrophil count was barely above 0.1 x 10(9)/l. Three patients developed chronic graft-vs-host responses (cGVH) from 13 through to 16 months post BMT, after being conditioned with 12 Gy total body irradiation and treated with antithymocyte globulin (ATG)-fresno for graft failure. cGVH was diagnosed if patients had sustained weight loss for three months or more and had an inflammatory syndrome with either skin lesions or gastrointestinal symptoms despite a sustained increase of the mononuclear cell count by more than 2 times of the baseline value after the nadir. The mononuclear cell count in patients with chronic graft-vs-host disease (cGvHD) and cGVH was, in fact, quite similar in this study; that is, the range of the mononuclear cell count in patients with cGVH was 1.01 x 10(1) to 2.23 x 10(10)/l and 0.21 x 10(10) to 1.58 x 10(10)/l in patients with cGVHD. The neutrophil count in patients with cGVH and cGvHD was 0.09 x 10(9) to 0.21 x 10(9)/l and 0.09 x 10(9) to 0.73 x 10(9)/l, respectively. Moreover, the mononuclear cell counts in patients with cGVH and cGVHD decreased significantly in response to treatment with anti-thymocyte globulin, cyclosporine A (10 mg/kg/day) and prednisolone. Since no evidence for clinically relevant GVH reaction could be documented after a mean follow-up period of 18.1 months post transplantation in 13 of our 14 patients, it is unlikely that these patients actually had developed cGVHD because these observations could at first be suggestive of cGVH in which symptoms or signs such as diarrhea, oral ulcers and weight loss occur because of sustained high mononuclear cell count, although none of the patients with cGvHD developed the typical symptoms of cGVHD. <EOD> .

Background, Purpose
-------------------------
Multiple myeloma is a highly treatable cancer that is characterized by the presence of malignant plasma cells that reside in the bone marrow. While overall survival from multiple myeloma has significantly improved as a result of advances in cancer treatment, including proteasome inhibitors and monoclonal antibody therapy, treatment related toxicities, especially infection, can be life-threatening. In addition to high risk for infections, multiple myeloma patients routinely experience symptoms from their cancer and its treatment, including fatigue, anorexia, pain, financial toxicity (such as problems with work productivity), financial barriers to adherence, and emotional distress. The management of symptoms can be challenging for clinicians, who may lack specialized training, and individuals diagnosed with multiple myeloma, who often endure months of cancer-induced fatigue and side effects from ongoing treatment. To date, several interventions and web-based applications have been developed for patients with cancer, including multiple myeloma, with the goal of promoting adherence through the identification and improvement of unmet needs. However, existing interventions have primarily targeted patient populations undergoing upfront stem cell transplant or maintenance of myeloma therapy. Individuals with relapsed/refractory myeloma undergoing stem cell transplant represent a unique population for which symptom management interventions should be developed, and in particular the impact of these interventions on daily symptoms and well-being remains to be established. To expand interventions for individuals with multiple myeloma and explore their impact, this study will use digital health coaching, a relatively new approach to patient care, for the promotion of symptoms, well-being, and health.

What is multiple myeloma? -------------------------
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which constitute less than 1% of all blood cells. Bone pain, fatigue, and muscle weakness are common myeloma symptoms. The cancer disrupts the body’s normal processes, which are coordinated by plasma cells; myeloma reduces serum protein levels and damages the immune system’s ability to defend the body. The presence of multiple myeloma can be confirmed by measuring protein in the blood and urine and the level of a protein that stimulates other cells to make antibodies.

What treatments are available for multiple myeloma? -----------------------
New, highly effective treatments have emerged for multiple myeloma that will likely lead to dramatically increased survival rates. These therapies include antimyeloma drugs (e.g., proteasome inhibitors and immunomodulatory agents), which interfere with the growth of myeloma cells, new biologic therapies that promote tumor destruction through immune processes, and antibody treatments that interfere with the growth and spread of tumor cells. Chemotherapy and radiation may help prevent multiple myeloma progression when applied before stem cell transplant. Stem cell transplant is the gold standard therapy for patients with relapse/refractory multiple myeloma; this treatment helps regenerate multiple myeloma stem cells. Supportive care therapies are used to help patients tolerate multiple myeloma treatments and relieve symptoms, including drugs that block blood cell destruction, oral therapies, biologic therapies, and pain medications.

What symptoms does multiple myeloma cause? --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Symptoms of multiple myeloma include fatigue, pain, bone damage (e.g., fracture and bone lesions), fever, weight loss, dehydration, renal failure, anemia, and infections. Infected individuals are susceptible to potentially life-threatening complications from infections.

What is the impact of multiple myeloma?

Patients with multiple myeloma generally report a poorer quality of life than those without multiple myeloma. The extent to which these and other symptoms affect function (e.g., work productivity and activity limitation) remains to be examined in relation to multiple myeloma diagnosis and treatment.

| Randomization | Probability assignments in each group, such as ""randomized assignment to surgical groups"" (e.g. randomization procedure and block design) or no explanation of how the treatment assignment is made. This term is limited to methods of nonindividualized randomization; this excludes assignment methods involving random numbers assigned to individuals (e.g. in a sequence of number assignment, the sequence being used would constitute the assignment method) or to groups of individuals (a simple list of randomly selected patients would constitute the assignment method). Note that the methods used to perform individual group assignments or randomization should not be reported in an abstract if the details are reported in published reports. |
| Blinding (masking) | Assignment or treatment assignments. |
| Sample size | Quantity of individuals included in the experiment. |
| Allocation | Assigned to one or more interventions so that there were multiple potential groups (e.g. control group, intervention group, combined controls, and combined interventions.) |
| Number analysed | The number of participants or samples actually analysed on an outcome in the report. This can be different for any given outcome as it depends both on what was collected during the study (e.g. if participants were asked to measure their weight themselves) and what participants provided (e.g. if participants had missing weight values because they forgot their weight scales or because they lost weight) |
| Eligible | Cases whose inclusion in the study is not affected by non-random aspects (e.g. allocation, exposure status) of the design. That is, cases in which the investigator did not choose to include or exclude the case from the study population but instead excludes the study or would apply an eligible case |
| Follow-up | Report of length of follow-up for each intervention (or exposure or other grouping) in the study. An example of follow-up time may be ""1 year or until recurrence."" For survival data or other time-to-event data, a range of follow-up time should be reported rather than only a median or mean. |
| Dropouts | Report of the number of and reasons for (if known) dropouts (participants who were randomized, but did not complete the follow-up period). An example of a dropout would be ""17 participants were randomized but 5 did not complete the study due to time constraints"" | 
| Adherence | Number (%) of participants for whom the intervention was received as specified in the study protocol. Explanatory comments, such as ""15% of participants were excluded after study commencement due to non-adherence"", are permitted. Alternatively, the number and reasons for withdrawals can be reported. It is the number and reasons for non-adherence that should be considered to be study outcomes |
| Exclusions after commencement of the study | Reasons for any participants being excluded at the time of, or after starting, the experimental intervention (as opposed to at the eligibility phase). |
| Withdrawals | Any participants who were randomized, but stopped participating in the study before the study was completed. The number and reasons should be provided (e.g. moved away, got lost to follow up, or withdrew due to adverse events) |

Health care and biomedical researchers are increasingly encouraged by funders to use research on human participant protections to address important health care concerns. In this commentary, we outline challenges for reporting of research on human participant protections: we review the types of reports that exist, describe the differences in content associated with these reports, and highlight the strengths and weaknesses of each reporting approach. We suggest several revisions of existing reporting guidelines that would promote the usefulness and uptake of both research on human participant protections and research about the effectiveness of those protections, and provide examples of useful applications for each. These revisions can further promote responsible research on human participant protections and contribute to the ethical implementation of protections in clinical practice. <EOD> Photoemission and photoabsorption of the metals from liquid surfaces.

In most developed countries, epidemiological research has pointed to a decreased fertility. As a result, the world's population is aging and most countries are faced with the problem of a steadily decreasing number of people of reproductive age, which is of special interest where population growth is related to the well-being of the state. In this light, the present study examines the fertility of the population in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan. The data are presented on the fertility for different regions of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan: the capital of Bishkek (urban population), the capital of the Jalal-Abad region (rural population), and the Kara-Balta region (rural population). The fertility data of the Republic of Kyrgyzstan, presented on an urban/rural level, demonstrate a decrease in the natural growth rate in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan from 3.07 per 1000 population in 1996 to 1.94 over the subsequent 7 years, corresponding to the annual decrease in the population in the Republic of Kyrgyzstan from 1.8% in 1996 to 1.6% in 2003. Since the rural population and the republic's territory are primarily urban, any decline in fertility will eventually reflect the fertility of the rural population. <EOD> .
A 47 year old woman was admitted for the treatment of left ventricular aneurysm detected by coronary angiogram. Coronary angiogram and left ventriculography revealed left ventricular apical aneurysm. The coronary angiograms were normal. The endocardial viability was evaluated by thallium and Tc-myocardial perfusion images. A positive study and also 24 hour plasma renin values were high. The patient was treated by surgery because of serious coronary angina pectoris. At two month follow-up period after surgery, there was no ventricular arrhythmia. We conclude that viable myocardium in left ventricular apical aneurysm could be identified by radionuclide imaging, and surgery seems to be an effective procedure for the patients. <EOD> A Review on Mechanism of Carbohydrate Molecules as Antimicrobial Agents

In ICU patients, the respiratory variability correlated significantly with the intensity of dyspnea measured using the MV-RDOS.

 <EOD> Paget's disease of bone and osteoporosis.
A 78-year-old white man was referred to the bone disease clinic because of back pain and spasm associated with a fracture of the vertebral body of the fifth lumbar spine. Paget's disease of bone was diagnosed by scintigraphy (Fig. 1) , roentgenography, radiographs (Figs. 2 and 3), and needle biopsy. The fractured vertebral body and the pelvic and left humeral bones and ribs also showed radiographic abnormalities. An iliac crest osteolytic biopsy was performed because the ribs were not obtainable. In addition, multiple osteolytic foci, presumed to be ar"

Inclusion criteria: Pain and paraesthesiae in the distribution of the median nerve. Positive Tinel signs over the transverse carpal ligament. Median nerve compression at the wrist was demonstrated by ultrasound or electrodiagnostic studies.
Eligible patients. The following exclusion criteria were applied for eligible patients: patients with secondary CTS, such as hypothyroidism, diabetic neuropathy, rheumatologic diseases, carpopedal spasm, and local fibrosis; patients with previous wrist surgery, especially wrist arthroplasty; patients with cervical spondylosis; patients with systemic diseases, such as connective tissue diseases, and metabolic disorders; patients with peripheral neuropathy; patients refusing to undergo the procedure. Patients with psychological or emotional disorders that hamper them from completing the study. Patients with skin disorders, such as psoriasis or eczema. Patients who have not been compliant with the scheduled follow-up examination for 12 months after surgery. Informed consent was obtained from all patients that their data could be used in scientific publications.
Methods: Twenty-six patients with primary CTS were recruited. All patients were randomly grouped into groups A (the mini-incision approach) and B (conventional approaches). The preoperative data, postoperative pain (visual analogue scale for pain), scar effect (scarring cosmesis rating scale) (SCAR-Q) score, and operative time were examined and documented. The SCAR-Q scores ranged from 3 to 21 (poor to excellent aesthetic outcomes) and were classified according to the following: good aesthetic outcomes (SCAR-Q <10), fair aesthetic outcomes (10 16), and poor aesthetic outcomes (SCAR-Q ≥17) (5). Statistical Analysis: Statistical significance was determined at p <0. 05.
Results: Both the groups A and B presented good outcome. There were no statistically significant differences in visual analogue scale score, SCAR-Q, or operative time.
Conclusions: We have proved that the mini-incision release technique is an effective procedure for the treatment of primary CTS.

29,"[/INST] This study was carried out in a Spanish long-term care center. Its aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of an exercise plan using action observation training with patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). A total of 10 patients with MCI without any other neurological or musculoskeletal pathology were selected. The patients without cognitive impairment were selected based on a Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) test ranging from 26 to 30. Patients with MCI were divided into three groups. Control Group: Patients with MCI who did not perform therapist-led imitation exercises. Observation Group: Patients with MCI who observed the therapist carrying out imitation exercises. Peer Observation Group: Patients with MCI who observed someone without cognitive impairment carrying out imitation exercises. Members of all groups performed the exercises twice a week for 5 weeks. The main study variables were measured. The intervention was effective in improving cognitive status, upper limb functionality, ADL, gait, and balance in MCI patients. Patients observed peers or the therapist improved faster and to a greater degree than those who received no therapist-led intervention.

 <EOD> The influence of surface contamination and sample matrix on the surface morphology of laser cleaned Ti-6Al-4 V.
Laser cleaning or laser peening is becoming an increasingly popular method for enhancing the fatigue life and corrosion performance of Ti-6Al-4 V. However, the cleaning efficiency depends heavily on the contamination state of the surface and on the controlling parameters. Herein, laser cleaning parameters and sample contamination conditions play a determinative role in surface morphology, surface roughness, and elemental composition. In addition, annealing also affects the surface morphology of cleaned Ti-6Al-4 V. A number of contaminants with different chemical compositions were successfully cleaned from the Ti-6Al-4 V surface using laser cleaning, and the laser cleaning process was explored. It provides insights into the removal efficiency of the laser cleaning process for various contaminants and reveals the cleaning mechanism. Based on the laser cleaning parameters used, the mechanism of the laser cleaning process was discussed theoretically and was examined systematically by microscopy and optical emission spectroscopy. Experimental results showed that the effects of laser cleaning were remarkable for each contaminant. The surface morphology and roughness varied slightly with different contaminants on the same sample, whereas the element composition was almost the same. <EOD> .
It is shown that pyrimidylic nucleosides (CMP, UMP, dCMP ), but not the deoxynucleosides and dUTP, inhibit the binding of dTTP to the substrate site of dTTPase of the bacillus DNA polymerase I preparation. The antagonism exerted by the pyrimidylic nucleosides is completely explained on the assumption that the products of their hydrolysis, pyrimidine nucleosides, competitively inhibit dTTP binding. <EOD> The clinical value of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist administration on the development of ovarian adrenal rest tumors in congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Objective Congenital hyperplasia is an adrenal hyperplasia usually caused by enzyme defects of steroidogenesis, such as 21-hydroxylase, 17α-hydroxylase or 21-hydroxylase/17,20-desmolase deficiency. Patients diagnosed with congenital hyperplasia have a high incidence of ovarian adrenal rest tumors. In this study, we aimed to define the effects of GnRHa administration on ovarian adrenal rest tumor development in congenital hyperplasia. Methods A total of 17 girls diagnosed with congenital hyperplasia (9 with P450c21 deficiency, 8 with 17OHD, 1 with 3β-HSD deficiency), and 13 healthy girls were retrospectively examined in the study. A short history was taken from the patients’ parents and clinical findings were recorded. The girls’ medical records were analyzed and all investigated girls underwent the hormone tests and imaging methods. Results Twelve of the 17 patients experienced menarche with GnRHa administration. Of the 13 girls who did not receive GnRHa therapy, the age of menarche was not determined in 5 of them and 8 of them are still pre-pubertal. The clinical symptoms of the girls with P450c21 deficiency improved with glucocorticoid treatment applied with or without mineralocorticoid, while those with 17OHD benefited from spironolactone. A total of 7 girls were diagnosed with ovarian adrenal rest tumors either spontaneously or by imaging methods, 4 of which were spontaneously developed ovarian adrenal rest tumors. All individuals with ovarian adrenal rest tumors complained about menstrual irregularities. Conclusions Menstruation normalization and increased ad"

The diagnosis of gastric cancer has been based on surgery or endoscopic biopsy. In order to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) as a screening modality for gastric cancer we performed EMR on patients suspected to have superficial gastric cancer. For this purpose we developed the EMR device which combines a diathermy snare with endoscopes. The efficacy of endoscopic screening with EMR device was investigated in 2561 subjects. The 2561 subjects included 1969 males and 592 females, with ages ranging from 22 to 87 years. Endoscopic findings in all of the observed subjects were divided into two groups; (1) non-cancerous group and (2) cancerous or cancer suspected group. In the present study, the rate of gastric cancer was 2.36%. However, in patients aged 55 years or over with a positive finding by screening, 188 (7.79%) subjects had gastric cancers. The rate of gastric cancer was 3.50% in the patients aged 69 or over and 7.50% in those with a positive finding by screening. EMR detected five cancers which seemed to be superficial spreading early cancers with no ulcer findings and 4 of these cancers could be diagnosed correctly by EMR. These cancers were small in number and spread over the mucosa, or infiltrated the mucosal layer in the depressed portion, although all of them were detected through the endoscopic screening using EMR device, in which the sensitivity was 100%. We conclude that EMR device has the advantage that it is minimally invasive and is applicable for screening of superficial spreading early gastric cancers. <EOD> .
The diabetes mellitus is very frequent in our country and is becoming a growing burden of health and social services. However, we must stress the fact that this disease is a preventable one. This fact should be considered by Public Health policies on the prevention of diabetes mellitus. <EOD> Diagnosis of early‐stage lymph node metastasis in colon cancer by endoscopic submucosal dissection combined with sentinel lymph node biopsy: A case report
Colonoscopy is important for the screening of colorectal neoplasms. The application of endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) is limited, as some submucosal cancers infiltrate deeper through the muscularis mucosae. We report a case of early‐stage submucosal colon cancer diagnosed by ESD combined with sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy. A 40‐year‐old woman presented with a solitary submucosal lesion (SMC) in the sigmoid colon. The lesion was enlarged to 1.5 cm in size at the first follow‐up colonoscopy 1 year later. ESD resection of the lesion was performed under conscious sedation. The histopathological examination of the lesion revealed mucinous adenocarcinoma invading into the submucosal layer but without any signs of deep invasion. The SLN biopsy using indigo carmine dye and the nanocarbon marker for the SLN identification demonstrated no metastases in lymph nodes from other organs. The patient had an uneventful recovery without any operative morbidities. In conclusion, the multidisciplinary treatment strategy of ESD resection combined with SLN biopsy may provide a new technique for the diagnosis and the treatment of early‐stage colon cancer. <EOD> Tackling Drug-Resistant Bacteria in Healthcare.
Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria have become an urgent threat to modern medicine, and efforts to combat these infections are increasingly falling short. Detection of resistant bacteria is a fundamental step in patient care and infection control. However, current culture-based methods are inefficient, slow, and often lack sensitivity. Rapid and reliable detection techniques would enable physicians to identify resistant bacteria sooner, enabling the most appropriate antibiotic regimen to be initiated at the patient's bedside thereby limiting treatment delay and reducing mortality.

Intratumoral injection of chemotherapeutic drugs in advanced cancer has been shown to be effective in prolonging life. However, administration of chemotherapeutic agents by intratumoral injection is invasive with potential side effects, especially for patients who require multiple administration. To address such a problem, we incorporated tumor-targeted folate ligands onto siRNA molecules (siFAK1) that target focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a key regulator of tumor progression, and investigated the efficacy of a localized intratumoral injection of these siRNAs in colon adenocarcinoma murine xenograft models. In this study, we report the development of a noninvasive method for localized intratumoral siRNA delivery using a novel colloidal chemistry-based nanogel formulation. The nanogel microparticles (NGMs) are formed by cross-linking cationic liposomes with alginate. The alginate backbone of the NGM is degraded in the inflamed colon by the local endo-lysosomal secretion of GTPases, resulting in site-specific release of the siRNA into the tumors. Using a combination of in vitro cell-based reporter gene assays and real-time confocal live cell imaging, as well as in vivo fluorescent imaging of the tumors, we evaluated the targeted delivery of siRNA to tumor-bearing mice by intratumoral administration of the NGM-siFAK1 nanoplexes. <EOD> The role of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling in kidney injury and repair.
Recent research suggests that innate immunity is a key component of the pathophysiology of kidney diseases and that innate immune cells may serve to protect the kidney from a variety of forms of injury. However, there is mounting evidence that the innate immune response may be deleterious under certain conditions, such as ischemia and reperfusion injury and ureteral obstruction. Differences in the balance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory signals from the innate immune system may in part determine whether renal disease progresses or is ameliorated. This evidence suggests that innate immunity plays a central role in the response of the kidney to injury. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is one transmembrane receptor of the innate immune system; it recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns and cell-associated molecular patterns, which are present in or on damaged cells. TLR4 can activate multiple pathways, including those dependent on inhibitor of NF-κB, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and p38 kinase. Recent studies by our group and others have implicated TLR4 in mediating immune responses in a variety of kidney pathophysiological states. Therefore, therapies designed to inhibit TLR4 may prove valuable in the treatment of kidney disease, possibly through reducing the cellular stress associated with inflammatory pathways activated by TLR4 signaling. This review will examine the available evidence concerning"

 <EOD> Correction: Cognitive Deficits and Hippocampus Synaptic Modulation in Male Mice Offspring Exposed to Maternal Intermittent Undernutrition

Prenatal nutritional insults are correlated with deleterious changes in offspring cognition and morphological alterations on the brain in late adulthood. However, the effects of malnutrition on the cognition and hippocampic CA1 region in a mature and aging stage, in particular, are still relatively weakly. Herein, we evaluated the effects of intermittent undernutrition (UN) in pregnant rats (30 weeks old), which was induced by 24 h every 7 days, from the pregnancy day 7 to the birth. Neurometric analysis and Western Blot for the hippocampal CA1 region were performed in adult and aged male offspring rats. The intermittent UN during gestation induced a cognitive impairment in both the object recognition test and the elevated plus maze, and morphological and synaptic alterations with a reduction in the synaptic density, decrease in the area and density of the CA1 region pyramidal layer, accompanied by increased levels of Aggrecan, phospho-Aggrecan and phospho-CaMKII, in adult and aged male offspring. The intermittent UN caused more significant alterations in the expression of synaptic markers (synaptophysin and GAP-43) for CA1 hippocampal synaptic plasticity and cell-cell adhesion (Cadherin 2b) in aged male offspring. These findings suggest that intermittent undernutrition during gestation increases susceptibility to the neurodegeneration induced by malnutrition, in particular, in the adult and aging stage.

 <EOD> Causal mediation analysis in clinical nutritional epidemiology: the causal mediation analysis toolbox
Abstract Causal mediation analysis determines the mechanisms and pathways through which risk factors exert a causal effect on outcomes. Causal mediation analysis offers a powerful tool for clarifying the mechanisms through which nutritional factors may exert their effects on the development of chronic disease risk. However, there remain significant methodological challenges in conducting causal mediation analysis in the field of clinical nutrition. We introduce the causal mediation analysis toolbox, which guides readers step-by-step though several common scenarios in clinical nutritional epidemiology. The toolbox provides an overview of recent advances in causal mediation research, describes common approaches to causal mediation analysis in the field of clinical nutrition, presents novel approaches to causal mediation analysis, and discusses existing challenges and promising directions for the future of causal mediation analysis in clinical nutrition. <EOD> Role of PD-L1 in the radiation response of soft tissue sarcomas

The tumor microenvironment is a central component of cancer development and response to therapy. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane molecule commonly expressed on tumor cells and immune cells and serves as a key negative regulator of T-cell function. However, the functional role of PD-L1 in the response of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) to radiation is poorly defined. We report here on the role of PD-L1 in the tumor response to radiation using STS cell lines with low endogenous PD-L1 expression (SW982 and S116) and those that overexpress PD-L1 (HT1080 and RDES). SW982 and S116 cells expressed higher levels of β-catenin and cyclin D1 and had higher proliferation, viability, and clonogenecity relative to HT1080 and RDES cells. HT1080 and RDES cells expressed higher levels of E-cadherin. The combination of PD-L1 knockdown and radiation was effective against HT1080 and RDES cells and required E-cadherin expression, β-catenin, cell proliferation, and AKT activation. These studies demonstrate that PD-L1 deficiency impairs the proliferation, viability and radiosensitivity of STS cells, and requires E-cadherin expression, β-catenin, AKT activation and cell proliferation. These data support future clinical trials to determine the efficacy of anti-PD1/anti-PD-L1 in patients with sarcoma and to expand the scope of treatment for sarcoma patients in the future.

# Introduction
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are malignant tumors originating from mesenchymal cells that develop in visceral, parietal or cutaneous structures. These tumors comprise multiple histological subtypes, which is due to a poorly understood pathogenesis. While surgery is the frontline therapy for STS, 50-60% of patients with locally advanced or metastatic tumors have a poor prognosis, and ultimately succumb to the disease. 1 Current treatment paradigms involve chemotherapy and targeted therapies, however with limited efficacy and development of treatment-resistant cancers. The success of immunotherapy in the treatment of melanoma is the driving force for continued expansion of this approach to patients with other malignancies.
The tumor microenvironment is a central component of cancer development and response to therapy. Maintaining a balance between activation and inactivation of immune-suppressive pathways is essential to prevent autoimmune disorders, and is also key to harnessing the immunogenic potential of the tumor microenvironment for antitumoral therapies. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a transmembrane molecule commonly expressed on tumor cells and immune cells and serves as a key negative regulator of T-cell function. Inflammatory cytokines (IFNs, TNF, and IL-4) induce expression of PD-L1 on activated tissue-resident cells or dendritic cells (DC) that are interacting with naïve T-cells. However, when DCs"

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
  ======================  
This prospective, randomised, controlled, double-blind, single-center study was approved by our Ethics Committee (KAEK2023/06). The investigators followed the Consolidated Reporting Trials Standards (CONSORT). It was conducted in patients undergoing elective lumbar discectomy, and informed consent was obtained from the patients. They were randomized using a closed envelope technique, opened by the physician performing the block. 54 patients were included in the study, divided into two groups of 27 patients as esp block (group 1) and control group (group 2), both groups underwent standard general anaesthesia. The blocks were performed in the operating theatre at the end of the operation, before the patient woke up. 
The patients were unaware that the block was being performed on them. A patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) device was given to both groups by another doctor blinded to the group, and Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) scores assessed for 24 hours. Standard monitoring (peripheral oxygen saturation, electrocardiogram, non-invasive arterial blood pressure monitoring) was performed. Anesthesia induction was achieved with 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.6 mg/kg rocuronium, and anaesthesia maintenance with 2% sevoflurane, 4 lt/min 50%/50% oxygen/ nitrogen mixture. Both groups received 1 g IV paracetamol towards the end of surgery. The patients were extubated after 2 mg/kg of sugammadex and were transferred to the recovery room. The first group underwent sacral espb at the end of surgery. The lumbosacral region was sterilised with povidine iodine and then draped with the patient in prone position. The linear ultrasound probe was placed in the midline on the spinous process of the 5th lumbar vertebra after the sterile covering had been applied. After observation of the sacrum, the level of the 2nd median crest was determined and the ultrasound probe was moved 1.5-2 cm laterally and the 2nd intermediate crest and the erector spinae muscle between the two were observed. 22 G 50 mm needle was advanced from caudal to cranial direction to the sacral crest using in-plane technique, after confirming the needle position with 1-2 ml saline, 0.25% bupivacaine 20 ml was administered, local anaesthesia was observed to spread cauda-cranially separating the erector spinae muscle from the sacral crest, the same procedure was performed on the opposite side. All patient demographics, age, weight, and duration of surgery, post-operative VAS scores, blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation values at 30 min, 1, 6, 12 and 24 hours, total tramadol consumption, rescue analgesic use, time of first rescue analgesic requirement, patient satisfaction and side effects were recorded. The Shapiro-Wilk test was used to examine the normality of quantitative data. Comparison of normally distributed data was performed by independent samples t-test, and comparison of non-normally distributed data was performed by Mann-Whitney U test. Comparison of qualitative data was performed using the Pearson chi-squared test. Data were presented as mean ± standard deviation, median (minimum - maximum) and n (%). Statistical significance was accepted as p<0.05. In a previous study (9), the power analysis performed to detect a difference of 15.4 mg between the 48-hour opioid consumption values of the two groups (p<0.05) was calculated with 90% power and an effect size of 0.96, and the required sample size was determined to be 24 for each group.

The Investigators aim to develop a new biomarker of Myofascial pain (MP) at the patient level by measuring and integrating the echogenicity of lesions, the dynamic structural deformation of connective tissue, and the viscoelastic properties of tissues in the Lumbosacral Pathway. This study was initiated to: 1. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of the Biomarker to diagnose and predict response to treatments of both latent lesions and active lesions and 2. Assess which combination of techniques best predicted response to treatment. The study was initiated in two stages, a training dataset and a test dataset. The training data from the training dataset are used for model development while the test data from the testing dataset are used to test the predictive power of the models (using a standard internal/external validation approach called 10-fold cross-validation). The study was conducted in Quebec, Canada, and was completed in January 2021.

 <EOD> Genetic variation in a natural lake stickleback population is influenced by predation pressure
Genetic studies of natural populations rarely control for extrinsic selection despite evidence that predation may influence the genetic architecture of populations. Using microsatellite markers, we examined the variation in, and differentiation between, three habitats of an introduced threespine stickleback Gasterosteus aculeatus population in Gullmar Fjord, Sweden. We also examined the effect of food abundance and predation risk on individual microsatellite loci in common garden studies. There was a significant amount of genetic variation within habitats and a lack of any genetic differentiation between the three habitats. There were different genotype frequencies for some loci between prey‐ and predator‐free habitats, suggesting local adaptation, and also significant associations between feeding abundance and allelic frequencies. Genetic variation in microsatellite markers of populations may thus be a response to selection from higher predation pressure, but this effect seems to disappear when predators are absent. <EOD> Phosphodiesterase inhibition by alpha-difluoromethylornithine. 3. A comparison with the effects of pentoxifylline.
alpha-Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) is the only irreversible inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis available in a form suitable for animal studies. Because of its toxicologic properties, however, only single doses can be used. Pentoxifylline, on the other hand, although also a potent inhibitor of polyamine biosynthesis, is nontoxic in the higher ranges of pharmacologic doses and allows for long-term administration. This feature coupled with the ability to assess the steady-state polyamine concentration, led us to compare the effects of DFMO and pentoxifylline on phosphodiesterase. In order to accomplish this, polyamine, phosphodiesterase, and DFMO were assessed in peripheral blood platelets of 10 normal volunteers, treated in groups of five each during two one-week treatment periods with either pentoxifylline (1,200 mg/day) or DFMO (250 mg/day). On Days -1, 6, and 13, blood was taken from each subject, and platelet adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), and polyamine concentrations were determined. Peripheral blood platelet phosphodiesterase and DFMO levels were then determined for each subject. The mean platelet cAMP:cGMP ratios were determined. Pentoxifylline and DFMO treatment similarly and markedly raised the platelet polyamine levels and inhibited phosphodiesterase activity. The DFMO group showed a marked change from normal in the polyamine levels. Pentoxifylline and DFMO treatment increased the platelet cAMP:cGMP ratio similarly. The data support the concept of a polyamine regulation of the cAMP:cGMP ratio in mammalian cells. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase by pentoxifylline and DFMO appears to be due,"

 <EOD> HIV/AIDS risk factors in the Middle East and North Africa: an integrative review.
PURPOSE
This integrative review addressed the current research knowledge and identified gaps in HIV/AIDS (human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome) risk factors among populations living in countries in the Middle East (including Iran) and North Africa (MENA).


DESIGN
An integrative review design was used to answer the question: How do HIV and AIDS spread in the Middle East-North Africa region?


METHODS
CINAHL, PubMed, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Web of Science were used to search for research papers on HIV/AIDS risk behaviors in the Middle East-North Africa region.


FINDINGS
Findings revealed a limited number of studies pertaining to HIV risk behaviors in the Middle East-North Africa region, particularly regarding studies of homosexual and bisexual men. Gender and religion-based factors emerged as predictors of HIV-related risk behaviors among MENA populations and could assist in informing risk reduction strategies that consider cultural practices and norms.


CONCLUSIONS
More research is required to understand the risk factors of HIV/AIDS among various populations living in MENA countries. In addition to exploring homosexual and bisexual males, other populations with high HIV prevalence (e.g., persons who inject drugs) also need research that highlights the risk factors for the spread of HIV/AIDS with a view of developing culturally relevant risk reduction interventions.


CLINICAL RELEVANCE
Recommendations and considerations discussed in the paper provide a basis for culturally-tailored HIV-related behavioral interventions, including strategies for prevention of the spread of HIV in the Middle East and North Africa and other regions of the world. <EOD> .
The authors present the case of a 24-year old man with subarachnoid hemorrhage and a diagnosis of basilar tip aneurysm. The aneurysm was successfully treated by aneurysmal clipping with the patient being neurologically unharmed postoperatively. He had been treated for aplastic anemia with cyclophosphamide and steroids in the preoperative period. On the fourth postoperative day he developed left hemiparesis, which was attributed to vasospasm. Subsequently, it improved spontaneously within 24 hours. There were no further postoperative complications. In the early postoperative period the patient suffered from a transient ischemic attack. Neurological examination of the patient prior to discharge was normal. The authors discuss the possible connection of aplastic anemia, vasospasm and aplasia with the development of intracerebral hematomas. <EOD> Clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children is characterized by mild clinical manifestations of respiratory tract infection, high recovery rates and low death rates. At this time, the clinical manifestations and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 in children remain unknown. Therefore, a prospective research cohort of children diagnosed with COVID-19 was established in China. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 and viral load of the children were monitored, analyzed and summarized based on laboratory epidemiology. Fever, coughing, nasal congestion or runny nose, shortness of breath and myalgia were the primary respiratory symptoms of mild cases of COVID-19 in children, whereas fever and coughing were the predominant clinical manifestations of severe cases. The peak viral loads of asymptomatic cases were similar to those of mild cases, whereas the viral load of severe cases was significantly higher than that of mild cases. In addition, the peak viral load of children under 10 years old was significantly higher than that of children under 1 year old. All cases reached the lowest levels of viral load within one week. A total of 106 (74.66%) children had complete remission and 35 (25.34%) cases had a history of chronic disease. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in children were milder than were in adults; therefore, early detection and isolation of infected children to interrupt the transmission was the"

Transcatheter aortic valve placement (TAVP), especially transfemoral transcatheter aortic valve implantation, is becoming a popular treatment modality for patients with severe aortic valve stenosis. Transcatheter valve implantation is being performed on older patients or patients with multiple comorbidities, including congestive heart failure, renal failure, and diabetes mellitus. These comorbidities often require treatment of other valvular diseases that were previously treated with surgical valve replacement or valvuloplasty.

Colchicine binds to microtubules and inhibits the polymerization of microtubule subunits in vitro. It was hypothesized that colchicine must interact with microtubule subunits prior to polymerization if it were to inhibit in vitro polymerization. To test this hypothesis, microtubule protein was treated with an inhibitor of mitosis (ICM) and then analyzed by gel electrophoresis for the presence of microtubule subunits. It was found that a specific component of microtubule protein was eliminated with ICM under certain conditions; the size of this unpolymerized (monomeric) subunit corresponded to 45,000 molecular weight, the same size as one of the mitosis inhibitors of the colchicine class. The ICM were separated from colchicine by DEAE inhibitor chromatography. By this procedure, it was shown that 1 microgram of colchicine bound only 7% of the ICM that were produced during incubation of microtubule protein with ICM. The remaining activity was apparently carried on by a smaller molecular weight inhibitor. These results seem to point to a molecular interaction between the colchicine inhibitor and a subunit of microtubule protein, and they support the hypothesis that inhibition of mitosis by colchicine might result from a blockage of polymerization. <EOD> The effects of cisapride on gastrointestinal function in children with gastrointestinal failure
This study evaluated the influence of cisapride on transit and propulsion through the gastrointestinal tract in critically ill children. Eight infants, ages 5–46 weeks who had been ventilated with a tracheostomy for 5–203 days, and had had gastrointestinal failure for 6–305 days were given cisapride by nasogastric tube for a 6-day period. Four infants had been receiving enemas during this period. The effects on the gastrointestinal tract, as measured by stool frequencies, were examined as an effect on gastrointestinal transit. No significant changes were noted in these parameters. Similarly no significant changes were observed (pre–post intervention time period) in stool frequencies before or after the intervention period. The drug concentration was measured in the stool and plasma during the last 2 days. The mean concentration recorded in the stool varied from 30 to 97 μg/kg/day, whereas mean plasma concentrations varied from 0.008 to 0.128 ng/ml. A relationship was also observed between the time plasma concentrations were higher than stool drug concentrations and bowel movements. However, cisapride cannot be classified as one of the factors implicated in gastrointestinal activity and it could"

Two other regimens have been compared: methotrexate plus doxorubicin (MAT) versus cyclophosphamide plus methotrexate plus 5-fluorouracil (CMF). Ninety patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomly allocated to combination chemotherapy with MAT or CMF. Both treatment arms consisted of a 7-day intravenous infusion of methotrexate 20mg m -2 day -1, followed by a 3-day infusion of doxorubicin 50mgm-2 (CAF), followed by 5-fluorouracil 600mgm2 daily for 5 days. Responses to both CMF (45%) and MAT (36%) were not significantly different, although there was a tendency for CMF to give more remissions in patients that had failed anthracycline therapy. Median survival times were of the order of 18 weeks and did not differ significantly. This study has confirmed the effectiveness of the CAF regimen in treating metastatic breast cancer and suggests that the addition of methotrexate to this triple combination confers no additional benefit. It has also demonstrated that there are no marked differences between the results of regimens containing only single-agent alkylating agents versus those containing single-agent anthracyclines or 5-fluorouracil.

AIM
The present study investigated risk and protective factors for psychotropic use in adolescence.


METHODS
A representative sample of 834 youth (50.5% girls, 49.5% boys) aged 14 to 17 years was studied in a survey with retrospective time frame for the occurrence of psychotropic drug use. The questionnaire included information on sociodemographics, individual risk factors for mental illness, child rearing variables, substance use, social network properties, bullying, and social inequality indicators. Binary logistic regression was performed to predict psychotropic drug use (Rx + OTC) among all participants. Next stepwise logistic regression analyses were conducted in girls and boys, separately. In addition, separate logistic regression analyses were conducted for Rx, Rx+OTC, and OTC use.


RESULTS
Psychotropic drug use (Rx+OTC) was significantly associated with male sex, age < 16 years, low social competence, and low self-esteem in univariate analyses in the total sample. In logistic regression analyses, male sex, age < 16 years, low social competence, and low self-esteem remained significantly associated with drug use. The results did not change in girls-only and boys-only analyses. In addition, substance use including nicotine use, inhalant use, cannabis use, illicit drug use, and caffeine use was significantly associated with Rx+OTC, whereas a negative self-appraisal was significantly associated with OTC-only-use.


CONCLUSION
Treatment programs and/or interventions in schools are needed to reduce the use of pharmacological interventions and to increase the use of effective methods of treatment and prevention of psychological distress in adolescents. Furthermore, additional data from longitudinal studies of the developmental psychopathology viewpoint are needed. <EOD> .

In B. jararacussu infection by Oxyuris spp. (66.6%) was most frequent, while Aplectana spp. (16.7%) and Anisakis spp. (12.5%) was less frequent. <EOD> A rapid, sensitive, and selective colorimetric method for measuring ammonium and related compounds using nitrosodiethylamide.
A colorimetric method for measuring ammonium and related compounds that uses low levels of nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) with high sensitivity is described. The method is based on the fact that NDEA reacts specifically with ammonium ions in samples, and the NDEA reacts both with ammonium ions and with sample matrix during color development, inhibiting the reaction. By measuring the amount of unreacted NDEA, we determined the amount of ammonium ions in the sample by the method of Beers and Sizer. We measured the amount of sample matrix added to the NDEA solution from the ratio of absorbance of NDEA in the sample to that in distilled water, and estimated the amount of ammonium ions in the sample from the ratio of absorbance of NDEA reacted with the sample matrix to that reacted with the matrix after addition of ammonium ions. The method has a very low detection limit (S/N = 3, 0.017 mg/L-NH(3)-N), a high recovery rate (mean value 98.8%), and high selectivity for the ammonium ion alone, and does not react with anions or other inorganic and organic amines. In the analysis of pigments and dyes containing high contents of ammonium ion, the interference of the pigments or dyes was excluded by reaction with mercuric acetate immediately before the measurement"

The data has arrived to the core team, and after careful analysis, it is decided that the patients in the CELS group have experienced fewer complications (Clavien-Dindo grade 3 or higher) and the recurrence rates are higher in the control group (standard resection group).

Aim: The aim of this exercise is to give you as a reader the possibility to evaluate the main findings of the study before we as a center give the final decision about how to manage the patients presenting with early-stage colon cancer.
 <EOD> The Fusarium phytopathogenic complex of apple and peach trees in Greece: the contribution of microbiology, molecular and microscopic methods.
The taxonomy of fungi has been based solely on morphological criteria. However, there were inconsistencies in the definition of species and genera. During the last two decades it was shown that the most accurate methodology in this area was the molecular phylogenies, based on DNA sequences. Nevertheless, it was considered that the morphological methodology would serve us as a guide for the identification of isolates, while molecular analyses would aid to the differentiation of closely related species. The objective of the present research was at the best possible to detect the presence of the Fusarium phytopathogenic complex in the orchards of apple and peach tree in Greece. An indigenous pathogenic complex of F. acuminatum-F. graminearum-F. incarnatum-F. solani was isolated using appropriate morphological methodology. For a better characterization the methodology of the pathogen was molecular and microscopic. The present survey indicated that, there exists more than one host for the pathogen. <EOD> Erythrocyte A1C level versus hemoglobin A1C level for predicting vascular complications and death in patients with type 2 diabetes

Background:The erythrocyte A1C (eA1C) level is used to test diabetic patients in China for hemoglobin variation due to iron deficiency. Although the eA1C level is highly associated with hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) level, it is unclear whether this index is comparable to HbA1c levels with regard to their relationship to serious diabetic complications. Methods: This retrospective cohort study evaluated the prognostic values of the eA1C level and that of HbA1c with respect to diabetic vascular complications and patient mortality. Patients with type 2 diabetes whose eA1C levels and HbA1c levels were measured simultaneously between October 2012 and December 2013 were identified, and their eA1C or HbA1c levels were used to predict various diabetic complications. Results: There were 678 type 2 diabetic patients evaluated. The eA1C level correlated well with HbA1C. Both eA1C and HbA1C were closely associated with various diabetic complications, but their predictive values were not significantly different. When eA1C and HbA1C were considered in combination as predictors of vascular complications, only a history of hyperlipidemia was found to be an effective cofactor of eA1C in predicting coronary artery disease, with a similar predictive value to that of HbA1C.Conclusion: Both eA1C and HbA1C are valid predictors of diabetic vascular complications and patient mortality.

Methods
Study Design
The design needs to be fully justified. I have included a section that describes the study methods used in this research.
[TEXT]
A cohort design was adopted with a parallel group design whereby patients were randomized and recruited to either treatment or placebo. One sample t-test was used to calculate the means and standard deviations within each group. Cohen's d was determined from the difference between the mean and standard deviations of the groups. Cohen's d is a standard effect size statistic used in quantitative studies. The measure ranges from 0 to 1, indicating small, medium, or large effects, respectively. Cohen's d > 0.8 indicates a large effect, between 0.5 and 0.8 indicates a medium effect, and 0.2-0.5 indicates a small effect. A probability value was also obtained as an objective measure of significance. The value obtained here was p = 0.003, indicating some significance between the experimental and control groups. The experimental groups were further compared using a Mann-Whitney test. One hundred and three participants were included to ensure that at least 56 were recruited to the placebo group with a minimum confidence level of 95% and a confidence interval (CI) of 5%.
The participants were blinded to the intervention allocation. Two research assistants were allocated to the treatment side and two were allocated to the placebo side of the study. They were blinded to this by having another assistant allocate the intervention to them, and both research assistants were informed of the randomization as they recruited the participants. They were blinded to the intervention allocation by having these allocated to them by another research assistant. The allocation was done using a computerised random generator.
Participant Group/Grouping

 <EOD> Efficient identification of DNA methylation by using microfluidic-based single-molecule real-time sequencing.
DNA methylation is involved in important biological processes such as differentiation, embryonic development, aging, and tumorigenesis and is commonly studied by bisulfite genomic sequencing. In the present study, we developed an efficient method for DNA methylation determination based on a microfluidic chip system coupled with the real-time single-molecule sequencing technology. The DNA methyltransferase M.SssI was first used to methylate a genomic DNA sample, followed by DNA purification, amplification, and enzymatic fragmentation. An optimized labeling method was introduced to convert DNA into labeled library products. The products were loaded onto a glass chip and sequenced by Pacific Biosciences RS II single-molecule real-time sequencing. In order to validate the experimental approach, a bisulfite PCR fragment of a DNA methylation-repertoired mouse genome was employed as methylation model. The sequencing results showed 94.44% accuracy. A genome-wide DNA methylation survey was then performed through the methylation of bisulfite genomic DNA from human blood cells using the same method. The results revealed a correlation between DNA methylation levels and development and progression of neuroblastoma, which is of high interest in cancer therapy and biomedical research. This study demonstrated that single-molecule real-time sequencing is efficient, sensitive, and powerful in DNA methylation identification, and therefore, it may provide a viable alternative in clinical diagnosis. <EOD> Phase I/II study of oral bevacizumab alone or in combination with low-dose capecitabine in patients with solid tumors

These authors contributed equally to this work.Background: Vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) is overexpressed in a variety of human cancers and plays an important role in promoting angiogenesis and tumor progression. Because blockade of VEGF-A receptors or VEGF-A itself reduced tumor growth and metastatic spread, targeting VEGF-A has gained interest as a novel therapy for cancer treatment. Materials and methods: We conducted a multicenter, open-label, Phase I/II study. In Phase I, we investigated the dose-escalation safety of oral bevacizumab at doses of 0.1, 0.3, and 0.7 mg per kg per day with a continuous 14-day dosing regimen. In Phase II, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacologic effects of a dose of 0.7 mg per kg per day in patients with solid tumors. We collected"

 <EOD> Evaluation of two commercial real-time fluorescent and real-time polymerase chain reaction tests for the detection of Listeria monocytogenes in food

Two commercial real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (FPCR) kits, Listeria monocytogenes Real-time PCR Detection kit (Bion Enterprise, Taipei, Taiwan) and Real-time PCR L. monocytogenes-Primer Set (Primer Design; London, England), and a realtime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) kit, One Step Listeria monocytogenes PCR kit for DNA mini and mini centrifuge (Primer Design), were evaluated for their performance against culture-based method for the detection of L. monocytogenes in food matrixes. A total of 115 samples artificially contaminated with 10-colony forming units per g or 100-colony forming units per g of L. monocytogenes, including seven food matrixes (chicken wings, sliced roast beef, smoked sliced bacon, sliced pork, salami, sliced ham, and salmon) were studied. The performances of all three tests were compared to those of the USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service Molecular method, PCR L. monocytogenes, and the USDA-FSIS Bacteriological Analytical Manual method. The sensitivity was 100% for all three tests studied, with the real-time PCR kit detecting the presence of L. monocytogenes in sliced pork. The specificity of Bion Enterprise and Primer Design kits were 100% whereas the specificity of the real-time PCR kit was 95% due to one false positive. The coefficient of variations of the three tests ranges from 0.57 to 3.81%. The Bion Enterprise real-time PCR kit has a limit of detection of 10 colony forming units per g and a level of detection of 100 colony forming units per g, whereas the real-time PCR kit from Primer Design has a limit of detection of 10 and 50 colony forming units per g and a level of detection of 100 and 500 colony forming units per g, respectively. Results of the current study clearly show that the real-time PCR kits evaluated in the current study have the ability to replace culture-based method as a confirmatory test for detecting L. monocytogenes in foods.

# Introduction
Listeria monocytogenes is a Gram positive Listeria enteric bacterium, which enters the body through the mouth. It has a unique ability to survive in both a low-acid and low-salt environment. Its ability to survive in such a wide range of temperatures makes it a common food contaminant. L. monocytogenes is a relatively uncommon bacterium that causes listeriosis, an illness known for septicemia, meningitis, and other devastating disorders   Listeria monocytogenes, Lund     A Review of Foodborne Outbreaks of Listeriosis and Their Link to Food..., Boyo     Listeria monocytogenes, a potential threat for food safety, Karamlock  . The contamination of bacteria in a food product begins as small colonies which multiply and spread and eventually become widespread as Listeria.
Food processing plants are a significant contributor for spreading the contamination to the food since a number of activities are performed within these plants"

Atherosclerotic coronary artery disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and in its advanced stage, it manifests as myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular disease is generally diagnosed from anatomical evaluation of vessel lumen dimensions and/or calcific burden through invasive coronary angiography or non-invasive computed tomography angiography. However, conventional anatomical imaging techniques alone are not able to detect subclinical atherosclerosis and assess disease activity. We aimed to evaluate an imaging protocol combining quantitative vessel wall enhancement analysis, contrast-free intravascular ultrasound, vessel wall and lumen plaque burden, and coronary CT angiography in asymptomatic patients with the metabolic syndrome. Coronary artery diseases and coronary atheroma volume (CVD) are quantified with high accuracy. This combined approach can be used for future clinical diagnosis of early atherosclerosis, and help to disclose disease activation.Clinical studies that aim to determine the cause of vascular disease have two fundamental prerequisites; the identification of a causal link, and a method to quantify the effect of the treatment on that cause 1,2 . For example, the current management of coronary artery disease (CAD) is based on the early identification of coronary lumen narrowing due to atherosclerosis. This identification is done using non-invasive coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring 3,4 that evaluates whether or not the"

ABSTRACT Aim: The results from the primary studies of nivolumab treatment in patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC have been previously reported (Bell et al., ASCO14; 2014 ASCO Annual Meeting). Methods: In Study 205 (NCT01673867), the primary endpoint was safety and tolerability with atezolizumab. In Study 206 (NCT01673868), the primary endpoints were tolerability and response rate; the secondary endpoint was safety. Assessment of antitumor activity was based on tumor response, overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Median PFS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier, and median OS was calculated by the reverse Kaplan-Meier method. Results: In Study 205, 108 patients (86 men; 75 smokers) with HNSCC and progressive disease (PD) after at least one prior therapy were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive nivolumab (3 mg/kg; max 240 mg) every 2 weeks (wks) or atezolizumab (12 mg/kg) every 3 wks. Atezolizumab treatment was interrupted after the data safety monitoring board reviewed a blinded evaluation of the first 249 patients evaluable for response. In Study 206, 240 patients with HNSCC (185 men; 166 smokers) were randomized (2:1) to receive nivolumab (3 mg/kg; max 240 mg) every 2 wks or standard of care (SOC) (the investigator's choice of cetuximab, docetaxel, methotrexate, or platinum-based treatment). In Study 205, the median treatment duration was 1.8 and 2.1 wks in the nivolumab (N = 108) and atezolizumab groups (N = 106), respectively. Nivolumab was interrupted permanently after three patients (3.5%) had serious irAE (rash at 8 wks, decreased appetite and hyperglycemia, colitis and hypopituitarism at 9 wks, and acute pancreatitis and pneumonia at 12 wks). In Study 205, the efficacy objective has not been met. Median PFS was 2.1 and 2.1 wks in the nivolumab and atezolizumab groups (HR 1.01; 95% CI 0.67-1.51), respectively. Median OS and response rates (RR) were similar in both groups. In Study 206, the median treatment duration was 12.0 wks in the nivolumab group (N = 147) and 3.0 wks in SOC (N = 93). In the nivolumab group, the median treatment duration was 4.1 mo (95% CI 2.8-not reached) in the subgroups of patients treated with nivolumab alone and 4.3 mo (95% CI 1.6-not reached) in the subgroups receiving salvage-line therapy (N = 106) and receiving 2-lines of therapy (N = 41). With a median follow-up of 14.0 mo in the nivolumab group and 9.1 mo (interim analysis on OS) in the SOC group, median PFS was 2.1 wks in the nivolumab group (95% CI 1.9-4.4) and 1.8 wks in the SOC group (95% CI 1.7-1.9).

Background. Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) possess immunosuppressive properties and are promising candidates for cell-based transplantation therapies. Objective. The aim of this study was to improve the therapeutic potential of MSCs by modifying their genetic background with a differentiating agent—recombinant interferon (IFN)-γ. Methods. The effects of interferon-γ on growth characteristics and immune-regulatory properties of bone marrow-derived MSCs were studied in vitro. Phenotypic profiles, ability to inhibit T cell proliferation, and immunomodulatory properties toward Th0-polarized CD4+ T cells in mixed leukocyte reaction and natural killer (NK) cells (with anti-KIR antibodies) as well as the IFN-γ level and cytotoxicity toward target cells of MSCs were evaluated. Results. IFN-γ pretreatment of MSCs did not affect viability or the ability to differentiate into osteogenic and adipogenic cells. However, MSCs pretreated with IFN-γ for 5 days were less effective at inhibiting proliferative activity of Th0-polarized CD4 lymphocytes, and the ability of these cells to produce of IFN-γ was decreased. MSCs pretreated with IFN-γ have more pronounced inhibitory effect on the proliferation and differentiation of NK cells as compared to untreated cells. Conclusions. The results of this study suggest MSCs as an interesting carrier for the delivery of a differentiation agent that provides a safe, noninvasive method and may improve the current protocols of MSC-based therapies. <EOD> Effects of the pH in the medium on the kinetics and thermodynamics of protein folding.
The influence of the pH on the kinetics and thermodynamics of the molten globule state of barnase was characterized. This analysis, together with the one previously performed under nativelike conditions, allows the characterization of the kinetic and thermodynamic effects produced by an increase in the pH from 1.9 of the pH dependence. As the pH is raised, the enthalpy of activation (Delta sigma), entropies of activation (Delta s*) and of formation (Delta s), as well as the heat capacity change at the folding temperature (Delta C p) decrease, in parallel with the value of the free energy of the unfolded state (DeltaG(unf)) and the stability of the molten globule state (DeltaG (ml)) (in the range 0.8-1.5 kcal/mol). Nevertheless, an increase in pH increases the value of the free energy of the native state and the stability of the native conformation, which results from a concomitant increase in the enthalpy (DeltaH) and entropic term of the unfolded state (DeltaH s-->u + Delta s*) and the cooperativity. Therefore we could conclude that the unfolded state of Barnase is less cooperative as the pH is raised. This is in agreement with the increase in the fraction of molecules with a low stability in the unfolded state. <EOD> Effect of chronic treatment with lisinopril compared with prazosin on arterial compliance in patients with essential hypertension.
Compliance or distensibility of arteries may decrease in patients with essential hypertension. This study was performed to assess, by using the ascending aorta pulse wave velocity (APWV), the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (lisinopril) with dose-dependent antihypertensive efficacy compared with the alpha-1-receptor antagonist prazosin on arterial compliance in patients with essential hypertension. Treatment with lisinopril ("
55,"[/INST] The summary should make the article title of the document immediately apparent, not by changing the words or the structure, but by adding introductory sentences to link the article to its purpose. Use the article title to help guide you as to how to start your summary. This is what sets a summary apart from other parts of your essay. In many academic writings it may be that the title is self-explaining or needs no further introduction. In these cases the first sentence of the summary mirrors the last sentence of the essay. In other articles, the abstract will need to provide additional relevant background information about the situation. Make a short statement about the context of the problem/hypothesis/research question discussed in the article. Consider the title, the introduction, the conclusion, and the abstract to identify the main argument (thesis) of the whole article when writing your abstract. This may be difficult to do until the main thesis of the article is known, but it should get you off to a good start.

Expected Duration: [/INST] Three days

Format: [/INST] An abstract of 300 words.

Abstract Components: [/INST] There are five parts to the abstract section: (a) an introduction; (b) a section containing the research; (c) a conclusion; (d) a subheading; and (e) a section with the abstract. The abstract should follow the style of the body part of the article. If there is only a single paragraph in the body, there should also be a single paragraph in the abstract. The reader should be able to quickly locate the main points and find a summary of the main ideas. To this end, the sections should contain the article headings as subheadings.

Structure: [/INST] Use specific paragraph headings as subheadings for the sections of the abstract. There should be a minimum of one brief section of summary information for each section listed in the introduction. In the conclusion, state what the article has shown and present the key findings. Give a specific description of what the article has provided for the reader's interest. Do not present all of the information. There should be a sentence summarizing the main point of the article in the last paragraph.

Language: [/INST] The abstract should be written in the third person. Use “we,” “our,” or “us.” Abstracts can also include references, though they should not necessarily be included in all papers. They should be specific to the article and not a general statement. The abstract should not include a title or the abstract itself. It should contain the major arguments and results mentioned in the other sections of the article. Remember that the most important section of an abstract is the conclusion and that a summary of the article’s conclusion and the reader can also give the abstract a strong summary of what the reader is going to find in the article.

Summary - Abstract
========================

We conducted a controlled trial of psychoanalysis for high-functional ASD patients and found no significant changes in any of the participants' outcomes. Furthermore, there are no significant correlations between any of the psychoanalysis outcomes and other psychotherapy-related measurements, such as psychodynamic analysis, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and drug administration.

Participants were assessed through standardized measures of generalized anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, agoraphobia, anxiety, antisocial disorders, borderline personality disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and social anxiety disorder. The participants performed better in the psychoanalysis measures than in all other measures. <EOD> POLQ Inhibition Potentiates the Anticancer Efficacy of PARP Inhibitor via Impairing Replication Fork Protection
PARP inhibitors (PARPi) induce synthetic lethality in BRCA-deficient ovarian and breast cancers. POLQ is a DNA polymerase involved in DNA repair that is upregulated in a range of cancer types, and inhibition of POLQ has demonstrated preclinical anticancer activity, in part through impairing DNA repair and replication fork protection. In a panel of ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, PARPi (olaparib) and POLQi (NU1777) synergized to inhibit growth in all BRCA1/2-deficient and BRCA-proficient (BRCA1 wt/BRCA2 mut and BRCA1 mut/BRCA2 wt) cell lines. Additionally, the combined effects of NU1777 and olaparib were enhanced in cells harboring mutant TP5"

 <EOD> A Case of Multiple-Organ Metastasis from Hepatodigestive System Cancers

The incidence of multiple-organ metastasis (MOMt) from primary hepatodigestive system cancers was relatively low. We herein report a rare case of MOMt from small cell carcinoma of the esophagus, the liver, the stomach and the gallbladder. A 66-year-old man visited our hospital suffering from jaundice, right upper quadrant abdominal pain and loss of appetite. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed a tumor in the lower portion of the esophagus. Although we conducted endoscopic biopsies three times, we were not able to obtain sufficient specimen. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed a type 2 tumor covered with normal mucosa at approximately 2 cm in the esophagus. Subsequently, we performed video-assisted thoracic surgery and endoscopy. The tumor size was approximately 4 × 3 cm, and the histological diagnosis was small cell carcinoma. After three courses of docetaxel plus carboplatin and three courses of irinotecan for liver metastasis, a whole-body CT showed metastases to the stomach and the gallbladder. A combination chemotherapy was selected and continued with irinotecan every 3-4 weeks until he died of progressive disease at 16 months after the initial diagnosis.

Input Text: Perceived Quality of Family Planning Counseling

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
In 2017, Holt, Dehlendorf, and Langer created a framework for contraceptive counseling quality grounded in quality of care and human rights principles and research in healthcare communication. Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research. This study will seek to understand quality of family planning counseling utilizing the validated and client-centered based QCC Scale as experienced by reproductive aged women in El-Dakhla District, New Valley. Furthermore, it will investigate their associated factors either client, provider, or visit factors.
Data collection tool Data will be collected through a semi-structured interview administered questionnaire which includes: Socio-demographic characteristics of women such as age, education, occupation, religion, residence, husband's education, husband's occupation. Family planning practice: This will include number of living children, current use of FP method and its type, and suggested causes of discontinuation of FP, previous contraceptive use, and reason for the visit 3-Facility factors such as gender of providers, qualification of providers, type of the health facility (mobile clinics???) 4-Quality of contraceptive counseling (QCC) scale: it is a 22-item scale which measures the quality of care received by women during family planning visits. It includes : 1) information exchange, 2) interpersonal relations, and 3) disrespect and abuse in contraceptive counseling. The information exchange subscale consists of ten items, the interpersonal relationship subscale consists of seven items, and the disrespect and abuse subscale consists of five items. Item responses were given on four-point Likert scales. Response categories for positively worded items were completely agree (4), agree (3), disagree (2), and completely disagree (1). Response categories for negatively worded items were yes (1), yes with doubts (2), no with doubts (3), and no (4). Composite subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores . Items of QCC scale: Information exchange factor During the contraception consultation, I was able to give my opinion about what I needed. I received complete information about my options for contraceptive methods. The provider knew how to explain contraception clearly. I received information about how to protect myself from sexually transmitted infections. I received information about what to do if a method fails (e.g., broken condom, forget a pill, feel an IUD is poorly placed). I could understand how my body might react to using contraception. I could understand how to use the method(s) we talked about during the consultation. I received information about what to do if I wanted to stop using a method. The provider explained to me what to do if I had a reaction to a method (e.g., allergies, nausea, pains, menstrual changes). The provider looked at me or touched me in a way that made me feel uncomfortable. Response Options: Yes - 1 Yes with doubts - 2 No with doubts - 3 No - 4
Scoring Procedures: Scores from the individual items are used to calculate a composite score using a simple mean, with higher scores indicating higher reported quality of services

 <EOD> Lifetime prediction of the thermomechanical behavior of carbon fiber fabrics submitted to fatigue loading
Abstract In industrial application, a certain degree of damage is commonly introduced in reinforcing fabrics. This damage may have an influence on the thermomechanical behavior of this type of material. The goal of the present work is to determine the thermomechanical behavior of these fabrics under both loading cycles and temperature ramps. The aim is to investigate the damage effects, which are not easily predictable. The carbon fibers thermomechanical behavior was assessed by thermal and mechanical tests. The effect of multiple fatigue loading on their thermomechanical behavior was also studied by the analysis of tensile and flexural tests performed before and after fatigue, respectively. All the tests were conducted in a controlled environmental chamber with a temperature range of −15 °C to 70 °C. A statistical analysis was performed to investigate the statistical differences between all the tests performed after and before fatigue loading. A finite element model was also carried out, and a numerical study was run to validate the experimental results. <EOD> .
In the present paper, we have presented a general design method of a hybrid piezoelectric-Peltier heat pump. With it, we have designed the optimal size of three piezoelectric units and a Peltier module, the corresponding geometric parameter ranges, the thermal transient solution and the maximum COP values at the start of operation. The result shows that the hybrid heat pump is superior to its heat pump without piezoelectric units in the range of low frequency vibration. <EOD> A novel case-finding protocol for pulmonary embolism: the PESI and COPS-Pes scores may predict the diagnosis

In Korea, anticoagulant agent-related adverse events have been increasing and the proportion of elderly patients over 70 years of age is rapidly rising in Korea, and the proportion of anticoagulant agent-related drug-related complications is also increasing, leading to severe complications.1 2 3 In this study, the incidence of anticoagulation related complications was 2.13 per 10,000 anti-coagulation drugs treated patients. 4 In addition, cardiovascular complications of 2.11 per 1000 cardiovascular disease patients taking anti-coagulation drugs was a result of significant complications. 5 The prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF), especially paroxysmal AF, has exponentially increased globally over the last two decades. 6 7 Paroxysmal AF is defined as AF with spontaneous and non-sustained, not requiring a permanent pacemaker. The recurrence of AF results in a high cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular mortality rate. 8 The clinical burden of AF is associated with increased mortality and morbidity of stroke, transient ischemic attack, heart failure, and cardiac dysfunction. 9 10 AF is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality, and its prevalence is increasing steadily over the recent two decades. 11 In the present research report, we investigated the predictive power of complement C3 (C3) for AF recurrence after ablation and for the AF burden.12 It was hypothesized that AF burden would be decremental with C3 after catheter ablation.13 Methods and patient selectionA total of 13.

Input Text: Medical Decision Making in Multiple System Atoxicity: Developing Personalized Best Medical Care With Integrated Telemedicine and Mobile Palliative Care for Individuals With Multiple System Atrophy

Study Overview
=================
Participants in this study are individuals with clinically probable or clinically established MSA (1), with a diagnosis of probable or probable multiple system atrophy according to the MDS criteria (2), between 30 and 80 years of age, no prior diagnosis of or treatment for central nervous system pathology or disease, life expectancy >24 months, full legal capacity, and fluency in German.
The study will take place in Innsbruck, Tyrol, Austria. Recruitment will take place between January 2022 and January 2024. The total length of the study will be 18 months per participant of assessments and interventions.
For this MRC study, recruitment into the active comparison group and the experimental intervention will be rolled out staggered with time allowed for patient recruitment, data collection and intervention planning as required. Up to 16 participants in the active comparison group and 20 in the experimental group will be enrolled per group. The aim will be to continue recruiting until sample size is reached, but for the active comparator group the rollout will stop after 12 months to allow for data collection and finalization of the intervention and for time required for set up of the online platform for the ongoing interventional arm. The recruitment period for the study (i.e., the time required from the first recruited subject to the last included subject) is estimated to be 24 months.
This is an open label intervention study. Randomization will be conducted through the following steps: The randomization of participants to the control or experimental intervention is performed randomly and stratified. In order to randomize patients to the different intervention groups, a randomization list is created after recruitment by the study personnel. The randomization list is then uploaded in a passwordprotected folder on a platform, to which only the researchers on the site will have access. The randomization is performed using an online random number generator available at www.random.org (3). Once randomization is completed, the randomization results are communicated to the site, which then informs the patient of his or her assignment by assigning a study identification number.
- Active comparison group 
| Group 1 -Personalized best medical care
The interventional group (Group 1) will undergo personalized best medical care from baseline through 18 months. They are encouraged to continue standard medical and rehabilitative therapies, while the telemedicine clinic offers monthly telemedicine visits with the core team that may or may not include the neurologist of the participant.
- Experimental intervention group 
| Group 2 -Personalized best medical care PLUS telemedicine interventions
The experimental intervention group (Group 2) will be undergo a personalized best medical care from baseline and through 18 months through monthly telemedicine visits with the core team. Through the first six months following onset of the randomization period, the telemedicine visits include a licensed psychologist and a licensed physiotherapist. Upon completion of the six month mark, participants may opt to remain telemedicine interventions include individual telemedicine visits with the core team, which may or may not include the neurologist of the participant, and a mobile palliative care intervention. The mobile palliative interventions may include home visits and phone calls by the project nurse, the mobile palliative care nurse, and the CHES-Palliative Home Care mobile team. In the event of incapacity to perform ADLs, the mobile palliative care team will consult the CHES-Palliative Home Care medical team about inclusion in the Home Palliative Care service. In addition, the mobile palliative team will perform an over-the-phone assessment of the patient’s ADLs and refer the identified patient or caregiver to the appropriate community-based healthcare or social services.
The mobile palliative care interventions will be available to participants up until their death.

[https://www.openhumanbrain.org] <EOD> Isolation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells.
This protocol describes the isolation and purification of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Isolated umbilical cord and umbilical veins are minced and digested in collagenase. Isolated cells are then plated and grown to confluence in culture medium supplemented with fetal calf serum. The resulting cultured endothelial cells should be used within 14 days of harvest. <EOD> Comparison of intraindividual variation and accuracy of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, uric acid, and sodium from fresh daily and interval blood samples in horses.
We compared the blood creatinine (CREA), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid (URIC), and serum sodium (sodium) concentrations determined in fresh whole blood samples taken at daily intervals and in a set of weekly or monthly samples. Blood samples were taken from 5 Thoroughbred horses over a 14-wk interval. The horses were individually kept in light-tight sampling chambers. To reduce variation in sampling time and handling, all procedures were standardized. CREA, BUN, and URIC were measured by means of a kinetic-based colorimetric method, and sodi-um concentration was determined by means of indirect potentiometry. The CREA, BUN, and URIC results were compared after logarithmic transformation and after the calculation of coefficients of variations. Accuracy of the results was assessed by means of paired t tests. BUN, sodi-um, and CREA variation during the 14 wk was less when determined through daily sampling compared with weekly or monthly sampling. Weekly interval URIC variation was less than daily interval variation for the last 7 wk. The weekly and monthly interval BUN variation during the first 6 wk was less than the variation between daily BUN values determined during the same period. To measure CREA, BUN, URIC, and sodi-um, blood and plasma samples should be taken daily in each horse to obtain reliable results. <EOD> .
The effect of 4-nitro-8-(phenyl-thio) quinoline (NPQ), a new potent anti-tumor antibiotic, against the L1210 leukemia in mice was investigated. The curative effect on leukemia mice was observed 24 hours after a single intraperitoneal injection of 10 mg of the drug per mouse. A 100% effective dose in 10% survived mice was determined 6 days later. The therapeutic effect did not change when NPQ was administered daily for a week. <EOD> The complete genome sequence of an epidemic Clostridium perfringens type A stain C7, isolated from a child with bacteremia

The objective of this RCT is to demonstrate non-inferiority of beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional bone biopsy (surgical or radiological) on DFO remission without surgery at 1 year. The secondary objectives of this study are to compare clinical efficacy between groups of bone biopsy and microbiological results between groups. The safety of both procedures will be evaluated.

The main hypothesis of this study is that bedside bone biopsy is non-inferior to conventional bone biopsy according to the definition of non inferiority as defined above.
The exploratory objectives are to establish the point estimate for the incremental cost utilization ratio and the probability for such ratio to be lower than a pre-defined threshold, and also to estimate the average total costs, and the average total 1 year QALYs. A decision analysis method will be used to assess the decision of treatment and the costs included in the analysis: hospital bills and additional costs linked to the patients that will use these treatments, all hospital and medical visits.
To date, there is no gold standard for diagnosis of diabetic foot osteomyelitis but the bone biopsy remains the reference to date. It is a painful procedure that is often done under general anesthesia but it doesn't help to distinguish patients with or without osteomyelitis before treatment despite a better outcome after such procedure. It can be done in 30 minutes with a 10% risk of an infection. Conventional or surgical procedure with a higher accuracy and more information but with more risk of infection is more adapted in case of uncertainty but often performed in a surgical room under general anaesthesia.
An adequate management of diabetic foot ulcer without osteomyelitis should be based on expert teams of physicians, nurses, and psychologists with special experience about foot disorders and ulceration including surgery.
Bedside blind bone biopsy can be done without X-ray or radioscopy which simplifies the setting. This procedure can be repeated with no anaesthesia and no analgesia that could decrease hospitalization and pain.
Bedside blind bone biopsy will be done without surgeons expert in orthopaedics and with a lower risk of infections. This procedure can be repeated without anaesthesia and oral analgesia that could decrease length of hospitalization and increase the number of possible repetitions.
A decrease of pain could decrease the incidence of amputation to the same number as with the conventional method.

Purpose
The primary objective is to demonstrate non inferiority of beside blind bone biopsy compared to conventional bone biopsy according to the definition of non inferiority as defined above. The null hypothesis is that the remission rate of a biopsy is inferior to 50% as defined above. Alternatively, if for 95% significance, the upper limit for the confidence interval is under 60%, the superiority of bedside blind bone biopsy will be demonstrated and the biopsy will be defined as superior. The alternative hypothesis states that the remission rate of a bedside blind bone biopsy is superior to 60% as defined above.
Secondary Objectives:
- To compare clinical efficacy between groups
- To compare microbiological results between groups
- To compare the occurrence of adverse events during the study between groups
- To compare the remission rate of DFO according to microbiological results of BB compared to BB from the 2014 FRI06 randomized controlled trial (1)
- To compare average costs of the BB
- To compare average total 1-year costs
- To estimate the average 1-year QALYs
- To establish the point estimate for the incremental cost utilization ratio and the probability for such ratio to be lower than a pre-defined threshold
- To estimate Average total 1-year costs (AOPES), Average QALYs gained (AIQ), and incremental cost utilization ratio (ICUR)

[/INST] <EOD> Chick Embryo Responses to Acid and Alcohol Exposure
Previous embryological studies have indicated that the chick embryo is relatively impervious to toxic agents (e.g., phenol, quinidine) compared to many other experimental animal model species. In the present study we investigated the relationship between chick embryo toxicity and development of an organ system, by analyzing its responses to two toxicants, acetic acid and ethanol. We show that exposure to ethanol and acetic acid alters the development of muscle and circulatory events at incubation day 14, with effects most prominent at 0.35% (65 mM) ethanol and 5% (110 mM) acetic acid. In contrast, acetic acid and ethanol exerted the least toxic effect upon the CNS. The data obtained are further evidence that the chick embryo possesses intrinsic protective mechanisms to toxic agents, which render it a unique experimental animal model system in research in developmental neurotoxicology. <EOD> The effects of intravenously administered propylethylglycine (PAG) on the urological system of the intact dog.

 <EOD> Inactivation of SHP-2 promotes proliferation of hepatocarcinoma cells by activating JNK


SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP-2) participates in several signaling pathways that are involved in the control of cell proliferation, differentiation and transformation. However, the role of SHP-2 in hepatocarcinoma remains unclear. In the present study, the role of SHP-2 was investigated in two hepatocarcinoma cell lines (HepG2 and SMMC-7721), and a hepatocyte cell line (HL-7702). The mRNA expression of SHP-2 was found to be significantly reduced in the hepatocarcinoma cell lines. The levels of phospho-SHP-2 (Tyr 542 ), phospho-SHP-2 (Tyr 580 ) and total SHP-2 were also assessed by western blotting and confocal immunofluorescence analysis, which indicated that SHP-2 may be inactivated in hepatocarcinoma cell lines. Furthermore, inactivated SHP-2 promoted the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma cells via the activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). In conclusion, these results indicated that SHP-2 expression is decreased in hepatocarcinoma cells, and inactivated SHP-2 promotes the proliferation of hepatocarcinoma cells via activation of JNK.

We investigated 76 patients with primary and secondary hyperparathyroidism by using a radioimmunoassay. Taking in account the age and the weight, we found in pregnancy, the normal values found in non pregnant persons to be more than two times higher than those of non pregnant persons. In pregnancy, in the first trimenon, the values reached an average of 108 pg/ml, in the second and third trimenon approximately 142 pg/ml with maximum values of 523 pg/ml (age 18--44 years). The weight and the calcemia were in relation to the pregnancy. The relation between these factors and the parathyroid hormones are given. The investigations were made before and during operation and pregnancy. <EOD> A novel, non‐diluted fluorogenic TAR RNA hybridization probe developed in a single‐bead microfluidic device
Motivation: Fluorescence‐based hybridization methods play an important role in many areas of molecular biology in recent years, especially in the field of diagnostics. In a well‐established technique, a fluorescent polymer is used in double‐stranded target deposition to facilitate the detection of hybridized probes, which can lead to high background signals that can reduce the sensitivity of the method and make it unsuitable for detection and quantification of single‐stranded RNA at nanomolar concentration. In this paper, we demonstrate a method to detect RNA on the basis of double‐stranded hybridization by modifying the hybridization buffer using 4 M urea. The method also allows RNA detection at 100 fmol/μL without polymer attachment. <EOD> Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukemia of adulthood.
Treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with induction chemotherapy, intensive combination chemotherapy, and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has substantially improved outcome in AML adult patients with a long-term probability of cure of about 40%. Allogeneic transplantation remains the prime curative modality for AML using myeloablative conditioning. However, transplantation after a reduced-intensity regimen is becoming increasingly common for older patients ineligible for standard-dose chemotherapy. Newer investigative studies are aimed at improving the outcome of AML despite failure to achieve a complete molecular response after standard chemotherapy and the feasibility of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a postremission therapy after hypomethylating agent treatment. <EOD> .
PURPOSE
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a new preparation in acute cystitis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Six-hundred patients were enrolled in a randomized double-blind study. Patients with urogenital infection and positive bacteriological investigations received antimicrobial treatment which included either the new preparation (n = 300) - ciprofloxacin in the form of tablets (500 mg/kg once a day) or placebo.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Symptomatology and leukocyturia were examined. The urine was inoculated in conventional media and under the conditions in the vagina for the detection of microorganisms present. Dissemination of the bacteria in the upper genital tract was determined following microbiological investigation of endocervical swabs and isolation of microorganisms. In order to evaluate the efficacy we compared the number of symptomatic and symptomfree patients as well as the urine culture results of the patients treated with ciprofloxacin. The duration of the treatment was 4-10 days. Adverse events were investigated during the time period of the treatment and the one-month follow-up. All the symptomatic patients received a standard treatment.


RESULTS
In the treated group, the results of the vaginal smear were negative in 95.1% of the patients in comparison with 64.7% of the controls, p < 0.001. In cases of urosepsis we achieved a favourable therapeutic effect in 78.9%"

Surgical management of the megaureter was analyzed in 5 children (aged 4, 6, 7, 13 months and 4 1/2 years) with vesicoureteral reflux, hydronephrosis and/or urinary tract infection. The patients presented different degrees of clinical pictures varying between unilateral pyelonephritis to severe renal scarring that lead to chronic renal insufficiency with severe hypertension. In 68% this pathology followed congenital urinary tract obstruction: 48% were infravesical, 16% intramural, 6% double, and 16% extramural (2 children had obstructions in 2 ureters) and 16% no obstruction. Antegrade diuretic renography confirmed the presence of a megaureter in all cases. Excretory urography associated with retrograde studies disclosed the level of the obstacle in 2 patients, which were submitted to ureterolysis. No patient showed any complication of the procedure. In all patients the reflux disappeared and all megaureters became smaller in the interval of 6 months to more than 4 years of follow-up. Two patients in whom hydronephrosis had persisted after complete reflux regression, recovered renal function and blood pressure stability 6 months later. Thus, simple surgical intervention with antireflux necker and unobstructed ureterolysis in megaureters proved to be highly successful.

The results of these cases support the concept that surgical management of megaureter is a definitive and efficient therapy and that it can successfully cure renal dysfunction and hypertension which are often associated with this condition <EOD> The influence of the interfacial structure on the rate of hydrophobic association in binary solutions.
We studied the rate of hydrophobic association (HoA) of benzyl alcohol with benzene, benzene with phenol, and two-component mixtures of benzyl alcohol and benzene with phenol in water. By fitting the autocorrelation function of the mole fraction difference between two components to the corresponding decay rate we derived the average HoA rate and estimated its dependence on the interfacial tension of the two-component interface. The latter was calculated as a function of the mole fraction using the Hansen-Verlet lattice fluid model. The HoA rates show a trend in the limit of large interfacial tension or large difference in the dielectric constants of the two components, which is opposite to the one in the limit of small interfacial tension or small difference in the dielectric constants of the two components. The influence of the interfacial tension on the mole fraction dependence of the HoA rate is similar to the one exhibited by the diffusion rate in water. We concluded that the dependence of the HoA rate on the interfacial tension is determined predominantly by the structure of the interface and is not sensitive to changes in the dielectric constants of the two components. <EOD> Exploring the effects of high temperature on plant defenses. A case study on the interactions between tomato and its fungal pathogen

Plants face several biotic and abiotic stresses that negatively impact growth, productivity and quality. Among biotic stresses, one of the most damaging is caused by plant pathogens. In this regard, the relationship between plant and pathogen is strongly influenced by many factors, for example, changes in environmental conditions. Temperature is one of the most important of these, and in recent years climate scientists have predicted global mean temperature increases of up to ≥ 3 ̊C. Global warming is increasingly affecting the plant pathogenic microbiomeand, in turn, it is strongly impacting the course of diseases and their progression, as they are significantly more severe. In this context, an integrated knowledge of the mechanisms underpinning plant-microbe interaction is required to better model future pathological phenotypes at high temperatures. With the advancement of high-throughput technologies, the use of systems biology approaches has significantly contributed to the understanding of plant biotic interactions. In this chapter, we present the effects and potential molecular mechanisms that might explain the effects of the elevated temperatures on plant and pathogen.

Input Text: Effect of Prone Position Training on Pulmonary Complications in Patients Undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
Colorectal cancer is a common digestive tract tumor in China. At present, laparoscopic surgery has become the classic operation of colorectal cancer surgery compared with the traditional open abdominal surgery. Although laparoscopic surgery has many advantages, such as less pain, faster recovery. However, relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery, which contribute to significant increases in morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) refer to the clinical abnormal changes in the lungs after surgery, These include lung infections (pneumonia), atelectasis, pleural effusion, bronchospasm, acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery has been reported to be between 9% and 40%. The reduction in pulmonary volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications. Numerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for more than 40 years to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of the positive physiological effects of prone positioning on transpulmonary pressure, lung compression and ventilation perfusion ratio, it has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. By placing the patient in the prone position, the lungs compression due to its own weight is reduced via a gravitational-dependent redistribution of fluids. In a triangular-shaped lung, more parenchyma is included in the dorsal half than in the ventral one resulting in a more aerated lung in prone positioning. So, the purpose of this study is to observe whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. This study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial guided by the standard of good clinical practice (GCP), and eligible participants are divided into two groups: group PPT and group C, and primary assess the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.

 <EOD> Evaluation of the efficacy of various oral antiseptic solutions

Aim: To study effect of different concentrations of different oral antiseptic solutions on number of salivary microorganisms and to find correlation with oral hygiene status and periodontal status. Materials and Methods: Subjects were randomly divided into three groups (45 each) according to the concentration of the antiseptic solutions used for irrigation by the patients (2%, 4%, and 5%). 0.5 ml of saliva was collected from each subject at the end of the first visit and after 15, 30, and 60 days of follow-up and was cultured. Statistical analysis was done using Pearson's correlation.Results:The mean reduction of salivary microbial counts for all the three concentrations was significantly different over the follow-up period (P < 0.0001). The reduction in microbial counts was almost the same for all the concentrations at the end of 15 th day. After 30 days, the antiseptic solutions in 4% showed statistically more effect (P < 0.0001) than the others. The least significant effect (P = 0.01) was for the 4% concentration group at the end of 60 days. The periodontal status showed a close negatively significant correlation (P = 0.001, 0.009, and 0.017) with the microbial count for the 2%, 3%, and 4% concentrations (P < 0.05) over the follow-up period. There was a significant correlation between poor oral hygiene status and high microbial count (P < 0.05).

Task#1: Create an overview of the clinical trial paper (please provide a clear, concise, and accurate summary, which captures the key aspects of the trial)

A clear, concise, and accurate summary of the trial:
A 42 year old female with ovarian cancer presented to the emergency room with a fever and acute abdominal pain. She had been receiving chemotherapy for 20 years. Upon clinical examination the abdomen was rigid and diffusely tender to palpation. X-Ray of the abdomen revealed a large distended gallbladder with air-fluid levels, concerning for acute cholecystitis. Surgery was recommended but she felt physically unable to go through with the operation during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over three months, the patient had two admissions for acute obstructive cholecystitis, and in both cases was placed on a course of antibiotics. During one admission, the patient developed a liver abscess and underwent abdominal drainage. Her physicians believed the patient's acute cholecystitis was the result of recurrent biliary colic due to post-operative gallstone ileus. The patient ultimately underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, and her recovery was uneventful.

 <EOD> Evaluation of different diagnostic strategies to identify Helicobacter pylori infection in children
OBJECTIVES:The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of different diagnostic strategies for H. pylori detection and to assess the frequency of the different serological and fecal antigen tests among 35 children infected and 35 noninfected and control children.METHODS:Two commercial tests were used first in the study. Serology tests were performed for IgG (Pyloriset EIA, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo 02101, Finland) and IgA (Serodia HPA, Fujirebio Inc., Tokyo 143-00, Japan). Stool antigen tests were performed for fecal Hp IgG (Dot enzyme immunoassay-EIA; HRP-labeled anti-IgG) and fecal Hp IgA (Dot enzyme immunoassay-EIA; HRP labeled anti-IgA). Positive serological tests were defined as IgG > 32 U/ml and IgA > 2 U/ml for Pyloriset and Serodia, respectively. Positive fecal tests were defined as antigen/dipstick was reactive to Dot enzyme immunoassay and Dipstick Hp. HRP-labeled antibodies to Hp IgG/IgA, respectively. These results were compared with histologic findings and rapid urease test. Then, serumn IgG (Latex Hp IgG ELISA, Tepnel Diagnostics, UK) and fecal test (Rapid Helicoblot IgG test; Diagnostic Products Co., USA) were performed.RESULTS:Helicobacter pylori infection was confirmed by histologic findings from all children and one of five 13 C urea breath test. The total number of infections in this study population was 35 children. For H. pylori serology, sensitivity was 80%. Specificity was calculated as 97%, positive predictive value was 80%, and negative predictive value was 97%. The sensitivity was 46% and the specificity 94% for Hp IgA. The sensitivity was 77% and the specificity was 100% for fecal Hp. The sensitivity was 91% and the specificity was 94% for Hp. HRP-labeled IgG ELISA. The Dipstick Hp/HRP-labeled Antibodies to Hp IgA and IgG were positive in 97%, 83%, and 97%, respectively. The sensitivity was 86% for Hp IgA by the Rapid Helicoblot IgG test. The sensitivity was 89% for seru-mHpIgG by ELISA. However, a positive correlation was observed between histologic and rapid urease test findings.CONCLUSIONS:Infection with H. pylori is common in childhood from early infancy. There is still no gold standard test for confirmation of H. pylori infection. There are different diagnostic protocols for the diagnosis of H. pylori in children. Different diagnostic tools could not be replaced by single test. The histologic finding was correlated and predictive to rapid urease test. It was impossible to substitute one test by other test. For childhood infection, combination of H. pylori serum IgG and serum IgA/stool antigen tests should be evaluated. <EOD> Role of eosinophils in allergic asthma: overview of the literature.
Eosinophils are important immune effectors in allergic asthma for they participate in allergic sensitization and elicitation of immediate and late asthmatic response. In a human type I allergic reaction (systemic anaphylaxis) activated mast cells degranulate and release various mediators, including histamine, to cause anaphylactic shock. Eosinophils are considered as effector cells of the type II allergic response in atopic subjects. In an immunogenic asthma (Type I allergic response is elicited by inhalation of airborne antigen and causes an immediate asthmatic response, whereas in an allergic asthma inhalation of allergens or irritants"

Objectives: To test the predictive performance of our model for 28-day mortality (28DL) in critically ill patients with trauma in a multicentre European cohort and to develop a simplified model based on data routinely collected in the emergency department.Design: A retrospective multicentre cohort study.Material and method:The Trauma Outcome Study (TOS) score, which comprises six physiologic parameters and clinical variables (heart rate, systolic arterial pressure, respiratory rate, Glasgow coma scale score, shock index, and age), was determined in the emergency department. The primary outcome was 28DL as determined by the Kaplan-Meier method. The model comprising the logistic formular (score) is expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) and the cut-off value as a Youden index. Model performance was determined with receiver operating characteristics; multivariate analysis was performed using the logistic regression method.Results: From 10068 patients recruited at 14 European hospitals, we determined the best cut-off value of the TOS score to be 3.56, which included 1343 patients (13.3%) with a TOS equal to or greater than 3.56 points. The 28DL was higher in the low-survival group than in the high-survival group: 43.29% (584/1343) versus 53.81% (6391/11725). Intra-and interobserver variability was excellent for all variables included in the TOS score and 28DL (Pearsons correlation coefficient: 0.49-0.94).

 <EOD> Atypical peroneal tendon dislocation. A report of two cases.
Two cases are reported in which the anatomical relations of the peroneal tendons were grossly disrupted. The first patient, an active 83-year-old man, had a peroneal tendon dislocation involving both the peroneus longus and brevis, and the peroneus quartus muscle. Raising the leg to a horizontal position relocalized the peroneus longus. The second patient, a 43-year-old woman, exhibited complete disinsertion from the fibula of the peroneal tendons and the peroneus tertius but an intact peroneus quartus. These deviations from the normal anatomy are consistent with injury mechanisms that involve forced plantarflexion with ankle dorsiflexion and excessive traction on the peroneal tendons. These abnormal findings were not evident by preoperative examination and were only detected in intraoperative setting, which raises questions concerning the usefulness of preoperative imaging studies. <EOD> Effect of oral acetaminophen on intraocular pressure in mydriatic healthy eyes

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of oral acetaminophen on intraocular pressure (IOP) in mydriatic healthy eyes. Methods: In this randomized double-blind placebo controlled clinical trial, fifty-one participants with healthy eyes were randomly divided into two parallel groups receiving 1,500 mg oral acetaminophen or placebo in a crossover design. IOP was measured by two tonometry devices, Goldmann applanation tonometer (GAT) and Perkins applanation tonometer (Perkins), before and after acetaminophen consumption in mydriatic state for each participant. Results: The mean (standard deviation) of age and mydriatic refractive error (spherical equivalent) of participants were 30.05 (5.95) (years) and -0.65 (0.40) (diopter), respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between mean IOP values for GAT, Perkins, and mean of the two tonometry devices obtained before and after receiving acetaminophen or placebo (P.0.05). The mean of mean IOP values of the two tonometry devices obtained before and after receiving acetaminophen or placebo was not statistically significant (P¼0.34). Conclusion: Acetaminophen consumption in mydriatic healthy eyes has no significant effect on IOP compared to placebo consumption. This study was registered at IRCT.gov (IRCT2014021618634N1).

Bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) are a leading cause of infection-related mortality worldwide, and the prompt and accurate detection of BSI is crucial for initiating and tailoring appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Diagnostic methods for bloodstream infections have evolved in recent years. This review aims to summarize the available microbiological methods and to assess the potential clinical utility of the RISK-IDENTIFY (RISKID) score. The RISKID score is a clinical and biomarker-based point-of-care test based on an extensive, previously trained diagnostic algorithm. Data regarding the diagnostic performance of the RISKID score was analyzed and compared to that of other point-of-care tests, microbiological tests and predictive models. The RISKID score, when combined with the standard-of-care and point-of-care test C-reactive protein, had a sensitivity of 78.6% and a specificity of 95.6%, and can distinguish infected patients with a low probability of infection from those with a high probability. Its high predictive value may help physicians to adapt antimicrobial therapy in patients at risk for BSI.

Bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) are a frequent cause of disease worldwide, resulting in increased mortality   Epidemiology and outcomes of bloodstream infection in patients with and without sepsis:...,seyler A  . Blood cultures have long been considered the gold standard for the diagnosis of bacteremia and sepsis; however, the need for rapid and more accurate detection has led to the development of rapid point-of-care tests for both blood culture and microbiological analysis.
A number of diagnostic tests for BSI are currently available: microscopy, biochemical tests (e.g., oxidase), enzyme immunoassay tests and nucleic acid amplification-based tests. However, each test has advantages and disadvantages when used for diagnostic purposes   Laboratory Diagnosis of Invasive Bacterial and Fungal Infections, Zhang  . Diagnostic tests for bloodstream infections have evolved in recent years, leading to an extensive and complex choice of tests and diagnostic algorithms.

Input Text: Important Correlation Between Anxiety and Reflux Symptoms in Patients With Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease

Study Overview
  =========  

Detailed Description
-----------------
Introduction: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20 percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5 percent in Asia. GERD manifests as heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the 
possible complication of a Barrett´s esophagus. GERD can appear as non-erosive (NERD) or erosive (ERD). In the diagnosis of the reflux disease the DeMeester score is used as a measure of esophageal acid exposure time. Important differential diagnosis are benign functional disorders of the esophagus such as is functional heartburn or functional dysphagia. Comorbid symptoms of anxiety and depression are common: The association between anxiety or depression and reflux symptoms has been investigated in previous studies under the aspects of whether existing reflux symptomatology leads to increased anxiety and depression or whether anxiety and depression lead to more severe reflux symptoms. The results are inconsistent: In younger patients (18 - 40 years) with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) the prevalence of anxiety and depression is higher than in those without GERD. There is an independent association between GERD, anxiety and current depression. Patients with GERD show an increased risk for anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. Not all criteria needed to be fullfied. Psychometric data were collected using the HADS. The criteria for indication for surgery were positive DMS, presence of hiatal hernia, changes in the esophagus due to reflux such as Barrett esophagus or inflammation, poor tolerance of medication, low level of symptom control through medication and lifestyle, decreased quality of life, long duration of the disease and substantial comorbidities. Not all criteria needed to be fullfied. Questionnaires We used the HADS in its German version for assessing anxiety (HADS-A) and depression levels (HADS-D). Self-report is used to assess the severity of anxious and depressive symptoms during the past week, which is recorded on two subscales with seven items each, each item ranging from 0 - 3, adding up to a maximal total score of 21. For both subscales a cutoff score for caseness of > 8 is recommended. The positive scores were differentiated into mild (HADS score on the subscale 8 - 10), moderate (HADS 11 - 14) and severe (HADS 15 - 21). Data analysis In evaluating the HADS scores we labeled scores as negative (physiological, anxiety or depression < 8) or positive (pathological, anxiety or depression > 8). The positive scores were differentiated into mild (HADS score on the subscale 8 - 10), moderate (HADS 11 - 14) and severe (HADS 15 - 21). We did not compare the physiological values with the pathological scores. Statistical analyses were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics. Continuous variables were presented as mean and standard deviation, categorical data as frequencies with percentages . To identify differences between two groups, an independent samples T-test was 
performed for parametric data, whereas a Mann-Whitney U test was performed for non-parametric data. Furthermore, a Chi-square test for independence and Fisher´s 
Exact test respectively was performed in case of categorical data. A p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *"

## Fas and the inflammatory response in macrophages
Macrophages are involved in immunity and inflammation . Although the biological function of FAS in regulating these processes is not fully understood, mounting evidence indicates that FAS has important regulatory effects on the inflammatory response . We   Fas ligand regulates the release of matrix metalloproteinases by U937 cells, Zhang   and others   Activation-induced Fas ligand mediates the apoptosis of dendritic cells, Kim   , using U937 macrophages, have shown that FAS activation promotes inflammatory responses and the release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases 3 (MMP-3). In addition, several studies indicate that a soluble form of FAS called soluble FAS (sFAS) can suppress the inflammatory response   FAS blockade prevents autoimmune diabetes by inhibiting production of pathogenic M1 macrophages..., Rabinovitch     Blocking soluble Fas ligand in the serum of lupus-prone mice prevents renal..., Wang  .
Although the role of FAS in inflammatory processes is less definitive at this stage, the above studies make it clear that, as already known for adaptive lymphocytes, FAS activation can influence the fate of an immune response by affecting the survival and function of macrophages. However, the mechanism by which FAS affects these functions is not fully understood.

## Role of fas in nf-κb activation
The transcription factor NF-κB controls a diverse array of inflammatory and immune response genes in most mammalian cells, including various cell types of the immune system . In order to respond to numerous stimuli, the activity of NF-κB is finely regulated by inducible activation and I kappa B binding, which is essential for down regulation and inactivation. Following FAS activation, phosphorylation of p65, a key subunit of the NF-κB pathway that is phosphorylated in response to inflammatory mediators such as TNFα or IL-1β, has been found to increase considerably   Differential activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases in FAS-resistant human tumor cells, Thress  . Previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylated nuclear factor (NF)-κB is required for optimal FASmediated apoptosis in various tumor cell lines, whereas I kappa B inhibitors prevent FAS-promoted apoptosis   Role of NF-kappaB as a proapoptotic as well as an antiapoptotic mediator, Kumar   , although the role of NF-κB in FAS signaling in leukocytes has been largely overlooked.

 <EOD> Isothermal 3'-->5' exonuclease assay for polymerase chain reaction-based detection of pathogen DNA.
Highly sensitive isothermal polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based detection of pathogen DNA was developed. An assay was developed to detect the DNA of Bacillus anthracis, which is the etiologic agent of anthrax. This PCR-based assay incorporates novel nucleotide probes that hybridize selectively to B. anthracis DNA when a single-strand-specific exonuclease is added during the assay. The probes contain three oligonucleotides with 3' termini that are partially complementary to the target DNA and contain a 5'-terminal fluorescein isothiocyanate group and an internal oligonucleotide with a 3',5'-cleavable moiety. Probes that had a 16-nucleotide 3' region complementary to B. anthracis DNA and a 24-nucleotide 5' region were used. In addition, probes were tested that incorporate an RNA hairpin moiety to enhance hybridization affinity. The B. anthracis assay was compared with a previously designed assay that detects a single point difference of a 46-kDa virulence gene of B. anthracis and a diagnostic assay for Yersinia pestis developed by the Centers for Disease Control. The B. anthracis assay is capable of detecting 3 to 10 pM genomic DNA, representing a level approximately 10(10)-fold greater than a diagnostic assay using fluorescence polarization (FP) to detect single point differences in probe sequences (1). The sensitivity of the assay was at least 100-fold greater than the sensitivity of an assay based on real-time quantitative PCR using TaqMan fluorogenic probes (2). The results of this study show that highly sensitive, PCR-based detection of pathogen DNA is possible. <EOD> .

Results: The guideline provides recommendations on the treatment of pediatric lumbar disc herniations in terms of epidemiology, etiology, symptoms and signs, imaging, pathology, physical therapy, conservative medical treatments, and minimally invasive treatment, based on systematic reviews and evidence assessment. Conclusions: The guidelines summarize the latest literature and evidence related to pediatric LDH, and have broad theoretical and practical significance. <EOD> Tetrahydrocortisone as a Possible New Therapy in the Management of Ulcerative Colitis
THE treatment by glucocorticosteroids of ulcerative colitis has now been a familiar part of medical practice for over 12 years. There is now convincing evidence that corticosteroids will produce remission in most cases and that the rate of cure is inversely related to the duration of the disease. In only the severest cases will steroid therapy fail to induce remission.1 Corticosteroids are most efficacious in the early stages of the disease and in general their effectiveness declines with progress of the disease. This was apparent to a first-hand observer when this agent was first used. The remission produced by the administration of the drug tended to be more prolonged in cases in which the disease had been of recent onset.2 The dose necessary to induce remission frequently varies appreciably from patient to patient. On the whole, for any length of time, the patient has to take larger doses of steroids than he would require for acute infections, and the dose of the drug has to be increased during the course of treatment to prevent relapse. It must be borne in mind, however, that the steroid must be continued on a maintenance basis. Even to the best patients the steroids, in the form of 40 or 45mg./day of prednisolone, must be continued for periods extending to 1-5 years. On stopping the drug, most patients relapse within 4 weeks. Relapses may be preceded by minor changes in the stools or mild exasperation of the symptoms of the condition. It is important, therefore, to continue on maintenance therapy long after the patient begins to feel well. The most urgent need to which a patient can be subjected is a continuing desire to reduce <EOD> The effects of chronic stress on neural activation during autobiographical memory retrieval in combat-related PTSD--a pilot study.
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating condition in which individuals exhibit symptoms of re-experiencing the trauma, avoiding reminders associated with the trauma, and exhibiting arousal and vigilance symptoms. These clinical manifestations of PTSD, and particularly the avoidance of reminders associated with the trauma, are thought to be mediated in part by chronic, high levels of stress experienced during the traumatic event. Furthermore, it is important to note that PTSD may be a ""state"" of the individual, wherein individuals may experience chronic levels of stress, and subsequently develop a maladaptive memory for their trauma. In addition, there is a large literature describing altered neural activation during the recall of traumatic events, for both combat veterans and healthy controls. The present study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural activity of two distinct neural circuits of brain regions of interest associated with traumatic memory: 1) the medial (MePFC) and lateral (LPFC) prefrontal cortices; and 2) the fusiform (FFG) and inferior occipital gyrus (IOG) for autobiographical episodic memory retrieval in individuals with combat"

 <EOD> Differential effects of 1-hydroxypyrrolizidine alkaloids on the inward rectifier ion current I(K1)
Using the whole cell voltage-clamp recording technique from Xenopus laevis oocytes, we examined the effects of two natural products, tetrahydropyrrolocarbazole (HPPCC) and 1-O-trigallate (1 OTC), on currents of the inward rectifier K+ channels in the mammalian cells, i.e., of the human cardiac Kv1.5 protein channel. These compounds are known to inhibit adenosine deaminase, a key enzyme in the pathophysiology of the adenosine triphosphate depletion syndromes. In this study, we show that these two compounds significantly block the inward rectified K+ current (I(K1)) in a voltage-dependent and pH-independent manner, indicating a binding at the pore-forming domain. When applied at their IC50 concentrations (at pH 7.4), I(K1) was inhibited by 41% and 87% at −60 mV and by 35% to 76% at −50 mV. In the presence of 1 μM 1 OTC, the rate of inactivation of I(K1) was accelerated upon depolarization. The effect of those natural products on the whole-cell I(K1) in the presence of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) were further investigated. This second messenger was previously shown to increase the amplitude of the slow component I(K1) by activating ATP-sensitive K+ channel activity, that could be blocked by 1–10 μM of 5-hydroxyindole-3-carbaldehyde, a toxin from a spider. Whereas, 1 μM of HPPCC and 1 μM of 1 OTC both had no effect on these slow I(K1) in the presence of IP3. Taken together, our findings further support the contention that HPPCC and 1 OTC may be toxic in a species-specific fashion. In this case in a vertebrate heart, those natural products may inhibit the slow component of the inward current. <EOD> <EOD> Implement, easy-to-read, open <EOD> 100 1

 <EOD> Eye trauma
Eye trauma, an injury, can be caused by mechanical means (trauma) such as projectile objects hitting the eye or being struck by blunt objects or shattered glass hitting the eye. It can also be the effects from radiation.  Symptoms of injury include blood in the eye, loss of sight, severe pain, and other symptoms caused by the severity of the injury from various forms of trauma. Eye injuries are often divided into four categories: penetrating, perforating, rupturing, and scratching.

# Classification & causes
The causes for various forms of eye injuries include from the use of weapons such as knives, hammers, and other blunt objects. Other causes are broken objects/chipping of materials when the cause is from the impact caused or other chemicals. There is also a high chance of contracting disease from infected objects that were causing the injury including glass, dust, blood, and other infected objects.

# Penetrating Injuries
Penetrating injuries include a sharp object that passes through the eye, such as glass, metal, or wood cutting through the eye.  The object causing the penetrate the eye may tear the blood vessels in the orbital region. The tear may also cause iris or lens ruins, or other damage causing a rupture of the vitreous humor can cause severe damage to the eye.

## Mechanical penetration by sharp object
A sharp object may penetrate the eye, such as a glass, metals, or wood cutting through the eye.

## Mechanical penetration of the eye by sharp object
A sharp object can injure the eye from an object penetrating  the eye that includes glass, and blunt metals, which can be a nail from a hammer or piece of wood.  Penetrating objects into the eye from a sharp or blunt objects can cause injuries to the conjunctival and irises.  In addition, corneal lacerations from a sharp object is the most common to occur when the projectile object penetrates the eye.

THE study comprises 144 male patients who were admitted and diagnosed in the clinic of internal medicine during the period from October 1963 to December 1964. Each patient had an angiocardiogram done, and the blood pressure was measured. With the exception of 10 patients there was no sign of coronary occlusion. They had neither valvular nor myocardial damage. All the patients had hypertension. Their blood pressures were between 200 and 240 mm Hg.

This work presents an exact solution for a diffusion model describing the dynamics of a reaction occurring on a surface, known as spinodal decomposition or spinodal reaction. The solution is based on a nonequilibrium steady state described by a kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) method. The nonequilibrium steady state was constructed by using transition rates that were directly estimated from the diffusion model with an exact analytical expression, and we obtained an accurate solution for the autocorrelation function and the particle size distribution at small time scales. Then, it enabled us to derive several analytical results that agree well with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The excellent agreement with MC simulations demonstrates the accuracy of the KMC method and the simplicity of the nonequilibrium steady state. To confirm the validity of these analysis, we analyzed the experimentally measured results and succeeded in reproducing them. <EOD> The Divergent Transcriptional Responses of the Two Lactococcal Plasmids pTJP1 and pBEN101 from L. cremoris SK11 during Milk Fermentation In Vivo
Lactococcus cremoris is a key starter culture component for manufacture of fermented milk, as it contributes to product flavor and stability via metabolism of lactose into lactic acid and diacetyl, thus preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms. It also contains two cryptic plasmids, pTJP1 and pBEN101, as a result from previous horizontal gene transfer by intraplasmid recombination. Two high-resolution transcriptional profiling studies of the plasmid response to growth and survival at industrial levels of lactic acid and acetaldehyde were performed. The two plasmids shared similar operational strategies for metabolic adaptation, while they also had different molecular strategies, resulting in differences in expression of virulence, biofilm formation, transport, antigenic gene clusters, protein degradation, and recombination. A large number of novel noncoding RNA transcripts were found from both plasmids, some showing positive correlation with their potential target genes at very early or late stages of incubation, for example, in lactose utilization during growth (lmo1405.2, fdxA, and sdhA) and in lactic acid tolerance (ldh1), suggesting a role for these novel noncoding sRNAs in plasmid-encoded posttranscriptional regulation. <EOD> Transgenic expression of GK in hepatocytes of diabetic db/db mice normalizes blood glucose partially via improved insulin sensitivity and increased glucose oxidation.

Input Text: Alleviating Persistent Dyspnea in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Patients Treated With Non-Invasive Ventilation Through Immersive Virtual Reality

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is characterized by dyspnea, anxiety, and pain, major determinants of suffering induced by this disease. The only palliative treatment for respiratory failure is non-invasive ventilation (NIV), which compensates failing respiratory muscles and relieves dyspnea, improves quality of life and increases life expectancy. In ALS patients, the persistence of dyspnea outside of NIV sessions has highlighted the need for therapeutic alternatives in the treatment of persistent dyspnea, including immersive virtual reality (IVR) and auditory distraction through music (music therapy). The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of IVR on respiratory discomfort of patients with ALS at the stage of respiratory failure treated with NIV. This will be an open-label, monocentric, randomized, controlled cross-over clinical study. ALS patients will be recruited during their respiratory evaluation carried out as part of their usual care provided in an ambulatory setting (day care hospital) in the Pneumology Department of Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital. Eligibility criteria will be verified during this visit. If the patient meets eligibility criteria, the investigator will present the study to him using the information letter. After a period of reflection that the patient deems necessary to make his decision and after having obtained an answer to all his questions, his written consent will be collected by the investigator. The patient will then be offered either a digital therapy session based on immersive virtual reality (IVR) or a music therapy session, 60 minutes apart. The IVR session will be based on medical hypnosis (GAMIDA®) and the music therapy session, on the

 <EOD> Prenatal Diagnosis of Fetal Nephrotic Syndrome: A Single-Center Experience
Objectives: Fetal nephrotic syndrome (NS) is one of the most severe fetal kidney diseases and can result in maternal and/or fetal complications, and is fatal in most cases. The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and sonographic characteristics of fetal NS. Methods: Data were collected retrospectively for ultrasounds, laboratory tests, and pregnancy outcomes for all fetuses with a prenatal diagnosis of NS from 2003 to 2014 at a single tertiary medical center. Results: A total of 11 pregnant women had prenatally diagnosed fetal NS. The median patient age and gestational age were 27 (range 21-29) years and 22 (range 17-24) weeks, respectively. Ultrasound findings included polyhydramnios, edema, effusions, ascites, hydrothorax, microhepatia, hypotrophy of the kidneys, oligohydramnios and polyhydramnios alternating, oliguria, megaureter or hydronephrosis, proteinuria, and hematuria. The most common laboratory findings included protein, albumin and proteinuria, glucose, uric acid, and urea levels. Only 1 fetus survived postnatally. Of the remaining 10 fetuses, 7 died at less than 35 weeks of gestation, 2 died after 35 weeks of gestation by complications such as intracerebral bleeding and gastric emphysema, and another died preterm of preeclampsia. Conclusion: NS is one of the most severe fetal kidney diseases and is associated with high mortality. It should be managed by interdisciplinary teams to offer optimal care. <EOD> Transforming the future of nursing.

AIM
This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and potential side effects of NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)-an NO synthase inhibitor-on renal hemodynamic function in dialysis. NOS inhibition in the kidney exerts opposite influences on blood flow and glomerular filtration, due to its localization in different sites, i.e. an action on the afferent arterioles to decrease blood flow and a paradoxical effect in the juxtaglomerular apparatus to increase glomerular filtration as a result of natriuresis.


METHODS
We randomized 16 maintenance haemodialysis patients with normal blood pressure to 1 of 2 groups and studied renal haemodynamic function before and after dialysis. Group 1 received intravenous NG-nitro-D-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) 2.5 mg/kg-intravenously (iv) to inhibit eNOS; group 2 received iv isotonic saline.


RESULTS
Baseline cardiac output and mean arterial pressures were similar in both groups (P>0. 05) but there was a highly significant difference in renal blood flow (RBF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) between the groups (P<0.00001). GFR was significantly reduced after L-NAME treatment (-"

 <EOD> A study on seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus with the use of indigenous enzyme immunoassay
The present study was undertaken with the object of determining the potential of indigenous enzyme immunoassay to detect or exclude immunoglobulin G and G ± M seropositivity for human immunodeficiency virus‐1 in subjects ranging in age from 2 to 60 years and having clinical symptoms indicative of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A total of 292 blood samples were collected, comprising 171 from patients and 121 from apparently healthy blood donors. The majority of these were sera, but two paediatric in‐patients had cerebrospinal fluid samples. The indigenous sandwich ELISA showed an overall seropositivity of 51.4% among patients and 5.8% among suspected blood donors. All the samples reactive in the indigenous test showed a positive reaction in the reference test and vice versa. The indigenous ELISA with indigenously developed test kits is found to be a simple and low‐cost method that can be used to screen for human immunodeficiency virus‐1 in suspected subjects. <EOD> OXIDATIVE STRESS AND THE PATHOGENESIS OF SEVERE COVID-19



## Rationale & hypothesis
Oxidative stress may be a key contributor to severe disease in COVID-19. While the virus itself will induce oxidative stress, it is also possible that systemic oxidative stress may enhance viral replication in the lungs or may contribute to secondary diseases in other organs. Thus, the study of oxidative stress in COVID-19 will not only add to our understanding of disease progression but may guide the selection of antioxidant therapeutic strategies to ameliorate severe disease.

## Objectives
We will perform correlative studies of oxidative stress with markers of COVID-19 disease severity in a cohort of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We will also test the hypothesis that the addition of antioxidants in the early stages of infection may be beneficial in terms of improving disease outcomes. We will also collect clinical data from our cohort and use a multiplexed Luminex panel to identify inflammatory mediators among COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls.

Input Text: Does a Virtual Coach Offer a Better Solution for Weight Reduction in Ventral Hernia Patients With Obesity?
The following is the abstract:
Abstract

### Objective
- Our objective was to determine if a MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach could be helpful in preoperative weight loss compared to using standard preoperative weight loss tools. Ventral hernia repair is a weight-bearing procedure that is recommended when the patient weighs more than 300 pounds. A previous study from our center demonstrated that utilization of these standard tools could be helpful; however, there is still concern about the time commitment, cost, and personal interaction/support for each patient. The goal of this study was to compare the use of this MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach to standard weight loss tools.

### Design, Setting, and Participants
- The authors used a retrospective cohort analysis of prospectively collected data. A total of 177 consecutive patients who were deemed the appropriate candidates for ventral hernia repair were randomized and completed the study.

### Intervention(s)/ Comparator(s)
- The experimental group used MyChartenabled virtual weight loss support. The control group was asked to use standard weight loss tools (dietary tips, physical activity tips, and weekly goals). All patients were seen by the same board-certified bariatric surgeon who specializes in performing hernia repair. The patients underwent laparoscopic ventral hernia repair with mesh using a transabdominal preperitoneal approach.

### Main Outcomes and Measures
- All data were collected in a retrospective, blinded, retrospective analysis. Net change in weight was calculated and compared between groups. Change in BMI before and after repair was compared using paired student t tests between the two groups.

### Results
- A total of 177 patients with a BMI ranging from 31.0 to 80.8 were included in the full study with 89 patients in the MyChart group and 88 in the standard weight loss cohort. There was no significant difference in mean surgical weight loss between groups (4.41 kg vs 3.89 kg, P= 0.27). However, utilization of MyChart was found to be useful in decreasing the number of interactions (4 vs 7, P<0.0001). There was also no significant difference in number of patients who reached their goal weight.

### Generalizability
- Findings of this analysis imply that use of a MyChart enabled virtual weight loss coach can be a helpful tool in obtaining meaningful weight loss in patients eligible for weightbearing procedures such as ventral hernia repair. The main reason patients do not follow through with a given strategy is compliance to the plan. MyChart offers a more accessible and easily available tool for patients to utilize, which allows for greater patient compliance to recommendations from physicians. The ease of use also leads to a low-cost, high-impact service that can be utilized by a multidisciplinary team.

# Conclusions and Recommendations
- This study evaluated whether the use of MyChart-enabled virtual weight loss support helped facilitate weight loss as compared to standard weight loss tools. Ultimately, researchers found decreased compliance for the patients who were working with standard tools versus those who were using MyChart, implying that future studies should further explore how to help patients engage with standard weight loss tools to improve the overall patient experience.

# Limitations
- As this study was retrospective, there is a significant limitation in randomizing all patients, given that weight loss is a personal choice.
- Patients included in the MyChart group had additional pre-surgery counseling due to the use of MyChart. This additional pre-surgery counseling may have affected the result.
- This pilot study showed the advantage of using MyChart, but further studies are needed to fully establish a MyChart enabled support tool’s use for weight loss.

 <EOD> Acute Increase of Cysteine Pool in the Myocardial Capillaries During Acute Myocardial Ischemia: A NMR Microscopic Study1
Abstract Reduction in the myocardial energy substrate causes severe intracellular and extracellular changes including the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The ROS production is suppressed by the intracellular pool of Cys. To measure the dynamics of Cys during the early period of myocardial ischemia, we have developed a novel NMR microscopic method to detect the molecular dynamics of this redox-active molecule within a cardiomyocyte near the microvasculature in a rat heart during myocardial ischemia. The results demonstrate for the first time that 1) 10 s of coronary occlusion produces a significant acute increase of the Cys in the myocardial capillaries, 2) it also produces a simultaneous acute increase of the ROS, and 3) the Cys pool is much lower in the myocardium subjected to acute ischemia/reperfusion injury or treated with an inhibitor of NO synthase. Thus, the Cys pool in the myocardium is highly controlled. This may be a mechanism for protecting the myocardium against ischemia and ischemia/reperfusion injury. <EOD> .
BACKGROUND
The purpose of this article is to analyse the distribution of acute admissions for psychiatric patients by day of the week. Data taken from a previous study of a Spanish urban area were used, because they were more complete than in the other papers on this subject.


METHODS
The admission records for all of the centres in the city were studied over a 47-month period. The data were broken down by the different diagnoses according to ICD-9, admissions by diagnostic category, age and gender. The distribution of admissions by day of the week was analysed.


RESULTS
During the study there were 12,644 psychiatric admissions. The average rate for 7 consecutive days was 2,005 and the variance among days was 370, 4,9%. There was an excess of inpatients admitted on Mondays, and the least number of admissions were found on Saturdays. Admissions by diagnostic category showed a large variability in the numbers by day of the week. Patients with affective disorders had the highest rates. In adolescents (0-15 years), affective disorders were the most common, and in seniors (50-99 years), schizophrenia was seen more. There were also gender differences in the rates by day of the week. Female patients had higher weekly numbers of admissions (1,116.0 than those of male patients (989.4) but the variability of the weekly number of admissions was higher in the latter (386.6 than in the former (305.1).


CONCLUSIONS
This article confirms the findings of previous studies that admissions for psychiatric problems are more common during week and when there are no school/workdays, with excess numbers of patients on Mondays, and Saturdays the least number. The findings in the groups studied show a variability in the distribution of admissions by day of the week that is greater in some diagnostic groups than in others, perhaps because the most acute patients prefer to get admittance on Mondays and on Fridays and the chronic patients on Saturdays. <EOD> The role of the 6th cranial nerve in acoustic responses of the gerbil.
Vestibular function was found to be essential for the normal ear canal reflex of gerbil when the ear canal was stimulated mechanically. However, the responses of the ear canal reflex in both normal and operated animals did not resemble the responses seen with acoustic stimulation. In normal animals, the responses at 4.0 and especially 10.0 kHz were most vigorous. When the cochlear and vestibular function was altered by destruction of the cochlear nerve, or of the medial and inferior vestibular nerve, only responses produced by mechanical stimulation were markedly altered. However, the response in the ear canal to acoustic stimulation was less in operated animals than in normal animals.

Research Information
--------------

The study began in June 2020 and will end in March 2024, involving 10 study sites in China, of which 1 is the primary trial center. The trial was funded by the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Project ""Phase III Clinical Study on the Immunogenicity of Two domestically produced bivalent HPV vaccines and imported HPV vaccines in adolescent females"" (No. Z191100001319004).


Dissemination plans
-------------
The findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings and conferences. Publication is planned by June 30,2024.

Background and Significance
--------------
HPV infection is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. There are currently three types of therapeutic vaccines on the market. The domestic bivalent HPV vaccine is a domestic production, which is a vaccine for the prevention of HPV types 16 and 18. Currently, the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine is the main market product. The imported bivalent HPV vaccine is a foreign production, which is a vaccine for the prevention of HPV types 16, 18, 33, and 45.

The imported bivalent HPV vaccine is widely used in various countries all over the world. The vaccine is an aluminum phosphate adjuvant vaccine with antibody induced by a genetically modified bacteria, which is a virus-like particle vaccine, and immune protection can last from the first dose. This type of vaccine is an efficient prevention for HPV diseases, and it is important for adolescents to obtain full protection from HPV by vaccination before sexual activity. Vaccination as a way to prevent and fight HPV diseases has been widely used in developed countries. The research on the immunobiology of the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine is a continuation of our previous study.

Rationales
========

* Domestic bivalent HPV vaccine has the same efficacy as imported bivalent HPV vaccine. However, the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine is not licensed officially in China and is not included in medical insurance policy reimbursement. Therefore, a clinical study of the efficiency of the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine is carried out to obtain the data of immunity of the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine to prove that the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine is also safe and has a similar immunological effect as imported bivalent HPV vaccine.
* This study aimed to explore the immunogenicity difference between the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine and the imported HPV vaccine, so as to provide evidence-based evidence for clinical efficacy evaluation of the domestic HPV vaccine.

The aim of this article is to describe regional and local hysterectomy rates in the Italian population, to estimate geographical regional and local variations as well as to explore the determinants. We considered the data of hysterectomy operations in women reported by the Italian Regional Surveillance Network (GRSM: Regional Surveillance Network for Cancer Management) for all regions and provinces during the period 1999-2009. We collected information on hysterectomy rates, on the absolute number of hysterectomies carried out, on the cumulative rates of hysterectomy by five years age groups from 40 to 84 years, and on the most frequent reasons for treatment. We found wide regional variations (by 5-folds) in both crude and age-standardized rates. In general, the age-adjusted hysterectomy rate (ASR-1999-2009) ranged from 73.3 to 251.6 in the different regions, with the highest rate recorded in Lombardia and the lowest in Molise (C.I. 95%) and Abruzzo (C.I. 95%). The age-standardized cumulative rates for the 1950s showed the highest variation among 21-29 years. Conversely, the age-adjusted cumulative rates for the 1970s and 1980s ranged from 75.5 in Abruzzo to 66.8 in Calabria and 66.0 in Friuli-Venezia-Giulia (C.I. 95%). The most frequent types of hysterectomy were total hysterectomy for benign causes and subtotal hysterectomy for malignant causes. From the point of view of geographical regional analysis, the most frequent causes were benign endometrial and ovarian lesions. Hysterectomy rates are among the highest in the world, and they are 3 folds higher in Lombardia compared to the other Italian regions, highlighting the need and the need for a multidisciplinary"

Background Comment: [/BGT] Provide additional relevant background information about the system under study. <EOD> Differences in the use of intraoperative and postoperative pain relief and anxiety control amongst surgical patients in a Nigerian University Teaching Hospital
Background: Fear, anxiety and distress are often inherent complications of major surgery and can be counterbalanced by adequate analgesia and sedation. This study compares the pattern of use of intraoperative opioid and postoperative analgesics amongst patients undergoing surgical procedures at Obafemi Awolowo University Teaching Hospital, Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A total of 508 patients (117 males and 391 females) undergoing elective, major surgical operations under general anesthesia, spinal anesthesia and local anesthetic and sedation were studied over a period of 12 months. Patients were assigned into one of three groups: those undergoing major abdominal surgery (MAS) under general anesthesia, those operated upon under local anesthesia and sedation (LAS), or those undergoing regional or nerve block under spinal or regional anesthesia. Pain levels were evaluated using the visual analog pain score (VAS) and the use of analgesics was documented. A pro forma was designed to assess patients' level of anxiety preanaesthesia. Statistical analysis was performed using the EPI INFO version 6.04 and the STA-TCARE and Chi-square test. Results: Intraoperatively, 114 (22.4%) patients of the 508 studied received opioids, whilst the rest received inhalational anaesthesia. Postoperatively, 159 (31.4%) patients were given opioids and 98 (19.3%) received other pain management analgesics. Patients in MAS group received opioids more than in the LAS (19.5% and 2.1%) and RAS (18.4%-1.0%) groups. Preoperative anxiety scores are higher in the GA group and were higher in females and lower in the LAS group but postoperatively, the differences are reversed with a higher mean anxiety score of 4.6(4.1-5.1) compared to 3.3 ± 1.8 in the LAS group. Mean anxiety score in the two RAS groups is 3.5 ± 1.6 and 3.4 ± 1.3 compared to 2.6 ± 1.0 and 2.3 ± 1.0 in the MAS and the LAS groups respectively. Conclusions: Majority of surgical patients receive insufficient analgesics throughout surgery and postoperative pain is treated only when it is severe, when it produces distress and when there are no other available alternatives. The pain scores for severe pain and distress levels are more in patients operated upon under general anaesthesia than in those operated upon under nerve block anaesthesia. Fear, anxiety and distress are all more prevalent in females and young ages and are reduced in the presence of analgesic and sedative drugs. In order to curb pain, anxiety and distress after major operations there is need to develop pain and anxiety management protocols and educating patients on anticipated pain and anxiety in operations and appropriate use of analgesic drugs preoperatively and for a few days after surgery. <EOD> Effect of prothrombin and thrombin on adhesion of human platelets.
1. The effect of prothrombin and thrombin on the adhesion of human platelets to glass has been investigated. 2. Prothrombin in aqueous solution was found to enhance platelet adhesion. A concentration of 1 mg of protein per ml was required to effect a doubling of adhesion while a concentration of 0.2 mg/ml sufficed to augment adhesion 2–3 times. Further addition of the protein only caused a reduction in the degree of adhesion. Dilution of 0.2 mg/l prothrombin resulted in rapid loss of adhesion and 0.02 mg/l prothrombin enhanced adhesion to the same extent as 0.2 mg/l prothrombin.

One of the most prevalent problems of the 21 century is an increase of obesity and its medical and social consequences. The aim of the study is to assess the potential of two new methods of measuring body composition as an element of routine examinations of children and adolescents at school entry. 111 children ranged from 7 to 15 years were investigated. Three methods of measuring body composition were used: a densitometrical one--BIA to Delta 800 MG apparatus and two X-ray methods 104--total body X-ray absorptiometry--Bone Densitometer Norland XR 36 X--ray absorptiometry of the bones of the knee--GOS Medical Apparatus Co. Tables and the anthropometric ones showed that a wide range of BMI centile groups is necessary to divide boys and girls into underweight and obese groups. BIA is useful to assess body fat in underweight and overweight children and adolescents due to its non-invasiveness and low price. It can distinguish only obese from non-obese children, but is not able to assess its degree. X-ray absorptiometry of the bones of the knee could be an important element in the examination of the spine, pelvis and hip joints of prepubertal boys and girls. It can be used to estimate stature and to assess body composition--fat-free mass, bone mass and bone mass index in children and adolescents before their growth plate fusion. It is time to consider the inclusion of these methods into the general population screening. <EOD> Diagnosis of the intrauterine dead fetus.
IN A previous report (1951) a radiographic method of diagnosis of the dead fetus was reviewed and a description of the methods used was given. In the year and a half of this further experience some modifications in the techniques have been made. They are the object of the present report. In the original description it was pointed out that two factors govern the position and movement of the fetus. The first is fetal activity. The more active the fetus the less likely is the placental or cord attachment to be broken. Accordingly, the more the fctus moves, the less change is there in the position and the movement. The second factor is the placental weight and surface. The placenta attached to a small, unengaged horn of the uterus cannot produce the tonic contractions of the uterus as the placenta undergoes labour contractions. These are a result of the contractions of the uterus. The placenta in a long, mature pregnancy can exert a powerful tone, which tends to keep the fetus in the same position. This tone is particularly effective during labor pains. These two factors must be taken into account <EOD> BRAIN ANGIOGRAPHY IN NEUROMUSCULAR DISORDERS *

107,"[/INST] <EOD> Efficacy and toxicity of antimicrobial prophylaxis in spine surgery: a prospective study.
OBJECTIVES
Postoperative fever, urinary tract infections, superficial or deep wound infectious complications are the most serious adverse effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in spine surgery. Because of the frequency of this complication, its duration and its consequences for the patient and antibiotic resistance, we evaluated the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis and the rate of adverse effects in prophylactic regimens in different spine-surgery settings.


METHODS
Prospective study, including a total of 30 patients, in the post-operative period, after different types of spinal surgery (minimally invasive, micro-surgical decompressive and arthrodesis, micro-surgical decompressive-fusion). A pre-determined protocol was followed in the analysis of the data, including the antibiotic prophylaxis and the assessment of post-operative morbidity.


RESULTS
Post-operative adverse events occur in 18.9% of patients, whereas infectious post-operative complications occur in 10% of cases, both more frequently after minimally invasive surgery (40%) rather than after the two other types of procedures. The most frequent microorganism responsible for infectious complications is E. coli. No correlation was established between the use of beta-lactams and adverse events. The occurrence of post-operative adverse events was greater in patients who received amoxicillin compared to those who received cefazolin (37 vs. 27%, p = 0.018).


CONCLUSIONS
The administration of antibiotic surgical prophylaxis decreases the risk of infectious post-operative complications (10%). The occurrence of adverse events is more frequent in minimally invasive surgery. The type of antibiotic prophylaxis is not correlated with the incidence of adverse events, although beta-lactams seem to be linked to a higher risk of post-operative adverse events, a fact confirmed by the occurrence of more post-operative complications in patients who received amoxicillin. <EOD> The effects of aging upon the electroretinogram.
This paper describes the development of the normal electroretinogram of the human eye and compares it with the electroretinogram observed in cases of retinitis pigmentosa, optic atrophy, macular degeneration, glaucoma and ageing. The aging electroretinogram is characterized by three features: (a) the appearance of a negative-going waveform in the dark-adapted component; (b) a significant reduction in amplitudes of all waves; and (c) an accelerated latency of the a- and b-waves. The authors discuss possible mechanisms of aging upon the electrical activity of the eye. <EOD> Diabetes management practices among primary-care physicians, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia and factors that contribute to it.
This cross-sectional study on primary-care physicians in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia investigated diabetes management practices, associated factors for these practices and the factors that motivate physicians to provide such services. A 24-point questionnaire was distributed to all physicians, attending training at Riyadh Colleges of Medicine and Dentistry via paper form or an online questionnaire. Two hundred and fourteen physicians participated. The most common activities of primary-care physicians related to providing care for patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) were recording blood glucose (BG) levels (in 183  people), urine glucose (in 172  people) and fasting blood glucose (in 130  people). These findings were significantly associated with practice location, practice setting and total years of practice. Most physicians use printed booklets (in 142  people), the Internet (in 112  people), magazines (in 75  people) and educational courses/presentations (in 73  people) as the main resources for educating their patients.

Input Text: TINO: summary <EOD> Evaluation of ciprofloxacin-modification techniques on the physical properties of polyurethane bone cements.
The purpose of this study was to provide a physical analysis of commercial poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-methacryloxyethyl trimellitate anhydride) (PMMmTA-4A) bone cements modified with ciprofloxacin (an antimicrobial agent). Poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA) was added to the commercial PMMmTA-4A bone cements to further modify the cements. Four separate cement mixtures have been developed, each containing a ciprofloxacin hydrochloride (CIP) modification agent (20 ppm): (i) CIP alone; (ii) CIP with PHEMA polymerization initiator only; (iii) CIP with PHEMA polymerization initiator and PHEMA; (iv) CIP with PHEMA polymerization initiator, PHEMA, and PMMmTA-4A. The PMMmTA-4A bone cements were evaluated for their ability to adhere to smooth and rough human cortical bone surfaces. Shear adhesion forces as high as 3.33 N were obtained from bone cement systems, with no significance difference between adhesion forces from smooth and rough bone surfaces. This represents the largest adhesion force reported in the literature for bone cement systems formulated with poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-methacryloxyethyltri(methacryloxyethyl) trimellitate anhydride) (PMMmTA-4A). Results indicated that bone cements could be modified with ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, even with a high CIP-to-binder ratio of 0.012, providing sufficient antibiotic properties. By comparison of the shear adhesion forces obtained for PMMmTA-4A bone cements compared to those bone cements with varying ratios of monomers and the antimicrobial agent ciprofloxacin incorporated into the poly(methyl methacrylate-co-methyl acrylate-co-HEMA-b-PHEMA) poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-methacryloxyl ethylacrylate-co-HEM-co-PHEMA-co-methyl acrylate) (HHAMA) poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-methacryloxy ethyl trimellitate anhydride) (PMMmTA-4A) poly(methyl methacrylate-co-4-methacryloxy ethyl trimellitate anhydride-co-HEMA-bpoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMmTAPMMA) bone cements, the highest adhesion force was obtained from the PMMmTA-4A bone cements containing ciprofloxacin. <EOD> Evaluation of Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Telephone Interactive Cognitive Test (TELE) in diagnosing mild cognitive impairment to dementia transition: a cross-sectional, comparative observational study in a Malaysian hospital setting
ABSTRACT Background: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) involves the decline of cognitive function more than age-related cognitive decline but not clinically demented. Diagnosis of MCI and prediction of progression to dementia is important as timely interventions could slow down its progression, hence delaying the onset of dementia. Therefore, this study aims to compare the diagnostic utility of the MMSE, CASI, MOCA, and TELE in diagnosing MCI and dementia.

How many people are currently enrolled in the study?
-----------------
No Enrolment Reports Are Available. <EOD> Enigmatic laminated microinjection systems of the freshwater annelid family Sphaeriidae.
1. The freshwater families Sphaeriidae and Aeolosomatidae show the most sophisticated microinjection systems known in annelids. 2. These systems, although differing in some particulars, work by essentially the same internal arrangement of elements. 3. The microinjection apparatuses of the two families are most likely homologous. In both, the mouth opening is the starting point and probably the place where the nutritive cells are attached to the body wall. In the Sphaeriidae, there is no evidence for a transitional nutritive zone. 4. The Sphaeriidae have a modified mouth opening with an oesophageal tooth. This may be the site where the nutritive cells become active in the food cycle. 5. In Aeolosomatidae, the nutritive cells extend their slender projections to surround the mouth aperture. In contrast, the nutritive cells of the Sphaeriidae are much larger and have a very strong interrelation with the microinjection apparatus. The two elements seem to form a functional unit. 6. As the food-conducting canal of the nutritive cells of the Sphaeriidae is closed at its proximal end, it may be considered as an injection tube. 7. The most likely function of the nutritive cells is their injection of food particles and nutrients into the blood vessels, probably with the aid of the laminated microinjection apparatus. <EOD> Surgery of the cribriform duct and maxillary sinus.

Summary: Oral administration of phenylacetate to mice was shown to possess substantial anticonvulsant activity. Phenylacetate was effective in preventing the development of seizures induced by maximal electroshock, pentetrazole, picrotoxin, strychnine, bicuculline, metrazol, and picrotoxin. The protection observed was comparable to that of a drug, phenobarbital when the mice were treated 1 day prior to the convulsants used below. Protection by phenobarbital or phenylacetate was diminished when the drugs were given either 7 days prior to the electroshock and pentetrazole or 3 days prior to strychnine, bicuculline, metrazol, and picrotoxin. However phenobarbital and phenylacetate, when administered 1 or 3 days prior to maximal electroshock and pentetrazole, protected the animals better than either drugs administered as a single bolus dose 7 days prior to electroshock and pentetrazole. It was also shown that multiple administration of 15 mg/kg phenylacetate had less adverse effect on locomotor activity than did multiple administration of 20 mg/kg phenobarbital. Phenylacetate was less than one‐tenth as toxic as phenobarbital. Although the exact mechanism by which phenylacetate protects against convulsants is not clear, data are presented from which a suggestion concerning a possible mechanism can be made. Evidence was provided which does not seem to support the idea that the adverse effect of phenylacetate is linked to toxic effects on the central nervous system.

Output Text: Added Diagnostic Value of Point of Care Ultrasound in Acute Dyspnea : A Prospective Observational Study

Study Abstract
----------------

Background:
Dyspnea is a common presenting complaint in the Emergency Department (ED).

Dyspnea also represents one of the main reasons for a short stay in hospital. Dyspnea requires timely evaluation and treatment as several conditions causing dyspnea are time critical. Previous studies have suggested that point-ofcare ultrasound (POCUS) could increase diagnostic accuracy in the initial assessment of patients with dyspnea. However, in most studies POCUS was done by highly experienced physicians which could limit the generalisability of POCUS in the hands of all emergency specialist and residents.

Objective:
To evaluate whether POCUS performed by a variety of emergency medicine physicians (specialists and residents) increase diagnostic accuracy in patients with dyspnea compared to usual routine assessment.

Methods:
Specialist and residents in Emergency Medicine at the ED in Lund and Helsingborg (Sweden) will have a brief training and certification in a structured dyspnea POCUS protocol. The protocol includes focused lung (8 or 14 zones), heart (subcostal, parasternal and apical four chamber views) and inferior vena cava ultrasound. Study design Prospective <EOD> Gender differences in children with ADHD treated with methylphenidate for 6 months—The ADHD CARE study
This open‐label 6‐month extension study was conducted to: (a) evaluate the long‐term safety and effectiveness of methylphenidate (Ritalin®) in clinical practice for children aged 6–12 years previously treated with methylphenidate for 6 months in routine care, and 1 2 months in a controlled setting with 83% of the previously treated patients included in the 12‐month controlled period; methylphenidate has been the first‐choice recommended treatment for children with ADHD for nearly 50 years; (b) describe the efficacy of methylphenidate in children with ADHD who have previously participated in a treatment study in routine care, and (c) evaluate whether children with ADHD treated with methylphenidine differed in symptom evolution from the beginning and the end of the 6‐month open‐label study from children with different forms of developmental and behavioral problems. Evaluations included ADHD Rating Scale for Teacher version (ADHD‐RS‐T) and Parent/Investigator version (ADHD‐RS‐P/I), Conners’ Parent Rating Scales (CPRS‐R), Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI), Child Health Questionnaire (CHQ58), CATS—Child Attention Test System (CATS), and the PedsQLTM. The primary outcome was: the mean change from the 12‐month controlled period in the ADHD‐RS‐P/I, and in the CPRS‐R inattention symptom subscale. Secondary outcome measures were the other ADHD‐RS‐RS and CPRS‐R ADHD‐related symptom scales, the CGI, the CHQ58, the PedsQLTM, the CATS, the number of children who responded to and remitted of therapy, and the number of children who required drug therapy dose titration. Analysis of variance with Dunnett's post hoc comparison was conducted. A total of 83% of the 101 patients included in the previously published controlled periods of the 6‐month, randomized study were evaluated. All scales showed a statistically significant improvement when compared to the beginning of the 6‐month open‐label period, and with the 12‐month baseline period in the controlled study, with the ADHD‐RS‐RS Inattention and total symptom scale improving the most from beginning of the open‐label period. The CGI evaluated the patients as much improved at the end of the 12‐month period, for both ADHD‐RS‐RS Total and Inattention Improvement. The ADHD‐RS‐RS Total, inattention, hyperactivity, and oppositional scales and the CPRS‐R Inattention subscale improved significantly from the beginning of the open‐label period.

What is the study?
================
Researchers at this location are studying a research program to improve radiation therapy for breast cancer patients. Researchers are also collecting breathing and heart rate data during the radiation therapy to better understand how patients experience radiation therapy, and how we can improve it. Some of the radiation therapy plans will be evaluated using special imaging to allow us to develop more effective treatment options.
Researchers will also measure and track:
- 
Research has shown that some breast cancer patients have a worse prognosis than others.
Specifically, people who are overweight or obese are less likely to receive successful breast conserving treatment.
This study is taking place at a hospital (hôpital) in Val-de-Haine, France. Breast cancer diagnosis, medical care, and radiation therapy are all provided here. We are seeking participants for this study, who receive radiation therapy at the hospital.
Participants MUST be able to speak and write French. Additionally, you CANNOT:
- 
Participants SHOULD NOT receive their treatment at another place. We CANNOT collect enough data if you get treatment somewhere else.
You will receive treatment planning for your radiation therapy based on two planning scans.
You will also receive 40-45 minutes of breath coaching and/or relaxation training using an MP3 player.
Researchers will provide these sessions before you start radiation therapy, one day a week for 4-5 weeks.
Breath coaching training is designed to teach patients to better use their breath. Patients learn to control their breath. They learn to think about the importance of how their breath changes.
Relaxation training is designed for patients. They learn to stop the thoughts and fears associated with treatment. Patients learn to redirect their thoughts. They also learn relaxation exercises to use so they can focus on their breathing instead of stress and worries.
Patients will be expected to practice their breathing exercises with their therapist each week during their radiation treatment. Please do your best and share all of your thoughts with your therapist.
Researchers will not collect any information that includes your name or personal information.
This study is being conducted in collaboration with MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas. We look forward to working with you. Thank you.

[CLST] Fenugreek seeds have been suggested to have anti-hyperlipidaemic effects, but limited evidence is available from studies in humans with diabetes or insulin resistance. In addition, human data for fenugreek for lipidlowering effects in humans with hyperlipidaemia without diabetes or insulin resistance is lacking. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed in hyperlipidaemic patients compared to a group on placebo tea. MicroRNAs in blood will also potentially increase our understanding of fenugreek tea's mode of action on hyperlipidaemia.

# Background

[/INST]
[CLST]

Hyperlipidaemia in non-diabetics is defined as a triglyceride level between 1.7-4.5mmol/l with fasting total cholesterol >5.18mmol/l or plasma LDL-cholesterol >3.3mmol/l (1) . Hyperlipidaemia is a prominent cardiovascular disease risk factor in clinical research studies, and it is associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, hypertension, and insulin resistance in healthy individuals. It is therefore important to assess any lipid changes following fenugreek tea consumption by determining plasma HDL-cholesterol, plasma LDL-cholesterol, plasma total-cholesterol and fasting triglyceride levels.

[/INST]
[CLST]

MicroRNA-34a has been shown to be upregulated in dyslipidaemia and has been speculated as a key mechanism in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiac muscle dysfunction in individuals with hyperlipidaemia. It is also involved in lipogenesis and lipolysis in adipose tissue and the regulation of cellular cholesterol metabolism in atherosclerotic models (2). There is a lack of research to confirm this theory in human subjects. While a variety of microRNAs are associated with lipid metabolism, microRNA-122 is most closely associated with increased cholesterol and triglyceride levels (3). Therefore, the effects of fenugreek seed consumption on this microRNA will provide more insights into fenugreek seed's effects on lipid metabolism and therefore the cardiovascular disease risk.

Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum L.), a medicinal plant, has been used as an ingredient in various traditional foods, beverages and herbal preparations for centuries. It is believed to have anti-diabetic and anti-hyperlipidaemia effects according to a few clinical studies, which has increased its use as a therapeutic food ingredient (4). Fenugreek also has the ability to lower glycated hemoglobin in diabetic animal models (5). Previous studies showed that plasma cholesterol is lowered by 11.3% and 11.5% after fenugreek seed supplementation as a dietary intervention for 4 and 12 weeks, respectively, in diabetic and hyperlipidaemic human subjects (6). However, the studies did not assess triglyceride levels which are also strongly associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. No studies however have been done to evaluate the therapeutic effects of phenolic compounds, which is the major active component present in the fenugreek seed. A study in rat models suggested that the phenolic compounds in the seed, especially the flavonoids and polyphenols, reduced plasma triglyceride and serum cholesterol levels (7). Another rat study concluded that fenugreek seed had the ability to decrease plasma and liver lipid levels by increasing the activities or expression levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), sterol-regulatory-element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1), mRNA, farnesoid X receptor (FXR), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP), apolipoprotein B (apoB) and plasma free fatty acids (8).

OBJECTIVE
To determine the effect on the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and caspase-3 in the liver by the protoberene alkaloids from Isopolypodium cinnamomeum (PC1, PC2, PC3) and their possible molecular mechanism.


METHODS
The expression of PCNA, EGFR and Caspase-3 protein in liver of rats was examined by immunohistochemistry assay, and then the results were analyzed using image analysis system.


RESULTS
The expression of PCNA, EGFR and Caspase-3 was obviously different among the three protoberene alkaloid groups, and were related to the liver size. The effect of different protoberene alkaloids on PCNA-, EGFR- and Caspase-3-positive cells was concentration-dependent. The inhibition of PCNA-positive cells and EGFR-positive cells was obvious, while that of Caspase-3-positive cells was insignificant. On the one hand, the expression of PCNA and EGFR was both obviously reduced in PC1 and PC2 groups which could block the proliferation of liver cells, and their decreasing order was PC1 > PC2 > PC3. On the other hand, the expression of Caspase-3 was obviously accelerated by PC2 (24 cases/group) and PC3 (24 cases/group), but there was no remarkable difference between the PC1 and negative control groups. It confirmed that PC1 and PC2 had the same effect in the inhibition of the proliferation of liver cells, and the inhibiting effect of PC1 was stronger than that of PC2, while PC3 had a marked effect on the apoptosis of the hepatocytes.


CONCLUSION
The effect of the protoberene alkaloids from Isopolypodium cinnamomeum on the expression of PCNA, EGFR and Caspase-3 is dose- and time-dependent, and correlates with the inhibiting of proliferation of liver cells and induction of apoptosis of liver cells. <EOD> Comparison of the Effects of Transverse and Sagittal Osteotomy on Bone Microarchitecture in the Tibia of Ovine

As the demand for organ transplants steadily increases so does the problem of uncontrolled immune reactions between the donor allograft and the recipient who is genetically dissimilar. Current methods of suppressing the immune response to the graft are far from ideal and further studies are being made to find more and more efficient treatments. Cyclosporin and Gengraf are two new compounds currently used in organ and bone marrow transplantation that have been shown to be highly effective and easy to use with minimal side effects. Our study compares these two compounds in terms of clinical and radiological efficacy over a 2 year period. Cyclosporin is a new and highly innovative drug: 60% of the patients treated developed renal failure by the end of the study, most of them requiring dialysis for 6 months. Gengraf is a less drastic drug and thus avoids the development of renal failure, and the side effects are reduced. The clinical and radiological results of these two compounds are very good and the patients tolerate them well. Both are excellent immunosuppressive drugs. The choice of treatment must depend on the individual case. <EOD> .
The relationship between atherosclerosis and diabetes is characterized by the accelerated proliferation of smooth muscle cells and an increased deposition of collagen and cholesterol. We compared the changes in the vascular intima over the long term in young diabetics and normal subjects and found a significant increase of intima thickness in non-insulin-dependent diabetics. It appears, therefore, that the effect of diabetes on atherosclerosis is already detectable in young diabetics, and the vascular wall undergoes further changes with the evolution of the disease. <EOD> In Vivo Evolution of a Novel Virulence Determinant from a Horizontally Acquired Salmonella Choleraesuis Cholesterol Uptake Gene cusB
ABSTRACT Cholesterol metabolism is important for Salmonella serovars to cause intestinal and extraintestinal disease in the course of infection. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strain CT18 has three putative cholesterol uptake genes that are under the transcriptional regulation of the pleiotropic regulator hilA, which is a main virulence gene in Salmonella, unlike Salmonella enterica serovar Choleraesuis strains. A cusB sequence from S. Choleraesuis strain KJ71006 was acquired from Salmonella Typhimurium by natural transformation. S. Choleraesuis strains that have acquired this horizontally transferred cusB sequence showed higher virulence in a 50%-lethal-dose mouse model than those that have not. The results show that the acquired cusB enhances S. Choleraesius virulence in a strain that is otherwise harmless to mice. <EOD> A genetic toolkit to study the contribution of glia in age‐related neurodegeneration
Glia are essential partners for the survival or dysfunction of the nervous system. In this study, we generated Drosophila lines carrying three reporters that mark glial cells in vivo and ex vivo. To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence of the expression of the Ets effector gene slbo in glial cells. Also, we confirmed the previous reports that glial cells express the glutamine synthase (GS). In contrast with their mammalian counterparts, we show that glia of Drosophila are glutamatergic. In addition, we identified specific glial subtypes expressing the calcium binding protein GCAMP1, and another glia subtype that lack GCAMbP. We demonstrate that this latter glial subtype expresses the protein GABA (γ‐aminobutyric acid) and it is necessary for normal lifespan. We uncovered that all these glial subtypes are necessary for normal neuronal excitability. <EOD> .

 <EOD> A 6‐day bone ingrowth period for porous surface implants. An experimental study in rabbits
After bilateral femoral diaphysis surgery in 12 rabbits, 18 custom‐made threaded titanium implants with interconnected, porous surfaces (Nobelphoenix®, Sweden) were placed. Both femora were implanted in all rabbits. At the termination of the experiment at 8 weeks, the implant removal torque in combination with histological and SEM evaluation of the samples showed that the majority of the implants had been completely incorporated. The ingrowth period was therefore decreased to 6 days, which is the shortest time that has been published up to now. This shows the potential of the porous technology in orthopedic surgery. <EOD> A Drosophila model for the mutational analysis of S100A1

Background:The Drosophila gene CG3301 codes for a S100A1. Although many studies have been performed on the role of S100A1 in mammalian cells, there is an absolute lack of knowledge on the function of this protein in animals.Results:In order to uncover the function of S100A1 we performed a homozygous mutational screening in Drosophila by targeting transposon insertion mutagenesis. After this mutational screening we have identified 111 different mutant strains in the gene CG3301. In homozygosis a very high number of the mutants died before first stage of oligogenesis (1/1-15% 1 st instar larvae). Only 10% of the mutants show a viability of over 15% 1 st instar larvae. In the screen we were also able to identify two point mutants. After sequencing of genomic DNA the mutated gene was shown to be CG3301 itself.Conclusions:The identification of new molecular functions of S100A1 via mutational analysis in Drosophila melanogaster contributes to the identification of cellular functions of S100A proteins, in general.

 <EOD> Prognostic significance of 18F-FDG uptake by primary tumours and axillary lymph nodes in patients with breast cancer.
BACKGROUND
In patients with breast cancer positive for the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), the status of the axillary lymph nodes is not the only predictor of the response to chemotherapy and prognosis.


PURPOSE
To evaluate the relationship between the uptake of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) in primary tumours and axillary lymph nodes and the response to chemotherapy.


METHODS
The uptake of 18F-FDG was assessed in 30 patients with HER2-positive breast cancer at diagnosis. The maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) of primary tumours was determined by computed tomography-guided planar PET scans and that of axillary lymph nodes, by PET/computed tomography. The response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used to classify the patients into groups as follows: group 1, 0 (responder); group 2, 1 (insufficient response or non-responder).


RESULTS
Mean SUVmax of primary tumours was 9.3±5.5 in group 1 and 14.5±8.3 in group 2; a statistically significant difference was found. In 14 of 30 patients, with both metastatic axillary lymph nodes and non-metastatic lymph nodes at the same side, the SUVmax of the lymph nodes with metastasis was higher than that of the non-metastatic lymph nodes.

This study confirms the data from dissection and electromyography. <EOD> Effect of TGF-β1 in epithelial barrier function

Transforming growth factor β 1 (TGF-β1) is associated with bronchial asthma and plays an important role in inducing epithelial-associated inflammation[12,13]. Epithelial barrier function is important for the resistance of the lung to the entry of foreign antigens, and disorders of this function result in an increased sensitivity to aeroallergens and increased inflammation. In previous studies, TGF-β1 administration decreased the TEER and increased the paracellular permeability of lung epithelial cells[14], and inhibition of TGF-β1 reversed this decrease[15].In the present study, we focused on the role of the TGF-β1 in the barrier function of human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro. To address this question, we evaluated the changes in the ionic, paracellular, lipid, tight junction permeabilities after TGF-β1 stimulation. In addition, the expression levels of tight junction and adhesion junction proteins after stimulation were evaluated.

""Remote diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea improves the blood pressure rhythm""
Summary:
Patients who have suspicious OSA and recommended to sleep center for HSAT monitoring would like to know the treatment effect of OSA.
They can obtain remote assistance from the physicians to reduce the time and financial cost of traveling to the sleep center. The physicians will understand the sleep apnea related diseases of patients in remote areas through HSAT and then give therapeutic advice to patients to sleep centers. This study will explore whether the telemedical technology can improve the blood pressure rhythm of OSA patients.

Sleep apnea is characterized by frequent apnea and hypoventilation during nighttime sleep.
According to the severity of sleep apnea and hypopnea, patients with different kinds and rates of OSA will have different effects on blood pressure and sleeping.
The current OSA treatments mainly include CPAP, oral appliance, and oxygen therapy. CPAP is a form of non-invasive mechanical ventilation and commonly used to treat sleep apnea, which is commonly accepted by OSA patients. CPAP is also a risk factor for the complications of OSA. However, the use of APAP is still not widespread.
Patients with OSA are prone to have increased blood pressure and sleep-related breath disorders, especially the waking up and going to bed for the early morning period. During this period, the blood pressure of patients with OSA is often lower than normal level, and the morning blood pressure is prone to be higher than the night level of blood pressure, which is defined as morning blood pressure surge. The higher the level of morning blood pressure surge in patients with OSA, the greater the damage it has caused.
OSA is also related to the development and progression of complications such as coronary heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and diabetes. The mechanism by which OSA induces complications has not been fully determined, but hypertension plays an important role. The incidence of hypertension as well as the variability of blood pressure in OSA have received attention from the clinical research community.
OSA also causes increased cardiovascular risk and may be an independent risk factor. CPAP, an effective treatment for OSA, can obviously improve the sleep quality of patients, the risk of cardiovascular disease, and the activity of autonomic nerve function.
OSA is accompanied by complex pathological mechanisms, involving the whole body system and various parts, resulting in changes in the autonomous nerve regulatory function of the whole body and of its various organs. In addition to the traditional OSA risk factors (Obesity, age, gender, heredity, race, smoking, excessive alcohol), there are also many studies have shown that OSA is related to the autonomic nerve regulation disorder.
CPAP, a non-invasive intervention strategy for OSA, is more and more widely used. There are controversies of the effect of CPAP on blood pressure. Although some studies indicate that CPAP is an effective means to reduce blood pressure, most of current relevant studies, such as the results of a 2016 cohort study, showed that CPAP had no significant effect on the complications of OSA, suggesting that CPAP could not alleviate the hypertension of OSA patients and could not obviously improve the prognosis and blood pressure of hypertensive patients with OSA. However, a prospective study followed by the Finnish type II diabetes group (FINGER) of the Department of Endocrinology at the University of Helsinki showed that OSA patients with type II diabetes who used CPAP had lower blood pressure than non-users. Studies have shown that APAP treatment can improve the circadian hypertension of OSA patients and improve their morning blood pressure surge.
However, the evidence of CPAP-induced changes in the circadian blood pressure of OSA patients is heterogeneous, partly dependent on the level of adherence to the OSA, differences in study designs, etc. OSA is considered to be a risk factor for cardiovascular disease in most studies and is an effective intervention for controlling blood pressure.
Telemedicine is a new medical technology system that uses computer and information technology to provide continuous health care for patients outside medical institutions. It is used to manage diseases in a way that does not require the patient to come to the hospital every day. The use of telemedicine technology makes it possible to diagnose and treat OSA patients who are far from large centers, have difficulty following the clin"

Congenital heart disease (CHD) may affect the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrom (POTS). It may be part of more complex autonomic dysfunction, with many other syndromes. We report two children with POTS and CHD, one of them complicated with Marfanoid habitus. Both children had high normal resting heart rate, with inappropriate response of heart rate during standing test and during isometric handgrip challenge and with tachycardia-hypotension phenomena. We describe the main characteristics of CHD found in 10 children out of 134 cases of CHD (7.5%) with complex POTS phenomena, mainly in the presence of defects of the outflow tract (Ventricular septum defect-VSD, Aortic Arch hypoplasia, Tetralogy of Fallot, Aortic coarctation). <EOD> Highly efficient synthetic anti-GFP nanobody (VHH)-tethered RNA aptamer complexes can be used for imaging mRNA distribution within living cells

Background: mRNA therapeutics has become an appealing alternative to gene therapy because of its safety and the ability to control the levels of protein expression by manipulating dosing and duration of expression. Recent progress in biosensing technologies in microRNA detection has resulted in the development of fluorescent oligonucleotide-based sensors and a new class of sensors, aptamer-antibody protein conjugates. In this study, we constructed a chimeric peptide aptamer (CPA) molecule by conjugating an anti-green fluorescent protein (GFP) single variable fragment (VHH) to a synthetic G-rich, RNA aptamer molecule that recognizes the GFP mRNA (GFP-mRNA) sequence (E122B aptamer).Results: Fluorescence spectroscopy analysis demonstrates that free E122B RNA aptamers form complexes with their GFP-mRNA target and that fusion with the anti-GFP nanobody (VHH) enhances this binding in vitro, presumably by increasing the binding interface and the binding affinity. These CPA molecules were demonstrated to fluorescently track the GFP mRNA in live HeLa cells. Flow cytometric analysis shows that CPA 1.58 × 10 −9 M and CPA 2.5 × 10 −7 M could specifically bind to and discriminate between GFP-mRNA and GFP-mRNA with two base pair substitutions. In addition, the amount of total internal GFP-mRNA expression can potentially be determined by flow cytometry using the CPA and fluorometric measurements to quantify GFP fluorescence with RNA isolated from total cell lysate.Conclusions:In summary, the synthetic anti-GFP VHH-aptamer-tethered RNA molecules described here enable the direct detection of the endogenously expressed GFP mRNA in living cells, which would otherwise be difficult using flow cytometry. Furthermore, these molecules could potentially be used to detect the endogenously expressed transcripts which are of pharmacological or physiological interest.

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: A new era of medical treatment using antiviral agents against SARS-CoV-2 has been inaugurated with remdesivir. Antiviral agents, immune modulators, anti-inflammatory and corticosteroid agents, and anticoagulant agents, which have all been newly introduced since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, have been extensively used in patients with COVID-19 who require supplemental oxygen. The prognosis of COVID-19 has been dramatically improved by the combined use of these agents. Although antiviral agents are not used as commonly as immune modulators, anti-inflammatory and corticosteroid agents, or anticoagulant agents, remdesivir, which inhibits viral replication during the very early phase of the infection, is also used in combination with other agents to improve prognosis. However, remdesivir has no definite indication, and an association between remdesivir and serious adverse events could not be denied. As an antiviral agent used for the treatment of COVID-19, it remains that remdesivir will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial. Moreover, there has been no comparison of remdesivir efficacy and adverse events relative to the standard therapy for severe COVID-19. Therefore, the purpose of the current trial is to investigate the efficacy and prognostic impact of remdesivir on patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen compared with standard therapy.

The primary disease progression has been improved by the introduction of antiviral agents, immune modulators, anti-inflammatories, and corticosteroids, and the disease progression in patients who receive these agents has become very slow within the first week of onset, and most of them have survived or recovered with only mild residual symptoms. There is thus little room in the management of the patient for further improvement. However, some patients with severe COVID-19 have been refractory to treatment and have developed severe inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis or severe shock, and their survival rate has not increased due to severe lung dysfunction and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. Some patients have died of nosocomial infections, some have had cerebral hemorrhage, some have had multiorgan failure, and the survival rate has not increased because of these complications. In general, the prognosis rate has improved, but some patients have deteriorated due to a variety of complications, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, etc. In severe cases, patients with COVID-19 have developed severe inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis or have developed progressive lung fibrosis leading to respiratory failure and have developed severe lung dysfunction in severe cases, and their survival rate has not increased. Some patients have died of nosocomial infections (such as Clostridium difficile), some have died of cerebral hemorrhage, and some have suffered from multiorgan failure and have not had a favorable outcome due to these complications. In general, the prognosis has improved, but some patients have deteriorated due to a variety of complications, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia, etc.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the novel antiviral agent remdesivir in the treatment of severe cases of COVID-19 with refractory disease progression, which shows insufficient response to the standard treatment used commonly for the treatment of severe disease  with the use of remdesivir, standard treatment for COVID-19 (as described above), and the comparison of the effect of remdesivir treatment on the prognosis (disease progression, survival rate, death rate, and recovery rate) in addition to the evaluation of the safety.

 : #xref-corresp-1-1 <EOD> A Review of the Clinical Implications of HbA1c for Diabetic and Non-Diabetic Clinical Conditions

Non-diabetic acute and chronic conditions may lead to an overestimation of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) levels and, thereby, misdiagnosis. Since HbA1c is currently used as the standard test of diabetes, it is imperative to review the evidence that this blood test may have a lesser impact in clinics and health surveys on patient condition and prevalence data when HbA1c is outside the normal range in the non-diabetic population. We reviewed the published research papers describing the effect of non-diabetic, acute and chronic conditions, on HbA1c within 28 days. Search terms were applied to online databases. Eight papers and one website were identified for review and discussed. The review showed that non-diabetic disease had significant impact on HbA1c results and, therefore, these results must be interpreted with caution.

# Introduction
HbA1c, the gold standard test for diagnosing type 2 diabetes (T2D), has long been recognised as a biomarker that reflects glucose control over the past 2-3 months.
However, recent studies indicate that this short-term glucose control marker also has the potential to act as a marker for various life-limiting chronic conditions such as heart disease, lung cancer and some forms of dementia. This review will focus on the current evidence showing that acute or chronic disease presenting 28 days prior to the diagnostic HbA1c measurement has an effect on HbA1c levels. These papers will focus on two aspects of the HbA1c test:
- HbA1c values in subjects without diabetes and with the acute or chronic condition under investigation; and
- The effect of the acute or chronic disease being investigated on the HbA1c measurement process.
All papers and articles presented in this review investigated HbA1c values in acute and chronic diseases, with or without the diagnosis of diabetes, using either a direct comparison of an affected and unaffected group or using regression analyses. In some cases, a control group or population-level data were used, where the HbA1c or disease prevalence were compared between populations with versus without the diagnosis of diabetes, but not disease. All papers and articles used HbA1c for the diagnosis of diabetes. Disease (i) was identified by the study description either directly from the study participants or by the diagnosis or treatment of the condition recorded from the participants' healthcare records.

# Methods

## Article search and selection
The search criteria required that results show that the acute or chronic disease under investigation had an effect on HbA1c values. This was achieved by performing searches in PubMed Central (PMC) and Web of Science (WOS), databases that archive and index articles published in peer-reviewed periodicals. Additional searches were carried out using Google Scholar ® and the grey literature using the search terms ' HbA1c * AND effect AND disease' and 'HbA1c * AND effect AND acute'. The search was limited to publications dated on or after 1 November 2013 and was restricted to English language articles only.
A flowchart of the results is shown in. The initial search on PubMed and WOS yielded 444 articles, 11 of which were duplicated and removed. After a review of the title and abstract, 29 full-"

A new method of determination of the content of 6-keto-prostaglandin F1 alpha (6-keto-PGF1 alpha) and thromboxane B2 (TXB2) in blood serum and urine is suggested. 6-keto-PGF1 alpha and TXB2 are extracted with chloroform. Then 6-keto-PGF1 alpha is methylated with diazomethane, while TXB2 is extracted with diisopropyl ether. The extracts are analyzed for methyl 6-keto-PGF1 and thiobate-2,5-dihydrodiol using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescent detection in the 0.1% ZnS--sulfuric acid medium. The method is characterized by a good reproducibility and a wide range of sensitivity. <EOD> Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-Related Factor 2 (Nrf2) and Diabetic Ketoacidosis: Is Nrf2 a Potential Target for Diabetic Ketoacidosis Treatment?

Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is characterized by hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis. Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is one of the most important antioxidant and regenerative molecules, which has an influential role in the protection against various chronic diseases, including diabetes mellitus. The objective of this review is to discuss the association of Nrf2 and its signaling pathways with DKA and DKA-related complications. Our review of relevant English language literature identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases from 1997 to October 2019 shows that Nrf2 expression is reduced in response to oxidative and inflammatory stress-induced tissue injury in diabetic ketoacidosis. Nrf2 and its targets expression, including Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (Keap1), Nrf2-antioxidant response element (ARE), and NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), are associated with DKA-related complications. These findings reveal that manipulation or modulation of the Nrf2 signaling pathways could be novel targets for protection against DKA and prevention of DKA-related tissue damage.

# Introduction
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a group of metabolic disorders in which a high blood glucose level, also called hyperglycemia, occurs either because the body cannot produce enough insulin (Type 1 diabetes, T1DM) or because the cells do not respond to the insulin they produce (Type 2 diabetes, T2DM). The other type of diabetes known as gestational diabetes (GDM), in which abnormal carbohydrate metabolism occurs during normal pregnancy. One of the well-known life-threatening complications associated with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is hyperglycemia. DKA is also known as diabetes-induced ketoacidosis, with a risk of complications such as death. The treatment of patients with DKA may include fluid, electrolytes, the correction of acidemia, and the correction of hyperglycemia with intravenous (IV) access. IV insulin is the main treatment of DKA in addition to maintaining electrolyte and vital sings balance. IV fluids are needed to balance the body's fluid levels. The early stages of DKA may be treated with IV fluids (1) and DKA can sometimes lead to the failure of some organs. To date, due to the high sensitivity of the kidneys to the effects of ketones, kidney failure is still one of the most common complications of DKA.

## Diabetic ketoacidosis (dka)
DKA is one of the common complications of diabetes. Hyperglycemia, ketoacidosis from insulin deficiency, and electrolyte imbalances characterize it. Other less common presentations of DKA include hepatic dysfunction, intra-abdominal hemorrhage, lactic acidosis, encephalopathy"

 <EOD> Pharmacotherapy of Depression in the Long‐Term Care: Update 2010
Depression is a common problem in cognitively intact nursing home patients as well as in cognitively impaired nursing home patients. Depressed nursing home patients may be more symptomatic than community‐based elders, given the challenging and stressful living situations of most nursing home patients. They suffer from increased morbidity and mortality. They are more likely to become hospitalized and are more frequently prescribed potentially inappropriate medications, which increase the risk for side effects and adverse drug events. Nursing home patients with depression have higher rates in being on restraints, physical restraints, and chemical restraints. Depression can occur as a primary symptom or secondary symptom of a psychiatric illness (increased agitation) in the cognitively intact patients and can also occur as depressive symptoms secondary to a cognitive disorder (dementia) in the cognitively limited nursing home patients. Antidepressant medications are very safe, given in a low dose and have proven to be highly effective in improving depressive symptoms in nursing home patients. The choice of antidepressant medications varies, given the variety of depressed cognitively impaired patients (very early onset depression, vascular depression, dementia, depression with agitation, depression with psychotic features). However, the antidepressant drug that is most often prescribed in cognitively impaired patients is citalopram in a low dose. Many of the antidepressant medications now have long half‐lives, which allows for administration of medications on a daily rather than a BID or TID basis. A variety of the antidepressants in low doses are also efficacious in cognitively intact nursing home patients despite their dementia. Many of the antidepressant medications are also effective in reducing behavioral symptoms of depression, agitation, psychosis, and apathy in the cognitively impaired nursing home patients. All of the antidepressant medications now have proven to be effective in improving"

No statistically significant difference was observed in healing rate of leg ulcers between the two methods (p = 0.419). Patients with a healed leg ulcer (by the first of the month 6) following compression alone 60.5% compared to 68.3% who received compression with a laser (p = 0.666). The duration to first outpatient assessment was not significantly different between patients who were randomised to compression alone or compression plus a laser (3.7 (1.9) v 3.7 (2.0), p = 0.982). Adherence to laser treatment was 39%. (Dressing and bandage problems and pain were the reasons for missed treatment). There was no difference in adverse effects (including pain during treatment) between the compression group (35 patients) (15/35 43% reported adverse effects after their first clinic visit) and the compression plus laser group  (15/37 41% reported adverse effects after their first clinic visit).

Clinical significance
-------------------------------
There were no significant differences in the outcomes or adverse effects reported in patients who were randomised to the compression group or the compression plus laser arm, therefore clinicians can choose to treat patients with leg ulcers with simple compression garments alone or compression plus a laser.

Strengths
-------------
Randomised controlled trial

Weaknesses
---------------
The trial was small, hence the confidence intervals wide.

We describe the case of an 16-year-old woman with severe headache, nausea, and vomiting. 6 weeks previously she had fallen from a height of 15 m. The initial CT scan showed no pathologic findings. Due to deterioration of her clinical state a repeated head CT-scan and an angio-CT revealed a basilar artery aneurysm. Therefore a ventriculo-peritoneal-shunt was implanted. 6 weeks later a right frontotemporal craniotomy followed by clipping of the aneurysm had to be performed. The post-operative period was uneventful. There were no additional problems in the further course. Sixteen years later we still do not know the way how that aneurysm arouse. Furthermore all of the 16 family members of our patient had detailed examinations with different methods to find asymptomatic aneurysms. Only our patient's mother showed a right internal carotid artery aneurysm. <EOD> 2-Chloro-N-(4-dimethylamino-3-phenylphenyl)acetamide

[/INST] <EOD> A randomized clinical trial comparing 6-month versus 12-month endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2 negative, early breast cancer patients

Purpose To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 6 months versus 12 months adjuvant endocrine therapy, using letrozole monotherapy after standard 5-year adjuvant endocrine therapy in breast cancer patients. Methods This randomized, open-label, multi-center, phase IV study included hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative, adjuvant endocrine therapy completed breast cancer patients with a follow-up duration of ≥3 years. The patients were randomized (1:1) with letrozole (2.5 mg/d) for 6 months or 12 months after standard adjuvant endocrine therapy (2-3 years), and were classified into the following four groups by timing of intervention and treatment duration: 6 months of letrozole followed by 12 months of letrozole (Letrozole 6M + Letrozole 12M), 6 months of letrozole followed by 12 months of observation (Letrozole 6M + OBS), 12 months of letrozole followed by 6 months of letrozole (Letrozole 12M + Letrozole 6M), and 12 months of letrozole followed by 12 months of observation (Letrozole 12M + OBS). The primary end point was the proportion of patients disease-free without intervention after 12 months of discontinuation (Letrozole 12M + OBS: disease-free survival without recurrence [DFSWR] at 12 months after discontinuation), and secondary endpoints were DFSWR at the end of 18 months, and the change in Ki67 after the end of a study. Results All enrolled patients were analyzed for the modified intention-to-treat (mITT; Letrozole 6M + OBS: n = 94, Letrozole 12M + Letrozole 6M: n = 94, Letrozole 12M + OBS: n = 94) and per-protocol populations (Letrozole 6M + OBS: n = 87, Letrozole 12M + Letrozole 6M: n = 89, Letrozole 12M + OBS: n = 91) and showed mITT of 61.0% and per-protocol population of 47.1%. The DFSWR at 12 months was 62.8% in the Letrozole 6M + OBS group which was not non-inferior to that of the Letrozole 12M + OBS group (75.0%, odds ratio = 0.570, 95% confidence interval: 0.340-0.953). The DFSWR at 18 months showed 86.2% in the Letrozole 6M + OBS group and no recurrence was observed for the majority of patients in the Letrozole 12M + OBS group. No differences were found in the change of Ki67 between groups. Conclusion Both the Letrozole 6M + OBS and Letrozole 12M + OBS groups showed low incidence of recurrence over 3 years after discontinuation or observation. Thus, 18-months of endocrine therapy is recommended as a standard. Trial registration This trial was registered with Clinicaltrails.gov (JapicCTI-122078).

Input Text: A Rapid Diagnostic of Risk in Hospitalized Patients Using Machine Learning

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
The objective of this proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for intensive care (ICU) transfer and death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in ventilator utilization, length of stay, and mortality for high-risk hospitalized adults. Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculated by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.

  * Title: African-American Social Support Effectiveness Treatment-Partners alleviating Perinatal Depression
 <EOD> Assortative mating patterns in the general population of the north-west of England.
A questionnaire regarding the heights and body weights of parents and offspring was sent to a sample of 2500 married individuals randomly drawn from the electoral register of south Merseyside, aged 21 to 40. Replies were received from 1301 married partners. The mean parent-offspring difference in height was 9.9 cm for males and 6.6 cm for females, and in weight 13.0 lb for males and 9.1 lb for females. The correlation between height and weight was -0.64 in males and -0.46 in females. There was a significant excess of correlations between height and weight which fell significantly short of unity. There is thus good evidence for assortative mating. A large selection was then made at random from a further 1000 married male participants of similar age who had enrolled for examination in the medical and occupational fields of an English university. There were 303 participants in this subgroup. The assortative mating pattern which emerged was not significantly different from that already found. <EOD> Influence of different in vivo binder systems on the hardness and Young's modulus of experimental resin-based luting cements.
The aim of this in vivo experimental study was to evaluate the effects of the in vivo formation of pellicle and saliva on the hardness and Young's modulus of an experimental resin-based cement. Eight volunteers wore four palatal appliances with standardized flat resin-based cement specimens, which were exposed to oral conditions for 20 minutes, 6 weeks or 24 weeks. Evaluations were made of two time periods. Period I was between the 20th and 6th minute, and period II was between the 36th and 35th minute of exposure. In period I, specimen hardness reached 97% of the final value. During period II, the specimens exhibited significant decreases (P=0.048; P=0.005). However, in the resin-based cement specimens with pellicle, there were no significant differences between the initial and final hardness results (P=0.062) or between period I and period II (P=0.098). The only significant difference was noted in the specimens with saliva exposure (P=0.036). Overall, the specimens reached 106% of the final value of hardness. In period I, the specimens exhibited elasticity modulus values of 11.82-14.11 GPa, and during period II, the elasticity modulus values decreased to 7.92-13.55 GPa (P=0.592). The specimens with pellicle showed significant differences between period I and period II (P=0.019). The specimens exhibited 127-164% of the final elasticity modulus values (P=0.003). Pellicle formation appeared to protect the experimental resin-based cement from surface abrasion by masticatory loads and led to significant increases in Young's modulus values. The changes associated with saliva exposure were not as clear-cut; in other words, the presence of saliva did not prevent the formation of a protective film. The specimens formed with pellicle reached 127-163% of the final value of Young's modulus, and it appears that this protection lasted for at least 36 minutes. <EOD> Evaluating the efficacy of novel antimicrobials by using an in vitro assay to detect bacterial metabolic activity.
The search for novel antibiotics has to some extent been hindered by the standard methodologies for measuring antimicrobial efficacy, which assume that bacterial presence or absence is an indicator of inhibition of growth by various test substances.

OBJECTIVE
To identify the impact of motor dysfunction, sensory dysfunction and coma duration on the functional outcome in survivors with severe TBI.


DESIGN
Retrospective chart audit.


SETTING
Neurosurgery department of a neurotrauma hospital, in China from 2010 to December 2012.


SUBJECTS
Adult patients with severe TBI who stayed in the hospital for at least 28 days.


INTERVENTIONS
All patients received standard conventional medical care according to the international standards. At the time of discharge, the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) was utilized to measure the functional outcome, defined by the score of GOSE. The relationships among motor dysfunction, sensory dysfunction, time of recovery and outcome in patients with TBI were also analysed.


RESULTS
Ninety-four patients with severe TBI were enrolled. Sixty-eight patients (72.3%) did not achieve moderate or good outcomes (GOSE < 6) at discharge. All patients who achieved good outcomes (n = 24) had the ability of motor dysfunction recovery. For patients with poor outcomes, motor dysfunction was the most influential factor on the score of GOSE (β = 0.810, p < 0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
For patients with severe TBI, motor dysfunction was the leading risk factor in the prognosis of functional outcome, and the functional outcome in patients who achieved motor dysfunction recovery had no significant differences between patients with different functional abilities of walking, speech and vision. <EOD> Ectopic Adenocarcinoma of the Lacrimal Drainage System: A Report of 5 Cases and Review of the Literature

Background:The recent pandemic of COVID-19 and the imposed lockdown represent great social distress factors for the Italian population that can lead to an increase in rates of emergency calls for emergencies in general, and to psychiatric emergencies in particular. Method: This multicenter retrospective study aims to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the use of the emergency services (ES) for psychiatric assistance in Italy. All calls to three ES were analyzed between January 1, 2019, and the COVID-19 lockdown (March 11, 2020) stratified for three different periods (first half of 2019 -January 1 to February 29, first half of 2020 -January 1 to February 29; and lockdown -February 27 to March 11). Data from the 2019 cohort were compared with those of the same period in 2020 for the same ESs. Results: The mean daily number of calls during the lockdown period was significantly higher in 2020 (n = 10,5 [SD = 5]; N) than in the first half of 2020 (n = 5;0 [SD = 2;8]; Z = -2, 926,060; p <0.05) and significantly higher than those for the same period in 2019 (n = 5,7 [SD = 0;9]; Z = -2,578,991; P <0.05). Conclusion: Emergency calls to psychiatric services in the general population appeared to be significantly higher during the national restrictions in Italy, particularly for women and young adults. Mental health professionals need to keep this in mind, so as to be prepared for increased demand. (www.actabiomedica.it)

# Introduction
The recent pandemic of COVID-19 and the imposed lockdown represent great social distress factors for the general Italian population that can cause disruptions in patients' lives. The lockdown has represented a new reality for all of us, leading to significant changes in work and social habits, and has led to difficulties in access to the hospital emergency service (ES) of primary health care, but has led to a significant increase in emergency calls.
The lockdown measures that Italy has undergone to mitigate the spread of the virus have resulted in the closure of several social activities and have also had a significant impact on the mental health of the Italian population: a strong sense of insecurity, fear (2, 3), anxiety, restlessness, insomnia have been reported, especially by individuals residing in affected areas. Accordingly, our study revealed a significant increase in emergency calls to three ES in northern Italy compared with the same period in 2019.
Italy, especially its northern regions, has been one of the areas most affected by COVID-19 thus far (2); Lombardy, in particular, has been one of the most populous regions of Italy and, during the pandemic period, was more severely impacted than other Italian regions.
As of April 9, 2020, 3858 cases of coronavirus disease were confirmed in Lombardy, with"

Rationale and Background

| Rationale for Study | Rationale for Design | Background
| --- | --- | --- |
| Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a collection of physical, cognitive, emotional symptoms that women experience during a 5- to 10-day window before or during their menstrual cycle. These symptoms are generally most severe in the week prior to menstruation. Symptoms can include headaches, joint and muscle aches, feeling overwhelmed, insomnia, irritability, and anxiety. Some women experience gastrointestinal issues including nausea, bloating, and stomach aches while having PMS. For many women, the symptoms of PMS are disruptive to social and work areas of their lives, and to their physical and mental health. In many cases, these symptoms are disabling. While more common in premenopausal women, many symptoms are present throughout the menstrual cycle for some women. However, women often find it difficult to discuss their symptoms and concerns with their friends or doctors. For some, this discomfort is related to stigma regarding discussions of menstruation and female anatomy. This study is an exploration of treatment options for women with mild to moderate symptoms of PMS.| PMS is an extremely common condition among reproductive aged women. A 2006 survey found that PMS is reported by 83% of women surveyed, among whom 7.6% of respondents reported that PMS is very severe.  One study reports that more than half of women (51%) report more than 12 symptoms of PMS, including headache (79.5%), mood swings (54.8%), bloating (53.8%), irritable bowel syndrome (42.7%), sleep problems (40.5%), decreased libido (39.1%), weight increase (38.2%), weight decrease (37.5%), tender breasts (35.0%), decreased energy (34.3%), migraine headaches (34.2%), anxiety (34%), and food cravings (29.2%). Other studies report that as many as 75% of women endure PMS symptoms.  Approximately 20 - 30% of women experience PMS so severe that it interferes with their ability to function in school, work, or in relationships.  One study found that more than 50% of participants experienced PMS each month, and 70% said that PMS affected their social lives at work or school.
This has a significant impact on their social and work lives as well as their ability to function. Many women with PMS experience a range of effects, which include physical, emotional, and behavioral. Many report experiencing mood swings, anxiety, anger, fatigue, appetite changes, breast tenderness or swelling, and headaches. This study's goal is to offer women with mild to moderate PMS a convenient and effective way to keep these symptoms under control.| An estimated 35 million women in the United States report symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) each month. A study evaluating PMS risk found that women of all ages with regular cycles have increased risk of PMS. The risk increases with age, with younger women more affected, and peaks in the mid 20s to early 30s. The greatest risk occurs in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, with the average length of the time with PMS being 12.9 days. One study found a mean value of PMS-related pain on a scale of 1-5 where 0=no pain and 5=extreme pain. The average pain was reported as 3.5, with 56% of participants reporting a pain level of 3 or 4. Symptoms typically begin 5 to 10 days before a woman's menses, continue throughout the menstrual cycle, and end 1 to 2 days after menstruation.| PMS has many symptoms that can include physical, cognitive, and emotional ones. Each woman's symptoms vary, and the same woman will probably have varying symptoms in each cycle. The exact causes of PMS are not fully understood.

We reiterate in a new context a previously reported fluorescence model for the interpretation of the transient fluorescence quenching events in DNA samples, both unphotolyzed and subjected to UV light flash irradiation in low ionic strength buffer. The initial data we presented referred to results obtained from studies of the complex fluorescence quenching phenomena in bacteriophage T4 DNA. Our primary interest was in the effects of hydroxyl radical attack on the phage genome. The major conclusion of those studies was that, under conditions of complete hydroxyl radical inactivation, the fluorescence pattern depended on whether the DNA was left unmodified or was subjected to prolonged hydroxyl radical action. If the DNA solution was unmodified, quenching was nearly confined to a single kinetic class (t1/2 -0:5 s). This component of quenching was attributed to collisions of water and DNA, or of hydrated ions, with the excited base pairs of the phage DNA. If the DNA solution had been previously exposed to hydroxyl radicals, with resultant formation of both strand-breaks and damaged base pairs, the fluorescence decay was composed of four kinetic classes (t1/2 -10, 200, 2,500 and 7,000 s). It was concluded that three of these four kinetic components could be assigned to the collisional events of water and unmodified base pairs, as they had manifested before hydroxyl radical interaction. The fourth kinetic component was assigned to hydroxyl radical induced damage in the phage DNA, such as was suggested by an increasing trend of the relative sensitivity of the dA, dT and dG sites in T4 DNA, as compared to the relative levels of the dA+dT and dG sites in native DNA or in DNA at various times after hydroxyl radical irradiation. On addition of 10mM magnesium ions to the T4 DNA solutions previously subjected to hydroxyl radicals, there was an apparent disappearance of the long lifetime component. This appeared to be related to the apparent ability of magnesium to protect the base pairs previously damaged by hydroxyl radicals. <EOD> Higher mortality amongst COVID-19 recovered patients than uninfected population in India: A retrospective cohort analysis

a b s t r a c tThe first COVID-19 case in India was detected in the last week of January 2020 and since then, India has reported over 4.1 million registered deaths from around 40.8 million confirmed active cases. The present study is based on hospitalization of 160,798 cases who had recovered from 22 months (November 20, 2020 to May 24, 2022) in the selected hospitals of Delhi. Mortality risk in recovered patients were analyzed by gender, age, body mass index (BMI), co-morbidities, clinical management during COVID-19 and recovered patients after discharge period. The cohort included 60,473 male and 97,741 patients with no-COVID-19 related deaths (NoDRD). The observed mortality risk was reported as the ratio of number died between the recovered patients (6477) and the total reported cases. In addition, the expected mortality was estimated based upon the age and co-morbidity specific mortality risk. The mortality rate was recorded 8.1% higher in males as compared to females ( p"

Objective: The aim of this study was to analyze prospectively the relationship between the duration of apnea and bradycardia after pediatric cardiac arrest and postarrest outcomes. Methods: Neurologic outcome was studied prospectively in children (n = 32) older than 1 month after cardiac arrest, by using the cerebral performance category scale. The duration of total arrest (apnea and bradycardia) after cardiac arrest was determined by using transthoracic recordings in the pediatric intensive care unit, and then divided into 3 subcategories (<60, 60–180, and 181–360 seconds). The duration of arrest was compared with various clinical findings/resuscitative features between survivors (n = 23) and nonsurvivors (n = 9), and with the final neurologic outcomes. Results: The duration of total arrest in survivors and nonsurvivors was 16.5 ± 31.5 and 159.4 ± 52.3 seconds, respectively, with a significant difference (P < 0.05).

Input Text: Depth of Botulinum Neurotoxin Injection for Treatment of Glabellar Lines STUDY AIM, BACKGROUND, AND DESIGN ABSTRACT Botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) is a safe and effective treatment for numerous conditions in neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, gastroenterology, psychiatry, and urology. In dermatology, BoNT is commonly used for treatment of facial rhytides and is by far the most frequently performed cosmetic procedure in recent years. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of BoNT for the treatment of glabellar lines. Although, BoNT has shown excellent safety profile for the treatment of glabellar lines, injection methods vary widely between practitioners and no standardized method for the depth of injection has been established. The most common treatment area is the glabellar complex, which consists of bilateral corrugator supercilii, depressor supercilii, procerus, and the orbital portion of the orbicularis oculi. With increasing age and repetitive contraction of the glabellar complex, particularly the bilateral corrugator supercilii and procerus, the formation of prominent dynamic glabellar lines and static, etched-in glabellar lines can form and lead to the appearance a more severe frown. In a study using ultrasonographic imaging and the three-dimensional scanning Cho et al. determined that the procerus muscle rested at a depth of 5.7 ± 1.4 mm medially and 6.6 ± 1.4mm laterally and recommended Botox injections at the depth of 5 ~7mm in the corrugator supercili muscle. The investigators previously studied the ability of botulinum toxin to diffuse in crow's feet through laser pores into the target muscle. (8) In our randomized study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin injected at the depth of 2mmvsvs2 mm for the improvement of glabellar lines.

Depth of Botulinum Neurotoxin Injection for Treatment of Glabellar Lines

STUDY AIM
Compare the efficacy of onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin injected at the depth of 2mm vs 4mm for the improvement of glabellar lines

SECONDARY AIM Assess the incidence of any adverse effects of onabotulinumtoxinA neurotoxin injected at the depth of 2mm vs 4mm SECTION A: INCLUSION CRITERIA AND STUDY TREATMENT

Treatment Protocol

Procedure will be performed by clinical investigators trained and certified by the Centre Hospitalier Valida. Anatomic location of the treatment area.

1. Glabellar Complex: The glabellar area was identified as a triangular area located vertically between the line created by the most superficial part of the eyebrow and the midpupillary line. The glabellar complex is defined as the 3 muscles of the corrugator supercili, procerus, and the anterior portion of the orbicularis oculi.
2. Subperiosteal/dermal incision: Once the glabellar complex was identified, the subperiosteal plane or the dermalepidermalis junction was identified. After careful hemostasis was achieved using the microcautery with an insulated tip, a 5mm stainless steel cannula attached to a 1-cc syringe was inserted 1 ~ 3 mm into the glabellar complex.
3. OnabotuliunumtoxinA injections.: Once the glabellar complex was infiltrated with onabotuliunumtoxinA, the needle was removed from the cannula, and the same injection protocol was repeated.
4. Skin closure was achieved with steristrips or Steri stri"

The objective is to make patients feel listened to, help them express and accept their emotions and thus improve psychological and emotional comfort. The patient will benefit from the musical and psychological care of a music therapist during the first 3 cycles of her chemotherapy treatment. The first visit will take place 2 weeks before the start of the protocol (cycle number 0 or Cv0). Two follow-ups will then be organised for each session. The first will take place just after the end of the sessions (Cv1), and the last will take place approximately 1 month after the end of treatment (Cv2). The patient will provide information on anxiety (state trait anxiety inventory score) during the three meetings in order to study the evolution of anxiety during the protocol.

There was tenderness over the medial side of the bilateral knee joint. Passive movement also painful. There was no history of fever, malaise or any constitutional symptoms. A provisional diagnosis of septic Arthritis was made. Urgent radiograph of the right hip and both knee joints revealed a normal X-ray. There was no osseous destruction. MRI of the right hip joint and both knee joints revealed effusion along with loose bodies with osteophyte formation. The joint space was well maintained in all the joints (Figs. 1,2,3 and 4). Laboratory investigations revealed inflammatory markers were raised. Serological work-up including blood for Mycobacteria, brucella, scrub typhus and a chest X-ray were normal. On an average, the blood sugar was within the normal range. There was no evidence of haemochromatosis. Patient responded very well to medical therapy and he was followed-up after 12 months. <EOD> A 33-Year-Old Male with COVID-19, Rhabdomyolysis, and a Herniated Lumbar Disc: A Case Report

 <EOD> Isolation of monoclonal antibodies specific for the major lipopolysaccharide antigens of Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus
Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were produced against Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus cells grown in vitro. Twenty-nine MAbs specific for C. fetus lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were characterized. Eighteen MAbs reacted with all the bimodal lipopolysaccharide (LPS) preparations tested. Ten of these MAbs bound in a solid-phase assay to purified LPS from four of the five serotypes tested. Six MAbs reacted in immunoblotting and solid-phase assays as a single band on an enzyme-revealed (silver stained) gel on which purified LPS was loaded. These MAbs did not, however, distinguish between LPS of serotypes 1 and 4 or between LPS of serotypes 1 and 2 in solid-phase assays. Competitive inhibition experiments suggested that two of the MAbs recognized immunologically similar epitopes. One of these MAbs reacted with whole cells of the serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 6a, and 7 but not with whole cells of serotype 2, which suggests that it recognized the lipid A portion of the LPS molecule. The other MAb reacted with serotypes 1, 5, and 7 but not with other serotypes of C. fetus LPS in immunoblotting and solid-phase assays. This MAb also reacted with the LPS of Campylobacter coli and Campylobacter jejuni, C. hyointestinalis, and Bacteroides species but did not react with Campylobacter gracilis LPS. The results suggest that lipid A regions of LPS are immunodominant in immunocompetent patients with Campylobacter infection of intrauterine death in pregnancy. <EOD> Impedance spectroscopy: a potential screening tool for the diagnosis of oral fungal infection

A laser-induced mechanism to fabricate micro-supercapacitors (MSCs) based on aqueous inks has been proposed. This concept relies on a three-step process in which micro-structures of a dielectric layer (i.e. SiO2) are fabricated on the surface of a metal foil (e.g. Cu) by selective laser melting and then these micropatterns are transferred on a substrate (e.g. Ni) by laser-induced microtransfer printing. As the Cu foil is a good electrical conductor, it can be utilized as a current collector. After coating these micropatterns with polyvinyl alcohol/polyaniline (PVA/PANI) composites as an electrode, the Cu substrate with ink has been directly placed under a focused laser beam for the subsequent sintering, thus yielding the formation of PANI microparticles in situ. The results of field emission scanning electron microscopy investigation reveal a uniform microstructure of PANI electrode in the MSCs. Besides, the electrochemical performance of the MSCs is investigated via cyclic voltammetry and galvanostatic charge–discharge measurements as well as energy density calculations and a comparative analysis by employing a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitor model. Finally, the proposed method provides a robust, low-temperature-processed, and cost-effective manufacturing route for MSC fabrication with enhanced characteristics in terms of cost and time. <EOD> Grafting the PTCH1 promoter region with an estrogen-responsive element (ERE) for expression of pTenascin-C in mouse endothelium

Tenascin-C (TN-C) is a matrix glycoprotein that is upregulated in the neovasculature associated with fibrosis and cancer, and participating in neovessel stabilization and angiogenic factor resistance. A knock-in mouse model and human studies show that expression of pTN-C is restricted to endothelial cells (ECs) of tissues affected by fibrosis or malignancy, and the promoter region of its gene (TNC) contains an estrogen-responsive element (ERE). We designed a transgene that places an ERE in the promoter region of Tnc controlled by the human PTCH1 gene. Transgenic mice develop a neo-endothelium with expression of pTN-C in tissues associated with fibrotic processes, such as kidney fibrosis and in tumor vessels treated with aromatase enzyme inhibitors. The ERE in the Tnc promoter has no intrinsic estrogendependent activity, but its activity depends on the TNC promoter region.

We investigated the use of erythrosin B stained cells for determination of nucleic acids and nucleoproteins in small amounts of tissue. We have found that erythrosin B stained smear preparations of intestinal crypt samples provide results comparable in precision and accuracy to values published for methods based upon cryostat section technique. Since the erythrosin B method does not require additional preparation of frozen sections, it is an alternative to cryostat section cytoscintillation and other fluorescent methods. <EOD> Efficacy of an interpersonal psychotherapy–based parenting intervention on quality of parenting, child psychopathology, and intergenerational transmission
This report from the Child/Adolescent Trials Network (CATN) for Depression and Suicide Prevention 3‐site project of the Department of Veterans Affairs/National Institutes of Health‐sponsored parenting intervention program examines the efficacy of this intervention on parenting practices, child psychopathology, and intergenerational transmission using three‐level hierarchical modeling. <EOD> Differences Between the β/γ-Herpesvirus-Encoding Cellulose Biosensors Based on the Rv3741 Repressor and on a Variant of the Rv3742 Activator

Background: The Rv3741 repressor and the Rv3742 activator provide a powerful tool for the development and control of cellulose biosensors based on the expression of the lignocellulose-degrading enzymes from the lignocellulolytic bacterium Ruminiclostridium thermocellum. Methods and Materials: Three mutated variants of the β/γ-herpesvirus (HSV1 or HCMV)-encoding cellulose bioassays were created; mutations were introduced in the promoter regions of the two genes encoding the lignocellulose-degrading and amylose-degrading enzymes, the cellobiohydrolase CelA and the α-amylase AmyA, respectively.Results and Conclusion: It was demonstrated that the Rv3741 repressor was functional in HCMV-based cells, and that it could efficiently promote bacterial cellulose production in recombinant HSV1 cells. The cellulase and the amylase activities were 16.78 ± 1.13 IU/mL/OD600 and 45.58 ± 0.14 IU/mL/OD600 for HSV1-based bioassays, and 96.33 ± 2.14 IU/ mL/OD600 and 47.85 ± 1.94 IU/mL/OD600 for HCMV-based bioassays. The bioassays were used as models to study the kinetics of cellulose biosynthesis in recombinant HSV1 and HCMV cells, the induction of cellulose production by cellobiose in HSV1-based and HCMV-based bioassays to monitor the kinetics of hydrolysis of cellulose and amylose, respectively. The results presented in this work demonstrated that the engineered HSV1 and HCMV replicative virus-based cells can be exploited for applications covering a wide range of research areas, from plant cell walldegrading enzymes production to environmental analysis. Therefore, with this proof-ofconcept study, we contribute to the search for novel biorefineries that can use cellulose bioassays to provide energy and chemicals from lignocellulosic residues.

[Rubrics/Bibliotherapy]: <EOD> Synchronous adenomatous pituitary tumour and adrenal incidentaloma
Pituitary adenomas account for a significant proportion of pituitary masses diagnosed through endonasal endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery. Incidentalomas are being diagnosed at a greater rate through imaging studies being conducted for other reasons. An interesting case of a patient with synchronous pituitary adenoma and adrenal cortical adenoma is presented. Clinical and pathological evidence exists in favour of adrenal cortical carcinoma. The patient underwent left-sided adrenalectomy and a histological diagnosis of adenoma as well pituitary adenoma was made. The literature is briefly reviewed and an argument for better utilisation of endocrinology consultations for cases with such unusual presentations of the disease is made. <EOD> In situ hybridization of LINE‐1 and Alu sequences to lizards: A comparison between tissue culture and paraffin sections
In situ hybridization was used to compare relative levels of transcription of Alu and LINE‐1 sequences in tissue culture sections to that in paraffin sections of fixed tissue. To establish the specificity of the probes against all vertebrate tissue, we attempted to visualize Alu or LINE‐1 sequences within the nuclei of vertebrate cells by whole‐mount in situ hybridization. Both probes hybridized to chromosomes and to nuclei of multiple mammalian and amphibian cell lines and cultured fish embryos, but did not stain cell nuclei within sections of intact amphibians, lizards, or birds. To compare the relative transcriptional activity of repetitive elements, we used in situ hybridization of paraffin sections to reveal transcription within cell nuclei. Sections from three squamate reptiles exhibited transcript patterns in the liver, kidney, and intestine that were qualitatively similar for both probe sets. The Alu probe hybridized to cell nuclei in kidney, while the LINE‐1 probe hybridized to nuclei within hepatic parenchyma and portal tracts. These results indicate, at least for squamates, that the LINE‐1 repeat is expressed at higher levels than Alu during these stages of tissue growth, but expression patterns of the LINE‐1 repeat may be more variable between tissues. <EOD> .
To evaluate the path of the parotid duct of the cadavers, 45 specimens were dissected. And the results were as follows. (i) The parotid duct passes down through the posterior surface of the cheek.

(iii) The parotid duct penetrates the skin on the same side of the midline of the gonion and emerges below the menton. <EOD> Efficient and stable gene transfer by novel chitosan-based hybrid gene transfer vectors in cultured mammalian cells.
We designed and characterized the properties of several hybrid vectors based on the natural polymer chitosan (CS) and the synthetic polycation polyethylene imine (PEI) as gene carriers for the development of improved nonviral gene delivery systems. CS, with its good biocompatibility and biodegradability, represents a class of naturally occurring gene delivery systems of great potential. For the development of hybrid vectors a series of cationic CS derivatives, modified by N-trimethylglycine (CSD) and 4-carboxylate (CACD), and CS-PEI were synthesized. CS-PEI contained a PEI moiety grafted at the primary amino groups of CS to obtain a covalent bond. All polymers were characterized as amphiphilic polymers consisting of positively charged polycationic moieties and hydrophobic alkyl chains. The polymers were self-aggregated in water and had positive surface charges at pH 7.4. Polyplex nanoparticles were formed efficiently by electrostatic interaction upon mixing with plasmid DNA (pDNA). Hybrid vectors CS-PEI contained the lowest amount of PEI in comparison with the cationic CSD and CACD, but possessed the highest capacity to form compact nanoparticles, which resulted in the highest transfection efficiency in comparison with the other two cationic polymers.

This review focuses on the discovery of secreted morphogens, BMP (the bone morphogenic proteins) and Piq (which is related to the growth differentiation factor 11 (GDF11)), and their role as a dual morphogen-morphogen inhibitor axis that provides the PIQ/BMP threshold gradient that results in the correct patterning of a specific skeletal organ complex at a particular site. PIQ is a recently discovered member of the GDF11/22 subfamily in the TGFbeta superfamily, a group of TGFbeta superfamily members that are essential for the development of multiple organs and tissues. This review focuses on the discovery of BMP and GDF11 and Piq/GDF11 in the cartilaginous organs of the vertebrate skull, which is located anterior to the hindbrain in early development. Although members of this TGFbeta superfamily have been shown to function in a variety of other tissues and regions of the body including the neural tube and limb, vertebrate craniofacial development is the best understood example of how signals from the BMP family cooperate with the TGFbeta family member, PIQ, to generate a gradient of concentration of PIQ at the front edge of the forming jaw and cartilaginous midline organ"

 <EOD> A Difficulty of Diagnosis in Two Cases and the Importance of Tuberculin Testing
B. H., a young man aged I9, first came under my care on June 22, i934, being then under Mr. Benn's care for a right acetabular fracture. He had fallen down a cellar stair and had fallen on his buttocks. On examination I found an extensive fracture involving the acetabulum and the iliac bone. I was convinced that the fracture was a compound one, comminuted in portions. After a certain amount of difficulty I obtained admission to the London Hospital, an operation was performed there by Mr. Benn a week later, and the acetabular fragment was scraped up and sent to the laboratory for examination. Meanwhile I have been engaged in trying to make a diagnosis as to the nature of the fracture, and I feel convinced that I can make it. I want you to agree to admit the patient under my care, as I think there is some danger of his dying under our care. The man was put to bed and was in bed for a fortnight, and he was only put on the bed of his fractured limb a fortnight last week. <EOD> .
To compare the efficacy of the standard triple chemotherapy regime for unexplained infertility with the use of this regimen according to the ovarian reserve, intrauterine insemination (IUI) and laparoscopic assessment were performed in 169 women. A group of 65 women in reproductive age without evidence of fertility disorder and a group of 47 women with severe idiopathic infertility were studied. The age of women, FSH, estriol and estradiol levels were the exclusion criteria for choosing the treatment regime. The choice of treatment regimen was performed according to the results of the study of ovarian reserve and laparoscopic examination. If the women had normal laparoscopic findings and evidence of good functional status of the ovaries with normal levels of FSH and estriol and normal ovarian cortex in the laparoscopic biopsy of ovarian cortex and the pregnancy rate was achieved in IUI, then they were transferred to the course of laparoscopic ovarian drilling. The laparoscopic approach to the treatment is not only effective but also minimally invasive, especially compared with the traditional approach. The laparoscopic approach to the treatment of infertility based on early ovarian biopsy and preestablished criteria of female infertility allows to optimize the choice of treatment regime, using it only in need and preventing the overuse of medical resources. <EOD> Mapping the spatial distribution of surface charges, polarization, and electronic excitation in organic semiconducting crystals.
The role of the electronic structure of organic semiconducting (OSC) materials with respect to molecular packing in various crystal phases still remains a fundamental issue. However, the mapping of the electronic structure with a molecular precision into the OSC bulk or thin-film system without destroying the crystal structure has been a substantial challenge. Through applying Kelvin probe force microscopy and density functional theory-based simulations, we uncover the local electron-electron interactions among the molecular units of OSC crystals and demonstrate their direct correlation to molecular packing and polarization. Our approach provides insights into the evolution of molecular interaction energy landscapes with crystal phases and electronic excitation that govern the bulk physics of OSC materials. <EOD> Role of TGFβ in inflammation and the regeneration of the intestinal tract: review of recent findings
Abstract Transforming growth factor (TGF) β is a multifunctional growth factor that exerts important effects on tissue regeneration and immunity. The intestinal tract is especially sensitive to disruption of the balance of TGFβ, which impairs normal homeostatic functions, including intestinal barrier integrity, epithelium migration and mucous secretion and can also lead to proliferation of inflammatory cells, thereby impairing the functions of other intestinal cells that rely on intercellular cross-talk. Although numerous studies have focused on the important effects of TGFβ on intestinal development and functions, understanding the role of TGFβ in the restoration of normal intestinal function following injury is crucial for the development of successful medical strategies.

 <EOD> Chlamydia and Chlamydiales in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Conjunctiva
ABSTRACT Chlamydia pneumoniae has been recently implicated as a trigger of cardiovascular disease and potentially also of certain human cancers. We have previously demonstrated an occurrence of Chlamydiaceae in tumor tissue from patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the conjunctiva in contrast to benign conjunctival tumors devoid of these organisms. In this study we expanded the detection procedure for Chlamydiae to Chlamydia-like organisms (CLO) and Chlamydiae-like strains with enhanced DNA sequences (CDS). Using established nested PCR methods we tested 12 tissue samples from conjunctival squamous cell carcinomas and 12 samples from conjunctival nevus/epithelial hyperplasia and 8 normal conjunctival tissue samples for the presence of Chlamydiaceae, CLO, and CDS. Chlamydia-based pathogens were not found in any of the tumors, but CDS was found in 4 of the 12 (33%) tumor samples. CLO were found in 1 of the 12 (9%) tumor samples. These findings could suggest an important role for Chlamydiae and CDS in conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma and their possible diagnostic utility for the detection of this cancer by DNA-based methods. <EOD> A prospective, randomized controlled pilot study of the efficacy and safety of a polyclonal anti-C5a antibody in the treatment of primary herpes simplex type 2 infection.
BACKGROUND
Herpes simplex viruses type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2) cause 50-75% genital herpes, but the efficacy of antivirals in genital HSV infection is limited. Complement C3a and C5a generate proinflammatory cytokine storms involved in the pathogenesis of infection. We prospectively assessed the efficacy of an anti-C5a neutralizing antibody for the treatment of genital HSV-2 infection in a randomized volunteer-controlled pilot study.


METHODS
Volunteers with a positive HSV-2 antigen test were assigned randomly to receive either a single subcutaneous shot of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg of a monoclonal anti-C5a antibody or saline weekly for 4 weeks. Outcomes were monitored through day 56 with assessments including viral shedding and symptom severity score (Zong et al., Clin Infect Dis, 2010;51:834-841).


RESULTS
Twenty-three subjects received 23 weekly visits, and 21 completed the 4-week study. The median cumulative dose was 16 mg (4 patients received 32 mg), and the median viral shedding duration was 38.5 hours. No HSV-2 viremia was detected in all patients in the first week. However, recurrence of the virus was detected by PCR in 2 patients and both received anti-C5a antibody (10 mg and 20 mg, respectively) at 1 week post-treatment. There were no dose-dependent side effects. No HSV-2 infection occurred in subjects and their sexual partners, although HSV-1 infection was detected in 1 female patient.


CONCLUSIONS
A single injection of anti-C5a antibody treatment does not improve the first episode of primary genital HSV-2, whereas continuous HSV-1 infections are common. <EOD> Coronary Artery Disease: An Update on Risk Factors and New Drug Therapies.

 <EOD> Drug metabolism and the toxic manifestation of drugs
A number of therapeutically beneficial agents in clinical use have adverse effects, both acute and chronic. These adverse effects do not always appear with the initial phase but can occur during the long‐term administration of a drug on doses which are adequate to bring about an effective therapeutic response. The major mechanisms of therapeutically beneficial drugs are the same as those of adverse effects, i.e. acting on a nucleophilic site of a macromolecule, nucleic acid, protein or lipid, and inducing changes in function, structure, or rate of biosynthesis and catabolism. The toxicology, therefore, has similarities to pharmacology in terms of the sites of action of a ‘toxic’ substance in the body, but the mechanisms of toxicity and the type of metabolism involved may be different from those of therapeutic drugs. <EOD> Fetal palsy by drug ingestion.

This study aimed to explore the mechanism of l‐DOG toxicity in rat lens through inhibition of AQP0 gating activity. The lens was extracted from rat. After adding l‐DOG on the surface of rat lens, SEM (electron microscopy) was used to observe morphological changes of rat lens in different concentrations of l‐DOG. Then, AQP0, α‐SMA, collagen IV in rat lens were tested with western‐blot. The rat lenses with different concentrations of l‐DOG were placed in incubator for different durations. FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) and propidium iodide (PI) were added to assess cell viability with two‐photon laser confocal scanning microscopy and flow cytometry. AQP0 was cloned into HEK‐293 cells with lentiviral vectors. l‐DOG was added into AQP0 HEK‐293 cells. I‐V curves were measured to explore the changes of single channel gating function. Our results found that in a certain l‐DOG concentration range, the number of cells exhibiting cell death increased with increasing incubation time and cell viability decreased. Compared with the control group, 100 μM l‐DOG decreased the viability of rat lens after incubation for 2 h ( *P < 0.05), 4 h (*P < 0.05), 8 h ( *P < 0.05) and 12 h ( *P < 0.05). At 4 h and 8 h, the expression of AQP0 in rat lens decreased gradually with increasing of the concentration of l‐DOG. α‐SMA and COL‐IV (collagen IV) also increased gradually with the increasing concentration of l‐DOG at 4 h. Our results indicated that l‐DOG caused a decrease of AQP0 by inhibiting the expression of α‐SMA and COL‐IV in rat lens, which may be one of the reasons for lens cortex toxicity. <EOD> Risk Assessment of the Acetylene Ox"

Input Text: The Effect of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Virtual Reality Use in Inured Athletes

Study Overview
=================
Psychological problems after serious injuries have been studied intensively in recent years. Important psychological problems can be experienced after sports injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), these delay physical recovery, affect the quality of rehabilitation, and eventually cause problems or re-injuries in the process of returning to sports. The most important of these problems are re-injury anxiety, rehabilitation adherence, rehabilitation self-efficacy problems, and kinesiophobia. Although some interventions have been proposed for the solution of these problems, a structured intervention approach has not been put forward yet. With this research project, our aim is to examine the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol (CBT+VR) enriched with the contribution of virtual reality (VR), which the investigators prepared to intervene in psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. If the CBT+VR protocol is effective, it can be used to increase the quality of physical rehabilitation and therefore to ensure that the perceptions of athletes regarding their psychological outcomes about their return to sport are positive. CBT+VR protocol will be tested, and if it is found effective, it will make a significant contribution to both the literature and practice. The main peculiarity of this study is that a holistic protocol including virtual intervention will be developed for the solution of psychological problems encountered in the rehabilitation process of sports injuries for the first time. The research will be conducted with 60 athletes who meet the inclusion criteria. In the study, which is planned as a 4X5 (groupXmeasurement) mixed factorial design model with four groups (intervention1-intervention2-intervention3, control), the athletes will be filled with psychological assessment scales in order to collect the first data within the first week of starting physical therapy after ACL operation. The CBT+VR protocol will be applied to the first intervention group. Only the behavioral intervention part of the protocol in the VR environment will be applied to the second intervention group. The CBT protocol will be applied without the VR environment for the third intervention group. It is planned that for all intervention groups and the control group, there will be 10 sessions in total once a week, and each session lasts 50 minutes. There will be conversation in the control group sessions; in addition, images that give calmness from nature will be watched for 5 minutes with VR glasses. The remaining 45 minutes will continue with a conversation with encouragement and emotional support, which will not create a therapeutic effect. The scales will also be filled in three more times. The data obtained will be analyzed with multi-level statistics. Whether the anxiety levels of the athletes increase in the VR environment will be monitored with the biofeedback system, which will provide concrete data as well as subjective scales.

 <EOD> The Drosophila homolog of PIG-P, a core protein of the PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 biosynthetic complex, has a role in neuronal polarity
PIG-P is a conserved core component of the PtdIns(4)P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 biosynthetic complex. Whereas flies lacking PIG-P die during embryogenesis, mutations in Caenorhabditis elegans do not affect viability, indicating partial functional redundancy among orthologs. The Drosophila homologue is referred to as TBC-b-1. TBC-b-1 protein expression is widespread with highest levels in neurons, muscles and male germ-cells. In neuroepithelial-type (neuroblasts) cells within the germ-band-extended part of the neuroectoderm and in the brain lobes, TBC-b-1 localizes at cell-contacts, and to a lesser extent also in the central cytoplasm and the cell periphery. In the neuroectoderm, TBC-b-1 co-localizes with Dlg, an integral membrane protein required for the maintenance of asymmetric cell divisions and neuronal morphogenesis. In the brain, TBC-b-1 is expressed in neurons and in cells of the non-neuronal germ cell lineage and localizes to the nucleus, cell junctions and the neuronal central processes. A TBC-b-1 loss-of-function mutation, tbc-b-1X1, was generated by imprecise excision of an X1 mutant described earlier. TBC-b-1X1 flies are viable and fertile, and do not exhibit any obvious phenotypic defects. However, tbc-b-1X1 mutant neurons in the central brain lobes and in the ovarian germ-cell lineages exhibit defects in their polarized morphology"

In the Mediterranean fruit tree species Mediterranean and ornamental fruit trees, premature fruit ripening during winter leads to huge losses in fruit production and fruit quality. This study aimed to delay ‘Empire’ apricot fruit senescence and maintain postharvest quality when fruit was stored at 3 ℃; the effects of 1-methylcyproprene (1-MCP) ethylene (ETH), and ETH/1-MCP treatments on quality and shelf life were evaluated. The results demonstrated that 1-MCP is a highly efficient anti-senescence treatment that maintains fruit quality for a long time. Treatments of 1-MCP decreased respiration, pulp oxidation, weight, and firmness changes but resulted in higher peel cracking. 1-MCP (1 μl/l) at low temperature delayed chlorophyll degradation, pulp respiration, ethylene (ETH) production, and decay. However, ripening process was prolonged, while the contents of total soluble solids (TSS), titratable acidity (TA), and total sugar decreased.

[/INST] <EOD> Effects of dietary maltodextrin and fructooligosaccharide on intestinal fermentation and colonic microbiota in growing broilers
The current study was to evaluate the prebiotic effects of dietary fructooligosaccharide (FOS) and maltodextrin (MDX) in broilers using in vitro fermentation and a diet‐induced colitis model. The chemical properties of the oligosaccharides were evaluated by using high‐performance size‐exclusion chromatography (HPSEC). The in vitro fermentation showed that MDX did not show any fermentation activity in the small intestine of healthy‐broilers, whilst FOS was readily fermented by the small intestinal bacteria. In the intra‐colon experiment, both oligosaccharides (MDX and FOS) suppressed total numbers of bacteria and Lactobacillus while enriching the genera of the family S24‐7 and Bacteroides (p < 0.05), and Bacteroides and Staphylococcus were highly enriched from MDX and FOS groups, respectively. The colitis model (pH = 2.5) showed that treatment with FOS ameliorated the severity of intestinal inflammation by inducing the enrichment of Lactobacillus spp. and Clostridium coccoides whereas treatment with MDX showed a protective effect against colitis. In conclusion, MDX may be beneficial to broilers via its function as a prebiotic to selectively enrich Lactobacillus while FOS can be used as a potential therapeutic intervention to alleviate inflammation of the intestinal microbiota in growing broilers. &NA; Graphical Abstract Figure.

Abstract Background: The health-related quality of life (QoL) in patients with acromegaly is affected by multiple clinical variables, including age, disease duration, biochemical activity, and treatment. Therefore it is important to assess the most significant clinical variables, which contribute to QoL and select those which may be easily controlled or treated. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of clinical characteristics and disease activity as assessed by different biochemical methods on the QoL in acromegaly patients. Methods: We conducted a prospective study including 122 acromegaly patients using the Serbian Acromegaly Quality of Life Questionnaire and the Medical Outcomes Survey Questionnaire (SF-36). The mean disease duration at baseline was 14.8 (±9.2) years and patients had been diagnosed 7.4 (±4.0) years prior to inclusion in this study. Results: Acromegaly patients had moderate to severe symptoms related to fatigue, psychosocial status, social functioning, and the emotional component of health status. The highest proportion of patients in our study were classified as having moderate to severe symptoms in the areas of headache, arthritis and pain, and emotional component of their health status. There was no significant difference in QoL between untreated and treated patients. Conclusions: These findings underscore the importance of aggressive control of excessive GH/IGF-1 hypersecretion in acromegaly patients as important for QoL improvement. <EOD> Preventable incidents—the true cost of a failure to communicate in the treatment of trauma

Background: Anti-tumor necrosis factors, such as infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and golimumab, are biological agents that have revolutionized the treatment of psoriasis. Nevertheless, drug survival varies among biological drugs due to differences in patient selection, drug adverse events, and management methods in actual clinical settings, which may lead to inter-drug comparisons. However, most of these studies were based on unreliable and non-validated data. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to evaluate drug survival in the long term using data from a real-world setting.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of psoriasis patients who were treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor drugs and were followed up for at least 12 months (in some cases as long as 5 years) in our hospital. We then compared and analyzed the drug survival rates of infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept.Results: A total of 261 patients were evaluated between 2011 and 2019, including 211 receiving infliximab, 40 receiving adalimumab, and 10 receiving etanercept. The cumulative drug survival rate was 72.4% at 1 year, 50.6% at 2 years, 25.3% at 3 years, 19.8% at 4 years, and 13.4% at 5 years. In the adalimumab subgroup, the cumulative drug survival rate was 71.7% at 1 year, 51.2% at 2 years, 31.9% at 3 years, 22.9% at 4 years, and 14.1% at 5 years. In the infliximab group, the cumulative drug survival rate was 75.8% at 1 year, 54.3% at 2 years, 32.1% at 3 years, 23.6% at 4 years, and 20.3% at 5 years. The patients who completed drug treatment before the data collection had better drug survival rates (≥20.4%) than those who discontinued treatment before the data collection (6.1-13.1%). In addition, concomitant treatment with conventional systemic antiproliferative drugs was also associated with drug survival.Conclusions:The long-term drug survival rate of infliximab was the highest, and that of etanercept was the lowest. Concomitant treatment with antiproliferative drugs positively influenced drug survival. In the early stages of treatment, patients who discontinued biological therapy because of side effects or a lack of efficacy showed poorer drug survival results than those comple"

Overall Conclusion (based on the evidence)
-----------------
The study by Panaich et al investigates the use of an AI-enabled hand-held echocardiogram in an attempt to identify HF in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. The authors concluded that AIbased echocardiography (either hand-held or traditional, depending on the study) could facilitate identification of patients with higer risk of HF.

Strengths (if there any)
-----------------
- Involvment of multiple centers
- Good generalizability of the results in a ""real world"" setting

Weaknesses (if there any)
-----------------
- Small sample size
- Short duration of the study to identify a significant difference in the primary endpoint
- No comparison with CMR or CCTA
- Lack of an adequate washout period between NT-proBNP and AI-hand-held Echocardiography

General Overview/Questions
=========================


* What’s the relationship of the article as a whole to others in its field and its relation to this topic? ________(e.g., this trial is the first to look at the use of….)


* What do you think is the single most important finding to emerge from this trial, in terms of the problem to be solved or the impact on the field/world of medicine? ________(e.g., This trial shows that AI-handheld Echocardiography can reliably distinguish HF from other causes of dyspnea in high-risk patients).

Study Limitations
-----------------
- Lack of blinding to results - This could lead to bias in the assessment of the primary endpoint.
- There is no comparison with CMR or CCTA, which could have influenced the results of this study.
- NT-proBNP was chosen as a gold standard, which could have led to an overestimation of the diagnosis of HF within 6 months.
- No power analysis was performed
- No sample size justification was provided.

In summary:
This was a well designed study with a good generalizability.
However, the sample size is small, the follow up period is relatively short and there is no comparison with CMR or CCTA.

A.J. Cohn, K.O’Keefe PH, R. Buergers, C.J. McDonald. Noninvasive Doppler ultrasonic studies of blood velocity in human subject. Neurology. 1977; 27: 922-931
The MCA blood flow velocity is measured with a transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasound probe which is placed on the surface of the temporal bone approximately 10cm anterior to the ear, with the ear lobe at the side of the probe to ensure optimal Doppler signals. The Doppler frequency is set to 4MHz. For all recordings, the machine is set to ""duplex"" mode, where the right and left carotid arteries and the right vertebral artery basilar artery is recorded if applicable. The ultrasound pulse depth is set to ""auto"" so it adjusts to the depth of the artery as it approaches the probe. For each trial, the investigator will adjust the ultrasound pulse depth and the machine is set to a gain of 65 to 70, so that 6 -8 strong Doppler signals is recorded. The blood flow parameters used for the study are:
- Peak systolic velocity: this is an estimate of the maximal amount of blood flowing through the artery. In the cases of stenosis, this will be reduced. It is measured by measuring the distance in cm of distance that the Doppler signal moves from one baseline to another baseline and then multiplying that by 2/3 - Mean velocity: the average velocity that the blood flow through the artery.
- Time average velocity: the average velocity that the blood flow through the artery. If one of these does not show a change, the other one can be used as an alternative.
- Blood velocity range 100 -90 Hz: the difference in velocity between peaks systolic velocity and a velocity of around 100 Hz. In the cases of stenosis blood flow velocity will be increased.
- Systolic -diastolic velocity range: the difference in velocity between peaks systolic velocity and diastolic velocity. In the cases of stenosis blood flow velocity will be increased.
A more complete explanation of the measurements can be found on the above website.


The ultrasound machine M-Turbo manufactured by SonoSite, Inc is used for measurements of MCA blood flow velocity. This device is an ultrasonic machine with a special head that can be used for ultrasound measurement. For all recordings, the M-Turbo is set to duplex mode, frequency 4 MHz. The depth is fixed depending on what type of recordings is being conducted. The recordings are recorded to a laptop computer as audio (.wav) files.


To allow for optimal recordings of the MCA blood flow velocity, the investigator will adjust the probe depth so that the MCA is in the middle range of the probe. The machine is set with a gain of 65-70, and the probe depth is changed as needed.


All recordings are recorded for analysis. The Doppler values are then transferred into a spreadsheet software. After which the investigator will enter the recordings in the database.


Most of the time the best place to record the MCA blood flow velocity is with the individual laying on their back with the head resting in pillows. In rare cases, and only if the individual is unable to lay on the back due to claustrophobia or otherwise, or has problems with the head being in a supine position, measurements can alternatively be taken in the sitting or standing position using the same technique as previously mentioned.


16-bit sounds are considered the standard of recording, and 16-bit audio is a method for storing digital data in a device, allowing for improved precision and a wide dynamic range for signals. Sound is sampled digitally, where the inputted signals are digitized using AD-converters. The frequency is normally 44.1 kHz, and this is the standard for computer audio data.

Background:We examined the association between time spent and bouts of physical activity, health-related physical fitness, and body weight in children aged 6 to 13 years.Methods: Time spent in physical activity and physical fitness were derived from accelerometer data (3 days) and 10 physical fitness tests, respectively. These variables were adjusted for daily energy expenditure, sex, age, and puberty status.Results: Children spent 58.7% of waking time in sedentary activities, 48.3% in light physical activity, and 3.0% in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. No significant differences were found between normal-weight and overweight children in time spent in sedentary activities (−0.9%; 95%CI: −4.9% to 3.0%), light activity (+0.8; 95%CI: −3.5% to 5.2%), and moderate-to-vigorous activity (+1.0%; 95% CI: +2.0% to +0.0%). Body mass index (BMI) z-score was positively associated with sedentary time (+0.3 kg/m 2 per hour of sedentary activity; 95%CI: +0.1 to +0.5), accelerometer METs*minutes/waking day (+0.1 kg/m 2 per hour; 95%CI:0.0 to 0.1) and physical fitness (+0.4 kg/m 2 per fitness level; 95%CI:0.2 to 0.5), and BMI z-score (0.6 kg/m 2 per fitness level units, 95%CI 0.5 to 0.7) were associated with bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.Conclusion: Time spent in sedentary activities, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, and bouts of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were not associated with BMI z-score and with some measures of physical fitness in Portuguese children. These results should be interpreted cautiously, as there was a low prevalence of overweight children in the studied sample.

Background Liver transplant patients are at high risk of hemorrhage, coagulopathy, or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) following liver transplantation. These complications may increase the likelihood of early reoperation in this fragile population. Objectives To analyze the impact of activated coagulation time (ACT)-based anticoagulation protocols on transfusion, coagulopathy (INR), and reoperations after liver transplantation. Methods All patients who underwent liver transplantation from January 2006 to December 2010 were included (n=374). Patients were subdivided into 2 groups: patients who received heparin-based anticoagulation protocols (Group H) and patients who received factor VIII-based protocol (Group F). Coagulation values were recorded upon arrival in the ICU. Coagulopathy development, transfusion of packed red blood cells, hemorrhagic complications, reoperations, and 30-day mortality were analyzed. Results No significant differences were found comparing Groups H and F regarding INR, hemorrhagic transfusions, coagulopathy development, and 30-day mortality. However, patients in Group F displayed lower reoperation rates (p=0.003). The probability of reoperation was reduced in patients receiving Factor VIII-based anticoagulation (hazard ratio: 0.42, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.76). Conclusion Our results show that factor VIII–based protocols for anticoagulation appear to provide more precise coagulation monitoring and lower rates of recurrent bleeding after liver transplantation without increasing thrombocytopenia in comparison with heparin-based protocols. The use of factor VIII-based anticoagulation protocols seems associated, therefore, with a lower probability of reoperation following liver transplantation. <EOD> Vesical calculus removed by the suprapubic method
IN October 1901, Mr. Robert Jones, of Llanwsthan, having been called to see Mr. I.

We may regard this as an extremely bold attempt, the idea of getting a sound so far beyond the urethra being a new one to me; for, although I can remember the late Dr. Lawson Tait as operating in this way, I am not certain that it was ever done successfully. It was then 15.00. I went up to Liverpool to prepare for the operation; and then, at 8.30 a.m. of the same day, Mr. Roberts (house surgeon at the Royal Southern Hospital), and Dr. Jones (whose letter referred to) arrived.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of FP-1201, an injected formulation of interferon beta-1a for preventing toxicities after CAR T-cell therapy in treating patients with B-cell NHL or B ALL who have no standard treatment option or whose disease has relapsed or failed to respond to standard therapy.

Detailed Description: [/INST]

In this research study, participants will be treated with FP-1201, a formulation of interferon beta-1a (FP-1201) to prevent toxicities after CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy.

The aim of FP-1201 in the treatment of CAR T-cell related toxicities is to suppress the inflammatory response via the downregulation of CAR T-cell activation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

FP-1201 will be administered daily for 3 days starting 3 days before CAR T-cell infusion.

This clinical trial will assess the use of a tablet to evaluate the patient's need of care by monitoring sleep quality. This tablet would allow nurses to prioritize care of a patient depending on the patient's sleep requirements.

In this hospitalised intensive care setting, the algorithm detects when a patient has sleep deficiency to take over and perform non urgent care. The goal is to improve sleep quality so to allow patients to recover better.

This study aims to assess the usability, the efficacy, the efficiency and the safety of the system regarding a patient's sleep quality improvement and related complications in ICU patients.

For the patient enrolled in this study, a sleep and an awake monitor will be connected. During the nighttime, it will determine whether patients undergo interrupted sleep. When it detects fragmented sleep, it will alert nurses. During the daytime, the algorithm analyses the sleep data and alerts the nurse if the patient faces fragmented sleep based on set parameters (average number of movements per minute of sleep, latency,…). During the sleep sessions interrupted, the nurse has to take care of the patient. When the nurse takes care of the patient, the algorithm detects when the patient falls asleep. It will then switch into prioritization mode and will take care of the patient's need for sleep. The nurse is still able to monitor the patient (eg. blood pressure, heart rate,…) during this phase of the screening. The algorithm can take any measure to ensure patient safety (eg. fall alarm, blood pressure alarms,…) When the monitoring and prioritization are finished, the nurse can resume his monitoring function in any case.

The following parameters will be evaluated by the nurse (1 or 6 points):

Score: 1 (poor) / 6 (good)

Duration of stay in the ICU:

Score: -1 (very long) / +1 (very short)

Quality of sleep:

Score: 1 (poor) / 6 (good)

Sleep quality according to the nurse's score:

Score: 1 (very poor) / 6 (very good)

Heart rate:

Score: -1 (less than 50 beats/min) / +1 (more than 100 beats/ min)

Blood pressure:

Score: -1 (less than 37 mmHg) / +1 (over 180 mmHg)

Glycaemia:

Score: -1 (over 2 gr/l) / +1 (less than 2 gr/l)

Sedation score:

Score: -1 (poor) / +1 (good)

Respiratory status:

Score: -1 (in danger) / +1 (secure)

Overall Study Design:

EZTRAZE-UC is a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, Phase 2, monotherapy, study to assess the efficacy and safety of SAR441566 monotherapy in a population of adult Participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria. Participants who do not fulfill the inclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1) to receive either SAR441566 or a placebo. All Participants will be treated for 12 weeks and will be followed for up to 36 weeks.

Participants who fulfill the inclusion criteria and do not fulfill the exclusion criteria will be randomized (1:1) using an interactive internet response system (IRS) to receive either SAR441566 or a placebo. Participants will self-administer a once daily oral dose of SAR441566 or placebo based on the randomization schedule.

The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of SAR441566 monotherapy as compared to placebo on fecal calprotectin and clinical remission at week 12.

The secondary objectives are to determine efficacy of SAR441566 monotherapy as compared to placebo on Focus on Fistula in Crohn's Disease (FOCUS) response score, Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT) for hemoglobin (FIT-Hb > 20 µg/g on at least one of weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 or 12), clinical response and clinical remission at week 12, percentage of Participants in corticosteroid-free clinical remission after 4, 8 and 12 weeks, histologic remission, histologic improvement in 2 or more endoscopic biopsies, Mayo Endoscopic (MES) scores, Participant Global Assessment of disease activity (PtGA-DA), Physician Global Assessment of disease activity (PGA-DA), patient assessed Mobility Score, Veterans Rand Medical (VR-12), Patient-Reported Outcome measure (PRO2), Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (SIBDQ) at week 12, percentage of Participants with a fecal calprotectin level (quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay/ELISA) lower than 250 µg/g (<250 µg/g) at week 12, and change from baseline in fecal calprotectin at week 12, and quality of life (QoL) at week 12, fecal calprotectin level (quantified by ELISA/ELISA) at weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12, FIT-Hb at weeks 2, 4, 8, 10 or 12, and CRP at weeks 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12.

 <EOD> In the case of a 46-year-old woman who died in 1953 after giving birth at St. Joseph County Memorial Hospital, the coroner reported to the court on Oct. 4, ″Dr. E. P. ″, and then by physician, was performed and a pathological diagnosis was made that the patient died as a result of ″overwhelming hypoglycemia″. The woman had been treated for insulin-induced hypoglycemic coma at the hospital, ″which in the opinion of the doctor and physician in attendance resulted from an adverse reaction to the insulin administered to the deceased.″ Toxicologists have examined the woman’s urine and insulin blood levels and found that she was given two to three times the normal dosage of insulin. Toxicologists, who have performed detailed postmortem exams for six months, have concluded that she died of natural causes, they say. She had an elevated insulin concentration in the blood, which could indicate her pregnancy or diabetes-related hypertension, and an elevated level suggests insulin, said Dr. Steven H. , toxicologist. The woman had previously been given 41.5 units of insulin, said Hooda. ″The amount of insulin given to patients depends on when the insulin was given, the level of blood sugar and other factors,″ toxicologist Steve H. ″The death is natural″, he said. The woman, who was 416 and had no previous history of diabetes, has received some injections before giving birth to her son on Sept. 26 and had no signs of illness or seizures during the delivery. Before the delivery, ″she was quite well except for the swelling of the feet″, according to her brother, ″Albert.″ Albert added that his sister had no experience with pregnancy before this one and had no diabetes or other problems.
The case of a 46-year-old woman who died of insulin-induced diabetes at St. Joseph County Memorial Hospital in Plymouth. Hours after the birth, she had hypoglycemic coma, which is characterized by extreme tiredness and insufficient energy levels to do simple tasks, according to a hospital source.   A new approach to insulin toxicity: Insulin-induced hypoglycemia and its treatment, Hooda   found that she had hypoglycemia after receiving a double dose of insulin for his condition. Insulin, used to treat diabetes and other conditions, is one of the most commonly prescribed medicines in the US.
The case in Plymouth comes as the state is considering bills to limit access to insulin and other lifesaving drugs. This is a new phenomenon in Ohio, where people can buy the drug with no restrictions. In order to protect the public from overdose, the state requires people to take diabetes tests before insulin can be prescribed. If the woman’s blood sugar levels are below normal, it is considered a “dangerous” level of blood sugar that can lead to hypoglycemia. The patient’s insulin levels are also important because the body produces a high level of insulin when it has a blood sugar level higher than the body’s average blood sugar level.
When the patient’s body becomes used to a high level of insulin, the body can’t absorb insulin properly, said Hooda. If you have a small amount of insulin, you may develop hypoglycemia. <EOD> Clinical studies of brivaracetam in the treatment of partial seizures: a review of the international prospective and retrospective studies
Brivaracetam is a sulfamate derivative of levetiracetam, and is a high‐purity prodrug that is rapidly and completely converted to the active parent drug before it reaches the brain. It selectively modulates synaptic neurotransmission, and also binds to synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A).

 <EOD> Transition to an E-Scooter Culture in Public Transport: User Behavior and Perceptions

Citation: Raihan, M.R.; Choudhury, K.; Sharmin, N.; Kumar, P.; Khodair, A.; Alam, S.; Ahmed, M.U.; Shayyaf, A.; Islam, A.; Islam, M.S.; et al.Abstract: There has been an emerging trend in integrating the use of electric vehicles, particularly electric scooters (E-scooters), into the public transport system worldwide to address traffic jams, environmental pollution, and to lessen the need for cars. E-scooter rides have gained a massive scope as an alternative option for travelling around the city in recent times, and cities, and governments are working together to make E-scooters more accessible to citizens. With increasing use and potential use, much still remains uncertain about how they could be applied in the context of public transport. Thus, there is a need to examine consumer perceptions regarding E-scooters and to assess whether they are preferred over traditional means of public transport. This study uses a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative approaches, and a total of 406 data were collected from students, service providers (such as taxi drivers), and policymakers in Bangladesh. It was found that 80% of respondents consider E-scooter rides as the most desirable mean of transport, when compared with other means, and almost 30% of them have already used an E-scooter. This study concludes that the provision of a reliable E-scooter service is more important than the cost and perceived safety of riding an E-scooter, when comparing it with other types of private transport. In response to the findings, this study provides recommendations for the government, transport authorities, and E-scooter operators toward a safe and organized transition toward E-scooter-based transport. Further, this study assesses the need to create a regulatory framework for the operation of E-scooter companies, so to support their development in Bangladesh.

# Introduction
In the last decades, cities have experienced fast growth and expansion. Many governments are planning to meet the demand growth by reducing the volume of private vehicles and shifting to public transport. However, the demand for and availability of public transport do not match each other in any urban region worldwide, especially in Bangladesh.
There continues to be a growth in traffic crashes and fatalities worldwide, which has not slowed down in recent decades. In some countries, such as the United States, road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death. The number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities may still rise, as rapid population growth and the number of vehicles has increased globally, especially in lowand middle-income countries, such as in Bangladesh.
Considering the urban growth and development in major cities, traditional methods of transportation are not efficient enough to reduce congestion and increase the supply of public transport, particularly in Bangladesh. Urban transportation is still primarily dominated by individual personal vehicles, even though there has been a significant increase in their use by middleto-high-income individuals. These trends are expected to continue in various countries. There has therefore been a strong demand from governments, urban planners, private companies, and users for alternative means of transport. A change in transport-related activities could be a potential opportunity for sustainable and efficient mobility options. The public transport system is an alternative solution to traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and CO 2 emissions. However, people still travel by car in large cities,"

 <EOD> .
The aim of the study was to establish the efficacy of intra-articular plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) in knee synovitis. It was designed as a prospective cohort, open-labelled, interventional pilot study with non-randomized parallel groups. The study included knees with synovitis secondary to osteoarthritis (OA) (Grade 1 to Grade 3 according to Outerbridge, grades I, II or III), fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis. All patients received three sessions of intra-articular PRGF injections, with a time of two weeks in between each PRGF injection. A single PRGF concentrate preparation was performed and used for all treatment sessions. The PRGF preparation process included a 70% of centrifugation in a single closed system. All patients received intra-articular injection of 3 mL PRGF in the lateral gutter of the knee. After 6 months of treatment all patients received a second evaluation. 171 patients were included in the study and 150 of them completed it (48 men, 50.0%; 102 women, 57.3%). The mean age was 62.6 years (SD 13.4; range 18.1-80.6). An improvement of 4 points in the WOMAC score for pain was reported by 74.0% patients, an improvement of 4 points in the WOMAC score for stiffness with 71.3% patients and an improvement of 4 points in the WOMAC score for function with 79.4% patients. There was a significant decrease in the mean VAS score for pain: the mean score of the VAS pain at baseline was 7.11 (SD 1.09) and after 6-month the value was 5.52 (SD 1.93) (P≤0.0001). 62.5% reported a clinical improvement of pain in comparison to the previous visit. Our results suggest that intra-articular PRGF treatment is able to improve pain and function in patients suffering from knee joint synovitis secondary to OA. <EOD> Comparison of immunohistochemical expression of NFATc2 and FoxP3 gene expression in a group of patients with and without acute coronary syndrome.
The present study aims to evaluate the correlation between NFATc2 and FoxP3 gene expression and immunohistochemistry in patients with and without acute coronary syndrome. A total of 40 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were divided into two groups: Group 1 was the patients who had percutaneous coronary intervention (9 patients with ST-elevated myocardial infarction and 15 patients with unstable angina) before bypass surgery and Group II was the patients (21 patients) with CABG. We prepared a single-step protocol for simultaneous expression of two marker genes, FoxP3, a regulatory T subset marker, and NFATc2, a gene implicated in early T helper 17 cell (Th17) differentiation, in patients with and without acute coronary syndrome. The expression of the two genes and number of regulatory T cells were higher in the patients with acute coronary syndrome than in the other patients. Therefore, the measurement of the expression of these genes is a valuable indicator to predict and diagnose patients with acute coronary syndrome. <EOD> Improved Molecular Methods for Detection of Salmondilla species (Gastrotricha: Macrodasyida: Thaumastodermatidae) from Marine and Brackish Environments

SalmHunt amplifies a 0.687-kb segment from the 16S gene to target Thaumastodermatidae and Salpidae. A third primer (Hc2) was modified to create SalMicHunt, which improves detection of Thaumastodermatidae.

 <EOD> Role of interventional echocardiography in assessing transplant outcomes and procedural success of transvenous implantable cardioverter-defibrillators



# Introduction
Transvenous implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) implanted prior to heart transplant may be associated with adverse clinical outcomes. We sought to evaluate differences in clinical outcomes between preand post-transplant ICD patients and determine predictors of mortality post-transplant. We further sought to validate ICD pocket change as a means to assess procedure success and evaluate its association with post-transplant mortality.

# Methods
The Toronto Cardiac Transplant Program's database was queried for all patients who received an ICD prior to heart transplantation between 2011-2017. ICD data including procedure success, pocket change, lead parameters, ECGs and ICD shocks were reviewed. Recipient, donor and ICD data were obtained. Survival was analyzed using cox proportional regression and log-rank tests for pre-versus post-transplant comparisons.

# Results
171 patients had ICDs implanted prior to heart transplant; 31% underwent 54 transvenous implantation procedures with 60% successful procedures. Patients were observed from 2011 (3 monthly post-implant monitoring, or 6 if unsuccessful procedure), and received post-transplant care according to standard of care guidelines. 45 underwent a successful transvenous implantation procedure; 10 had repeat unsuccessful procedures, and 2 were unsuccessfully implanted peri-operatively. 41 (68%) patients in successful transvenous ICD cohort had pocket change compared to 0 patients (0%) in the failed procedure cohort. Overall 1-year and 2-year post-transplant mortality was 5% and 12%, respectively.

# Discussion/conclusion
Patients with unsuccessful transvenous ICD implantation procedure were observed to have nearly 5 times greater mortality at 2 years post-transplant compared to those with successful procedures (20% vs 4% at 2 years, respectively), and patients without ICDs (5% at 2 years). 2 of 3 patients in successful transvenous ICD cohort with no/no-change pocket implantation had deaths attributed to arrhythmia, compared with none in the no ICD/failed procedure cohort. As a non-invasive method to assess procedure success, an interventional echocardiography pocket change test is simple and rapid to perform in addition to offering the benefit of"

HISTORY AND CLINICAL FINDINGS
We report the case of a woman aged 32 years who developed sudden, severe vertigo with vomiting. She had no cardiac arrhythmias. Her history revealed a surgically corrected coarctation of the aorta, but she had no history of cardiovascular interventions, coronary heart disease or arrhythmia. There were no neurological deficits.


INVESTIGATIONS
ECG showed marked ST-segment elevation in the aVR lead (ST-segment depression in the others VR-leads), left bundle branch block (LBBB), and ventricular tachycardia (VT). Further diagnostics showed no evidence of atherosclerosis. Cardiac enzymes, liver and kidney function were normal. In addition, she had hypergammaglobulinaemia. Chest X-ray showed the surgical coarctation of the aorta. In the electroencephalogram (EEG) there was no evidence of seizures or epileptiform abnormalities.


TREATMENT AND COURSE
She was treated immediately with an Adenosine infusion followed by an ACE inhibitor. Because of the sustained ventricular tachycardia which rapidly degenerated into a ventricular fibrillation, urgent cardioversion was performed twice. Then she was transferred to a centre with surgical capacities. Her course in our hospital was uneventful. Under continued antiarrhythmic therapy and ACE inhibitor she remained in sinus rhythm during the whole observation period of 4 days.


CONCLUSIONS
In patients with the coarctation of the aorta we recommend treatment with a beta 1/beta 2 adrenoceptor antagonist and an ACE inhibitor. In the case of VT or ventricular fibrillation with signs of compromised myocardial function, a bolus infusion of an Adenosin or direct current cardioversion with a defibrillator may be used. A dual-chamber pacemaker is required in cases of 2:1- and 3:1-block. <EOD> Transcatheter management of the unprotected left main coronary artery disease.
Management of unprotected left main coronary artery stenosis in patients with severe unprotected left main coronary artery disease remains a complex clinical problem in cardiology. Recent randomized trials revealed high survival benefit from percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent implantation into the left main coronary artery compared with coronary artery bypass grafting. However, procedural risks and postinterventional drug-eluting stent thrombosis limit the application of these strategies. Current data are summarized including new developments in the technique of stent implantation into the left main coronary artery. Alternatives to the percutaneous coronary stent implant in patients with unprotected left main coronary artery disease are discussed. <EOD> 4.5 out of 5 stars

| Instruction Text | Tocilizumab is used to reduce the side effects of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This process, known as mobilisation, usually involves one or more injections of hG-CSF to release the blood cells from the bone marrow (mobilisation). Because hG‐CSF works rapidly, it is often used to speed up the recovery of blood cells after chemo/radio therapies which usually suppress the mobilisation and growth of bone marrow cells. A lot of the side effects from the chemo/radio therapies are pain‐related. Cancer and its treatments can cause tiredness in muscle and joints, a loss of blood supply to the skin (neuropathy), and other health problems which can be painful and make everyday activities such as getting dressed, washing and eating difficult. These effects can affect people both during and after their cancer treatment. Tocilizumab is a treatment option which could help to improve the quality of life of people during and after chemo/radio therapies. We are now looking for people who receive blood stem cell transplants to take part in a research study about how treatments can make the blood stem cell transplant process better. Some people receive tocilizumab, but others do not have tocilizumab. The study will involve testing two groups of people, in different hospitals. One group will include people who take tocilizumab when they receive the blood stem cells. The other group will include people who do not take tocilizumab. |

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) causes pandemic acute respiratory disease coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). At present, there are no effective antiviral drugs to efficiently block viral multiplication. The virion contains multiple non-structural protein 16 (nsps): papain-like protease (PLpro), spike glycoprotein 1 (S glycoprotein), M glycoprotein, E glycoprotein and nucleocapsid-binding protein. M glycoprotein (Mpro) and PLpro play critical roles in the viral replication cycle since the two proteases help to promote viral entry and replication. This study determined the Mpro and PLpro inhibitory activity of the synthetic peptidomimetics of nirmatrelvir, camostat, and EIDD-1931. These three compounds dose-dependently suppress the viral protease activity of Mpro and PLpro. The peptide-based agents used individually to inhibit only Mpro and PLpro at a lower concentration showed weak antiviral activities; however, combined treatment of the peptide inhibitors could considerably increase the antiviral activity in V"

Search strategy: clinical trials

Result:

(1) EVEN-ICSI trial - TESA
 
 49 couples with AZ sperm and high sperm DNA were randomized to undergo ICSI with high purity embryos obtained with TESA (n=26) or commercial microfluidization-IVF (n=23). The two groups were comparable regarding age, fertility grade, baseline characteristics and treatment cycle. At day 3, fertilization rates were significantly lower in clinical pregnancy group (14 vs 39%, p<0.05). Clinical pregnancy rates (CPR) were significantly higher in the control group (7 of 23; 30.4% vs 0 of 26; 0%, p<0.05). Similarly, high purity embryos were retrieved in a significantly higher percentage in control group (67% vs 12%, p<0.05). In conclusion, TESA-ICSI is superior to commercial microfluidization-IVF for couples with AZ sperm and high fragmentation

42 azoospermic men and 45 normal fertile men were randomized, to undergo surgically retrieved testicular sperm (e.g TESA) or surgically recovered epididymal sperm. Normal fertile men ejaculated sperm were used as control. The overall fertilization and pregnancy rates were significantly higher in the surgically obtained sperm groups compared to control. The authors concluded that ICSI using testicular or surgically retrieved epidydimal sperm are superior ICSI technique and should be preferable in men with AZ sperm.

Input Text: the Effect of Stabilization on Archery Performance

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Arrow Release is the Final Result of the Stable Segments during the Kinetic Chain of Archery Sport Archery can be described as a comparatively static sport requiring strength and endurance of the upper body, in particular the forearm and shoulder girdle. Skill in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow to a given target in a certain time span with accuracy. The discipline is described as a three-phase (the stance, the drawing and the sighting) movement. Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and followthrough. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. An archer pushes the bow with an extended arm, which is statically held in the direction of the target, while the other arm exerts a dynamic pulling of the bowstring from the beginning of the drawing phase, until the release is dynamically executed. The release phase must be well balanced and highly reproducible to achieve commendable results in a competition. The bowstring is released when an audible impulse is received from a device called clicker that is used as a draw length check. Each arrow can be drawn to an exact distance and a standard release can be obtained using the device. The clicker is reputed to improve the archer's score and used by all target archers. The archer should react to the clicker as quickly as possible. In particular, a repeated contraction and relaxation strategy in the forearm and pull finger muscles should be developed for this reason. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization and stabilization-related parameters on shooting performance at the cervical, lumbal and scapular levels in archery athletes. A total of 40 archery athletes aged between 10 and 18, who have been professionally engaged in archery for at least 1 year were included in the study. Demographic information and musculoskeletal system evaluations of the athletes were done. Performance of the athletes via Upper Extremity Closed Kinetic Chain Stability Test, Hand Grip Strength test; presence of scapular dyskinesia was evaluated via the Lateral Scapular Slide Test. Cervical region stabilization was evaluated via Craniocervical Flexion Test, scapular level stabilization was evaluated via Scapular Muscle Endurance Test, lumbar region stabilization was evaluated via Abdominal Drawing-in Test and Sahrmann's Core Stability Test. As the parameters related to stabilization, postures via Corbin Postural Rating Scale; balances via Stork Balance Test, Upper Extremity Y Balance Test; pain was evaluated via the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. Shooting performances were evaluated with 72 target shootings and a total of 720 points.

 <EOD> The Effect of Perceived Discrimination to Health Related Quality of Life in Korean Adolescents

This study was designed to examine the relationships between perceived discrimination, stress symptoms, depressive, anxiety, and health related quality of life (HRQOL) in Korean adolescents. A total of 2,871 Korean adolescents (1,462 girls and 1,409 boys) attending middle and high schools participated. The perceived discrimination was measured using the modified version of Perceived Discrimination Scale for Adolescents (PDS-A). HRQOL was measured using the European Kidscreen-52 (Ki-QOL) and adolescents' Stress Checklist (ASC). Results of hierarchical multiple regression analysis showed that negative perceived discrimination was significantly associated with negative affect in general and at school environment domain of HRQOL (GHQ-A, p< 0.001, p< 0.001, respectively), social support, and social pressure domain of HRQOL (p< 0.05, < 0.001). The effects of negative perceived discrimination to the HRQOL were smaller than effects of stress symptoms, depressive, and anxiety, and negative affect had the smallest effect of the variables on the HRQOL for girls. In conclusion, negative perceived discrimination had a negative influence to the adolescents' HRQOL, even controlling effects of stress symptoms, depressive, anxiety, and negative affect.

# Introduction

The study will collect pseudonymised patient data from primary care practices that are part of the NHS and private practices that are part of the Care Records Service. This study will make use of data available on patient registered in primary care services (i.e. GP practices) and the patient will have to have a CPR number to be enrolled in the study. The study will also make use of electronic health records from the secondary care service. The results of the study will present summarised data without any possibility to identify individual patients (i.e. anonymised data). The study does not include any intervention; therefore, the participants will not be contacted.

 Study Rationale: Overview of the disease
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An overview of the disease/condition to give context/justification for the study.
-----------------------------
Vitiligo is a common autoimmune disorder characterised by the presence of well-demarcated and irregular patches of localised and/or generalized hypopigmentation on the skin. It is caused by destruction of melanocytes, the cells producing melanin in skin. The exact cause of vitiligo remains uncertain but it is thought that genetic, environmental factors and autoimmune mechanisms might contribute to the development and progression of vitiligo. It is estimated that vitiligo affects about between 0.14 – 2.2% of the world population. The condition has a more prominent affect in darker skin types and often have a negative psychosocial impact on patients since vitiligo is associated with low self-esteem, social discomfort, depression and anxiety, and a negative impact on quality of life 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Existing Knowledge (Literature Review)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Describe any related studies, including the rationale, outcomes, results and conclusions.
------------------------------
Vitiligo is considered a chronic and relapsing disease, with significant negative effect on quality of life. Despite this, few studies investigated the long-term effect of vitiligo and existing studies are limited in their focus, the small number of patients included and the long time period over which the data was collected. One study in the UK found an average of 58.5 dermatology visits in people with vitiligo over a 23 years follow-up period. No significant difference was seen in the number of dermatology visits between people with vitiligo and controls. People with vitiligo are 10.4 times more likely to suffer from depression and are 6.2 times more likely to suffer from anxiety than people with other forms of pigmentary disorders.

Input Text: The Effect of Self-efficacy and Relationship Through Behavior Modification by Hybrid Mode

Study Overview
-----------------

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: The COVID-19 pandemic had reduced access to early care, education, and life participation for families of children with developmental delay, resulting in deterioration of parental mental health, child deterioration, and parental unemployment. The literature supports that face-to-face or online caregiver-mediated interventions could promote child development, self-efficacy and reduce parental stress. The clinical practice of early care center in our hospital lacked a multi-disciplinary integrated relationship facilitation program for caregivers of children with developmental delay. Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects and examine of the behavior modification by hybrid in Stress, self-efficacy, relationships and conflict for caregivers Method: Caregivers of development delay children were recruited and randomly assigned to Hybrid group(n=20), and  Self-learning group (n=19). After 8-weeks training (Online sessions and individual consultation sessions), the performance was assessed by a blinded assessor. The outcome measures included Intervention Fidelity, Parenting Sense of Confidence, Parenting Stress Index: Short form, The Conflict Tactics Scales: Parent Version, habit schedule record, satisfaction questionnaire. Date analyzing: Collected data will be analyzed with Mann-Whinney U test, the Wilcoxon Signed Ranked Test, and Spearman correlation analysis by SPSS version 20.0, and alpha level was set at 0.05.

195,"[/INST] <EOD> Intraoperative Radiotherapy Following Local Recurrence of Soft-Tissue Sarcoma
Objective Local recurrence of soft tissue sarcoma is characterized by a less favorable prognosis as compared with the previously unirradiated tumor bed and, thus, intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT) has the potential to prolong disease-free survival. The present study was designed to estimate the treatment outcome of patients with local recurrence of soft tissue sarcoma treated with IORT. Patients and Methods Thirty patients with local recurrence after irradiation of a previously untreated soft tissue sarcoma were treated with resection and IORT. All tumors were histologically and staged as “local recurrence.” Patients received IORT using the mobile electron accelerator in-house. In the irradiation planning, special attention was paid to the tumor bed, the planned resection line, and the surgical margins; thus, an electron field encompassing all these relevant structures could be created. Results No secondary metastases were observed. After a median follow-up of 75 months (range, 5 to 184 mo), locoregional progression of the disease was seen in four patients; however, no major local failure was noted. Disease-free survival at 3, 5, and 7 years was 77%, 64%, and 21%, respectively, with 21% locoregional recurrence at more than 5 years. Distant recurrence was the most frequent pattern of failure, and the median time to recurrence was 18 months. The overall survival at 3, 5, and 7 years was 94%, 53%, and 38%, respectively, with a median survival of 48 months. In a univariate analysis, high tumor grade >G2 was correlated with worse locoregional control (p = 0.011). The use of >1 chemotherapeutic agent showed a trend toward significance but the difference was not significant in the univariate analysis. Conclusion The current study shows an apparent advantage related to local control in the favorable-risk group, characterized by low tumor grade and low stage (no high-grade tumor). However, no survival advantage could be demonstrated in this group. <EOD> Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion With Stand-Alone Cages Versus Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion With Plate Versus Posterior Decompression and Fusion Cervical Spinal Fixation: A Comprehensive Review and Meta-Analysis of Comparative Clinical Studies

Introduction:The anterior approach to cervical spine surgery for treatment of cervical degenerative disc disease (cDDD) has been shown to have lower risk of injury to the adjacent-segment disease (ASD), adjacent segmental degeneration (ASD), and instrumented-segment degeneration (ISD). Anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) is less popular today because of complications related to spinal fusion such as plate-related issues, screw loosening, and pseudoarthrosis, in addition to ASD and ISD. Stand-alone cages are more advantageous than plate-assisted fusions to avoid or delay ASD, which is a major concern. Aim: The aim of this systematic review is to compare plate-assisted fusions versus stand-alone cages, focusing on ASD, adjacent-level disc degeneration, range of motion (ROM), and fusion rate in multilevel cDDD. Methods: Eligible studies comparing the outcome of the three methods were identified by searching the PubMed, Medline, OVID, Cochrane, and clinicaltrials.org database. Data were collected including study design, country, author's name, year of publication, number of cases, average age between the three groups, and follow-up. Study selection and data extraction were conducted by two authors. The ROM of the operative segment was recorded at one year postoperatively. The authors identified 11 studies for qualitative analysis because they reported the data required. Outcome measures used were ROM of the operative segment at one year, fusion rate, and ASD or adjacent-level disc degeneration. Results: The present review comprised 11 studies on multilevel cervical spondylotic myelopathy (CSM) and multilevel cDDD. They included a total of 816 cases with 319 cases using anterior plate-assisted fusion ("

- [CONCLUSION]

[TEXT]

- This paper presents the results of a single-center, non-interventional clinical study with a follow-up time of at least one year after the baseline examination. The aim of the study was to evaluate whether a full diagnostic three-dimensional imaging method is essential at baseline examination or it can be replaced by a magnetic resonance imaging.



In 2016,  a study at the Department of Periodontology was conducted in which periodontitis patients were examined from two different clinics and a new diagnostic and therapeutic concept was to be developed to detect risk groups even more clearly and effectively. Following further development of the conceptual approach, several clinical trials have already taken place, and the present study is the continuation of the clinical trial with the approval.

# Results
Eighteen patients with furcation defects > 35% who met the inclusion criteria were selected for the study.  All patients had advanced periodontitis and were indicated for a CBCT from a diagnostic point of view. The data of the reference examination of the patients were compared with the data of the standard CBCT for bone loss and furcation involvement. The aim of the study is to determine how well a panoramic x-ray, the gold standard of radiography, can be replaced by bitewings, a bitewing survey and a simple MRI.

## Patients
All patients were screened and recruited in the outpatient clinic of the Department of Periodontology. Inclusion criteria were at least two adjacent, completely covered, bilateral defects in the mesial and distal direction in a tooth with at least two root canals (Figure 1).

<img src=""https://i.imgur.com/C8J9Qe5.png"" width=""960""/>


Apart from the bitewing and the bitewing survey, a full arch x-ray series was taken as a reference. All panoramic films and intraoral x-ray images were taken with a phospho-plate.

## Diagnostic
The radiograph was taken digitally without the use of phosphors. With a 1:1 ratio, the digital images were reduced for analysis in order to make the measurements of the CBCT reference examination comparable to the standardized digital images.

## Dental imaging
Based on bone density information, a distinction was made between cortical bone, cancellous bone and air. These were represented as 256 × 256 pixel images and provided an isotropic field which enabled measurements.

## Image evaluation
The clinical trial was evaluated independently by a specialist for diagnostic and technological parameters. The clinical trial consisted of a three-dimensional volume calculation that was made within an isotropic resolution field of 150 µm.

## Image evaluation
A calibrated computer with identical equipment and a 19"" Dell P2412H computer screen with a spatial resolution of 1280 × 1024 pixel density and a dynamic range of 400:1 was used to analyze the images. A calibration for the contrast and brightness of the images was also performed prior to the analysis.

# Results
Further studies showed that the combination of a three-dimensional volume calculation of the cone with an acquisition of the CBCT in a field of view of 8 × 8 cm with a resolution of 400 × 400 µm showed a clinically relevant diagnostic performance.

# Conclusion
Using computed tomographic cross-sectional images, a digital volume reconstruction was made from two-dimensional cone beam computed tomography image data.

# Conclusions
In 2016, a study taking place at the Department of Periodontology was conducted in which periodontitis patients were examined from two different clinics and a new diagnostic and therapeutic concept was to be developed to detect risk groups even more clearly and effectively. Following further development of the conceptual approach, several clinical trials have already taken place, and the present study is the continuation of the clinical trial with the approval.

Pregnancy usually is planned as soon as circumstances, personal wishes, and age permit, and an early marriage is preferred. The birth is performed at home attended by a midwife or nurse, with little medical help. After delivery, for both husband and wife, a week is spent in a home bed of the parents. The woman stays there for a shorter or longer period depending on the ease of delivery, the condition of the child, and the financial and social status of the parents. The most commonly used contraceptive methods are withdrawal and the rhythm method. Only 19% of women interviewed used any method. Most women do not seek more information because they want to have a baby in the future, have no knowledge of methods, or are embarrassed to ask for information.

The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Children with Severe Neuromuscular Illness and Their Families. Int.Abstract: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the virus has greatly influenced the everyday functioning of society and medical care. Children with neuromuscular diseases require special medical care and rehabilitation, which has been limited by the epidemic restrictions. Our study aimed to assess changes in functioning and the well-being of children with neuromuscular diseases and their families during the pandemic from April 2020 to April 2022. A survey was performed with the use of the standard and clinically validated tools: the Polish version of the General Depression Scale (GDS), the scale of psychological resources (SPI) by Juczyński, and the scale of the parents' burden of care by M. B. Zarzycki et al. 2005. The studied subjects were patients and their parents, who received treatment and rehabilitation in the Children's Hospital, Specialist Clinical Centre of Neuromuscular and Hereditary Metabolic Diseases of Medical University of Lodz. The study included 61 children with a confirmed diagnosis of neuromuscular disease (30 boys and 11 girls) at the age of 3.5-19.5 years of age (M = 11.739; SD = 3.129). The study of the functioning of children and adults during the pandemic showed that 37.7% of children have suffered mood changes, 24.6% anxiety symptoms, and 27.9% behavioral changes. Children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, chronic muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, and mitochondrial diseases have experienced more clinical symptoms during this time, compared to patients without the listed diagnoses. Children and parents from 50 families reported a decrease in the bur"

 <EOD> A review of the genus Notharctus, early Tertiary primates (""platypus monkey"") of North America.
The early Tertiary North American platypus monkey genus Notharctus is reviewed. The systematic position of this taxon in its own tribe, Notharctini, in primate subordinal rank, the parapithecidae, remains uncertain, but recent findings point to a phylogenetic position within a parapithecid clade which would mean that this lineage is not the earliest diverging lineage of euprimates. Of eight species of Notharctus, only four are reliably known. The best known species, N. osage is represented by abundant fossils found in the Late Eocene deposits (Wasiolek Member, Fox Lick Formation) in NW Missouri. Notharctus major is known from the earlier, Late Eocene, Fox Lick Formation of NW Missouri, N. clarus, based upon isolated teeth, is known from deposits in both the Wasiolek and Faraon Locality of the Fox Lick Formation; N. breganhon and, possibly, N. nebraskensis are present in the latest Eocene deposits of western Nebraska; N. manitobensis and N. arizonaensis are both known in both of the major North American Tertiary basins, the Missouri Basin and the western Interior Seaway (central interior seaway). The type species of the genus, N. whitei, was described from an abundant Late Eocene (Lutetian) fauna from western Pennsylvania, but the only specimen assigned to this species is a single cranium and probably does not represent the same taxon as the other, distinctly larger species. <EOD> Higher Dietary Iron Promotes Inflammation, Which Is Attenuated with the Absence of Hfe

Higher iron intake is believed to increase the risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. HFE is an intracellular iron-responsive gene that is mutated in hereditary hemochromatosis, a disorder of iron overload. Iron overload has been linked to insulin resistance, diabetes, and atherosclerosis, suggesting that HFE may play a role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. To investigate the effect of altered iron metabolism due to overexpression of HFE on insulin sensitivity, glucose transport, and gene expression, and to determine whether the absence of HFE (Hfe knockout) protects from insulin resistance that is concomitant with higher dietary iron intake, we used 12-week-old Hfe knockout and wild-type (WT) mice that were fed either an iron-adequate diet (ID) or iron-overload diet (IOD) for 5 weeks. Compared with WT mice receiving ID, dietary iron overload resulted in decreased insulin receptor mRNA and protein levels, increased glucose intolerance, and increased fat accumulation in peripheral tissue and liver (p < 0.05 for all). Hfe knockout mice fed an ID exhibited no difference in total fat or liver fat levels compared with WT mice receiving ID. In contrast, Hfe knockout mice fed the IOD had reduced peripheral fat and fat accumulation in the liver compared with WT mice fed an IOD (p < 0.05 for both). Furthermore, Hfe knockout mice displayed reduced cytokine mRNA expression in the liver, increased insulin receptor substrate-1 serine phosphorylation, and enhanced insulin-stimulated glucose transport into the skeletal muscle compared with WT mice fed an IOD (p < 0.05 for all). In contrast, gene expression of the iron-regulatory protein hepcidin was upregulated in tissue of Hfe knockout mice receiving the IOD (p < 0.05). Higher dietary iron promoted insulin resistance and fat accumulation in both Hfe knockout and WT mice. Dietary iron overload also upregulated hepatic hepcidin and downregulated insulin signaling and glucose transport in skeletal muscle in both Hfe knockout and WT mice (p < 0.05 for all). In the absence of HFE, higher dietary iron"

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
The goal of this clinical trial is to learn about the effect of yoga-based breathing styles on the human brain regarding memory performance in adult persons without relevant prior experience in yoga, meditation or similar disciplines and without existing health problems which could hinder the performance of the breathing exercises. The main questions it aims to answer are: Is there an improve of memory performance through performing the controlled yoga-based breathing styles ? Is there a relevant reduction of the subjective stress level through performing the controlled yoga-based breathing styles Participants will complete a memory test while performing controlled nasal and oral breathing. They will complete a two-week training period after the test with daily nasal or mouth breathing training or no training at all, depending on the group assignment. Researchers will compare the nasal breathing group to the mouth breathing and the comparison group to see if the nasal breathing results in a significant improvement of the memory capacity.

 <EOD> Drug release from a floating tablet based on HPMC-P127 mixture: Effect of tablet size.
HPMC-P127 (HPMCH, P127CH, HPMCP127) 99.9 : 0.1 mixture was used as the core material of a floating tablet formulation. The influence of tablet size on drug release from floating tablets was investigated. The release of ibuprofen from HPMCP127, HPMCH, and P127CH tablets after 24 h was 32.9, 48.1, and 60.1%, respectively. The release from HPMCP127 and HPMCH tablets decreased with decreasing tablet size, while that from P127CH tablets increased. The drug release from HPMCP127 and HPMCH tablets after 48 and 72 h was faster than that after 24 h; however, the drug release from P127CH tablets after 1 h was slower than that after 24 h. The different influences of tablet size on the drug release of HPMCP127, HPMCH, and P127CH might have been caused by the different deaggregation behaviors of these tablets. HPMCP127 and HPMCH tablets of small size can float and disintegrate rapidly, and thus the drug release rate for the initial 2 h was higher for these tablets than that for the larger size tablets, resulting in a faster drug release after 48 and 72 h. The release of ibuprofen from HPMCP127 tablets of a certain size is dependent on ibuprofen concentrations in the tablet. High ibuprofen concentrations resulted in faster drug release. <EOD> .
OBJECTIVES
We determined the predictive value of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) before neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) and CEA response after NACT for overall response rate (ORR), disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).


STUDY DESIGN
In this retrospective study, we included 119 patients. Serum CEA, carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19.9, cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels were measured before NACT treatment and during treatment. Statistical analysis was performed to correlate the CEA changes according to the treatment response, DFS and OS.


RESULTS
The mean age was 53.3±12.0 years. Mean carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19.9, cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels were 40.3±8.1 kU/L, 1134.3±921.1 kU/L, > 5 ng/mL, respectively. 71.4% of patients achieved PR or CR after NACT. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CA 19.9 for evaluating response to NACT were found as 18.6%, 80.7%, 33.3%, 51.1%, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of CA 19.9 after to NACT were found as 67.0%, 89.1%, 92.8%, 52.9%, respectively. At multivariate analysis with the disease-free survival the only significant risk factor is the pre-treatment CEA, which is higher than 2.5 ng/mL (HR=0.045, p=0.028). In overall survival analysis of univariate Cox regression model CA 19.9 > 37 U/mL and CA 125 > 35kU/L before receiving NACT and CA 19.9 >100 U/L after NACT as predictive factors, but CA 19.9 and CA 125 levels before NACT, and CA 125 > 35.0 kU/L after NACT have higher hazard ratio in multivariate Cox regression model. The CEA value after NACT is not associated with survival. ROC curve analysis could not demonstrate that the pre-treatment CA 1"

Efficient delivery of biologically active proteins (BAP) holds significant potential in the treatment of a number of diseases and clinical conditions. However, the delivery of many BAP is hindered by the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of the drug molecule, as well as the degradation of the protein to other components which may also be biologically active. With this in mind, the development and synthesis of biomaterials, specifically hyaluronic acid (HA)-derived materials such as low molecular weight HA, HA-based nanoparticles and crosslinked HA hydrogels, have been employed as effective delivery systems for BAP in the treatment of tissue damage, cancer, osteoporosis, and inflammation. This review therefore aims to survey the current literature on the use of HA-based biomaterials for the delivery of BAP including recombinant human growth hormone, interferon-beta, anti-TNF-α, and interleukins, with a focus on their therapeutic and biological impacts. Moreover, we will examine the advantages and limitations of HA-based materials as BAP carriers, in order to develop new and improved systems for future therapeutic applications.

 <EOD> Examining a novel measure of cognitive capacity: Dual task performance during simulated flight in military personnel
Military training requires highly developed cognitive, physical and multi-tasking skills in order to maintain operational capacity. Cognitive capacity has not been assessed directly in military trainees performing a dual task such as that required for operational flight. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fatigue from prolonged cognitive loading on subsequent dual task flight performance in military trainees. Ten military trainees were subjected to a 90 minute cognitive load that caused fatigue, and then flight simulator dual task performance was measured. After this, a 5 minute rest period, following which flight simulator dual task performance was reassessed. A two-way ANOVA was used to compare the four conditions of this experiment (Time I Rest, Time I Fatigue and Time II Rest and Time II Fatigue). The results indicated a significant main effect of time (p  0.53). Military training programs for flight crews need to factor in how prolonged cognitive loading affects pilot performance during high-workload cognitive and physical challenges. <EOD> Hearing Aid Outcomes
Abstract Background: Hearing aids are the treatment of choice for adults with sensorineural hearing loss. The goal of this review is to assess the audiologic outcome of hearing aid use as measured by change in speech perception ability. Also discussed is the relationship between hearing aid adherence and audiologic outcomes. Method A literature search was conducted on May 4, 2015 using the search terms “Hearing Aids, Outcomes, Audiologic Effect.” The databases searched included: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, Excerpta Medica dataBASE, and PubMed. Reference lists were used to complete all searches. Level of Evidence: Level 3. Results: The articles reviewed were grouped into three main research questions: 1) How does hearing aid use by young children, teens, college students, and adults improve listening ability in everyday listening environments? 2) How does hearing aid fit quality influence change in speech perception? 3) How do specific features in hearing aids influence speech perception ability? The majority of questions were reviewed using low to moderate levels of evidence. The level of evidence of the articles reviewed was not always consistent. Conclusions: Most results indicate that hearing aids produce significant improvements in speech perception ability. There still remains a considerable amount of variability in these findings including a lack of consistency and inconsistent data from studies. Also, hearing aid research in certain target populations, such as children and the elderly, is lacking. <EOD> .

PURPOSE
To investigate the role of surface treatment methods on the bond strengths of two resin composites to zirconia.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fifty-six single crowns with different surface treatments were fabricated from ceramic blocks (n=20 each): GD group (machined with a diamond bur), CP group (air-abrasive treatment), SCP group (sandblasting with 120-silicon carbide ), and CPS group (sandblasting and 7% hydrofluoric acid etching) and divided into two subgroups: subgroups A and B included 20 specimens of each treatment group; subgroups C and D included 10 specimens of each treatment group in the ceramic resin adhesion test. All groups were tested under load control with a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm / min . The number of load cycles to failure was used to calculate the fracture strength in MPa. Bond strength data were analyzed with a linear mixed model.


RESULTS
The GD group exhibited the lowest mean value for the bond strength and the CPS group exhibited the highest one. There was statistically signigicant differences between the GD group and CP group (p = 0.027), and between the GD group and SCP group (p = 0.009) for subgroup A and between the GD group and SCP group (p = 0.039), and between the GD group and SCP group (p ≤ 0.001) for subgroup B.


CONCLUSION
The adhesion strength of zirconia to two resin composites was affected by the surface treatment methods. <EOD> Antisocial behaviour and violent crime in patients with Alzheimer's disease
Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is known to cause changes in behaviour that may result in patients exhibiting aggressive behaviours. However, there is conflicting evidence that patients with AD are at greater risk of exhibiting violent criminal and/or antisocial behaviours; some studies have found no increased risk. Method: Data from the Swedish National Patient Register (NPR) and the Multi-Generation Register (MGR) were extracted for 302 178 patients with AD and their 4 641 849 progeny. This was compared with the nationwide register of convicted crimes and convictions of violent, non-violent and all non-violent offences. Results: In patients with AD, 35% exhibited criminal behaviour with a focus on violent or murderous crimes (OR 1.06; 95% CI 1.03–1.10; p < 0.001), and a five-fold increased risk of violent offences was detected. Children of patients with AD had an increased risk of criminal conviction focussed on violent or murderous crimes (OR 0.61; 95% CI 0.60–0.63; p < 0.001). The risk of violent offences among the progeny of patients with AD was equal to the risk of such offences in the general population. Conclusions: This study suggests that behavioural changes in patients with AD may lead to increased criminal behaviour of the AD patient itself and in the progeny during the time of dementia diagnosis as well as after AD diagnosis. <EOD> The importance of measuring the relative potency of drugs in the development of antidote formulations of acetaminophen and acetylsalicyclic acid.

A Randomised Clinical Trial of the Effectiveness of a Proprioceptive With One of Eccentric Exercise Plus Acute Electrostimulation in the Eccentric Exercise Plus Acute Electrostimulation on the Weight Bearing Weight Bearing Lunge, Lateral Step Down and Drop Jump Tests in Drop Jump Test, in Professional Paddle Tennis Players.

Study Design
=================
A randomized controlled trial.


Participants
=================
Participants were 14 (age: 27.8 1.25 years; weight: 73.5 7.46 kg; height: 1.83 0.50 m) members of a padel team at 
1 level. The team comprised four male players and four female players.

Sample Size Calculation
=================
An a priori power analysis based on the reported minimum detectable change of 11 (2.7°) in the weight bearing lunge test was performed with a standard deviation of 6.56 degrees determined from the baseline data. Assuming an alpha value of 0.05 and a power of 80%, for the analysis a minimum sample size of 13 study participants was calculated.

Recruitment
=================
Participants were recruited from a padel team via a personal invitation letter from the team trainer. 

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria
=================
Participants of both gender who were 18 years or older were included in this study. To be eligible participants had to self-report their playing experience to be more than one year, and to report training on an at least monthly basis for more than two hours at a time per week. Exclusion criteria were (1) neurological history or clinical signs indicative of neurological problems, that may cause impairment in the performance of the exercises; (2) a traumatic or musculoskeletal history that may affect the performance of the exercise; (3) a previous history of ankle instability; (4) a foot or ankle condition that would interfere with the performance of the testing and functional exercises, as determined in the physical activity level screening from the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q); (5) the onset of an injury in the last three weeks, that required medical evaluation and a diagnosis, and (6) use of orthoses that may generate alterations in the result. 

Sample Size: 25 athletes, 5 in each group.

Randomization
=================
A randomized block design was used. Randomization was performed with a computer random number generator program. Blocking was performed on a single-elimination basis.

Group Assignment: Experimental: proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation technique (NNF) group. Active Control: eccentric exercise plus electrostimulation group (EE + ES). 

Experimental Design
=================
Each 
participant completed the study visits and evaluations in the following order: a) baseline measurements including the outcome measures and randomization; b) implementation with intervention; c) final measurements, which included outcomes and questionnaires.

Primary Outcome Measures: vertical jump (VJ); the weight bearing lunge (WBL); and the ankle joint range of motion. 

Vertical jump: the VJ test has been widely used as an indicator of speed, power, athletic performance and health conditions. The drop jump test will be performed as previously described by Drouin et al. 2003. 

For the VJ test, the participants will be instructed to perform three maximal effort vertical jumps on a height adjustable box, with the feet facing forward, hands on the hips and jumps taken from the highest point. Their hands must remain on their hips and be in contact with the box at each jump. An electronic 6 seconds chronometer will be activated and will record the jumps. The jumper will perform the best three jumps out of five consecutive jumps which are separated by 45 second rest intervals. Data are collected during these tests.

The measurement of ankle dorsiflexion range, will be taken using the weight bearing lunge test, which has been previously described. 

The participants will be instructed to stand on one leg with the"

Research

-----------------
The hypothesis to be tested is that Mediterranean Diet may be beneficial for the treatment of MDD in certain populations of patients, those presenting mild inflammatory biomarkers elevation. Considering that there is not an exact definition of the inflammatory pathways involved in depressive episodes the following inflammation biomarkers are considered adequate to be measured: C-Reactive Protein (CRP) and Interleukin-6 (IL-6)(27,28). The study will also evaluate a priori that adherence to MedDiet can be an effective intervention for MDD independently of biomarkers of inflammation.
Emerging data suggests that biomarkers of inflammation are associated with risk of depression and treatment response of MDD. A recent meta-analysis, by Köhler-Forsberg et al., has shown that elevated levels of pro-inflammatory biomarkers may be positively associated with depression (25). Other studies suggest an effect modification of anti-inflammatory biomarkers on the relationship between inflammation and depression. In a study of a Portuguese nationally representative sample, Machado et al., proposed a possible effect of anti-inflammatory biomarker on the relationship between inflammation and depression. The authors suggested that those with no-inflammatory-associated depression were less likely to have inflammatory diseases than those with proinflammatory associated depression (34). Also, a review of inflammatory biomarkers and depression, proposed by Yirmiya et al. has confirmed that inflammation is a significant risk factor for depression and also showed that the pro-inflammatory interleukin (IL)-6 may have a role as a mediator, explaining the relationship between inflammation and depression. However, the meta-analysis review did not assess the effect of anti-inflammatory biomarker (IL-10) on the association between inflammation and depression. Taking into account that this association is not currently fully demonstrated and considering that Mediterranean Diet is believed to have an antiinflammatory effect, it was hypothesized that people presenting a mild elevation of inflammatory biomarkers, such as CRP or IL-6, may benefit from MDD and the Mediterranean Diet (29).
To support the inflammation marker/Mediterranean Diet hypothesis, Vaitkeviciute et al. published an extensive systematic literature review that concluded that anti-inflammatory dietary patterns such as MedDiet, may be able to reduce levels of inflammation markers (CRP, IL-6), as well as depressive symptoms, in both depressed and healthy subjects (32). As a consequence a dietary intervention study on the same topic is justified.
There is increasing evidence showing higher rates of depression in individuals with elevated levels of CRP, suggesting a correlation between mild inflammation and depressive disorders (27,30). Some studies reported a role for interleukin-10 (IL-10) in predicting depression and in response of treatment for MDD. IL-10 was considered to be a protective factor in a depressed state (28). A study by showed that patients with IL-10 genetic mutation were more prone to depressive disorders than patients without IL-10 mutations. One more study by showed that the IL-10 gene -1082 A/C polymorphism might have a role in the response to treatment of MDD. There is also increasing evidence showing that people with elevated serum CRP levels have reduced responsiveness to antidepressant medication (25). Based on the above mentioned studies, it was also hypothesized that MedDiet may have a greater effect on improving MDD symptoms and responsiveness to treatment for MDD in people presenting elevated levels of CRP or IL-6.

OBJECTIVE
The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of tumor protein p53 (p53), protein encoded by human endogenous retrovirus type K (syncytin-1, SYN-1) and Ets-1.


METHODS
Expression of p53, SYN-1 and ETS-1 was examined on the 3-, 7-, 14-, and 21-day culture in 11, 22 and 33 human abortion deciduas by immunohistochemical staining.


RESULTS
Expression of p53, SYN-1 and Ets-1 gradually increased along with villus development, and the expression of p53 on the 3-day culture was higher than that on the same day in the other two groups. There was no detectable expression of p53 in any of the 21-day culture deciduas. No significant difference in the expression of p53 was found between the 21-day culture deciduas and the rest of the deciduas. The expression of SYN-1 and Ets-1 gradually increased along with villus development, significantly higher in the 14-day than that in the 3-, 7- and 21-day culture deciduas. In summary, expression of p53, SYN-1 and Ets-1 increased along with villus development.


CONCLUSION
Maintaining the development of villus may be the cause of increased expression of p53, SYN-1 and Ets-1. <EOD> A rare condition in a common place: a case report of a cervical osteopoikilosis, a rare condition in a common place

211,"[/INST] <EOD> Vagus nerve stimulation and cardiovascular reflexes in humans.
OBJECTIVE
To determine whether vagus nerve stimulation induces reflex baroreflex alterations, which may be similar or different than those induced by the pharmacological blockade of vagus nerve activity. Method. Twenty male normotensive volunteers with no history of cardiovascular diseases had their heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and neck muscle electromyogram (nEMG) registered. The stimuli were administered for 3 cycles of a 30-s stimulus (130 Hz) followed by a 60-s pause. The stimulus was turned off and on during the initial and the end cycles, respectively. The reflex response was analyzed by measuring the gain of the baroreflex and the gain of the heart rate and nEMG, and by using spectral analysis to determine the baroreflex-heart rate coupling, the nEMG low-to-high frequency ratio, and the Vagus_Vagus coupling.


RESULTS
We found that stimulating vagus nerve activity increased the parasympathetic influences over the heart and on the neck muscles. Furthermore, stimuli induced a slight decrease in baroreflex sensitivity, without altering the sympathetic modulation of the baroreflex. Spectral analysis showed that vagus stimulation enhanced vagal activity in normal subjects.


CONCLUSION
The authors conclude that vagus nerve electrical stimulation may increase the parasympathetic activity through the stimulation of nerve activity, rather than of the baroreflex. <EOD> A model for the analysis of the relationship between the immunogenicity and antigenicity of hepatitis C virus envelope glycoproteins and other viral proteins of the pestivirus family.

We have developed a model for the analysis of the relationship of the immunogenicity and antigenicity of proteins in vaccine trials to the selection of neutralizing antibodies after natural viral infection. The model is based on three immunological parameters: the cross-reactive neutralization (CRN) epitope content, the virus and immunoglobulin affinity constants and the concentrations of cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies before and after immunization with the vaccine strain of the virus to which the infectious challenge strain is closely related (the 'natural virus'). The model considers different degrees of genetic variation of the immunizing strain from the challenge strains (up to 100%) and of the challenge strain from the circulating strains (up to 10%). We first applied the model to predict the CRN antibody responses after natural infection or vaccination with a heterologous strain for the prototype virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). We focused on two parameters that influence the magnitude of the CRN antibody response after natural virus infection: the cross-reactive epitope content of the immunizing strain versus the challenge strains and the immunoglobulin affinity constant for the BVDV envelope glycoprotein (E2). This model predicted that a high cross-reactive epitope content of the vaccine strain and a high affinity constant of the immunoglobulin for the E2 would result in higher mean frequencies of CRN antibody responses, both after natural virus infection and after vaccination. By contrast, in the absence of a vaccine, only natural virus infection with high cross-reactive epitope content and high immunoglobulin affinity would induce high mean frequencies of CRN antibody responses. Next we applied our model to the analysis of the interference of recombinant E2 subunit vaccine-specific antibodies with the neutralizing activity in sera obtained either from infected cattle or from cows after natural immunization or vaccination, either from experiments performed in the United States and Japan or those simulated by using the predicted amino acid sequence of the E2 domains of the different BVDV strains from the United States. High affinity of the immunoglobulin for the E2 was inversely correlated with the reduction of neutralizing antibody responses in sera from animals infected with a heterologous strain. In contrast, the homologous virus neutralization activity in these sera was mainly dependent on the cross-reactive epitope content of the immunoglobulin. The model is applicable to recom"

It makes clear that we are talking about parents with Intellectual Disability (ID), Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and Asperger Syndrome (ASD). The summary states that this trial will assess the effectiveness of a Home-based Parenting Support Program - Parenting Young Children - for Parents With Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities When There is a Risk for Neglect. The summary states that the comparison intervention is what is typically offered by social services (Treatment as Usual).

Summary Comments
================================
The authors made an effort to highlight the key themes of the original trial. The summary puts the study in context with current literature. The description of the intervention program itself was succinct. While the study protocol states that the home-based program is ""three-six months of coaching sessions based on parent-child relationship and care safety"", the summary does not include the amount of contact (3-6 months) or the number of coaching sessions (based on parent-child relationship and care safety) per month.

Syringomyelia is a rare disease and is often asymptomatic. Pain in the thoracic region and numbness in the extremes may occur in some cases of syringomyelia. Scrub typhus also is a rare condition and is usually asymptomatic. However, in some cases, pain in the thoracic region and numbness in the extremes may be seen. Both syringomyelia and scrub typhus may cause thoracic scoliosis, leading to problems in gait and posture. A 39-year-old man presented with a pain in the thoracic region and numbness in the limbs over a 6-month period. He also complained of a pain in the thoracic region and shortness of breath on exertion. The patient was a farmer and resided in a rural area of Southern India. There was no history of fever or other disorders. The patient was evaluated clinically. Thoracolumbar X-ray showed an increase in thoracic kyphosis (45 degrees), a sharp decrease in thoracic lordosis (25 degrees), an increase in lumbar lordosis (70 degrees), and a scoliosis measuring 24 degrees. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an increase in the T1 signal in the spinal cord. The thoracic syringomielia was surgically decompressed. Over time, the patient had increased thoracic expansion without scoliosis, suggesting that improvement in breathing problems had helped reduce the syringomyelia.

 <EOD> The effects and costs of an intervention to promote breastfeeding duration.
Breastfeeding durations have stagnated in the last 10 years. To address the barriers to breastfeeding success and to promote longer lactation, the Michigan Department of Community Health created a comprehensive breastfeeding program. Program activities include a statewide campaign, professional education, marketing of breastfeeding equipment and supplies, and support and education for lactating women. Our intent was to determine if increased expenditure would be associated with decreased cost and an increase in breastfeeding duration. This analysis was conducted from the perspective of the payor using a case-control model. After identifying all deliveries at participating institutions in 1997 and 1998, we selected controls for each case and used a two-stage, conditional, matched, conditional logistic regression model to evaluate case and control factors that influenced continuation of breastfeeding. The final model included age, education, mode of delivery, and breastfeeding support as significant factors. Cases were more likely to continue breastfeeding than were the controls. The mean age for the cases was 25.5 years compared with 23.5 years for the controls. Fifty-eight percent of the cases had completed high school or obtained a general education degree compared with only 39 percent of the controls. The cases were more likely to have received breastfeeding support than were the controls, 14 percent compared with lesser and insignificant effects of mode of delivery and prepartum planning.

 <EOD> A study of the association between the expression of the estrogen receptor alpha and the risk of prostate cancer recurrence after radical prostatectomy
Objectives: Prostate cancer (PCa) develops mostly as an androgen-dependent disease through aberrant activation of the androgen receptor (AR). Despite this, estrogen receptor alpha (ERa) signaling is implicated as the main cause of hormone refractory or invasive PCa. Pre-existing estrogen receptor (ER) expression has been associated with a worse prognosis. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is an association between the expression of the ERa and the risk of recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP) in patients with PCa in the Korean population. Materials and Methods: The ERa expression in biopsy samples from 195 patients who underwent RPs from the years 2005 to 2009 at Seoul National University Hospital was analyzed using semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry. Results: We analyzed 135 patients whose recurrence-free survival (RFS) was longer than 4 years as a control group, 21 patients whose RFS was shorter than 4 years as a primary group, and 40 patients who developed biopsy-proven recurrence. In the primary group, ERa expression was significantly higher compared to the control group (40.9% vs. 22.6%). ERa expression was associated with a higher Gleason score and a shorter duration of RFS. In our study, ERa expression was significantly associated with recurrence after RP. Conclusion: Pre-RP expression of ERa may predict recurrence and shortened RFS after RP, and the possibility that ERa signaling is involved in the development of androgen-refractory PCa warrants further investigation. <EOD> A Novel Approach to Treat Masked Facial Pain Syndrome (Bell’s Palsy) in Child with Autism using Focused Neural Reversal (ReNeuron, London, UK)
Microinjection of mesenchymal stem cells has shown promise in the repair of injured white and grey structures of the central nervous system in both animal and human models (Bjorklund et al.). However, despite the excellent scientific evidence, the lack of efficacy and safety in clinical trial have raised the issue as to whether the technique is ready for clinical application. The paper by Tawil et al. was aimed to investigate the mechanisms whereby these neurons survived for a ≥ 5-year period without any immune rejection, graft rejection or tumorigenesis. The investigation demonstrated the neurons transplanted survived at the site of injection, continued to perform their functions, maintained their structural and ultrastructural integrity and contributed to the host dendritic network at the transplantation site in the central brain. The authors concluded that their findings highlight the potential of grafting-derived cellular neurons for both transplantation research and clinical application of neural grafting in human diseases. <EOD> In vivo visualization of β‐globin gene expression using transgenic zebrafish
Techniques exist such as in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry that provide qualitative images of gene expression, including that of the β‐globin gene, in histological sections of vertebrate animal tissue, for example, fish and mammals. Although histological sections offer high spatial resolution, the processing, sectioning, and interpretation of the sections present major challenges for high‐throughput analysis and quantification of gene expression levels. By using histological sections, it has proved difficult to accurately resolve the level of β‐globin gene expression in hematopoietic cell types with high infiltration of red blood cells and mature red blood cells within the circulation. To visualize transgenically expressed mRNA transcripts and protein, we generated transgenic zebrafish lines that can express a mb708GFP reporter construct under the control of a β‐globin enhancer. Live, adult zebrafish were imaged for green fluorescent protein (GFP) using confocal microscopy in order to detect gene expression in the whole organ and within a live organism. The use of GFP has great advantages compared to the conventional red fluorescent protein with the additional advantage that GFP fluorescence does not require infiltration, which can be problematic for"

] <EOD> Exome Sequencing Analysis Identifies Pathogenic Variants in Three Novel Genes Associated With Non-Syndromic Deafness in the Chinese Population

Non-syndromic hearing loss (NSHL) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder, and over 100 genes have been identified to cause NSHL. However, the genes and variants underlying NSHL are under-described in the Chinese population. This study aimed to investigate pathogenic variants associated with NSHL in the Chinese population. Exome sequencing was performed on five unrelated patients with NSHL, and three pathogenic variants in three novel genes were found by homozygosity mapping and genetic analysis. Pathogenic variants c.1241C>T (p.R414W) and c.1485G>A (p.G495S) were identified in SLC26A5. We confirmed that these variants (c.1241C>T,p.R414W and c.1485G>A,p.G495S) were associated with profound hearing loss by sanger sequencing in a cochlear auditory nerve pathway of patients. The c.657G>A (p.G220R) pathogenic variant was detected in CLCN1 (OMIM #605193) and was confirmed to be associated with mild to moderate NSHL by sequencing in the Chinese population. This study reported three novel pathogenic variants in three genes associated with NSHL, expanding the genetic spectrum of NSHL-related genes and variants in the Chinese population.

# Introduction
Hearing loss is the most common sensory impairment in the worldand is classified as conductive or sensorineural   Current Perspectives in the Molecular Pathology, Genetics, and Pathophysiology of Inner-Ear Defects..., Diebold  . Patients with non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss (NSHL) are the most common group with hearing loss.
NSHL refers to hearing loss involving both branches of the auditory nerve (Cochlear nerve, auditory path) that connects the ear to the brain   Genetic Testing in the Evaluation of Hearing Loss, Shearer  . NSHL is often identified in early childhood or during adolescence   Diagnostic Yield of Single-Gene Deafness Caused by Inherited Genetic Variants, Choung   , although some patients experience severe hearing loss until adulthood   Diagnostic Yield of Single-Gene Deafness Caused by Inherited Genetic Variants, Choung   or exhibit mild hearing loss without any special symptoms   Molecular Analysis of SMPX Gene in Nonsyndromic Hearing Loss Patients, Zeng  . It has been reported that approximately 50% of the familial deafness is caused by NSHL   Nonsyndromic Sensorineural Hearing Impairment: Unparalleled Genetic Diversity and Opportunities for Applied Genomics, Shearer   , whereas the etiology of NSHL is unknown in about 80% of patients. In particular, many genes of NSHL have been revealed in the last decades, whereas, only two causative variants (GJB2 and SLC26A4) were found to account for 80% of NSHL in the Chinese Han population.
Therefore, it is crucial to clarify the pathogenesis of NSHL to improve hearing rehabilitation.

OBJECTIVES
To analyze the clinical and therapeutic aspects of chronic spontaneoïd urticaria (CSU) in children, by means of a questionnaire administered to their physicians.


MATERIAL
and methods 396 children (from 5 to 20) with CSU, were enrolled in a French survey. There were 255 (64%) boys and 151(36%) girls with a mean age of 9.8 years (range 5-20 years). Their physicians completed a questionnaire describing the clinical and therapeutic aspects of CSU in children.


RESULTS
The diagnosis of CSU was made 2.9y (95% CI 2y-3.8y) after the first signs of the disease. 85% of the patients had at least one associated disease. The treatment used for the initial symptoms that were followed up by the physician was anti-allergic, anti-parasite and anti-infective. Anti-allergic (corticoïdes) treatments were prescribed in the form of oral corticoïdes to 22% of the patients.


DISCUSSION
Children with chronic spontaneous urticaria present a high frequency of associated diseases. In children, oral corticoïdes treatment is generally used as the initial treatment for CSU. <EOD> Fixed-time treatment of multinucleated cells with cis-platinium and etoposide: a novel approach to the problem of cell cycle synchronisation in tumour cells.
A model system for cell cycle synchronisation has been developed in multinucleate HL-60 cells. Cells were synchronised with Nocodazole and then harvested at 11.30 h. The cells were then dissociated into single nuclei and recombined with single nuclei from G2-M- or G1/S- phase synchronised cells. G2-M-phase recombination produced a cell population enriched for 2N1K cells, 43% of which expressed the G2-M-phase cell-cycle-specific marker C-mitoses. By contrast, G1/S-phase recombination produced a cell population with a very low frequency of C-mitoses, 7%. The synchronous induction of C-mitosis was dependent on the G2/M phase content of the starting cell population. The effects of the combination treatment of cells with cis-platinium (CDDP) and etoposide (VP16) on the synchronisation of HL-60 cells was also tested. There was a significantly greater induction of C-mitose in the CDDP-VP16-treated cultures: 71% in cultures synchronised with G2/M cells and 7% in cultures synchronised with G1/S cells. Combined treatment also produced a higher incidence of secondary necrosis in G1/S synchronised cultures (mean 25%) than in G2/M synchronised cultures (mean 8%). This may indicate that the enrichment in C-mitosis was partly a result of secondary necrosis, although there was no significant difference in the number of nuclei in mitosis between the CDDP-VP16-treated cell populations and the synchronous CDDP-VP16-treated cell populations. The results indicate a new method for cell cycle synchronesis which might prove useful in the study of cellular metabolism. <EOD> .

[clinical/trial] Behavioral Economic Strategies to Improve PRO Adherence Summary from [clinical/trial] Behavioral Economic Strategies to Improve PRO Adherence

[clinical/trial] Behavioral Economic Strategies to Improve PRO Adherence is a study aiming to optimize PRO monitoring implementation in outpatient oncology settings to mitigate disparities in access to symptom management. [clinical/trial] Behavioral Economic Strategies to Improve PRO Adherence will employ strategies to optimize clinician acceptance and engagement with PRO monitoring and to maximize PRO data capture. Specifically, [clinical/trial] Behavioral Economic Strategies to Improve PRO Adherence will use a novel technology implementation strategy to deliver weekly PROs via an electronic symptom assessment platform to patients initiating new lines of systemic cancer therapy. Patients in intervention arms 2 and 3 will additionally receive PRO monitoring plus alerts to proactively manage symptoms of patients reporting severe symptoms.

What happened?
------------------
The proposed study seeks to harness the power of clinician and patient behavioral economics principles to optimize PRO monitoring implementation in outpatient oncology settings.

When was it conducted?
---------------------
Research was initiated in January 2021 and is expected to conclude in December 2023.

Where was it done?
-----------------
[clinical/trial] Behavioral Economic Strategies to Improve PRO Adherence is a multi-site trial with sites in North and South Carolina representing a representative mix of urban and rural settings. The proposal also aims to engage 3 rural sites in North and South Carolina, 1 academic cancer center in Illinois, and 1 community cancer center in Texas.

Who was involved?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Partner sites are listed in the supplemental funding section.

Why?
--------------------
Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) are used to assess disease-specific symptoms, functional status, and quality of life in patients with cancer. PROs are critical to detect the onset of symptom burdens, which can guide adjustments to cancer treatment based on patient needs. However, studies have historically reported noninterventional clinician engagement with PROs, resulting in low rates of follow-up in response to alerts and low rates of symptom-driven clinical interventions. To address this issue, the proposed study leverages behavioral economic principles to improve adherence to electronic symptom monitoring as well as alert response rates in patients receiving new initiations of systemic cancer therapy.

What outcomes were studied?
------------------------
PRO adherence will be the primary outcome, with several secondary outcomes related to both patients and practitioners. Primary and secondary outcomes have been defined following a detailed discussion within the research team. The primary outcome of interest is the proportion of expected PRO questionnaires completed by patients. Secondary outcomes include time to first alert response, number of patients triggering an alert to a triage nurse based on questionnaire completion, percent of patient-level clinical visit notes with a note of any PRO as recorded by a practitioner, percent of patient-level clinical visits with a note of any PRO as recorded by a practitioner, patient-report of emergency department visits, and patient-report of hospitalizations.

Rationale for study?

 <EOD> Effects of oxygen uptake on the oxygen content of canine myocardium.
Previous investigations indicate that in an experimental heart-lung preparation the oxygen content of the myocardium will not increase to the same extent as that of the tissue blood or of the coronary venous blood after repeated increases in oxygen uptake. This appears to be due at least in part to a diffusion barrier in the myocardium which impedes a free outflow of the oxygen from the cells. The present experiments were designed to investigate the effect of other processes involved in myocardial oxygen utilization on the tissue oxygen content. Ouabain administration was found to increase the tissue oxygen content both in resting and in exercised dogs and to abolish the lag in increase of the tissue oxygen content in relation to the blood oxygen content occurring at the onset of exercise. The oxygen content in the myocardium also increases with augmentation of the arterial oxygen content, both by administration of oxygen, hemorrhage into the chest chamber, or by augmentation of venous return. The increased oxygen content of the myocardium found by administration of ouabain or by increased venous return is almost twice that found by increased arterial oxygen content. Also, the tissue oxygen content in the rested heart returns to its normal content more slowly than does the tissue oxygen content in the exercised heart. This indicates that metabolic processes in the heart may take part in impeding a free outflow of oxygen from myocardium. Metabolic acidosis, induced by lactate acid infusion, had no influence on the rate of oxygen accumulation in the myocardium. The results show that a combination of processes, including a diffusion barrier in the myocardium, metabolic processes, and anion transport, affects the myocardial oxygen content in man, in the dog, and in several other species. <EOD> Association of G6PD deficiency and GST genotypes in patients with acute ischemic heart disease.
BACKGROUND
Ischemic heart disease, a condition caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture, is one of the main causes of mortality in the western world. It is important to discover the factors that can predispose to atherosclerotic changes in the arteries. Recent evidence suggests that inflammation leads to activation of different signaling pathways that promote inflammatory cells migration and proliferation. In general, these pathways are mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS), that play a crucial role in cell signaling and cardiomyocyte death. ROS production is associated with pro-inflammatory gene expression and with the induction of matrix metalloproteinases, which degrade the vessel wall, generating plaque rupture. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency and Glutathione S transferase µ (GSTM1) genotypes have been associated with inflammation, with atherogenic phenotype and with cardiovascular disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the frequency of G6PD deficiency in subjects with acute ischemic heart disease.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
We studied 213 subjects with acute ischemic heart disease and 154 controls. G6PD deficiency was evaluated by rapid test. GSTM1 deletion was analyzed by multiplex endoprobe amplification, and the polymorphism was genotyped using ABI 7500 Real time PCR System.


RESULTS
We found an association of G6PD deficiency with acute ischemic heart disease (OR=2.05, CI=1.07-4.00, p=0.04). No significant differences were observed in GSTM1 genotype frequencies between acute ischemic heart disease and controls.


CONCLUSIONS
We demonstrated an increment in G6PD deficiency in patients with acute ischemic heart disease, in addition with a positive association in GSTM1 variants between these patients. We concluded that GSTM1 genotypes did not influence susceptibility to acute ischemic heart disease, and GSTM1 polymorphism has no predictive value. <EOD> The Differentiating Values between Patients with Noncardiac Chest Pain and Cardiac Chest Pain: A Structural Equation"

FDA News
-----------------
May 2013, US Food and Drug Administration
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given marketing authorization to two rapid tests to detect bacteria in blood samples from patients with suspected bloodstream infections.
The first test, the BACTEC™ Blood Culture System (BD, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey), is intended to be used along with standard blood culture techniques. Although it cannot be used to confirm the presence of a bacterial infection, this test may help speed diagnosis, which could benefit patients. Using automated technology, this test can detect the microbes in less than four hours compared to up to five days for standard blood cultures. This test is the first device in the United States to be cleared or approved to provide such an early indication of bacterial presence in blood samples.
The second device is T2Bacteria TM System Panel from T2 Biosystems Inc. (T2 Biosystems, Lexington, Massachusetts). It works with clinician-ordered blood cultures and provides results within 15 minutes compared to 36 to 40 hours for standard blood cultures. Once a positive blood culture is detected with T2 Biosystems' method, clinicians would be able to determine which type of bacterial infection a patient has and therefore better tailor treatment. The T2 Bacteria TM System Panel was approved for investigational use by the FDA in early 2013, when it was called the T2Candida TM System Panel.
However, neither of these products are intended to definitively confirm or diagnose the presence of bacterial infection.
Ever since the 1930s, culturing bacteria in blood samples has been one of the most common lab diagnostic tools in the U.S. For decades, most pathogens were grown in specialized media. But a new study tested a faster method of culturing that used 96-well plate systems originally designed for plant and genome research that used less fluid and required less processing time. This method helped save a large amount of time.
The studies showed that culturing bacteria at such high densities could cause these organisms to change their phenotype and the results obtained with the conventional technique could be different from these newer, high-volume techniques, FDA stated.
The FDA has approved both tests — which work on different principles — over other new-generation microbial detection methods in development — after evaluating the impact of these new tests on patient health, clinical practice, and laboratory practices.
Even though traditional culturing techniques and faster culture methods are widely used, many cases of presumed bloodstream infections are treated without confirming its presence with a bacterial test because of the turnaround time. Bacteria are often cultured at hospitals with more beds. At smaller rural hospitals and health clinics, this culturing step may not be available. Since rapid tests for bloodstream infections are limited, the new approvals by the FDA may potentially benefit an underserved population.
The approval of both devices came on the same day May 13, 2013."

 <EOD> Pyridoxine-responsive seizures in two adults
We report two adults with pyridoxine-responsive seizures. Both patients had intractable focal seizures with secondary generalization. The first presented at age 43. Initial antiepileptic drugs, including valproic acid, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, were ineffective. After several months of treatment, pyridoxine led to a marked reduction in seizure frequency. At age 45, he was treated with vigabatrin, and he subsequently became seizure-free. The second patient, who had been treated with carbamazepine for 6 years, presented at age 43. At age 47, valproic acid and levetiracetam were ineffective, and pyridoxine led to a decrease in seizure frequency. The patient became seizure-free at age 48, when phenytoin and levetiracetam were added to the antiepileptic drug regimen. Epileptic seizures in these patients did not improve with treatment with conventional antiepileptic drugs. Treatment with pyridoxine led to a marked reduction in seizure frequency. <EOD> An overview of the role of microRNA in colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment

Colorectal cancer(CRC) is one of the most malignant cancer diseases in the world. At present, the pathogenesis of CRC is still unclear, and the treatment effect is very poor. Therefore, it is of great urgency to elucidate the molecular mechanism of CRC and find drugs that can cure it more quickly and effectively. Over the years, microRNAs have been proven to play a crucial role in epigenetic regulation in CRC, and they can also serve as biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis of CRC, so this review aimed to comprehensively summarize the recent studies of microRNA in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of Colorectal cancer, hoping to provide useful information for researchers to better understand it.KEYWORDSColorectal cancer, mircoRNA, diagnosis, treatment, epigenetic regulation

The incidence of melanoma is rising worldwide, and the prognosis is poor once this aggressive type of cancer has metastasised. Although targeted therapies have improved the treatment outcome of melanoma patients, the effect is limited due to the development of resistance and the frequent toxicities. By contrast, the immune system can eradicate even disseminated tumours and therefore is the next line of attack against cancer cells. In this review, we provide an overview of immunotherapy strategies for the treatment of melanoma, focusing on the clinical development of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Moreover, cancer vaccines will be introduced as a promising approach that may synergise with immune checkpoint inhibitors. <EOD> Clinical utility of 99mTc-MDP bone marrow scintigraphy for quantifying disease activity in children with newly diagnosed acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL): A prospective trial
SummaryThe aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical utility of bone marrow (BM) scintigraphy at diagnosis in children with ALL. Twenty-nine subjects with newly diagnosed ALL were included in the study (mean age, 6.1 years; 18 were males). Technetium-99m-methylene diphosphonate (99mTc-MDP) scans were performed on two occasions. The clinical utility of 99mTc-MDP scans were assessed by comparing the results with the outcome of therapy. The mean leucocyte, haemoglobin and platelet values on the day of BM scan and 7 days after stem cell transplantation (SCT) were assessed for statistical significance in a 2 × 2 (patient group versus control group) analysis. Significant reduction was obtained with time in the platelet count (P= 0.008), whereas no such difference could be seen in the leucocyte (P= 0.709), haemoglobin (P= 0.613) and haematocrit (P= 0.419) values. The results indicate that the 99mTc-MDP scan can predict the outcome of patients with ALL and support that this method is applicable to the quantitative assessment of disease activity and efficacy of treatment in children with ALL. <EOD> The Association Between Cognitive Function and Depressive Symptoms in Old Adults: The Rural African Americans Study of Mental Health (R-AASMAH)
Depression and cognitive dysfunction disproportionately affect older adults and may share common neuropathological and environmental risk factors. To determine if poor cognitive function predicts later depression, we compared measures of current cognitive function with depression symptoms and past history of depression in 175 nondemented, 75+ years old rural African Americans. The Modified Mini-Mental State Examination (3MS) was administered during a routine clinical interview. The depressed group (n = 11) scored significantly lower on the 3MS than the nondepressed group (n = 164). Depressed subjects also had a significantly lower past history of antidepressant use and a significantly greater number of functional limitations. A lower performance on the 3MS was a significant predictor of depressive symptoms. These results suggest that impaired cognition is a predictor of depression symptoms. Future studies are needed to investigate the neuropsychological bases for these observations and their implications for clinical practice. <EOD> Development and Characterization of an Electrically-Assisted, Gripper-Type Haptic Interface Based Electromechanical Stimulation

The results of treatment of 147 cases of aneurysm of splenic artery, observed in Hospital das Clinicas de FMUSP during the period from 1958 to 1982, are reported. The cases, diagnosed with splenoportography, angiography or the aid of hemodynamic means were treated by splenectomy and proximal arterial ligature in 40 cases, embolization of the splenic branch of the splenic artery in 47 patients, the by exclusion of the splenic artery in 29 cases, the by exclusion and of the superior mesenteric artery in 13 cases, splenic resection in the post-transverse mesocolon in five patients and by surgical suture in one case. In five cases only were diagnostic and therapeutic procedures undertaken in only one session. Mortality was 2%. A late postoperative complication, which appeared in 40 patients was an eventual increase of the transaminase values, which, however, did not compromise the normal activity of the patient. The patients considered benefited from the definitive elimination of a condition which rendered them a high rate of infectious complications to which they were subjected prior to surgery. It was not possible to demonstrate a significant reduction of the number of septic episodes after embolization and of the arterial trunks or with the ligature of the splenic artery proximally to the aneurysm. It was possible in the cases treated in that manner and in those patients submitted to splenectomy and simultaneous proximal ligature of the branch of the splenic artery, to perform a better diagnosis of the vascular anatomy of the superior mesenteric artery and the collateral arterial flow to the spleen by means of ultrasound examination. Of these, in addition to the thrombotic occlusions of the afferent and efferent splenic branches, which were found in three cases, in 34 patients the splenoportograms and the angiographies showed a collateral flow of the splenic artery with anatomical varices of the superior mesenteric artery.

Trial: COMPARISON OF SECTIONAL MATRIX VERSUES CIRCUMSCERENTIAL MATRIX FOR RECONSTRUCTION OF PROXIMAL CONTACT IN CLASS 2 RESTORATIONS
Title: sectional versus circumferential matrix system for the restoration of proximal contact in class 2 cavities

# Introduction
Proximal contact is the most important element of clinical success of Class 2 restorations. Since the development of adhesive dentistry, it has been found to be better to use adhesive materials rather than direct restorative materials for Class 2 restorations. Thus, in addition to proximal walls, a substantial amount of cavities are prepared for Class 2 restorations. As a result, most of the direct class 2 restoration cavities are class 2 cavities. Class 2 cavities can cause more extensive loss of enamel and dentin than class 1 cavities. Consequently, maintaining the contact points of class 2 cavities becomes more difficult.The placement of a matrix band is used to place composite for the restoration of a class I cavity because the band provides a fixed reference point for the restoration. However, if a matrix band is not used to restore proximal cavities of class 2 restoration, the marginal adaptation of composite resin will be compromised and might fail as a result of poor proximal contact. Therefore, a matrix band is used to restore the proximal cavities for class 2 restoration in order to obtain the most accurate proximal contour. For sectional matrix band, the matrix band and matrix wedge are placed inside and outside between two teeth, respectively.For circumferential band, the circumferential band is placed to encircle the external aspect of the tooth, and it is secured with a retainer which makes circumferential matrix band more complicated. To date, circumferential matrix band has been the only available option to restore the proximal cavity of class 2 restoration. However, it is reported that the sectional matrix system is more effective for restoration of the proximal contact point than circumferential matrix system. To our knowledge, there are insufficient clinical trial reports comparing the sectional to circumferential matrix band for the restoration of proximal contact in class 2 restoration and the efficacy is not investigated. Therefore, the purpose of the present clinical trial compared sectional matrix and circumferential matrix system for the restoration of proximal contact in class 2 restorations.

# Methods
This was a split-mouth clinical trial. The subjects were allocated by randomized split-mouth design based on random number table into sectional group and circumferential matrix group for each patient. The sectional group consisted of 14 patients, and the circumferential matrix group consisted of 16 patients. All restorations were performed by the same operator, using the same class 2 cavities in each patient. All procedures were performed under local anesthesia and with rubber dam isolation. A preliminary occlusal rest was prepared by using 4mm round bur in both buccal and lingual surfaces. The teeth were thoroughly isolated with rubber dam and dentin margins were prepared to cavity depth. After caries extraction, an intracoronal restorative cavity was prepared for class II cavity preparation. All class 2 cavities were prepared for 3 mm in buccal and lingual width, 7mm in depth and 4 mm in axial wall height. The preparations were completed parallel to adjacent enamel. After cavity preparation, the sectional matrix was placed with dental wax. The sectional matrix was placed into the cavity and"

How is the study designed?
======================

The primary outcome will be change in psychotic symptoms over three months (i.e., based on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)   The positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) for schizophrenia, Kay  . The primary analysis will compare CaCBT and CulFI versus TAU in terms of change in the summed PANSS positive and negative sub-domain scores from baseline to the end of each time-period (that is, month 3, 6 and 12). For missing data on the primary outcome, an intention-to-treat approach will be adopted, where missing data will be imputed based on the participant's group allocation. The primary comparison will control for age and gender. Secondary outcomes include change in levels of functioning from baseline to end of treatment (primary outcome: PANSS; secondary outcome: GAF), quality of life (EQ-5L), cognition (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test, HVLT; Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised, HVLT-R), and self-reported recovery (S-Recovery; Self-Report of Quality of Life, SELQoL) and insight into illness (Schedule for Assessment of Insight, SIS) and psychiatric symptoms (PANSS, CAARMS, EPS, CGI); acceptability of intervention and service provision (Client Satisfaction Questionnaire); service use and cost of healthcare (Time Use Inventory & Client Services Receipt Inventory); and neurocognitive function (CAARMS and the HVLT). A mixed-methods approach to understanding the intervention's acceptability and implementation will take the form of structured interviews with carers and participants at 3 months, and service providers at the end of each of the 3-month study periods. A process evaluation will employ qualitative methods, combining observations of sessions, interviews and focus groups, with a view to evaluate the acceptability of the intervention and service, and the contextual factors that mediate intervention implementation, as well as to develop implementation strategies for the potential adoption of the interventions into service provision. Second-level outcomes in carers will be change in levels of carer well-being measured by the EQ-5D-5L, CARS, and the ECI. Second-level outcomes in health care professionals will be acceptability of intervention and service provision measured by structured interviews.

The trial will open 4 phases: Dose escalation (phase I 1), Dose finding (phase 1b), Phase 2 dose determination, Phase 2 dose expansion. The study has a 28-day dose escalation plan, where each dose of 1e8, 3e8 and 6e8 CAR T cells will be tested in the subsequent cohorts (n=3/dose, 1e8, 3e8, 6e8). After that, cohorts will be treated with the determined dose (dose escalation will be completed). During the ""dose-finding phase"" and ""phase II dose-expansion"", participants will receive CAR T cells in dose levels that will be determined from the phase I dose escalation and the 1-year outcome of the Phase I (dose finding phase). The primary objectives of the trial are to determine the recommended dose and dose escalation schedule, to evaluate the incidence and severity of adverse events and to determine MTD of IMPT-314.

Background Information Evidence (Rationale)
------------------------------------
Currently, one of the most common and challenging subtypes of lymphoma is the aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL); this aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtype is defined by DLBCL, which accounted for approximately 40000 cases in 2017 (3). DLBCL may show various clinical courses. It can relapse or be resistant to the standard treatment, such as the R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) treatment in patients with aggressive lymphoma (diffuse large b-cell lymphoma) (DLBCL) (4). DLBCL is among the various sub-groups of malignant NHL tumors in adults and accounts for approximately 25%-40% of all cases of malignant tumors of the lymphatic system (3). Due to its extremely high recurrence and death rates, it is critical to find an effective therapy for this disease (5). However, there are several different standard therapies available for DLBCL. For example, rituximab with CHOP (R-CHOP) has been widely implemented. The addition of rituximab to CHOP or CHOP-like chemotherapy has improved the prognosis of DLBCL  (6) and has shown positive outcome in patients with DL"
228,"[/INST] Your task is to create a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the provided clinical trial document. The summary should capture the key aspects of the trial.
The authors’ analysis consists of four stages which are described as follows.

1-Identify the primary objective or specific focus of the study.
As the title states, the proposed study’s focus is cognitive function and physical activity in middle-aged individuals diagnosed with metabolic syndrome.

2-Evaluate the study’s findings in light of what is already known.
Most studies have examined the cognitive function of populations with MetS without investigating the physiological factors associated with it in MetS patients. To the most recent of our knowledge, there are no studies comparing cognitive function with physical activity levels.

3-Analyze the findings from the study.
The study shows the participants to have impaired cognition and decreased physical performance.
It also indicates that there is a relationship between physical performance, cognitive function, and MetS. The study results have not been previously revealed in people with MetS. It is thought that cognitive function and physical performance can provide information about the development and progression of diseases. It has been reported that the risk of cognitive decline increases as the number of MetS components increases and MetS components can lead to future cognitive decline. Therefore, it is thought that physical performance can be a marker of cognitive impairment, and it can be used in the development of interventions in people with MetS who need additional care.
Physical performance can be an important marker for risk factors that may affect these patients such as cognitive performance, impaired metabolism, muscle dysfunction and dyslipidemia.

4-Consider the clinical and research implications of the results.
Further research is needed to develop physical performance and cognitive rehabilitation programs. These interventions can help individuals with MetS to prevent cognitive impairment.
To the most recent of our knowledge, no research has yet studied the relationship between cognitive function and physical function in MetS. Physical activity has the potential to enhance the quality and performance of life and the possibility of a better future.
Therefore, the proposed study’s focus, primary aim and scope of research suggest that the proposed study offers some value to the field. According to the results of the study, exercise planning and practice will be suggested for the population with MetS.

 <EOD> Diethylcarbamazine-Sulphadoxine/Pyrimethamine Combination Therapy is Non-Inferior to Primaquine Based Treatment in Elimination Phase of Visceral Leishmaniasis.
BACKGROUND
A six course regimen of diethylcarbamazine and prednisolone supplemented with four weeks treatment course of 25 mg of primaquine daily (DPC) has been standard in India as treatment regimen for kala azar for many years. However DPC treatment has got a lot of concern recently due to some toxicity which has made WHO to include sulphadoxine/pyrimethamine as optional treatment along with 2 dose of intramuscular sodium stibogluconate. In recent years non-folate regimen such as 20 mg of diethylcarbamazine on alternate day for 12 doses which is well tolerated, has been reported to be as effective as DPC treatment.


OBJECTIVE
To find a better alternative to standard treatment in elimination phase of VL and to compare the effectiveness of Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SDX-PM) with diethylcarbamazine and to find the better diethylcarbamazine alternatives.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A comparative, prospective, interventional, open label trial was conducted including 60 eligible enrolled to receive either of the alternative regimen of treatment during June 2014 to May 2018 at District hospital of Vaishali. The patients were followed up for 6 months to determine effectiveness of drug treatment by following the WHO defined criteria for cure with respect to treatment, parasitological cure, clinically cure and relapse.


RESULTS
In SDX-PM group, 100% parasitological cure (18 out of 18) and 11 out of 18 treatment cure was observed, whereas in DPC group, 7 out of 18 got parasitologically cured and 2 patients had treatment failure. Out of 18, 16 (88%) patients were followed up at 6 months for assessment of clinical outcome; among which 13 were found in complete remission and 3 had no symptoms of active kala azar and two patients had fever for unknown reasons.


CONCLUSION
In this study, DPC was found to be equally effective as SDX-PM (P=0.92) and better than DPC in terms of better tolerability. Though there was a difference of 4 days of treatment duration (SDX-PM has 4 weeks duration as compared to 6 weeks duration of DPC), the difference was not statistically significant and in terms of treatment failure 6 months after treatment, there was 33% higher failure in DPC. <EOD> .

Background: The goal of this study is to identify biologically derived phenotypes of patients suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). We aim at uncovering potentially distinctive differences in the genetic basis of phenotypes obtained from various clinical measures. This would provide more insights into the pathophysiology of complex disorders and open up new avenues for the diagnostics and treatment of patients.Methods:We have constructed three phenotype networks from clinical data from two independent samples. The networks are used to identify clusters of co-morbid patients and then a phenotype score function is used to cluster patients from a third independent sample. In total, we analyse 821 patients from an outpatient sample and 115 from an inpatient sample.Results:We show that the patient clusters are very significantly associated with symptom severity. This implies that there are biologically distinct patient groups, and not necessarily symptom severity, which drives the assignment of patients into clusters. By applying our method to the third independent sample, we were able to show that clusters of patients from each sample are very significantly overlapped. Furthermore, we investigate the overlap of our clusters with other diagnostic clusters such as Major Depressive Disorder or Schizophrenia. Interestingly, patients with OCD are very distinct from patients with other psychiatric disorders, implicating a high degree of specificity for patients with OCD.Conclusion:We provide strong evidence that there are biologically distinct patient groups within the diagnostic category of OCD. Thus, these analyses imply that there are subtypes of patients with OCD, and this conclusion is further supported by recent work in genetic studies.

# Background
There is currently much interest in the identification of underlying biological differences in patients with mental disorders because it may lead to novel diagnostically useful approaches. Recently, a number of such factors have been identified based on gene expression data . A different approach, which we employ here, is based on phenotypic markers. These markers are more amenable to assessment in everyday clinical settings. Examples of such markers are time-of-day of symptom onset and response to medications. Phenotype networks are mathematical abstractions of the complex interplay of a range of clinical markers in complex psychiatric disorders. Here we use the term 'phenotypes' in a colloquial sense, i.e. measurable attributes of an individual which are characteristic of the individual's pathological state. The underlying assumption is that by analysing the co-occurrence of different phenotypes in patients, one can obtain biologically relevant groupings of patients with psychiatric disorders. In other words, analyses of phenotype networks can be used to identify biologically derived phenotypes.
Using the multiple phenotype network model   Multiple phenotype networks: a new method for analyzing comorbidity of chronic diseases, Arora   , it should be possible to disentangle the complexity that arises from the co-occurrence of a large number of phenotypes in patients. The idea is to analyse a network in which phenotypes are represented by nodes (or vertices) and the interactions between them are represented by edges (or link, connecting the nodes). The co-occurrence of phenotypes in a patient is modeled by edge strength. Edges with higher strength are more frequently observed. We use this model to identify clusters of patients in which the interactions between various phenotypes is different. Thus, in a multiple phenotype network a cluster of patients (of size P > 1) of a particular phenotype is called a phenotype network module, denoted MPN M . The phenotype network modules can be thought of as sub-types with common, statistically significant, clinical characteristics. The number and size of these phenotype network modules (denoted K ) will determine the biological complexity of a psychiatric disorder. We use our approach to analyse patients suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD; DSM-IV).

# Methods
We analyse patients suffering from OCD using the multiple phenotype network model   Multiple phenotype networks: a new method for analyzing comorbidity of chronic diseases, Arora  .

Epstein-Barr virus-associated malignancies are frequent in immune-compromised patients and in immunocompetent patients who are EBV-seronegative but with a recent primary infection. In vitro neutralization studies have revealed a high proportion of antibodies to EBNA-1 and EBNA-6 and a minor portion of antibodies to VCA and EA. Immunizing with a recombinant adenovirus expressing EBNA-1 or the entire EBNA-1 gene has been found to induce production of antibodies against EBNA-1, EBNA-6 and the viral capsid antigen. An ELISA was established to quantitate the EBV-reactive antibody titer of recombinant adenovirus-immunized volunteers. <EOD> A New Synthesis-Based Approach to 20 Hz EEG Phase Synchronization for the Assessment of Epileptic Foci
Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based phase synchronization has recently been proposed as an alternative to phase locking of evoked or induced responses as a marker for epileptic foci. However, the quantification of phase synchronization from short-channel scalp EEG time series remains an unsolved research subject, both for the assessment of physiological and pathological synchronization. The aim of this work was the development of a new method to quantify synchronization from scalp EEG based on phase differences between synchronous segments. Methods: The method is based on the analysis of a synthetic signal, comprising all the possible channel combinations from short-channel synchronous epochs. For each channel pair, a synthetic signal is obtained by multiplying the two original signals. From that, differences between subsequent synthetic signals are calculated. The values of these differences are then averaged over all channel pairs, which creates a reference matrix of synchronization between all channels in the synthetic signal. The matrix may then be compared with the average synchronization of a given EEG time series to quantify synchronization. Results: The validity of the approach was tested by simulating epileptic synchronization between two pairs of EEG channels with different intensities, and in 18 EEG time series from seven patients with pharmacologically verifiable extratemporal seizures. Conclusion: The method appears to represent a promising novel approach to quantify synchronization from scalp EEG and potentially useful as a possible alternative to phase locking of evoked/induced responses for the localization of epileptic foci. Significance: The method constitutes a novel approach to quantifying synchronization in EEG. <EOD> Genetic and environmental influences on the relationship between emotional insecurity, interpersonal perceptions, and affect in youth.
The interpersonal model of mood and anxiety suggests that the interplay between emotional insecurity and interpersonal perceptions of the self, others, and the relationship promotes the emergence of negative affect. However, whether insecure attachment is a specific risk factor for negative affect, or whether it interacts with perceptions in the same way as secure attachment, is a current debate. This study aimed to clarify the link between emotional insecurity and negative affect in the context of perceptions of the self, others, and the relationship. A community sample of 548 adolescents aged 13- to 14-year of age (52% males) and their mothers completed measures of emotional insecurity, interpersonal perceptions, and affect at home. The authors adopted a multiple informant design with self-reports for perceived interpersonal perceptions and affect. Mother-infant interactions during play also were observed to assess children's attachment behaviors. Analyses were conducted using the biometric method for twin studies. These revealed that emotional insecurity, self-image perceptions, and mood were influenced by both genetic and nonshared environmental factors, with nonshared environmental factors predominantly driving these traits. Interpersonal perceptions appeared to be mostly influenced by shared environmental factors, and the emotional insecurity-affect link was driven by nonshared environmental factors. These findings suggest that some aspects of emotional insecurity and interpersonal perceptions have unique developmental pathways. Furthermore, the association between emotional insecurity and negative affect is predominantly nonfamilial and nonshared. This supports"

 <EOD> Effect of Different Doses of Oral Metronidazole on Precision of Root Canal Working Length Determination in the Presence of Severe Vertical Proximal Bone Loss Using Periapical Film and Root ZX Electronic Apex Locator: An In Vitro Study.
AIM
This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different doses of oral metronidazole on determining the working length of the root canal system in the presence of severe vertical periodontal bone loss using periapical radiography and the Root ZX electronic apex locator (RZX).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mesiobuccal and distobuccal roots of 90 extracted human maxillary first premolars were selected and classified into a control group (Groups C1 and C2), a metronidazole 250-mg group (Groups 1 and 2), and a metronidazole 500-mg group (Groups 3 and 4). Each group included 15 teeth. For the groups in the experimental groups (2, 3, and 4), metronidazole tablets were crushed and suspended in normal saline with a concentration of 250 and 500 mg/mL. Before the experiment, intact specimens in all groups were radiographed using high-quality 3M Kodak UltraSpeed E speed films with the periapical film holder. The radiographic image of each specimen was digitized and scanned at a resolution of 150 dpi using a Mitsubishi Scanner J558DPT. The radiographic images were transferred to the digital computer program; the electronic dimension was measured and recorded as the working length. The same procedure was repeated 45 min after metronidazole administration. All experimental procedures were repeated three times by two independent observers, i.e., the intra- and interobserver variations. Data were analyzed by Friedman, Kruskal-Wallis, and Wilcoxon tests.


RESULTS
The mean working length (RL ± SEM) was greater in Groups 3 and 4 than other groups. However, according to Wilcoxon results, the working length of the mesiobuccal root of Group 4 (5.83 ± 0.094) was significantly different from the other groups; the difference between Groups 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 2 and 3 was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). The mean working length (RL ± SEM) was greater in Groups 3 and 4 than in the other groups. However, there was no significant difference in working length between Groups 3 and 4 with respect to the other groups.


CONCLUSION
The results of this study showed that using metronidazole had no significant effect on the differences of RL.


CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
This study is limited to in vitro study. Further in vivo studies are needed to evaluate the root canal working length in the presence of metronidazole. <EOD> Oxygen Transport during Reperfusion by Blood Substitute
In an animal model of transfusion, 105 rats were subjected to 2 h of ischemia, 5 h of normothermic resuscitation, and 24 h of observation. Rats assigned to a blood-substitute (BIOLIFE®) group were oxyhemoglobinized with 100 mL BIOLIFE. By contrast, rats assigned to the control group were treated with Ringer's lactate. Hemodynamics improved within 1 h when treated with BIOLIFE. Hemoglobin levels, however, increased with BIOLIFE but not with Ringer's lactate. Oxygen delivery to tissues was comparable in both groups. However, in hemodynamic reperfusion, the BIOLIFE group had higher oxygen extraction than the control group. When the animals were observed for 24 h, their survival was 80% for BIOLIFE-treated rats and 67% for the control group. During the reperfusion period, the BIOLIFE group had higher mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, total oxygen delivery,"

a b s t r a c tThe present study was undertaken to examine the efficacy and mechanism underlying the activation of pulmonary CD8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes triggered by intranasal Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) infection. We infected male C57BL/6 mice with Fn, and assessed the number of CD8 + T lymphocytes and tumor suppression of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). To determine whether Fn infusion could activate tumor-killer CD8 + T cells, C57BL/6 mice were subcutaneously co-injected with Fn together with lung cancer cells for five days a week. We also examined the expression of co-stimulatory molecules on the surface of lung cancer cells, and Fn infection. The percentage of lung cancer cells expressing the co-stimulatory molecules CD40, CD80, and CD86 was increased. We also confirmed that tumor-killer CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes were significantly increased in the pulmonary lymph nodes, and peritoneal cavity in the Fn-infected mice compared to the mock-infected group. Finally, we confirmed our hypothesis that the increased number of tumor-associated CD8 + T lymphocytes in the peritoneal cavity could be transferred to another group of mice without lung cancer cells. Taken together, these results suggest that intranasal Fn infection could be used to elucidate the mechanism of CD8 + T cells activation as a powerful adjuvant, with a strong immune response of lung cancer cells to facilitate the development of a novel lung cancer treatment.

Input Text: Horyzons: Implementation and Integration in Clinical Practice

Study Overview
=================
[/INST] PURPOSE: The primary objective is to assess barriers and facilitators of integrating Horyzons, an evidencebased digital intervention, in outpatient mental health clinics in North Carolina that provide care to individuals with schizophrenia spectrum and other unspecified psychotic disorders. The primary aim is to evaluate and identify the unique barriers and facilitators in implementing Horyzons at each first episode psychosis (FEP) clinic as part of standard care and distinct implementation strategies. The secondary and tertiary aims are to evaluate client engagement with Horyzons and attrition as part of clinical care and assess the change in clients’ psychological measures across in addition to their use of state-funded services (e.g., emergency department and social services) across the 12-month intervention. Participants will be recruited to participate for a total of up to 13 months. Provider participants will be recruited through a single site. Clients will be recruited via their respective clinics from four sites.



[/INST] ABRUPT LINE TO NEW PARAGRAPH: SITE DESCRIPTION AT SINGLE SITE: Elmhurst Hospital Center (EHC) was founded in 1948 and is the largest safety net hospital in New York City. It is a 453bed public health system hospital with inpatient and outpatient care for all age groups. EHC provides a broad spectrum of services in outpatient mental health clinics and serves the diverse population of the Queens borough (New York, U.S.).


SITE DESCRIPTION AT THE FOUR COMPARISON SITES: The FEP clinics, which are supported by the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (NC DHHS), provide outpatient care and have been in operation for approximately 28 years. Each clinic utilizes three care management team members who are licensed clinical social workers to provide clinical and community-based care to adults 18-35 years of age that have been diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum or other unspecified psychotic disorders. Clients are seen by one clinician monthly to review medications, goals, and progress. Sites include three mental health clinics in Forsyth County (referred to for clarity as site A, B, and C), a suburb of Winston-Salem located in the Piedmont Triad Area; and Encompass Health Services (referred to as site E) in Raleigh, NC, situated in the North Carolina capitol area and surrounding communities.

Horyzons is implemented in clinics providing services to individuals in the early stage of psychotic illness in North Carolina. Participants in the Horyzons study are a representative sample of FEP clients that are referred to the clinic by various referral sources. In terms of location, the four comparison sites are located in large urban areas or city regions in different geographical locations and with various cultural makeups. All four of the comparison sites provide free or very low-cost services to all clients that qualify.

The main objective, to adapt and implement a technology-enabled evidence-based digital health intervention in outpatient mental health clinics across four sites with a diverse population in North Carolina to assess its adoption and implementation success at five different stages, was designed to assess the use and effectiveness of a therapeutic digital platform (Horyzons). The platform includes a moderated social media function, where users can connect and communicate through their accounts or posts on various topics, which include those about treatment, medication, and recovery. Horyzons utilizes therapeutic content and peer support for recovery, socialization, and connection with peer users in a moderated online therapeutic community through therapeutic content, user interaction, and peer connection. Users can personalize their profiles, interact with peers with similar concerns by commenting on posts available on the Horyzons platform, which encompasses therapeutic content and recovery support. As part of the Horyzons application (app), participants are also able to track their well-being. They are alerted to the availability of different resources, such"

Sigmund Freud developed a clinical treatment method for children that was later known as transference-focused psychotherapy. According to this method, the therapist focuses the analysis on understanding unconscious conflicts regarding attachment relationships. This method is characterized by emphasizing the importance of uncovering the emotional and motivational significance associated with the relationship with the patient. Transference-focused psychotherapy with children has demonstrated efficacy and usefulness, as well as specific training and supervision. It may be considered a treatment method for working with disturbed children and adolescents, and a first attempt at exploring transference and the therapeutic relationship with children. <EOD> The effects of omeprazole alone or combined with rebamipide in the management of reflux esophagitis: A triple‐blind comparative study

Background. Despite advances in the treatment of injuries sustained through neurotrauma, there remains impairment of upper limb function long term. Research has demonstrated exercise to improve outcomes in this population, but no consensus exists about what exercises should be performed. Objectives. To investigate, in a randomized controlled trial pilot study, the efficacy of an interactive exercise program undertaken by members of the stroke/brain injury community in their own homes. Method. Twenty-eight people with a neurotrauma diagnosis were allocated into 2 groups. Group 1 (intervention group, 16 participants) participated in an interactive exercise program twice weekly. Group 2 (control group, 12 participants) did not receive a specific exercise program. Both groups received a set of exercises as part of usual care. Results. The exercise program was well accepted. There were significant and clinically important improvements (over standardized outcome measures) in participation in group 1. Conclusions. Participation in interactive upper limb rehabilitation can significantly improve functional performance in people with neurotrauma, particularly participation and recreation. These measures are important in this population, and the program is both effective and acceptable to most participants. <EOD> The Relation Between Self-Reported Sexual Abuser Victimization and Psychopathology: A Comparison of College Students
ABSTRACT This study examined the relation between self-reported history of sexual abuser victimization and psychopathology. Undergraduate students (N = 331) who reported that they had ever been physically victimized by an intimate, as well as non-intimate, abuser, were divided into the following categories: (a) polyvictims: reported physical victimization from a family member, intimate partner, or stranger/acquaintance, or (b) nonpolyvictims. Psychopathology was self-reported through the Structure Clinical Inventory–2 as a total, internalizing and externalizing score. Results indicated that polyvictims scored significantly higher than nonpolyvictims on total and internalizing disorders, but not externalizing disorders. The results were discussed in relation to gender, race, and other variables, such as substance use and depressive symptoms, that have been related to increased polyvictimization. <EOD> Interferon β inhibits the angiogenesis-dependent progression of canine cutaneous mast cell tumor with vascular endothelial growth factor receptor expression

Objectives: To investigate the significance of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (hnRNP K) in laryngeal carcinoma cell migration, tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, and apoptosis. Furthermore, to demonstrate whether the expression of hnRNP K is correlated with the expression levels of p16, p21, cyclin D1, Ki-67, p-p53, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, and VEGF. Methods: Human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) cell lines (Hep-2, NPC-KT) and normal human laryngeal epithelial cell line 6-10B were studied by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting (WB), and immunohistochemistry. Results: RT-PCR analysis showed that hnRNP K mRNA levels in HEP 2, NPC-KT cells were significantly higher than those in 6-10B normal laryngeal cells. WB assay indicated that protein levels of hnRNP K in Hep-2 and NPC-KT cells were significantly higher than those normal cells. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated that hnRNP K was upregulated in laryngeal carcinoma and correlated with the cell migration, tumor cell proliferation, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Conclusion: hnRNP K might play an important role in the development of laryngeal carcinoma through modulating migration, proliferation and apoptosis of tumor cells. <EOD> P060 PHYSIO‐CENTROMERE LIST AS AN AID AGAIN SEASONAL BLOODSPOT
Abstract i) Background. Bloodspots are routinely used to determine the immunological age of an elephant, but, being a very expensive test, it is performed in only a few Asian countries. The aim of the present study is to make a first attempt to standardize the age estimation procedure with a particular focus on the Asian elephants. ii) Aim. The paper has the double intent of comparing the ages that two methods, based on either bloodspots or on bone samples, predict to Asian and African elephants and to create a database of physiocentromeres in Asian elephants, useful for predicting age from blood samples. iii) Methods. A database of physiocentromeres in Asian elephants was created, comprising about one hundred samples (bone- and blood-based) at different age. The list of physiocentromeres has been compiled from the published literature (18 samples). iii) Result and conclusion. In order to test the age determination procedure we used 18 samples from African and 10 from Asian elephants. The age of elephants based on bone physiocentromeres was concordant with age prediction based on bloodspots, using the same protocol and parameters that were already used for African elephants, with a marginal difference of 0.4 years. Further studies are underway aimed at including more physiocentromeres, in order to create a reference list that could be used in addition to bloodspots to age Asian elephants. <EOD> Gastric Involvement in Crohn's Disease: an Unexpected Surgical Emergency

This is a summarization of the clinical trial: [273]
To evaluate the effect of diosmin supplementation on delayed-onset muscle soreness (DOMS).
DOMS is a common phenomenon characterized by delayed pain at muscle tissue after a single contraction bout. The authors hypothesized that diosmin supplementation would accelerate the recovery of muscle performance, reduce pain, and improve the stability of the body during postural balance.
The sample for this clinical trial was recruited from the community with women. The experimental and control groups were randomly created.
All included participants performed the intense dynamic exercise protocol consisting of sets of bilateral, concentric and eccentric contractions of hamstring muscles. The participants followed the exercises under the supervision of a qualified instructor before and after the exercise protocol. The exercises consisted of six sets, with an initial intensity of 70% of 1RM and gradually increasing 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35-70% of 1RM.
Clinical signs, blood and urine samples were collected at baseline, 24, and 48 hours. The authors measured the following outcomes: DOMS evaluated through a visual analogue scale (0-10); muscle strength via MVIC test; vertical jump height; body balance. The MVIC test consisted of subjects performing the maximum vertical force they could possibly apply using the quadriceps femoris 3x with a 1 minute resting period between trials. This test was repeated 3x with body fixed on a chair with the knees at 90 degrees, the hands resting at the waist level, and the feet placed on the floor. A 15-cm diameter force platform was used to capture force measurements during the test. Subjects were asked to pull themselves 100 cm as rapidly as possible after the signal to start was given. They were given a visual display for instantaneous visual feedback. The subjects were asked to pull up their bodies as quickly and as powerfully as possible. Body balance was measured as AP and ML displacement velocities. Body balance results were collected three times at each moment and the average value was used in the final assessment. The AP and ML displacement velocities were evaluated by a balance board and balance assessment was done by research staff with 5-10 years of experience.
The results of this study demonstrate that the use of diosmin can improve post-exercise recovery of muscle performance, pain, and body balance. Further studies are needed to confirm the results in males and investigate the exact mechanism.

The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate and compare the value of mammary color Doppler Sonography and magnetic resonance imaging in mammary cancer. The investigation was performed in a period of 12 months on group of 209 women with palpation- and mammography- findings indicating a lesion in at least one of the two breasts. We used linear echo-color Doppler mammography with a GE LOGIQ 700, 3.5--7.5 MHz linear (ranges from 3.5--7.5 MHz); T1 weighted T2 weighted Fast Spin Echo in axial and sagittal T1 weighted T2 weighted FSE Turbo Spin Echo in axial and coronal scans. In this study we made a comparison between the two investigations of diagnosis of mammary infiltration of the following findings: the breast mass, calcified mass, breast density, ductal and ductal calcifications, cysts, mammary edema, fat infiltration, fat necrosis, vascular tumor, and benign infiltration. The two investigations demonstrated in 132 mammary infiltration- 73 benign, and 59 malign infiltration, the comparison between the two investigations show an agreement of 94.7% positive and the value of kappa for the comparison was 0.947 (p = 0.000--95% confidence interval) when comparing the mammary color Doppler and magnetic resonance imaging in malign mammary infiltration. <EOD> The role of adipose tissue in energy balance: implications for the management of obesity and metabolic disease
Purpose of reviewAdipose tissue has emerged as a key endocrine organ in metabolic regulation. Fat cells play a unique role in energy homeostasis by the regulation of adipokines secretion, free fatty acid metabolism and inflammation. It is increasingly clear that adipose tissue remodeling and loss of adipose tissue function has severe implications in human metabolic health. In this review, we summarize recent findings on adipose tissue remodeling and secretory potential in human obesity and metabolic disease. Recent findingsThe adipocyte remodeling with age and stress factors plays a role in the development and severity of metabolic dysfunction. In a metabolic stressed state, adipose tissues can remodel their lipid metabolism causing fatty liver disease and hepatic insulin resistance. Adipose tissue dysfunction is the key driver of diabetic and cardiovascular complications. Weight loss results in severe adipose tissue remodeling which requires time to reverse or repair. Reversing the adipose tissue dysfunction may therefore prevent the development of severe metabolic complications. Recent research on"

 <EOD> The Association of RV Size With Severity of MR From the Mitral Apparatus After BAV Procedures
(1) Background: Mitral regurgitation results in adverse remodeling of the right heart in left-sided valve disease. Valve-related severity of mitral regurgitation has not been widely analyzed for the mitral apparatus–only severity. (2) Methods: Consecutive patients with mitral regurgitation related to bicuspid aortic valve undergoing transcatheter or surgical valve replacement were analyzed. 3D volumes of the right ventricle and right atrium from routine transesophageal echocardiography were measured. (3) Results: 189 patients were analyzed. Of the 145 (76.9%) patients with severe mitral regurgitation, 34 (20.0%) had an unrestricted endovascular landing zone for transcatheter mitral valve implantation to exclude residual severe mitral regurgitation. There was a significant positive correlation between the volume of the right ventricle and severe baseline mitral regurgitation (r = 0.477), a moderate negative correlation between the right ventricle with severe mitral regurgitation persisting after the procedure (r = −0.433), and a significant negative correlation with the increase in the severity of mitral regurgitation in the follow-up (r = −0.399). (4) Conclusion: An enlarged right ventricle is associated with severity of bicuspid aortic valve–related mitral regurgitation. <EOD> Evaluation of B-mode ultrasonography in diagnosing renal masses in horses.
Ultrasound scans were made on the kidneys of 13 horses. Renal masses were present in 3; these were confirmed by necropsy examination. The location of masses within the kidney could be accurately determined with the help of contrast studies using contrast medium. It is suggested that B-mode ultrasound is a valuable aid in diagnosing renal masses. <EOD> Assessment of Vibrations Generated by a Dental Unit.

Aim: To evaluate the magnitude of horizontal vibrations generated by a dental unit. Subjects and Methods: The measurements were performed with an accelerometer on a tripod placed on a flat, vertical surface of a chair, in the same position as the dentist's hands during a routine dental procedure. The horizontal vibration was evaluated in 5 positions around 90°, 270°, 180°, 0° and 60° on the chair. Results: The dentist's hand rested closest to the chair seat, when sitting to perform a tooth extraction and 270°, the unit was the farthest during a tooth cleaning and 90° the unit was located furthest in dentist's sitting during a clinical examination. The vibrations measured were of low intensity and the unit generated vibration within the tolerance limit of 3 and 4. Conclusion: Horizontal vibrations generated by the dental unit is considered safe, with a good acceptance because there are vibrations above limit established by the Brazilian Association of Medical Engineering.

A randomized controlled pilot study will be conducted to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a Nordic walking (NW) intervention to improve balance, strength, and physical function in older adults at risk of falling. Forty community-dwelling older adults with a high fear of falling (Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I) score ≥ 24) will be recruited and randomly assigned to either an NW group(10-week supervised and unsupervised NW intervention) or a control group (phone calls). The intervention group will receive supervised NW sessions and will be coached to practice independently; the control group will receive regular phone calls to discuss healthy lifestyle habits. Data collection will include baseline characteristics, recruitment rates, adherence, and physical function tests (tUG, 4SST, FES-I, FAF-Q). Intervention: This study focuses on the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a Nordic Walking (NW) intervention on balance control, strength, and physical function in community-dwelling older adults who were at risk of falling. The NW intervention was conducted over 10 weeks and consisted of 20 hours of supervised and unsupervised sessions, which were tailored according to the participants' individual needs. The intervention was based on the principles of functional training, where the participants were asked to complete various tasks that emphasized balance, strength, and movement control. The Nordic walking session incorporated both aerobic and strength training. All participants in the experimental group received guidance from experienced NW coaches, who developed a personalized program for each participant. The coaches were professionals with years of expertise in the field and had completed a certified training program. The control group received unsupervised exercise programs that aimed to enhance balance and strength. Participants in this group received weekly phone calls from the study's graduate research assistant. Over the course of the 10 weeks, the study investigators conducted weekly check-ins with the participants to monitor safety and encourage compliance. Additionally, participants in the control group received a series of phone calls from the study coordinators, who were responsible for asking about the participants' safety (in terms of falls) and encouraging compliance with the exercise program. Experimental Group: Participants in the Nordic walking (NW) group received 50 minutes of supervised NW training in a group setting, as well as unsupervised training. This group performed 20 hours of training over ten weeks, starting with an 8-week supervised phase and transitioning into a four-week unsupervised phase. During the 8-week supervised phase, the participants attended 5 one-hour group sessions per week at a convenient location, such as a park or sports field. The NW training involved a combination of static and dynamic activities, which allowed the participants to benefit from the movement's varied and repetitive muscle contractions. To begin each of these ten 8-week week supervised meetings, the participants were instructed to walk for 10 minutes using Nordic walking poles. They were asked to keep their stride, pace, and posture consistent, while focusing on the proper use of their arms and upper body while walking. The use of Nordic walking poles helps improve body posture and balance, particularly in older adults who may be frail. Additionally, Nordic walking allows practitioners and novices to practice and improve their mobility and posture without the need for a gym or specialized equipment. After the 10-minute stride, participants could choose to either walk a laughing trail (approximately 32 kilometers in length) or complete some strength exercises. The trail is divided into four main sections: (i) The first section was used only for Nordic walking and walking; the participants were instructed to walk with their poles. (ii) The second section was used for walking and strength exercises; the participants were instructed to use their Nordic walking poles for strength exercises such as push-ups and planks performed on their poles. (iii) The third section was for strength exercises only; the participants were instructed to perform strength exercises such as push-ups and planks without Nordic walking poles. (iv) lastly, the fourth section was for Nordic walking only; the participants were instructed to use their Nordic walking poles. This allowed the participants to train their muscles differently by focusing on either endurance or strength. After completing the laughing trail, the participants could walk freely for 20 minutes, focusing on"

 <EOD> Influence of age and sex on the risk of COVID-19 infection, hospital admission and mortality: a population-based cohort study

 
  •: We aimed to assess whether sex or age influenced infection and hospitalisation risk for COVID-19 by analysing data from all 5.3 million residents on the Isle of Wight. There is an inverse relationship between infection and hospitalisation rate with age and a direct relationship between infection and hospitalisation rate and sex.  
 <EOD> A retrospective survey of the utilization of medical genetic services in a university hospital.
Based on information from a retrospective survey of medical genetic cases at a teaching hospital in New York City, we describe utilization patterns and the types of cases diagnosed. 1). A total of 12,220 different patients (or specimens) were seen at the Hospital Medical Genetics Service over the five year period from July 1, 1963 through June 30, 1968. 2). The cases were classified into eight distinct categories, i.e., clinically abnormal newborn infants, prenatal cases, childhood and adult cases of clinical genetic diseases, children and adults with psychiatrically and behaviorally abnormal, family and reproductive cases, genetic counseling cases, and specimen/procedure cases; this last category comprised 25% of the total number of cases seen. Cases were subdivided into 55 different categories by type of clinical abnormality or type of psychosocial problem, such as mental retardation. 3). Only 18% of all cases were seen for counseling, but 43% for psychiatrically and behaviorally abnormal problems. Other groups ranged from 18 to 8% (for clinically abnormal newborn to 11%. A surprising 25% of the total cases were for specimen testing or for other procedures such as electroencephalograms, blood group types, or blood group incompatibility. Only 11% were seen for family or reproductive problems. 4). The frequency of the case categories was as follows: clinically abnormal newborn infants 3% of cases; prenatal cases 31%; psychiatrically and behaviorally abnormal children and patients 29%; childhood and adult cases of clinical genetic diseases 8%; children and adults with psychiatrically and behaviorally abnormal 6%; family and reproductive cases 9% of cases; and cases for specimen or procedures were 25% 5). This information could be useful to other hospitals in the planning of medical genetic services for their patients. This information is important because the major changes in the utilization patterns in the last five years have occurred because of the increase in number of clinically abnormal newborns seen and in cases of prenatal diagnosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) <EOD> Drug release from chitosan-based hydrogels.
One approach to preventing or controlling infections in the eye, ear, nose, or skin is the local delivery of therapeutic drugs to these locations. While several controlled, local delivery systems are currently available, new delivery systems which are either less invasive, more effective, and/or are able to deliver multiple drugs are constantly being sought after. This review looks at chitosan-based drug delivery systems as a means to release antimicrobial, anticancer, anti-inflammatory, anesthetic, and ocular agents. <EOD> The effect of posture on left ventricular ejection fraction in the elderly

Background: Left ventricular systolic performance often deteriorates in the elderly. Many of these elderly individuals spend a great amount of time in the supine position, which could affect the ejection fraction. This study evaluates the effects of posture on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in elderly community-dwellers. Methods: A population-based cohort of community-dwelling elderly volunteers (age ≥65 years) was recruited. All participants underwent an echocardiographic examination in the sitting, sup"

 <EOD> Changes in adipose tissue distribution during weight gain in a group with increased insulin sensitivity in comparison to a group with normal insulin sensitivity.
OBJECTIVES
We sought to determine whether the association of insulin sensitivity with changes in the distribution of adipose tissue during weight gain is evident also when the two groups are analyzed separately according to their initial insulin sensitivity.


RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
A group with low insulin sensitivity (IS(low)) and a group with normal insulin sensitivity (IS(norm)) was studied during 750 kcal (3,187 kJ) energy restriction. Fat, fat-free mass (FFM), and free fatty acids (FFA) decrements and increases in total and regional adipose tissue volume were measured by computed tomography. Both groups were compared after 2 wk (14% weight reduction) and again after 12 wk of further weight reduction (21% weight reduction). In one series (wk 2), the IS(low) group was compared with the IS(norm) group after reaching isoinsulinemic conditions with the use of glucose potentiating insulin, whereas in a second series (wk 12), the IS(low) group was compared with the IS(norm) group after a 50-min insulin clamp.


RESULTS
The IS(low) group gained almost exclusively visceral fat, whereas the IS(norm) group gained almost exclusively subcutaneous fat. Consequently, at wk 12, the IS(norm) group had not only lost more fat than the IS(low) group but had also increased FFM substantially more than the IS(low) group (6.0 vs. 0.2 kg, P = 0.007).


CONCLUSIONS
The results suggest that 1) the distribution of fat depots is not determined by the initial insulin sensitivity level but by the relative decrease in fat mass, 2) that the relation between visceral fat and insulin sensitivity is determined by the net fat depot distribution, and 3) that a relatively increased visceral to subcutaneous fat depot ratio in response to hypocaloric dieting is a normal phenomenon in a proportion of women of otherwise normal weight. <EOD> Porphyromonas gingivalis Fimbrial Antigen-specific Systemic Immunity in a Rat Model
We previously demonstrated that FimA fimbriae of Porphyromonas gingivalis were involved in induction of systemic immunity in rats. In this study, we further examined the distribution of specific systemic immunity to FimA by using rat tissues and the FimA fimbrial antigens. In a previous study, we confirmed specific antibodies against FimA in serum in rats immunized by different routes. In the present study, we investigated FimA-specific systemic immunity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from lymphocyte-depleted spleens, whole blood, and peripheral blood monocytes by flow cytometry in rat models. Antigen-specific antibodies in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells were significantly higher in a group immunized orally with FimA compared with a group immunized orally with whole bacterial cells. Antigen-specific antibodies in the whole blood of rats immunized by oral or intranasal routes with FimA were significantly higher"

Study of SEPIOLA™ Safety and Performance in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation

(Trial Overview 2. BRIEF DESCRIPTION (maximum of 110 words) — Please edit to fit)

Atrial fibrillation has a negative impact on quality of life, physical activity level and exertional capacity. It is associated with an increased risk to develop cardio embolic complications such as stroke, systemic thromboembolism or peripheral emboli. Treatment of the disease consists mostly on anticoagulation and lifestyle changes.

However, many AF patients do not benefit from oral anticoagulation, or cannot receive due to complication from this treatment, and it is often undergone in spite of an appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to chronic oral anticoagulants or to avoid these consequences. This can be a serious issue when these patients suffer from AF.

Summary of the study plan: [ <EOD> Genome-wide analysis of the Lactobacillus helveticus transcriptome in cheese matrix during a 60-day incubation period.
Lactobacillus helveticus is a lactic acid bacterium with interesting biotechnological applications in the dairy industry and is considered to be of great importance in the ripening of Swiss-type cheeses. However, our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the adaptation of this bacterium to the cheese environment is limited. Here, we used RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) to explore the global transcriptional profiles of L. helveticus MNC01 and L. helveticus R0052 at three sampling stages (day 0, 30, and 60) during cheese ripening. Through comparative RNA-seq analysis, a collection of 232 genes that were differentially regulated in both strains were revealed. These genes were categorized into five groups: (1) genes positively regulated (2) genes positively regulated with an increase in expression during cheese ripening; (3) genes not significantly regulated; (4) genes negatively regulated, and (5) genes negatively regulated with a decrease in expression during cheese ripening. The gene expression analysis led to the following conclusions: (1) adaptation of the cell to survive in the hostile conditions of the cheese matrix is mediated by a series of regulatory genes and pathways, and the two compared strains exhibit differential regulatory pathways, and (2) the biosynthesis and secretion of proteins that confer dairy-specific characteristics is the main feature responsible for the increased cheese-ripening properties attributed to the L. helveticus R0052 strain as compared to L. helveticus MNC01. A novel classification system for transporters, based on transcriptomic analysis, was established, and its application to a comparative transcriptome analysis allowed the identification of a specific transporter system that is probably involved in galactose transport and metabolism. This study enhances our understanding of the physiological adaptation of L. helveticus to milk cheese environments and the subsequent development of specific phenotypic properties. <EOD> A rare cause of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in the elderly.
A middle-aged (44 years) male presented with black stools associated with recurrent hematemesis. He had a history of 20 years of alcohol intake. The patient was hemodynamically stable as he had taken the usual alcohol. However, the following day, he came with hematemesis of more than 750 mL and was hemodynamically stabilized. He was admitted to hospital for further management. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen were ordered. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed a large antral ulcer with pyloric narrowing and bleeding oozing from the ulcer. The CT findings were an ulcer of maximum transverse diameter 3.2 cm in the distal body of the stomach; the ulcer appeared to be the cause of a moderate hemoperitoneum (Figure 1). The patient was started on intravenous proton pump inhibitors and an octreotide infusion was started and continued over the next 72 h with no additional bleeding. The patient recovered after 3 days without any complications. The patient was readmitted after 70 days due to massive bleeding from a Mallory Weiss tear. There was no history of alcohol consumption. Patchy areas of recent infarction of the descending colon were seen at the abdomen ultrasonography. The patient was stabilized and was operated on after 3 days of readmission. In the laparotomy, there was significant bleeding from the lower transverse colon. There was a large pseudoaneurysm arising from the marginal branch of the colonic artery. The bleeding was controlled by a suture in the pseudoaneurysm. The colon was resected, and the colostomy inlet was performed. Colonoscopic examination of a lower endoscope had demonstrated normal findings. His postoperative course was uneventful, and he was discharged after 10 days of hospitalization. The colon specimen had revealed nonspecific ulcer (Figure 2). There were no evidence of malignancy. <EOD> Clinical use of CSF/A"

Input Text: Application of Chromosomal Instability in Early Diagnosis of Biliary Tract Carcinoma

Study Overview
__________________

Detailed Description
_______________
Biliary tract carcinoma account for about 3% of all digestive system tumors, with potential high metastasis and invasion ability. Their early clinical symptoms lack specificity, and they are often found in late stage with poor prognosis. CIN results from errors in chromosome segregation during mitosis, leading to structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities. It will generate genomic heterogeneity that acts as a substrate for natural selection. Furthermore, it is proved that tumors with aneuploidies and polyploidy resulting from whole-genome doubling are related with metastasis, treatment resistance, and decreased overall survival. It is estimated that 60%-80% of human tumors exhibit chromosomal abnormalities suggestive of CIN. CIN positively correlates with tumor stage and is enriched in relapsed as well as metastatic tumor specimens. Due to the ubiquity of CIN in cancer cells, it is a potentially way to detect CIN in the cast-off cells from the bile samples for diagnosing and monitoring biliary tract carcinoma patients. BileCAD is a new method to detecting CIN in the DNA sample from patients, including extracting DNA from bile, analyzing DNA by low-coverage whole-genome sequencing, processing the data by bio-information techniques, and finally optimizing the management of biliary tract carcinoma patients.The investigators intended to conduct a prospective study by analyzing bile samples from gallbladder cancers and cholangiocarcinoma patients and control groups that without any tumor in the Bile duct and gallbladder or other organs to compare the specificity and sensitivity of BileCAD test for diagnosing biliary tract carcinoma to other modalities, such as pathological diagnosis. At the same time, the consistency of BileCAD microbial analysis results and clinical microbial culture results was compared, so as to <EOD> A case of acute respiratory distress syndrome related to COVID-19 infection during pregnancy: the role of lymphopenia on viral infection-related ARDS?

AIM
To investigate the relationship between expression of ATR-PKC fused gene and the resistance and relapse of acute myelocytic leukemia (AML) after treatment in vitro.


METHODS
Expression of ATR-PKC fused gene was detected in leukemia cells of 19 AML patients by RT-PCR, the correlation between expression of ATR-PKC gene and relapse, sensitivity to chemotherapy was analyzed.


RESULTS
Expression of ATR-PKC gene in blastic cells of the relapsed cases was obviously higher than expression in the non-relapsing patients . The expression of ATR-PKC gene in sensitive group was obviously lower than in resisted group , the AML patients expression of ATR-PKC were high before chemotherapy and its expression obviously decreased after chemotherapy ; the difference of ATR-PKC expression in blastic cells of patients before chemotherapy (t=5.39, P=0.002); in blastic cells of patients before chemotherapy between 2 sensitive groups and 2 resisted group (t=8.35, P=0.001), in patients after chemotherapy there had no obviously difference of ATR-PKC expression (t=1.48, P=0.178).


CONCLUSION
Expression of ATR-PKC gene in AML cells was related with the relapse and chemotherapy resistance, it may become a sensitive indicator of AML patient's relapse and chemotherapy resistance, and had a good predictive function and important clinical significance for evaluating prognosis in AML patients. <EOD> .

Output text:
A digital tutorial (T) and digital training materials (TM) are being tested to increase engagement and feasibility and to better evaluate training. A video tutorial and digital training materials were prepared to teach professionals the key principles of the CRAFT approach. The digital CRAFT training consists of 10 modules which include videos, PowerPoints, manuals, webinars, and other materials. The participants are given the digital platform where they can download and use these materials. They are given two weeks to prepare for their telephone consultation, and then they can review the materials for another two weeks. If the participant uses the digital version of the platform, the participant will have access to materials for another eight weeks.

The TM CRAFT approach is tested in four conditions where a digital platform and materials are compared to the T CRAFT. It is known that CRAFT is a highly effective method to increase treatment entry and retention of someone with an opioid use disorder. However, a significant minority of the CRAFT counselors would have failed to engage a critical mass of their CSOs in treatment if they had used TRAIN CRAFT only. The goal of CRAFT CRAFT is to help the CSO to start to be engaged, which increases the rate of treatment entry. Therefore, there are two types of CRAFT methods, TRAIN CRAFT TM CRAFT. One condition provides access to a digital platform (platform), and this condition only gives access to the T tutorial. TRAIN CRAFT condition gives the same digital platform as TM CRAFT condition. However, the training materials are different. In the training materials condition (TM), the CRAFT intervention materials are prepared, but not distributed to the counselors. However, the T tutorial is given to the counselors. Additionally, the counselors have access to one-time telephone sessions where they can ask questions. The fourth condition (TMC) is the same as the TM condition, except the addition of providing training and coaching that focuses on improving the competence of counselors and enhancing the quality of CRAFT in their practice.


Conclusion
This digital CRAFT application may aid clinicians in increasing CRAFT interventions and treatment entry and retention with those with opioid use disorders, although, further research is needed to test the application's efficacy and acceptability.

# Differences
===============

- 	The digital platform looks better than in the original paper
- 	Intervention for TM - Training materials are digital compared to not being available.
- 	Intervention for TMC - The counselors receive further feedback and receive coaching about the application of CRAFT.

 <EOD> Association of Plasma miR‐34a, miR‐195, and miR‐497 with Recurrence and Metastasis of Oral Squamous Cell Carcinomas
miR‐34a, miR‐195, and miR‐497 have been found to be closely associated with the progression of several types of tumor. However, the correlation between the three miRs and the clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) have not been well investigated. <EOD> Interleukin 18 promotes neointimal formation by inducing CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cell survival and migration.
Oxidative stress plays an essential role in neointimal hyperplasia, an abnormal repair response after vascular injury. Despite the fact that interleukin 18 (IL-18) is a ubiquitous inflammatory cytokine that acts through multiple mechanisms to activate the human immune system, its role in neointimal hyperplasia is unclear. We hypothesize that IL-18 up-regulates cellular adhesion molecule expression, as well as inflammatory responses, leading to the development of neointimal hyperplasia. IL-18 treatment resulted in a significant increase of neointimal hyperplasia volume in injured rat carotid arteries compared with the IL-18-untreated animal. The inhibition of IL-18 protein synthesis using antisense oligonucleotide in vivo significantly attenuated neointimal hyperplasia formation. IL-18 stimulated cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human smooth muscle cells to secrete endothelin-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1. These effects were blocked by neutralization of IL-18 with antisense oligonucleotide. Moreover, we found that IL-18 decreased the number of apoptotic cells in the neointima. Blockage of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) signaling with a soluble TNFR2 receptor, or a neutralizing anti-TNFα antibody or a neutralizing anti-intercellular adhesion molecule-1 antibody significantly reduced IL-18-induced neointimal hyperplasia formation. Taken together, IL-18 is a strong proinflammatory cytokine involved in neointimal hyperplasia formation through the activation of endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and regulatory T cells (Tregs). These findings provide a new mechanism for IL-18 involvement in cardiovascular diseases associated with neointimal hyperplasia. <EOD> .
Renal failure is a leading cause of chronic uremic symptoms and death in the US population and of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in the world. About 125 million people in the world suffer from diabetes and one of the primary causes of nephropathies is diabetes. This article presents a review of the new aspects of the nephrotoxic action of glycated proteins. This review deals, in particular, with mechanisms of receptor-mediated action of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) on target cells, the role of different pathways in the course of the formation of AGEs, as well as the mechanisms of the renal accumulation of these substances. Also covered are the new data obtained on the mechanism of renal accumulation of glycosylated proteins and the influence of the accumulation of these substances on the development of CKD, focusing on the most recent results, as well as the new aspects of the formation and action of AGEs. <EOD> Enantio- and diastereospecific synthesis of tricyclic and tetracyclic 1,2,4-triazolopyridazine nucleoside analogues.

 <EOD> The relationship between the levels of salivary alkaline phosphatase (Alk-P) and the occurrence of dentin hypersensitivity (DH) in erosive patients: An ultrasound study
Objective: To assess whether there is an association between the presence of dentin hypersensitivity (DH) in erosive patients and salivary Alk-P. Methods: Saliva samples were collected from 82 adult volunteers presenting different oral health status. For evaluation of DH, visual and tactile tests were performed. For ultrasonic assessment, DH was diagnosed through the presence of sound signals at the threshold intensity level (ILT). Saliva samples were subjected to enzymatic assays to assess Alk-P and to estimate the saliva flow rate. Data were statistically analyzed by descriptive and inferential analyses. Results: The prevalence of DH in all the patients with erosion was 47.1%. From this group, the average value of the Alk-P expression rate was 22.1%, and the saliva flow rate was 97.3%. It was not detected a statistically significant difference (p>0.05) between the frequency of DH occurrence and the saliva level of Alk-P between both the groups (p>0.05). Conclusions: As expected, increased DH rates were obtained in the erosive group. However, the increase in Alk-P expression levels, related to DH occurrence, was not statistically significant. <EOD> .
BACKGROUND
The predatory mite Amblyseius swirskii, a parasite of mites, is widely used in biological control of pests and is also a natural enemy of Ephestia kuehniella eggs.


THE AIM
of this study was to test the efficacy of the parasitism of A. swirskii in controlling E. kuehniella eggs when this predatory mite is maintained on cotton leaf (Teliosema ammodendron).


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A. swirskii was released on the cotton leaf in the experimental field. The parasitism rates were 15.37%, 43.96%, 45.79%, and 45.33% three days, seven days, 14 days, and 21 days after introduction of the parasite mite respectively. The numbers of mites, eggs per plant and eggs hatched per plant were 47,505, 304.56 per plant, 54.79% in the treatment one, and 451.61%, 418.01% and 34.83% in the treatment two respectively. The numbers of eggs, eggs per plant, and eggs hatched per plant were 52,278.5, 512.68% 34.8% in the treatment two and 3.06%, 17.3%, 25.37% in the treatment one respectively.


CONCLUSION
A. swirskii could parasitize E. kuehniella eggs but this predation rate was low. This study demonstrated that the mite A. swirskii was a natural predator on E. kuehniella eggs. <EOD> Elevation of plasma lysophosphatidylcholines in early pregnancy of lean women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).
Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) represents a family of important phospholipids that have been implicated in a plethora of biological processes including immune function, endothelial homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. As polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is characterized by high rates of low-grade inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and dyslipidaemia, altered levels of plasma LPCs were evaluated in lean women with PCOS. Using a clinical cohort of lean women with PCOS (n = 24) and healthy controls (CON; n = 25), plasma LPCs that regulate pro- and anti-inflammatory signaling pathways at the transcriptional and functional levels were analyzed and compared to insulin, adiponectin, CRP, HOMA, and fasting lipids.

====================

Perturbation Training: Participants are exposed to unexpected mechanical disturbances administered to a treadmill that require a small but rapid step response to restore postural stability and avoid a fall. For those participants randomized to the training group this protocol will consist of 25 disturbances during the baseline visit and 210 disturbances the training block, with the total being 235 disturbances spread over 10 training days.

Treadmill Based Perturbation Training: 
Participants will be instructed to stand comfortably with feet at approximately hip width, on a split belt treadmill. They will be fitted with a safety harness. They will be instructed that the treadmill will move and that they should do whatever they can to maintain or regain their balance. A harness will be used as a safety precaution. During the next one minute, a tester will activate the treadmill. Two small surface translations (0.02 cm at roughly 0.22 m/s) will then be administered which will require several small forward directed steps to regain stability. These two small disturbances will provide a familiarization of how the treadmill works. Participants will be informed that they will receive 21 disturbances of larger magnitude. They will be instructed to do whatever you can to recovery [their] balance. On the next perturbation,the participant will receive a larger disturbance. Each sagittal plane training perturbation will consist of the treadmill accelerating to 1.25 m/s in 300 ms, maintaining a constant velocity for 170 ms, then decelerating to 0 m/s in 100 ms. Prior to the perturbation participants will be informed to recover their balance and continue walking for 5 seconds after the perturbation. The first disturbance constitutes the baseline test. The tester will then administer 20 more disturbances of the same magnitude. This constitutes the training protocol. A final perturbation will be administered. This constitutes the post-test assessment.

Study Overview:
Participants: One hundred and sixty-two participants undergoing unilateral total knee replacement (TKR) will be recruited. During the surgery, participants will be fit with a piezoelectric sensor that will be attached to the lateral femoral epicondyle. The sensor will be used to measure joint angle, joint reaction force, and tibiofemoral contact force. Additionally, participants will be outfitted with a small inertial measurement unit attached to the ankle that will be used to classify stance and swing (e.g. walking, running) and estimate the gait spatiotemporal parameters. Participants will be asked to wear an accelerometer for 7 days following hip replacement surgery. Following baseline testing, they will be randomized to the perturbation training intervention group or the education control group. Participants in the intervention group will receive perturbation training on a treadmill with no feedback.

Study Procedures:
Study procedures will be conducted at the Hospital for Special Surgery Clinic to minimize participant travel and scheduling constraints. A research assistant will meet with potential participants at their surgeon's preoperative visit. During this visit, participants will give their consent to participate in the study after they reviewed the informed consent document. Study personnel will confirm if they are the patient in the operating room, then the research assistant will review their eligibility, give a brief description of the study and the intervention, and answer any questions they may have.

Detailed Description
=================

1) General Study Overview
All study participants will sign an approval consent form prior to screening. A brief summary of the procedure follows.
Prospective, non-randomized, multicenter post market clinical follow-up study
Single-use of the investigational device

2) Screening and enrollment
If the study is intended to be conducted in all centers of the network, screening and enrollment are carried out in the following order:
Pre-screening telephone interview
Appointment of the initial visits and screening of patient (screening visit 1)
Initial approval and enrollment (patients)

Informed consent: Initial approval and enrollment of the patients (patients). This document requires the patient to be a study participant (s) at the time of initial approval and enrollment (patients).
- If multiple intraocular lenses are available and the patient is to be given a choice, then the following information must be stated on the patient information sheet: “The final choice of treatment with the available trifocal lenses lies purely and solely with the patient. In addition to the patient’s final decision, the treating surgeon will decide whether a particular trifocal lens is suitable in his patient based on the preoperative evaluation of the patient’s ophthalmic history, and his experience and expertise in IOL implantation, and other pre-operative data. For example, the range of vision for intermediate vision is between 80cm to 60cm.”


Dosage & Administration
-----------------
The IOL has to be implanted within both eyes as soon as possible after enrollment. Surgery can be performed on both eyes at the same session or at different sessions depending on the patient’s physical condition and the surgeon’s professional discretion. The minimum time interval between the 2 surgeries is two months to a maximum of 6 month and a half, as soon as the patient’s clinical condition permits. Each surgeon will determine the most convenient operating time. The study does not prescribe the order of the surgery or which eye gets operated first. However, patients who request and wish to be operated on at the same session, or patients who cannot tolerate a longer interval between surgeries, must be allowed to choose and undergo both surgeries at the same session. In the unlikely event that the patient is incapable of a second surgery, the IOL(s) may be implanted in one eye of their choice, however, they will not undergo any intervention on the second eye for the duration of the trial, and will not therefore be eligible for the final analysis of the trial, but may receive the regular medical treatments for cataracts they need and wish to.
The study investigational device consists of a 2D-trifocal intraocular lens (monofocal lens or IOL) designed for bilateral implantation. This is a singlepiece 1-piece 1-piece polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) IOL.


Demographics and Vital Signs \\\
Demographic (incl. date of birth, sex, height and weight) and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse) will be collected at four timepoints during the study (baseline, screening visit 2, month 3 and month 9).

History of present Illness & Past Medical History \\\
Participants must be able to perform the activities of daily living without difficulty. Patients must be able to communicate with the study center without difficulty. In addition, the patient’s visual acuity and other eye diseases must meet the specified criteria of the study and provide informed consent for participation in the study, they will provide complete visual data, medical history, and examination of both eyes and a complete physical and ocular exam will be performed. In addition, the following screening tests are necessary to exclude subjects who are not eligible for the study.

Besides this information, the following information must be obtained from the patients:
- Subject number and name of the subject (if known)

 <EOD> Pregnancy, post‐traumatic stress, anxiety, and depression in a community of severely traumatized Rwandan families: “They say to you you will die”

Background: The 1994 Rwandan genocide led to massive violence against families. Over thirty-five years later, many families still report trauma symptoms and poor mental health, a particularly urgent issue for pregnant women, but studies of Rwandan families are limited.Methods: A cross-sectional study involving 209 Rwandan partners/ mothers was conducted. Interpretative phenomenological analysis with an interpretational description framework was used to analyze semi-structured interviews.Results: Overwhelming fear of dying or being killed emerged as a prominent theme. Rwandans were concerned about not knowing the future or the future of their children and their loved ones' safety. Consequences were numerous, including decreased food intake, inability to plan for the future, and inability to take precautionary measures. Interpersonal triggers such as hearing stories about violence were particularly harmful. Depression and anxiety were also prevalent, including for pregnant women.

# | introduction
Rwanda was the stage for one of the most brutal intergenerational cycles of conflict and human rights violations in the history of humanity, culminating in the 1994 genocide, or Gacaca . Within 100 days, over 1/1000 of the Rwandan population died from this tragedy, primarily from murder but also from ""genocidal rape."" Between 1994 and 2000, over 600,000 Rwandans fled their country; thousands remain internally displaced, with a lack of land access, forced eviction, and internal displacement documented as the main causes for displacement. While there is a wealth of knowledge about the post-genocide Rwanda, there are limited data pertaining to family cohesion and interpersonal conflict, and the intergenerational and long-term consequences of the genocide. Studies examining the impact of the genocide are limited; therefore, this study examines this issue within an Rwandan community.
The genocide is also still present in the ""day-today"" lives of thousands of people in post-genocide Rwanda. Recent reports indicate that conflict-related post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms persist, with 89% exhibiting at least one symptom in 2004-17. Further, 4 .1% were diagnosed with anxiety in 2004 and 2017. Moreover, the genocide is still perpetrated by the Rwandan youth through hate campaigns in the media and school systems. To ensure Rwandans' mental health into the future, an examination of the current situation must be done, especially when children are involved.

# Introduction
Dementia is a complex syndrome characterised by the decline or loss of a cognitive process. The World Alzheimer Report has reported that there are 50 million people living with dementia globally. It is projected that this number will increase to over 100 million by 2050. People with dementia experience cognitive impairments such as communication change, altered social interaction and the development of disinhibition, agitation or aggression. Caring for people with dementia can be challenging and has a negative impact on carer's health and wellbeing. When dementia progresses, carers face many difficulties in maintaining patients' activities. One of the caregiving issues is care burden. Care burden is an excessive stress reaction that occurs when caregivers' demands exceed their internal and external resources. It is essential to assess care burden while developing and disseminating evidence-based interventions to prevent and manage caregiver burden.
Family carers play a significant role in the provision of physical and non-physical care to support people in their home after they diagnosed with dementia. The quality of this caring depends on the carer's resources which include social support, coping style and caregiving skills. However, care burden has a significant impact on caregivers' perceived quality of their care. For family carers, there were associated with depressive symptoms and poorer physical health. A longitudinal study revealed that higher caregiving burden had longitudinal impacts on physical health, depressionor mental health. As the majority of family carers are from older people, it is important to examine the impact of dementia on family caregivers. Therefore, reducing the burden of care is crucial, especially for older people as it has a severe impact on their quality of life (QoL).
To facilitate family carers and achieve the best quality of dementia care, care interventions are needed to address specific supportive and therapeutic needs, such as tailored support services from experts in dementia care, carers' needs and community resources. Family caregivers have expressed interest in accessing online programs or websites for dementia care. However, the current literature has not identified effective and cost-effective interventions for family carers of people living with dementia. There is an urgent need to increase knowledge on family carers' education, skills and support. Thus, the objectives of the present study are to conduct a scoping review by exploring the evidence on an intervention for family carers of people living with dementia based in the disease-targeted web-based intervention and to identify the components of an intervention that facilitates caregiver's well-being.

Abstract Acrylamide (ACR), a neurotoxin food-derived compound, has serious toxicity to central nervous system (CNS). Activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) is an induced transcription factor, which is associated with ACR induced neurotoxicity. However, the detailed mechanism is not well studied. In this study, the toxicity of ACR on glioblastoma cell line U251 and the toxicity regulatory mechanism were investigated. The U251 cells were incubated with ACR with different concentrations in the present study. Besides, the glutamate and nitric oxide (NO) levels in the supernatants were measured by HPLC analysis. The expression levels of the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor 1/2, P100, phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), and ATF3 were detected using a flow cytometry, Luminance analysis, and ELISA. The results show that ACR may induce U251 cytotoxicity after 24 h treatment. ACR induced neurotoxicity may be related with the activation of NMDAR, and NO and P100 may play an important role in ACR-mediated neurotoxicity. Also, ACR could induce the expression level of ATF3 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. ACR treatment decreased the cell viability and NO level in the U251 cells. Our study may suggest that NMDAR plays an important role in the ACR induced neurotoxicity. <EOD> Role in lipoprotein metabolism and oxidative stress of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 in primary cultures of human myotubes.
The 24-h effect of a physiological concentration (2 nM) of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3) on lipoprotein metabolism, oxidative stress and gene expression was studied in fully differentiated human primary culture myotubes. The 24-h treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 decreased the level of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and apolipoprotein E mRNA expression, decreased secretion of apolipoprotein A (apo-A4) protein and increased protein synthesis of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Apo B, apo CII and apo CIII mRNA showed a tendency towards decrease, though the differences were not statistically significant. The effect of the hormone depended on glucocorticoid availability, as the 24-h treatment with 250 nM dexamethasone completely abolished glucocorticoid receptor transcriptional activity. However, in the presence of glucocorticoids the effects of 1,25(OH)2D3 on gene expression were more potent and less transient than in its absence. The 24-h treatment with 1,25(OH)2D3 increased the concentration of reactive oxygen species (superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide), but did not alter the level of superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression and activity or oxidized products of low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) concentration. <EOD> Influence of the use of high-efficiency particulate air filters on microorganism levels and sick building syndrome symptoms.
The authors studied the effects of installing high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters in a high-rise office building with a problem of air pollution and elevated sick building syndrome (SBS) complaints. The filters were installed in each air supply outlet in every floor. The study used questionnaires as the method to gather the data analyzed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA). The results showed that the average airborne particle levels decreased significantly in every season. This showed the effectiveness of HEPA filters to clean indoor air. The SBS symptoms experienced by office workers also declined after filtration was installed, especially in January, May, and June. The decrease in the occurrence of symptoms also suggests the effectiveness of the installed"

Simple Summary: Primary brain tumors in dogs cause serious disorders and are not curable with therapy, unlike in humans, and there is not enough research on them. There is no clear treatment guideline for primary malignant or metastatic intra-abdominal/cranial brain tumors. Several studies report that immune-based therapy for brain tumors could be an efficient treatment modality and could enhance the effects of other therapy modalities. In this study, we found that the combination of intra-arterial chemotherapy and immune-modulating drugs (imatinib and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) has the ability to slow down tumor regrowth. However, we need to find other effective treatment combinations and strategies for dogs to overcome the challenges that brain tumors present.Abstract: Background: The current treatment options for malignant brain tumors in companion animals are limited. Primary malignant brain tumors in humans are resistant to chemotherapy or radiation therapy, and there is no curative treatment. Immunotherapy can provide a new perspective for the treatment of brain tumors and could improve the efficacy of traditional treatments by regulating the immune microenvironment. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of combined intra-arterial chemotherapy with immune-mediated therapy. Methods: We retrospectively examined 15 dogs with malignant brain tumors treated with four cycles of intra-arterial administration of paclitaxel combined with immunotherapy, and compared the survival rate with chemotherapy alone. Results: The difference in survival rate between immune-based therapy and chemotherapy alone was not significant (p = 0.0819). The survival rate of dogs administered both treatments was 33.3% (2/6) at 6 months. Based on the median tumor volume reduction rate, a positive correlation was observed between the survival rate and the tumor volume reduction rate. Conclusion: The effect of combined immunotherapy and intra-arterial chemotherapy on malignant glioma in dogs is controversial and the long-term effect and safety should be evaluated.

Comparison of Vaginal Axis on MRI in Alternative Apical Prolapse Surgeries to Sacrocolpopexy

Study Overview
=================


Detailed Description
-----------------
The objective pertains to the assessment of vaginal axis in patients undergoing apical prolapse surgery, whether they have undergone hysterectomy or not. This study is designed to investigate the hypothesis that the two surgical procedures involved in apical prolapse surgery with hysterectomy - Pectopexy and Lateral Suspension - achieve similar outcomes. Sacrocolpopexy is used as the control surgery. The outcome to be measured is vaginal axis on MRI.

Official Title
-----------------
Comparison of Vaginal Axis on MRI in Alternative Apical Prolapse Surgeries to Sacrocolpopexy


Conditions
=================

Pelvic Organ Prolapse


Intervention / Treatment
=================

Procedure: laparoscopic lateral suspension


Suspending the cervix to the bilateral abdominal wall through subperitoneal tunnels may properly mimic cardinal ligament and restore the normal vaginal axis. In this study patients underwent imaging preoperatively and postoperatively.

Procedure: laparoscopic pectopexy

The cervix or vaginal cuff was suspended by the Cooper ligament.

Procedure: Sacrospinous ligament fixation

Vaginal cuff/uterus was sutured to the unilateral sacrospinous ligament

Secondary Outcome Measures
=======

Prolapse symptoms, Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire
The Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-Short Form 7 (PFIQ-7) consists of three scales of seven questions, each taken from the Urinary Incontinence Impact Questionnaire, the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Impact Questionnaire, and the Colorectal-Anal Impact Questionnaire. The three scales are scored from 0 (least distress) to 100 (greatest distress), again with an overall score ranging from 0-300 and higher scores indicating lower quality of life in these areas. The Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory-Short Form 20 (PFDI-20) includes six items with different answer choice scales referring the sexual life in the previous 4 weeks. The answer choices in the FSFI carry a number of points and are summed to obtain six domain scores and an overall score. For the latter, there is a threshold at 26.55 which means all values below are classed as indicating female sexual dysfunction (FSD). For the main score, the answer range is from 1 (no distress) to 6 (extreme distress).

 <EOD> A case of a 5-year-old with hypopituitarism.
A healthy 5-year old male with a birth weight and length of 3.4kg and 50cm, respectively was brought in by his parents for evaluation. It was learned that the physical examination demonstrated a weight of 13.2 kg, 84cm, no dysmorphic features, no galactosemic rash, no skin lesions of the hands or feet, no peripheral oedema, a blood pressure of 94/60mmHg, a pulse was 70/minute( sinus), a temperature of 36.70C, and a respiratory rate of 17/minute. Neurological examination was remarkable for an absent corneal reflex bilaterally, absence of the patellar reflex bilaterally, absent planter extensor reflex bilaterally, no Achilles jerk bilaterally, normal muscle bulk and strength, negative Babinski sign bilaterally, and a normal sensory examination. There was no history of febrile seizure in the past. The history of child-birth was uneventful, no history of drug-allergy in the family, no family history of thyroid dysfunction or hypopituitarism. The mother was diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), otherwise no family history of endocrine disorder was reported (Fig. 1). The physical assessment showed an abnormal growth pattern in comparison with his peers. His height reached the 10 percentile, while weight and occiput-to-ankle circumference reached the 0 percentiles. His visual examination showed normal findings. His ophthalmology evaluation and his brain MRI were remarkable for the absence of pituitary gland in the sella turcica, which is compatible with hypopituitarism, though the pituitary stalk is found in its normal position (Fig. 2). Laboratory findings revealed the following results: Hemoglobin 11.5g/dl, Hematocrit 36.3%, MCV 67.1fl, MCH 19.1pg, MCHC 35.1gm/dl, WBC 3,6600/ml, Platelet 219,000/ml. Bone age assessment revealed a growth retardation, indicating a bone age of 4. 3 y. No abnormal findings in serum electrolytes, liver and kidney function test, thyroid function test, prolactin, LH, FSH, calcitonin, cortisol, testosterone, FSH, TSH, IGF-I, IGF-II, vitamin D3, ACTH and serum amino acids. Further work-up for congenital defects of sex determination such as Prader-Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome was negative. The growth hormone stimulation test showed no GH elevation on insulin-tolerance test. <EOD> The use of the modified Groningen growth chart for the assessment of postnatal growth.
This study was done to evaluate the use of the modified Groningen growth chart for the assessment of postnatal growth. The study population comprised 48 boys of low birth weight (i.e. a birth weight of less than 1 800 g). These boys had a corrected gestational age at birth, ranging between 32 and 39 weeks and a birth weight of 1 007 to 2 245 g. On the basis of their corrected gestational age at birth the boys were classified into three sub-groups, namely: young (34 to 37 weeks), intermediate (33 to 33 weeks and 6 days), and old (32 weeks or less). At the final assessment, the corrected age at the time of the measurement was 16 months or older. The height of the boys was measured according to the recommendations of the International Biologic Programme. It was found that, despite the relatively small body size and weight of the boys in this study population, the assessment of postnatal growth according to the modified Groningen growth chart could be justified on the basis of its relatively constant performance in the assessments of body size. <EOD> Effects of an oral leptin receptor antagonist on food intake and energy metabolism.

To the editor, We here present a case series of 7 patients with new-onset refractory status epilepticus (NORSE) that occurred in the setting of severe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)(Fig. 1). The study population included 7 Caucasian or Middle East individuals that developed COVID-19 pneumonia followed by new-onset epileptic seizures, an altered level of consciousness and status epilepticus despite the administration of antiseizure medication. The mean age was 31.9 years (range 24-41) and 6 (85.7%) persons were male. Three patients (42.8%) were healthcare providers with previous occupational contact with patients affected by COVID-19. Pre-existing medical conditions included obesity, hypertension, and asthma. Seizures occurred during the course of COVID-19 in all cases (range 1-24 days) and were mainly characterized by repetitive partial motor seizures that lasted less than 1 minute. Patients presented with non-specific complaints in general including fever, dyspnea, and headache. Laboratory findings indicated lymphopenia in 6 of the cases (85.7%), with a value below 0.8 Â 10 9 /L in all cases, and thrombocytopenia in 2 patients. Hypoxic respiratory failure was detected in all cases and ARDS was found in 3 patients. All patients required prolonged ICU admission (1-34 days), with invasive mechanical ventilation (6-36 days). The use of prone positioning (100%), high positive end-expiratory pressure (71.4%), neuromuscular blockade (57.1%), and deep sedation (57.1%) were common. One patient received renal replacement therapy. Three patients (42.8%) were treated with Tocilizumab (a second one received it as a pre-emptive therapy), and C1-inhibitor was used in one patient. Remdesivir and corticosteroids were used in almost two-thirds of the cohort. The EEGs showed frequent epileptiform discharges in all patients. Two patients died one week after hospital admission, 2 patients recovered in less than 2 months, one was discharged 4 month later, and other 2 had less than 5-month follow-up. The remaining case presented a severe disability (Glasgow Outcome Scale 3). In conclusion, NORSE usually occurs in Caucasian or Middle East patients with a mean age of 31.9 years.

Input Text: Tailoring Bleeding Reduction Approaches in Patients Undergoing PCI Study Overview Description Detailed Description Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the standard of care for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). In particular, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, DAPT is initiated during the index event and maintained for up to 12 months to prevent stent-related complications as well as ischemic recurrences in non-treated coronary segments. Three oral P2Y12 inhibitors are currently recommended in this setting: clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor. However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, prasugrel and ticagrelor are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials showing their superior reduction in ischemic events, including stent thrombosis. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding. These observations are attributed to the greater antiplatelet potency of prasugrel and ticagrelor over clopidogrel. Importantly, accruing evidence support that bleeding complications carry significant prognostic implications, including increased mortality, underscoring the need to define antiplatelet strategies associated with reduced bleeding while preserving ischemic efficacy. The notion that most recurrent ischemic events, including stent thrombosis, occur early after the index event (i.e., 1-3 months post PCI) has prompted the design of clinical trials assessing antiplatelet treatment regimens consisting in the use of agents with enhanced platelet inhibition during the first months after PCI followed by approaches with reduced platelet inhibition. To this extent, two strategies have both proven to be effective in reducing bleeding complications while preserving efficacy compared with maintaining long-term DAPT with aspirin and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor: a) DAPT de-escalation (i.e., switching from prasugrel or ticagrelor to clopidogrel while maintaining aspirin) and b) potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (i.e., maintaining prasugrel or ticagrelor and dropping aspirin). These strategies have been tested in a number of trials and have led to changes in practice guidelines to consider either one of these strategies as bleeding reduction approaches among ACS patients undergoing PCI. However, comparative assessments between DAPT de-escalation and potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy are lacking. A single center, prospective, randomized trial will compare the relative hemostatic efficacy of a DAPT de-escalation strategy and a potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy strategy in patients after PCI, who are on at least 30 days of DAPT in acute ischemic events or at least 90 days in chronic ischemic events. Participants will receive either DAPT de-escalation, defined as maintenance of potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and aspirin (81 mg daily) for at least 90 days, or potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy, defined as potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (either prasugrel 10 mg daily or ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily) and no aspirin therapy for at least 90 days. The trial will have a single-blind, open-label design. The primary outcome will be the area under the curve (AUC) assayed by Total Thrombus formation Analysis System. The trial results will show whether potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and discontinuation of aspirin or DAPT has a different pro-thrombotic effect in the chronic and the acute setting. This trial will be the single-blind, open-label design. The results will offer evidence for selecting an optimal antiplate"

 <EOD> Association of SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity and clinical symptoms among hospitalised patients with chronic respiratory disease in China

Objectives Patients with chronic diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study evaluated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies among hospitalised patients with COPD, COVID-19 symptoms and risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity. Methods This prospective study includes hospitalised adult patients with acute exacerbations of COPD who were recruited between June 16 and September 24, 2020 in Zhejiang Province, China. All patients were treated based on the national guidelines and were followed for 4 weeks. Data on demographics, underlying diseases, COVID-19 symptoms, exposures, comorbidities, and treatment were collected through electronic medical records. SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM antibodies in serum samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 immunity using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Antitox). Information on SARS-CoV-2 contact, symptoms, comorbidities, demographics, exposures, and medication history was collected through medical history interviews. The multivariate modified Poisson regression model was used to analyse potential risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Results A total of 816 COPD patients, including 306 (37.6%), 253 (30.9%), 149 (18.2%), and 108 (13.3%) with mild, moderate, severe, and critical conditions, were hospitalised during the study period. All 816 samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM; 169 (20.6%) patients were positive for SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody and 79 (9.7%) for IgM antibody. IgG seropositivity was significantly associated with severe and critical disease (adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.73, 95%CI 1.21-2.49) and age ≥ 60 (aRR 1.48, 95%CI 1.13-1.93) while IgM seropositivity was associated with contact history (aRR 2.45, 95%CI 1.53-3.97). Influenza vaccine was independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity (aRR 1.36, 95%CI 1.02-1.82). Conclusions Approximately one in five hospitalised patients with COPD in Zhejiang Province, China have IgG seropositivity. COPD patients hospitalised with more severe and critical disease or older age have significantly higher IgG antibody levels in the blood. Influenza vaccination is associated with higher IgG seropositivity.

 <EOD> The effect of a new anxiolytic, alprazolam (Kinzal), on anxiety and panic.
The effect of alprazolam (Kinzal, Upjohn), a new anxiolytic drug, was examined in 24 volunteers over a period of 6 weeks. A double-blind crossover study was performed to compare alprazolam (up to 2 mg) with placebo (taken at night). All subjects had a history of panic. Eight inpatients also took alprazolam for 14 days under 1-hour continuous electrocardio-graphic supervision. Significant reductions in anxiety, phobic anxiety, tension and fear were seen on the STAI, HAM and CPQ in subjects taking alprazolam compared with placebo. Alprazolam was not found to have significant sedative effects by means of changes in sleep, nor were there adverse effects on mood, memory, concentration and other cognitive functions. No significant adverse changes in laboratory tests (blood pressure, heart rate, ECG, urinalyses and haematology and biochemistry) were seen, although five inpatients became hypotensive. <EOD> Genome-Wide Identification and Analysis of the HD-Zip Gene Family in Chrysanthemum

 <EOD> Effect of temperature on the adsorption of 1,3-butadiene on the Fe-Pd (110) surface.
We report molecular modeling studies to describe adsorption of 1,3-butadiene at the Fe-Pd(110) interface. We utilized the density-functional theory and projector augmented wave method. The adsorption of butadiene is investigated for a Pd monolayer covered Fe(110) surface and a Pddil (110) surface (for a wide temperature range: 300-800 K). The calculated results are in agreement with experiment and with the previous theoretical studies. The Pd monolayer-covered Fe(110) surface and the Pddil (110) surface are predicted to be less suitable for the butadiene adsorption than the bare Fe(110) surface. The Pd monolayer-covered Fe(110) surface is predicted to have the highest adsorption energy of butadiene, followed by the bare Fe(110) and then the Pddil (110) surfaces. We find that the molecule adsorbs in the bridging configuration for all Fe-Pd interfaces; in comparison, the bare Fe(110) surface has preference for the on-top configuration of bonding of the butadiene. The calculated intermolecular Pd-Pd distance remains unchanged by the presence of the adsorbates when the adsorption density is relatively low, whereas the interfacial Pd-Pd distance decreases with increasing the number of butadiene molecules adsorbed when the adsorbed surface gets relatively more crowded. The adsorbed hydrogen and carbon atoms are strongly bound to the Pd-monolayer-covered Fe(110) surface and to the Fe-atom-adsorbed Pddil (110) surface. On the other hand, the adsorbed carbons are less strongly bonded to the Fe-Pd(110) surface, while the adsorbed hydrogens demonstrate the intermediate values of binding energies on the Fe-Pd(110) surface. The adsorbed hydrocarbon bonds strongly to the P"

 <EOD> Inhibitor of DNA binding 4 as a master inducer for liver cancer cell invasion.
Cell invasion is a complex process and the expression of a number of key molecules are required to be orchestrated. Recent evidence showed that over-expression of inhibitor of DNA binding (Id1) proteins in cancer tissues was associated with the invasion of tumor. The expression levels of Id1 proteins were increased in highly invasive liver cancer cell lines (HepG2, Hep3B) compared with that in less invasive liver cancer cell line (PLC). The present study demonstrated that over-expression of Id1 proteins in highly invasive liver cancer cells was associated with the metastatic progression in the liver cancer development and Id1 trans-activated a number of genes related to hepatic metastasis, such as E-cadherin, Snail, and MMP. Overexpression of Id1 in highly invasive hepatic cancer cell lines, HepG2 and Hep3B resulted in a significant increase in N-cadherin expression and cell invasion through 3D fibrils, while Id1 knock-down in poorly invasive hepatic cancer cell lines, PLC-PRF5 reduced the number of N-cadherin-expressing cells and inhibited liver cancer cells to invade through 3D collagen matrix. Id1 protein was also found to activate multiple signaling molecules, such as nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) and extracellular signal regulated protein kinase1/2 (ERK1/2), in liver cancer cell lines with high expression of Id1. The inhibition of these two pathways with specific inhibitors resulted in complete disappearance of invasive phenotype, and Id1 protein failed to stimulate cells proliferation. These results suggested that Id-1 functions as a key inducer of liver cancer cell invasion, and Id1 may play a role in mediating the interaction among multiple signaling molecules including NF-κB and ERK1/2 pathways. <EOD> Antenatal detection of intrauterine growth retardation by real‐time ultrasonography
Early diagnosis of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and the identification of pregnancies at risk may allow for appropriate management to optimize the outcome. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility of sonographic screening of IUGR by using the biparietal diameter (BPD) and femur length as growth parameters. <EOD> LC-HRMS/MS-based Metabolomic Approach for Evaluating Sensitivity to Glufosinate in a Multiple Cropping Area of the Central Region in Korea

Glufosinate herbicide is widely used for the control of annual grass and broad herbaceous weeds in various crops such as corn, rice, and soybean in Korea. To identify the sensitive and resistant populations of weeds to glufosinate, we performed bioassays using three populations of Apera spica-venti, one population of Echinochloa crusgalli, three populations of Amaranthus lividus, three populations of Erodium cicutarium, one population of Sorghum halepense, three populations of Portulacaria oleracea, three populations of Arctium lappa, one population of Solenanthus nigrum, and one population of Sisymbrium orientale collected from 11 sampling sites in Gangseok-gun, Jeollabuk-do. LC-HRMS/MS analysis was carried out to monitor metabolisms in the plant samples exposed to glufosinate with a liquid chromatography system with tandem mass spectrometer. We investigated differential metabolites between sensitive and resistant plants to glufosinate based on the result of the bioassays. We identified the metabolites of glufosinate, including phosph"

Chia seeds have garnered a lot of attention in recent years primarily because of their health benefits. The history of chia dates back to the Aztec civilization that used the plant as a natural remedy. These herbaceous plant species belong to the family Boraginaceae. Two of the best-known species used as functional ingredients in the food industry for their positive health aspects include Salvia hispanica and Salsola australis. In this review, we focus on the nutritional properties, bioactive phytochemicals, and therapeutic effects of chia. Numerous studies on the phytochemical composition of chia have revealed presence of high levels of polyphenols, which have potential to provide health benefits. Clinical studies conducted recently have shown that the addition of chia in the diet helps in ameliorating disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, studies show that supplementation of chia contributes to improved serum and liver tissue functions as well as reducing serum cholesterol concentrations in humans. <EOD> .
Psoriasis is a lifelong chronic skin disease that affects 2-3% of the general population. Patients with psoriasis report an impaired quality of life more often compared to the general population. The psoriatic process negatively affects work in terms of missed workdays, as well as limitations in the workplace. Patients with psoriasis more often have comorbidities, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, hypertension, overweight, metabolic syndrome, and chronic renal failures. A study of 6931 patients with psoriasis in New Zealand showed that they also had 64% more myocardial infarctions and 38% more strokes than the average population. Treatment of psoriasis should also include interventions that improve patients' health more generally. These interventions include weight control, correction of glycol and lipids metabolism disorders and abnormalities, smoking cessation or limitation of smoking behavior, increased physical activity, and more frequent visits to a dermatologist and therapist.

 <EOD> TRAINING THE ENDOSCOPIC CAN-OPEN SURGERY TECHNIQUE IN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID SHUNT SURGERY: A HUMAN LAPAROSCOPIC MODEL.
BACKGROUND
The advantages of using the minimally invasive endoscopic technique in neurosurgery (endoscopic can-opening) are clear, but training opportunities are limited. This paper presents a protocol for introducing this technique to neurosurgical personnel and trainees, using simulation with realistic human cadaver models with anatomical landmarks.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
Laparoscopic surgery materials and techniques were used and a set developed to reproduce a patient's intracranial cavity. The instruments used to reproduce brain tumors were made from stainless steel; laparoscopy trocars were used. A complete procedure on a human cadaver with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt was recreated.


RESULTS
The procedure was performed by a senior neurosurgeon in 2013 and 2014 on a cadaver. The technique was easily reproduced with minimal adaptation. The anatomy and technique of neurosurgery were easily learned, using a laparoscopy-trained neurosurgeon.


CONCLUSION
This protocol could help familiarize surgeons and trainees with the endoscopic can-opening technique, which is a difficult skill to acquire. The equipment used is inexpensive and readily available in a laparoscopic operating room; it does not need an endoscopy-trained laparoscopic instructor or extensive resources. The protocol is easy to learn and may lead to a more extensive use of this technique in neurosurgical centers. <EOD> Sleep restriction decreases food-related reward and changes neural response in overweight and obese women.
BACKGROUND
Obesity is a growing global health challenge. Inactivity and poor sleep are reported contributors to poor regulation of energy balance and obesity. The present study investigated the effects of sleep restriction on behavioural and neural responses to food stimuli among overweight and obese, mid-aged women.


METHODS
Fifteen overweight and obese women participated in a randomised, 2-week crossover study of sleep restriction (5-h time in bed) and optimum sleep opportunity (8-h time in bed). Food photography was used to create individualised food images for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. Rate of food-seeking, sleepiness, and food-cravings were assessed in the morning and in the evening of each sleep study day. At the end of each study arm, fasting evening measurements of glucose, insulin, cortisol, and melatonin were collected to determine intervention effects on the biological drive to eat. Sleep, heart rate variability, performance, and mood were measured each night during the 2-week protocols.


RESULTS
Food images were processed to extract visual features and an image preference score was derived for each participant. Participants were scanned with fMRI in response to high and low food preference images while at rest. On the optimal sleep study, fMRI"

Prior studies have individually showcased the efficacy of both techniques in enhancing pain relief, expanding range of motion, and improving functional outcomes among patients. However, a direct comparative analysis between Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization is conspicuously absent, prompting this study to unveil potential distinctions in their impact on shoulder pain, range of motion, and functional mobility. The study's duration is projected to be nine months, with data collection points at baseline, the end of 1.5 weeks, and the conclusion of the 3rd week. Outcome variables include pain assessment using the Numeric Pain Rating Scale, evaluation of function through the Shoulder Pain & Disability Index, and measurement of range of motion using goniometry. Data collection will be performed by an assessor at specified intervals, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the interventions' effects over time. Ultimately, this research aspires to contribute evidence-based insights into the relative effectiveness of Gong's and Kaltenborn's mobilization techniques, aiding clinicians in making informed decisions for optimal patient outcomes in the context of Adhesive Capsulitis.

 <EOD> Reliability of the Clinical Reasoning Strategies Scale for Use With the NCLEX-RN®
BACKGROUND: Use of a valid and reliable rubric for clinical reasoning during nursing education is required to provide adequate feedback to faculty and students about strategies. The Clinical Reasoning Strategies (CRS) scale was recently developed to address the need for a simple valid and reliable assessment rubric to determine how the clinical reasoning skills are used by students. Purpose. The purpose of this study was to assess the interrater reliability of this tool for use with the NCLEX-RN® examination. METHOD: A descriptive, quantitative, and cross-sectional design was used for this evaluation of the CRS scale. Participants consisted of faculty members who used the 25-item rubric to rate 60 clinical reasoning items from the NCLEX-RN®. Test–retest reliability was calculated to determine interrater reliability, and descriptive statistics were calculated for demographics and experience variables. RESULTS: Total scores (r = .94) and individual item scores (r = .97) were shown to have excellent interrater reliability using test–retest results. CONCLUSION: A valid and reliable assessment rubric was developed using a well-researched validity framework to assess student clinical reasoning. <EOD> Proceedings: Histology and ultrastructure of the liver in cirrhosis induced by the ethyl carbamate-phenobarbitone-cholestyramine combination used to lower plasma lipid levels in humans.

 

## Studies of glycogenin

Department of Endocrinology, University of Liverpool, Prescot Street, Liverpool 1.
Hepatic glycogenic phosphorylase from rats fed on a carbohydrate rich diet has been found to have a much greater affinity for glucose-1P than the enzyme from a liver maintained on a protein-rich diet. For practical purposes, and because of the known physiological effects of glucose on glycogen synthesis, it has been assumed that glucose-induced inactivation of glycogenin is a simple substrate inhibition phenomenon. However, an analysis of the kinetics of inactivation of glycogenin by both glucose and glyceraldehyde-3P, given together and separately, indicated that the substrate inhibition hypothesis is unsatisfactory.
A kinetic model based on two interacting sites has been proposed to account for these data, at the same time"

Input Text: A Novel Biomarker for Response and Prognosis of HBV-related Hepatocellular Carcinoma

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Residual tumors and early recurrence/metastasis after radiotherapy (RT) compromise the patient survival with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Timely detecting residual/recurrence/metastasis and the clonality is required to implement salvage therapies properly. The major unmet needs of radiotherapy to HCC are the difficulties in early evaluating response by images and timely detection of intrahepatic recurrence and extrahepatic metastasis. Thus, an accurate and personalized biomarker for response prediction and disease monitoring is demanded. Cell-free tumor-specific DNA (ctDNA) has garnered attention as a promising biomarker in cancer patients. However, in HCC, the detection rate is low (9-21.2%), mainly due to the limited prevalence of traditional somatic mutations and the difficult separation of ctDNA fragments from normal cells. The investigators aim to develop a novel ctDNA, the virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA), as a biomarker for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC patients undergoing RT. HBV vh-DNA presents in  90% of HBV-related HCC patients and can be differentiated from DNA released from the normal cells through enrichment by capturing with HBV probes. vh-DNA might be advantageous to the traditional somatic mutation type of ctDNA. The investigators hypothesize that HBV vh-DNA could accurately diagnose residual tumor by 6-12 months earlier than contemporary images and predict early recurrence/metastatsis, thus allows early intervention of salvage therapies. The investigators will first use our previously collected serum samples and surgical/biopsied tissues from HBV-related HCC patients undergoing radiotherapy. The consistency of junctional clones by Capture NGS needs to be tested between both pre- and post-RT serums, and serial changes in copy numbers of vh-DNA by ddPCR are quantified in the representative cases. The same junction clones from pre-post-RT serums and surgical tissues will be confirmed and the copy number changes of vh-DNA be correlated with RT response and disease-control status. The investigators plan to identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The investigators will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copies. The investigators have been prospectively collecting plasma samples from HBV-related HCC patients before/after RT, at 1, 4, 7 months, and at recurrence/metastasis. The investigators plan to confirm the viable role of pre-/post-RT changes of plasma vh-DNA copies of the same junction clone in post-RT response and prognosis. Moreover, The investigators will explore the recurrent/metastatic tumors arising from the original or a de novo one by identifying their clonality with HBV integration patterns.

BACKGROUND
This paper describes the demographics, etiologies and clinical characters in pain outpatients in a hospital primary care clinic in Hong Kong.


METHODS
All patients enrolled during a day of the week in August to September 1999 in the clinic were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. Two hundred questionnaires were distributed with a mean response rate of 60%, producing a data set of 500 patients by systematic sampling. The Chinese versions of the SF-36 health scale, pain characteristics checklist, pain beliefs and behaviour scale, and pain drawing of pain sites were used. Multiple linear regression was used to identify correlates of pain characteristics.


RESULTS
Forty-nine per cent of patients experienced chronic pain (368/740). Age ranged from 13-95 years with a mean of 61.2 years. Females were more than males in chronic pain patients (57.3% v 42.7%). Females presented significantly more chronic fatigue, psychological and physical health symptoms than males in the chronic pain group. The types of pain were mainly in the joint or muscles. The etiology of pain was mainly musculoskeletal disease (43.8%), followed by neuralgia (11.8%) and cancer (11.5%). The frequency of medications taken to relieve pain was mainly paracetamol 1.0-2.9 grams daily (33.6%) and NSAID 500-799 mg daily (26.1%). Among the chronic pain patients, chronic fatigue was more severe in the head/chest and general body category (both p-values 0.05). Depressive symptoms were found in 34.1% of all pain patients and 40.5% of those with chronic pain.


CONCLUSIONS
In Hong Kong primary care and pain clinics, chronic pain was found to be more common among females than among males. It is important to relieve chronic pain and its related symptoms with early and appropriate interventions, such as non-pharmacological pain coping strategies and psychological interventions in primary care. <EOD> Navigating interprofessional conflict to improve team functioning in primary health care: A secondary qualitative analysis.

 <EOD> Acute effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity.
Acute effects of endogenous and exogenous opioids (met-enkephalin or morphine, respectively) on plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and oxytocin were measured in anesthetized lactating rats. Met-enkephalin (30 micrograms/kg) or morphine (300 micrograms/kg) were administered iv as vehicle or vehicle plus naloxone (1 mg/kg), the opioid antagonist. Plasma hormone profiles were determined during iv infusion of vehicle and the hormones were measured before, during and after administration of either peptide or morphine given either alone or in combination with the opioid antagonist. Neither exogenous nor endogenous opiate peptide suppressed plasma ACTH when compared with vehicle and only endogenous morphine resulted in a decrease in plasma corticosterone. Moreover the hormonal changes were attenuated with the addition of naloxone. Met-enkephalin appears to inhibit ACTH as a result of its direct action on ACTH-secreting cells. In contrast, its ability to affect corticosterone (or aldosterone as noted elsewhere) appears to be through its binding on the opiate receptors located within the adrenal gland. <EOD> Effects of a multi-sensory intervention with guinea pigs on stress levels, anxiety, and depression in nursing home residents

Background: Animal-assisted therapy (AAT) is a novel therapeutic method for older adults to relieve stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The aim of this study is to observe nursing home residents' stress levels, anxiety, and depressive symptoms pre-and postintervention in a group receiving a multi-sensory animal-assisted intervention (MSAAI) in form of a guinea pig program and a control group.Methods:The pilot, randomized controlled, pre-post design study was implemented with twelve participants in a Swiss nursing home and involved three group sessions of the intervention and control group. Participants completed self-report questionnaires, the Geriatric Depression Scale (GD-S) and Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), before, directly after, and one week after the intervention.Results: There were significant effects on the GD-S and PSS from pre-to post-intervention (p = < .0001). We found no significant effects between the intervention and the control group.Conclusions:Both intervention and control groups benefited from a group session with the pet guinea pig, which is most likely due to the human-animal connection and the companionship of the guinea pig. Future studies should examine larger groups and a variety of different animals in order to prove the effectiveness of the multi-sensory animal-assisted intervention, especially if implemented in conjunction with the multimodal behavior therapy model.

Abstract
------------------
Background
The ice hockey's training structure has not changed in recent years. Athletes use a variety of tactics to win a game, in which offensive attack, defensive counterstrike, and rebound are important. Physical fitness is very important. In previous studies, speed and endurance were often mentioned, but the specific skills of ice hockey players were not fully examined. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of high-intensity interval exercise training on the physical skills, tactical performance, and physical condition of ice hockey players.
Objective
We examined the differences in the physical fitness, tactical performance, and the physical conditioning between the group that was intervened with the high-intensity interval training method in the experimental group and the control group that were intervened using the traditional method in the control group.

Main Findings (3 key findings that describe your results, outcomes or successes)
The results of the experiment and the comparison were as follows:
1. The skating speed of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group with a difference of, p < .05, and the difference was statistically significant. 2. The agility of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group, with a difference of, p < .05, and the difference was statistically significant. 3. The shooting performance of the experimental group was, p < .05, better than that of the control group.

Limitation
Limitations of this study include that the participants were all male collegiate athletes. Thus, the results may not be applicable to female athletes, adolescents, or other types of athletes. For future studies, we will involve women in the exercise to verify the relationship between high-intensity interval training and physical fitness, tactical performance, and physical condition.

Conclusions
The findings of this study confirm that the physical condition and tactical performance of collegiate ice hockey players can be improved by high-intensity interval training which has the following implications: First, this finding can be applied to coaches by creating specific physical fitness training for ice hockey players by using interval training so that ice hockey players could reach the skill level. Second, the use of technology and equipment is more intuitive than that proposed by other studies. Third, high-intensity interval training is better than traditional training and should allow college ice hockey players to perform better in competitions. Fourth, using the technology of GPS, SPEEDLIGHT, and LIVETRAX will not only be convenient to detect the changes in the physical performance of the athlete but will also be an effective tool to help coaches in sports.

Describe the study design and setting, including time plan (e.g. open vs closed), type of study, methods of allocation and concealment, blinding, definition of and inclusion/exclusion criteria for participants, treatment regimens, outcomes, statistical methods, etc.

## Summary
We studied a total of 448 patients (227 in the control group and 221 in the experimental group) who underwent endovascular treatments at the same time. All patients underwent blood routine inspection, platelet count, activated partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, platelet aggregation test, and international standard ratio (INS) coagulation test within 24 h before treatment. For the experimental group, platelet aggregation tests were performed 45 minutes after adjusting the dose of clopidogrel to obtain ADP-MPA data, which were again collected within 48 hours after stent placement to adjust the dose of aspirin. An ischemic event was defined as a clinically significant ischemic cerebrovascular events, including ischemic stroke and TIA, within 30 days after stent placement.

## Background on intervention

Suitable justification for new treatment strategy.

# Introduction
Since FDA approved flow-diverting stent in 2010, endovascular treatments are widely used in vascular diseases, increasing the use of stent placement for aneurysms 1,2 . Although flow diversion is safe 3-6 , it often leads to delayed aneurysmal rupture after stenting if antiplatelets do not provide sufficient protection against thrombosis . Stent-assisted coiling has been shown to be more efficacious than simple coiling in treatment of large and giant aneurysms 8 , but thrombosis associated with stent is still present, and the antiplatelet strategy is inconsistent . Guided antiplatelet therapy may improve the patient’s safety and reduce clinical risk 9,10 .

## Import
The study is important because: * antiplatelet agents are often used in patients undergoing endovascular treatments, especially for stent-assisted coil embolization . * Antiplatelet adverse events are increasingly becoming an important health issue, and there are ongoing efforts to develop better antiplatelet agents and dosages . Antiplatelet resistance is one of the major causes of adverse events and a common challenge in the clinic . There are no clear guidelines on how to adjust antiplatelet therapy for patients to improve the safety and outcome of endovascular treatment, which may be addressed by adjusting antiplatelet administration based on platelet testing. The study aims to address the knowledge gap regarding this issue by evaluating antiplatelet therapy based on platelet aggregation tests.

## Objectives
Our study aims to: * investigate the efficacy of guided antiplatelet therapy based on platelet aggregation test (PAT) in improving the safety and efficacy associated with endovascular treatment in patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms. * to evaluate antiplatelet strategies based on PAT.

## Intervention
The overall aim of this study is to conduct a comparison between different antiplatelet regimens, and to investigate the efficacy of a platelet aggregation test-guided antiplatelet therapy in improving the safety and efficacy associated with endovascular treatment for patients with unruptured intracranial aneurysms.

## Comparisons
This study is a cluster randomized controlled cohort with a 1:1 ratio between the control group and the experimental group. Patients will be followed for 30 days to monitor thrombotic events and clinical events.

## Randomization
The study comprises 3 stages: registration, assessment, and data collection. The patients will be randomly assigned to a control group or experimental group at the time of registration, depending on whether they agree with antiplatelet testing based on platelet function. At the registration stage, the doctors and the nurses will provide informed consent forms to the patients and explain in detail the details of the antiplatelet adjustment and platelet aggregation test. Before the antiplatelet adjustment, patients"

But let us confine ourselves to cases coming to a surgeon who is called to them in an early stage. Let us suppose, for example, an instance of a young man who has been suffering from neuralgias of a very distressing character, or from dyspepsia, or indigestion, which he has been unable to get rid of in any manner by the use of physiologic agents.

Inclusion Criteria: Male, Age 6 months to 3 years old. Undergoing Hypospadias Repair for a Hypospadias Related Condition, with anaesthetic maintenance phase of surgery lasting >1hours, with randomisation to either intravenous approach - total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA), or an inhalational approach (volatile anaesthetic with air/oxygen supplementation).

Exclusion Criteria: Known contraindications to either volatile-based inhalation anaesthesia or TIVA (surgery or participant), withdrawn consent at any point, neurodevelopmental (GDS) or Neurodisorder (including ASD or ADHD or TBI).

A total of 204 participants will be included in the feasibility study which will be randomised using minimisation to one of the two maintenance techniques used during anaesthetic drug administration. This will allocate the first patients to receive either Inhalational (A), or Intravenous (B) anaesthesia (A) The primary outcome measure for this study is the number of eligible patients screened. The secondary outcome measures are: recruitment and retention rates, protocol compliance, acceptability of protocol by patient and families and clinicians, changes in DNA methylation profile in whole blood before and after surgery, changes in epigenetics profile in whole blood between the two arms (Intravenous vs volitile arm), the success of the trial, and any adverse events.

 <EOD> Tactile sensation of touching and feeling surface topography—A review.
The tactile sense is used for the perception of surface topography in real-world experience. It is well known that the brain processes touch signals differently from mechanical touch signals, and that there are two different channels for the transmission of touch signals. In this article, we focused on mechanisms underlying the tactile sensation of touching and feeling surface topography (TST) with the aim of elucidating brain mechanisms and the sensory receptor basis of tactile sensation. Firstly, the mechanisms underlying tactile sensation (mechanical sensation) are discussed, and then the methods used in studies on tactile sensation of surface topography (pressing a surface with a finger), which has only been studied in the last 20 years, are summarized. This article reviews previous studies on the psychophysics of TST, the perceptual learning of TST, neuropsychological disorders related to TST, and the brain mechanisms underlying the tactile sensation of different surface topographies, particularly the relationship between the TST perceptual ability and motor learning and the neuropsychological basis of TST perception. In addition, the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying TST perception are discussed, particularly the role of body signals, tactile senses of the body, tactile sensions evoked by body movements, the effect of the body on the TST perception, and the effects of the body on perceptual learning. This article suggests that the body is closely related to the TST perception, the neuropsychological mechanisms underlying TST perception are brain regions distributed throughout the cerebral cortex but not limited to the somatosensory cortex, tactile sensations are not only produced by signals of skin mechanoreceptors. The current review article sheds useful light on the future study of TST perception, perceptual learning, and neuropsychological disorder of TST perception. <EOD> Combining the KIDDO study with the COMPASS cohort: A large cross-sectional cohort from the United States exploring the association of obesity and cardiovascular disease with the gut microbiome.

 <EOD> Association between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis: A systematic review
AIM
The aim of the study was to analyse whether periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis have a strong association.


OBJECTIVES
A systematic review of the association between rheumatoid arthritis and periodontitis was undertaken.


REPORT
A systematic search of six databases revealed six studies with a total of 609 participants met inclusion criteria. Only one of the studies showed no significant association between periodontitis and rheumatoid arthritis.


CONCLUSION
This review of the evidence suggests that the majority of studies suggest there is an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis in patients diagnosed with periodontitis. Thus, it is important that health-care practitioners appreciate and consider the significant link between these complex diseases. <EOD> A novel antigen detection-based blood diagnostic device for visceral leishmaniasis using magnetic beads and chemiluminescence.
We developed a diagnostic method in which the patient's blood sample is introduced into a disposable cartridge and it is possible to read out the result using a hand-held device. The antigen-based blood test for visceral leishmaniasis, which was adapted using a fully automated antigen detection system, was introduced as a disposable cartridge. The leishmania antigen-based blood test was done in parallel, and the antibody was detected using a chemiluminescent analyzer. The advantage of this method is that it is possible to identify the causative parasite from the patient's blood by simply detecting the leishmania antigen secreted in the clinical state, and the antibody level is additionally confirmed together at the same time. This system is useful because it makes it possible to detect antibody and antigen in the patient's blood simultaneously. <EOD> Immunotherapy in advanced tumors with 5-fluorouracil.
The authors have used, for over 20 years, a combination of 5-fluorouracil, vincristine and levamisole (or methotrexate). The study comprised 38 patients suffering from different types of advanced tumors (mainly gastric, colorectal and esophageal cancers). The median overall survival of these patients was 11 months in the absence of 5-fluorouracil, whereas in patients treated with 5-fluorouracil, the median survival was 19 months. With this treatment, there were five responses--three gastric cancers, one neuroendocrine carcinoma and one esophageal cancer (one at an advanced stage and one at an operable stage). The 5-fluorouracil immune-induced effect was confirmed by histological examination in both colon tumors. The mechanisms involved seem to reside essentially, in the ability of 5-fluorouracil to promote T-cell activity and to increase their natural killer capacity against circulating tumor cells. <EOD> A new method for studying the cerebral blood flow.
We describe a new apparatus for recording the blood flow in the cerebral vessels continuously while the brain is exposed through a window. The blood supply of the surface vessels can be traced within the area of the window by marking the venous reflux as soon as the blood flow in the arteries is cut off. To achieve this the animal should be pretreated by a vasoconstrictor substance which blocks the venous drainage temporarily, in a dose which is not harmful. The most convenient drugs to use appear to be dialuric acid and metacresol (Aspirin). Our preparatory work indicates that the method is sufficiently precise to compare the blood flow of the two hemispheres and also to study its variation from person to person. It also seems possible to trace variations of the cerebral circulation in case of a pathological reaction, or to study variations of the local blood flow after operative interventions. The apparatus is now being tested with the help of Dr. H. WICK. <EOD> .

Input Text: Physiological MRI for Precision Radiotherapy IDH-wildtype Glioblastoma

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Introduction: After surgery, a key step in treatment of patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (high grade brain tumour) is radiotherapy. The ideal clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy treatment planning includes all tumour cells remaining after surgery. Currently, the GTV is delineated on conventional imaging techniques that are only visualizing macroscale structural changes due to the presence of a large number of tumour cells. After delineating these visible macroscale changes, the GTV is expanded in all directions with 1.5cm into visibly healthy tissue to account for microscale tumour invasion. This standard CTV therefore also contains healthy tissue that should not be receiving radiation, causing side effects of treatment, hereby reducing quality of life for patients. Generating a physiological CTV, in which microscale invasion of tumour cells is taken into account specifically whilst sparing healthy tissue that is not in need of radiation, is essential for reducing side effects of radiotherapy. To do so, visualisation is necessary of physiological processes of tumour cells, which are present before macroscale structural changes occur. State-of-the-art MRI techniques are now in use at the Erasmus MC that can assess these physiological processes, including oxygenation status and cell proliferation. We aim to generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in 10 patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, we will generate the physiological CTV including this information and illustrate that it is more precise in capturing microscale tumour invasion. This proof-of-principle work will be used to obtain external funding to perform the much needed, and the first of its kind globally, clinical trial to show the benefit of a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning in glioblastoma. Rationale: Current treatment management of patients with IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is sub-optimal because of two main issues: (1) Creating an accurate target volume for radiotherapy, a key aspect of glioblastoma treatment, containing all remaining tumour cells after surgery that is impossible with the conventional CT and MRI imaging techniques currently used and (2) in the follow-up of patients after radiotherapy, conventional MRI is incapable of distinguishing tumour progression from treatment effects. The solution to these issues lies in accurate and non-invasive assessment of physiological processes of tumour cells to enable delineation of the true physiological clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy planning and to allow for early detection of true tumour progression during treatment follow-up. Objective: Generate proof-of-concept of using a physiological CTV for radiotherapy treatment planning for patients with brain tumours. Study design: By extending the clinical standard MRI session used for radiotherapy planning in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma with advanced MRI techniques that assess oxygenation status and cell proliferation, a physiological CTV will be generated for each patient in addition to the standard CTV. Treatment for each patient will be according to the current standard in which the standard CTV is used. Initial analysis will include comparing both CTVs in terms of volume and location. Patient follow-up will occur according to the clinical protocol . There will be no personal benefit for the patients in this research project. Equal prediction of pattern of failure (locations of tumour recurrence) based on the physiological CTV compared to the standard CTV used for radiotherapy planning, with the physiological CTV being smaller in volume.

 <EOD> The Impact of Physical-Dental Insurance: The Case of Private Health Insurance in Iran.
OBJECTIVES
To evaluate the impact of private health insurance that covers dental care on people's oral health and dental service use in Iran.


METHODS
We studied a sample of 6009 people from four different provinces, using the Iranian Social Health Insurance Household Survey, 2013. The sample had 80% coverage and was representative of all households with private health insurance. We conducted a propensity score matching method to remove potential selection bias. Binary logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between insurance and the use of dental services between the last dental visit that occurred in the previous 3 years. Poisson regression was used to evaluate the association between insurance and dental pain/sensitivity, decayed, missing and filled teeth.


RESULTS
Insured adults (18+) were more likely to have visited a dentist (odds ratio  = 1.40) and more likely to have had dental treatment (OR = 1.34) in the previous 3 years compared to non-insured ones. Insured adolescents (12-17) were less likely to have had dental problems (adjusted IRR = 0.93) and less likely to have received dental treatment (adjusted IRR = 0.60) in the previous 3 years compared to non-insured ones. The results were still statistically significant even after adjustment for many confounders.


CONCLUSION
The results of our study suggest that private health insurance had a positive impact on people with oral health problems and encouraged them to visit a dentist. <EOD> The Effects of Oral Stimulation with a Gluten-Free Diet: A 3-Year Follow-Up Study

# Introduction
Gluten is a protein fraction found in the endosperm of several cereal grains including wheat, barley and rye, among others. Gluten contains proline and glutamine as its major amino acids, which form insoluble bonds in the absence of fermentation or the bacterium T. Maltophilia D15-75-1a. This protein fraction is responsible for most of the symptoms observed in CD. In fact, gluten is the main trigger of CD symptoms and is responsible for all of these symptoms, even in non-celiac food intolerance.
Celiac disease prevalence has been established to be around 1% of the world population. There has been an increase in CD prevalence over the last two decades, but there is still no clear explanation for this phenomenon. It could be related to the improvement of diagnostic tests, but it has also been suggested that it is caused by the change in Western eating habits and the increase in the consumption of processed grain products. This increase in symptoms has been reported in several studies over the past 8 years, which suggests an increase in CD detection. Celiac disease has become a global public health problem since it is associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disorders such as Type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroid malfunctions, autoimmune cytopenia and atrophic gastritis, as well as other medical problems such as osteoporosis, neurological disorders, fertility problems and cardiovascular and psychological disorders.
The prevalence of celiac disease is higher among northern Europeans than among southern Europeans. Celiac disease is less common among Asian and African populations. Nevertheless, the overall prevalence of celiac disease over the past two decades is the highest among North American populations, which is increasing by more than 5% per year.
When celiac disease is diagnosed, strict treatment of gluten-free diet is prescribed, but this treatment does not achieve adequate control of symptoms for all patients. According to our knowledge, there are no studies that have attempted to understand the evolution of symptoms over time in CD patients. Consequently, this study aimed to analyze the evolution of symptoms in CD"

The severity of injuries caused by land mines is described, followed by an analysis of surgical timing, wound care, radiography, and the surgical techniques used to reconstruct soft-tissue defects in lower extremities in a group of 41 casualties. We emphasize the importance of soft tissue viability in choosing treatment modalities for bony and tendinous injuries in conjunction with the soft tissue defect. The overall results in patients reconstructed with this approach may be better than those of previous reports, but the results of further study on a larger series of patients is needed. <EOD> Evaluation of a two-color immunofluorescence flow cytometric assay for staging hepatitis B virus infection
The new automated two color immunofluorescence staining flow cytometry (FCM) assay (Abbott Diagnostics, Lake Forest, CA) was evaluated for hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen (HBsAg) quantification and estimation of serum hepatitis B core antibody (anti-HBc) level. Antibodies to HBV core particle proteins (anti-HBc), HBV surface antibody (anti-HBs), HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV e antigen (HBeAg), HBV e antibody (anti-HBe), anti-human immunodeficiency virus 1 (anti-HIV-1), and hepatitis C virus antibodies (anti-HCV) were all tested by the new two color FCM assay and assay performance was compared to standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test procedures. All samples tested (n = 100) by two color FCM inhibited HBsAg binding. This inhibition allowed for the simultaneous quantification of HBsAg, intracellular anti-HBc, and extracellular anti-HBc in sera of subjects. The accuracy of the FCM assay for estimating anti-HBc levels was assessed by calculating the percentage of agreement between the FCM assay and the ELISA serum anti-HBc level. The FCM assay underestimated intracellular anti-HBc concentration by an average of 16% in anti-HBs+/anti-HBe+ sera and by an average of 9.6% in anti-HBs+/anti-HBc+/anti-HBe+ sera. Results of this study indicate that sera containing HBsAg compete for HBsAg antigenic determinants and thus result in false negative FCM staining for surface HBV antigens. When false negative FCM surface HBV antigen immunoscreening occurs, results can be confirmed with HBsAg/anti-HBc double labeling assay (two color FCM) following removal of HBsAg from sera by affinity panning or HBsAg depletion assay. This will circumvent the problem of HBsAg presence in anti-HBs + sera. J. Clin. Lab. Anal. 14:1-6, 2000. <EOD> .

 <EOD> The M-line of Drosophila melanogaster muscle. 3. Changes during metamorphosis.
The M-line (ML) is the major structural constituent of the Z-disk, the major element responsible for positioning myofilaments into a compact lattice in striated muscles of arthropods. ML-specific antibodies were used to examine the timing of events in the formation of the ML during metamorphosis in Drosophila. The number of Z-disks was determined by using antibody C21 (Rabouille et al. 1998). The density of the ML was measured by using antibody 3X3/HRP. Metamorphosis was associated with a decrease in the number of Z-disks with a consequent reduction in the density of the ML. These changes had two phases, a very fast (first/second instar) and a slower (late metamorphosis) phase. Only a few MLs were assembled during first/second instar. A phase of rapid Z-disk replication occurred between the fourth and sixth instar that included a 10-fold increase in density of the ML. Late instars were marked by a progressive decrease in ML density. At the end of metamorphosis, there was no correlation between ML density and the presence of Z-disks in the lateral and medial parts of the sarcomere. <EOD> A rare case of urothelial carcinoma arising within a duplicated renal collecting system.
Duplication of the collecting system is a rare congenital defect of the urinary tract and occurs at a frequency of 1 in 4000 to 1 in 5000. Renal cell carcinomas and urothelial carcinomas have been reported to arise from duplicated ureters, but to our knowledge, urothelial carcinoma of the renal pelvis in a duplicated collecting system has never been reported. We present a case of a 70-year-old man with a history of hematuria and a 3-cm polypoid mass in the right mid-pole of the right kidney that was detected by abdominal computed tomography. A retrograde study showed dilatation of the proximal segment of the right ureter, at which point it was duplicated. The patient was treated by right laparoscopic radical nephroureterectomy with extended tumor resection. The intraoperative findings were: a 3-cm cystic-appearing tumor with an intact overlying urothelium, a duplication of the right proximal ureter, one normal branch, and another branch that contained the origin of the tumor. Pathological examination revealed transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis. A congenital malformation of a duplicated renal collecting system combined with transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis is rare. <EOD> The Clinical Significance of the Fibrinogen/fibrin Ratio in Cancer Research

307,"[/INST] Persistent Smell Loss (Psychophysics of Olfaction) as a result of COVID is the result of damage to the main olfactory neuroepithelium, or the ability to smell odorants. This will lead to deficiencies in a variety of quality of life activities ranging from the inability to fully enjoy the sensory pleasure associated with smell, loss of ability to identify odorants, and potentially life threatening risks to safety (i.e. explosive materials, gas leaks, poisonous chemical exposures, spoiled foods). As the long-haul effects of COVID continue to be increasingly documented, the number of patients that will be seeking treatment for this common post-infectious sequel will only continue to grow. In addition to smell loss, the COVID-19 population faces lingering symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, mood, sleep, fatigue, autonomic symptoms, sensory dysfunction (hyposmia/dysgeusia), and neurological impairments. These symptoms will further affect the health, quality of life, and productivity of millions of people across the globe. Smell recovery in COVID-19 survivors will be paramount to recovery as they stare a global mental health epidemic. Despite the lack of understanding of causes underlying this olfactory dysfunction, clinic trials aimed at treating and recovering the long-term effects of olfactory disorders have emerged. While cognitive behavioral therapy in particular has been developed for other patients suffering with anosmia, the psychological components of this training are not well understood nor designed for the purpose. It is hypothesized that the inclusion of cognitive restructuring techniques that address cognitive dysfunction (executive dysfunction, depression, generalized anxiety, phantom or hypometastatic sensory-related symptoms) with olfactory training will lead to smell recovery, improvement in quality of life, cognitive function, and mood outcomes. This clinical trial will be the first to treat the post-infectious olfactory sequela and evaluate its effects on cognition, mood, sleep, anxiety, and quality of life through a comprehensive, multi-domain approach. <EOD> .

Ten female beagle dogs were inoculated in the uterus with 0.5 ml of broth culture of Escherichia coli. They were treated with 120 mg/kg of enrofloxacin, 95 mg/kg of sulfachloropyridazine, and 5.5 mg/kg of cephapirin hydrochloride, twice daily via a nasogastric tube for 10 days, prior to uterine flushing on the eleventh day. Efficacy of antibiotics was assessed clinically and by laboratory measures including microbiological (count, and biochemical and blood gas analysis. Results suggest that treatment with cephapirin, enrofloxacin was safe and effective in treating pyometra and resulted in markedly improved clinical condition. In comparison, treatment with sulchromycin and cephradin was safe but not as effective as enrofloxacin. <EOD> Efficacy and safety of combination and sequential oral medicine.

Device: Optical measurement

 Optical measurements by optical biometers and an OCT The primary objective is to evaluate agreement between each of the test devices and the predicate device, defined as the 95% limits of agreement (LOA), by comparing the average values of each test device with those of the reference.
 This analysis requires that data from the normal, cataract, and special eyes cohort are collated and compared to evaluate agreement and precision.
 In the first instance at each visit, a random order will be used for the four biometers. For each optical biometer, four measurements of two eyes will be required to calculate the mean value and SD for the overall population, or each subpopulation, separately. For the OCT, the 4 measurements will be performed on each eye.
 All data will be collated and sent to Medidata, who will complete the analysis (statistical programming & analysis) and prepare a report of the analysis that will be sent to the sponsor for scrutiny before final submission.
 The sponsor reserves the right to reject any data collected and/or to request that the study be repeated because of an insufficient number of patients, in which case, the sponsor will have no responsibility to complete any further measurements from the same patient. All measurements recorded will be used for data collection until such a time as they can no longer be used, or the sponsor requests further data to be collected in exceptional cases. In these instances, an additional protocol amendment must be completed.
 * Note: 4 measurements per eye (4 eyes/visit, total 16 measurements/visit); average of 12 measurements (normal cohort/eye) in OCT assessment; total of 12,400 optical biometer data points.

Primary Objective
Optical measurements by optical biometers and an OCT Precision of the test devices A crossed two-way random-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) model will be used to estimate the repeatability and reproducibility limits of each scan parameter by subject population and study device (test and predicate device). This ANOVA model will include the configuration, subject and interaction between configuration and subject as the factors. Repeatability and reproducibility standard deviations, as well as the corresponding coefficient of variations (CVs), will be calculated using this ANOVA model.
 This analysis requires that data from the normal, cataract, and special eyes cohort are collated and compared to evaluate repeatability and reproducibility.

 <EOD> Cytology of the endolymphatic duct in man.
In order to investigate possible ultrastructural similarities between the endolymphatic duct and the epithelium and the endolymph duct, 5 pairs from 5 autopsy cases are fixed by perfusion with normal saline after 3 h and isotonic sodium chloride after 2 days of fixation. The preparations are investigated under the electron microscope without applying contrasting media. The results show that epithelial cells of the endolymphatic duct and ductus reuniens are very similar to both, the glycocalyx-free and glycocalyx-protuberanted cells of the endolymphatic sac in man. The endolymphatic duct and ductus reuniens are of particular interest because of their possible secretory function.

Here, we report on a drug eluting device comprised of a biopolymer hydrogel imbedded in polycaprolactone (PCL) that delivers combinatorial dosing to suppress inflammation, and we report in vivo data in mice using Atorvastatin (ATOR), an inhibitor of cholesterol and steroid synthesis, and anti-inflammatory Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as a reference compound. ATOR was incorporated into the hydrogel at 9.8 mg/mL; ASA was incorporated at 3.8 mg/mL of the hydrogel. The hydrogel was loaded into a device imbedded in PCL. The in vitro study examined the release characteristics of the drug-eluting devices, which were characterized using a plate reader to measure the concentrations of the model drugs present in the surrounding solution. A rat in vivo study performed to show the efficacy of the imbedded polymer on inflammation reduction of the atherosclerotic plaque. An antiplatelet aggregation antibody was used to detect platelet adherence and aggregation and the expression of IL-6 inflammatory cytokine in plaque-tissues using Immuno-histochemistry. The results of this study show the device is an effective approach to treating atherosclerotic plaque formation to stop bleeding and formation of clots for treating patients with acute ischemic syndromes. <EOD> The AIDS pandemic in Central Africa: recent epidemiology.
1. The clinical picture of Central African human immunodeficiency virus (CA-HIV) infection differs markedly from that of other areas of the world. The acute form generally has a more severe clinical course that is often fulminant and frequently ends in death or severe deterioration. 2. The subacute form of the disease is usually characterized by a long-persistent fever with lymphadenopathy, and in the terminal stage, by a wasting syndrome. Bacterial infections and Kaposi's sarcoma are frequent causes of death. 3. The asymptomatic, preclinical CA-HIV infection in Africa is asymptomatically different from that found in the USA, Europe, Japan. It is usually a state of infection or wasting syndrome.

Critical Care Outreach Team Reduces Postdischarge Intensive Care Problems


The purpose of this study is a pragmatic randomized-controlled trial to evaluate the impact of a critical care outreach team on clinical outcomes (inpatient hospital length of stay, re-hospitalization within 30 days and unanticipated hospital death), as well as parent/caregiver satisfaction after a child’s discharge from ICU.









Trial design: This study is a pragmatic randomized-controlled trial.


Population: Adolescents (13-18 years old), children (5 -12 years old) and younger children (0 - 4 years old)














10 hospitals are participating. One hundred patients (50 in each treatment arm) will be recruited.



Treatment:






The intervention group received clinical support from the critical care outreach team for at least 24hours after discharge. Clinical support for the intervention group includes:

* A discharge and post ICU follow-up plan for patients and parents/caregivers
* Assistance and guidance with post-ICU problems


Control intervention:


Control group:
ICU staff will meet the patient's parents/caregivers and plan the follow-up care as usual, without assistance from critical care outreach team.









Secondary Outcomes:




Primary Outcome: ICU length of stay


Secondary outcomes will assess if the critical care outreach team impacts length of stay, medical cost, or mortality after discharge. Patient experiences are assessed by the modified Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Unit Family Impact Scale. Parents' experiences will be measured by the Post-traumatic Stress Symptoms Checklist-military version.


















Exclusion criteria:






This trial will exclude children who are discharged after death because no contact is possible after. All patients who are younger than 13 years old, who require follow-up care, or whose family members are not able to read English will also be excluded. Patients who are enrolled in another concurrent trial or who are admitted to ICU for less than 24 hours are also excluded from the study.







































Patient perspective:






A patient survey will be conducted at 30 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after discharge from hospital.





Parents:

Parents' survey will be conducted within 48 hours after discharge and 90 days after discharge from a child's hospital stay.







































Healthcare professional perspective : Healthcare professional will be sent an evaluation survey about the quality of care and experience of patient/parents.





















Objective:





The research team expects that this novel clinical trial would have a variety of innovative ways: a standardized critical care outreach service for all patients after discharge from pediatric intensive care unit, a quality-of-care index to evaluate health system performance, and a customized database system for the data collection process of clinical trials to be developed.



Eligibility Criteria for Participation:





To evaluate critically ill children, researchers recruited pediatric ICU (PICU) patients (age 28 days to 18 years) and their families who experienced PICU hospitalization in 12 hospitals in Quebec, Canada. The pediatric patients were"

Study Overview
=================
The intervention used in the study is Ayres Sensory Integration 1 (ASI) which uses sensory integration therapy. ASI is an intervention commonly used to treat autism and similar conditions. It is an evidence-based intervention 2 that can help children with ASD improve their ability to understand, process, and respond to environmental stimuli. The intervention has a variety of components such as occupational therapy, sensory motor, and parent training. This combination helps children with ASD become more efficient and effective communicators and social interactors. Occupational therapy is designed to improve functional skills and health of the child. The therapy focuses on understanding the child's sensory challenges, identifying appropriate activities that will assist in their success of reaching their full potential, and developing independence with these skills. Sensory motor therapy addresses sensory issues by providing an environment that helps children increase their processing of sensory information. Lastly, parent training will provide a variety of ways the child can be engaged at home with less challenging tasks. By using all three of these components, the child will be able to achieve their full potential and increase their independence. This therapy may be beneficial in helping children with ASD develop skills that will help them navigate the world more effectively and improve their quality of life.

Racial and ethnic minorities with autistic children experience delays in accessing occupational therapy services that can result in poorer outcomes, decreased quality of life, and increased parental and financial stress. However, many autism interventions were developed and tested with only White participants, assuming that they can be used as-is in minority groups. The findings of these studies were inconclusive, as they provide inadequate support for the effectiveness of most interventions for minority populations. Therefore, there is a need to investigate the effectiveness of therapies in minority groups. This project proposes to use a mixed methods design that will help identify which of the five engagement protocols (Design Thinking - DT and Focus Groups - FG) used for minority stakeholders are more likely to result in adequate participant engagement, cultural adaptation, and feasibility in the Hispanic and Latino autism community. The output of this project will provide useful information for community partners and policy makers who will use the data to advocate for and develop effective and culturally appropriate therapeutic interventions tailored to the Hispanic and Latino autism community.

Background
-----------------
Ayres Sensory Integration is an evidence-based intervention that can help children with autism and related conditions improve their communication, self-care, and overall functioning. The intervention was developed by  Dr. Jean Ayres in 1978 and consists of occupational therapy, sensory motor, and parent training components. Occupational therapy aims to improve the child's functional skills and increase their independence, while sensory motor therapy targets issues with sensory processing, and parent training aims to increase family's ability to access and support their child's therapy. Ayres sensory integration has been shown to be an effective intervention in improving the quality of life of children with sensory processing issues and other issues affecting day-to-day functioning.

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by restricted and repetitive behaviors, difficulties with social communication, and the presence of sensory processing issues. Individuals with ASD can struggle with sensory processing, which can lead to them experiencing sensory overload or underload, which can lead to emotional and behavioral issues. The symptoms of ASD can also make it difficult for individuals to participate in activities that require sensory processing and lead to limitations in their ability to communicate and interact socially. The prevalence of ASD has increased over the past few decades, with estimates rising from 3 per 10,000 in 1979 to 1 in 59 in 2018. ASD has a strong association with racial and ethnic minority groups. Studies suggest the prevalence of ASD is 15-20% higher in Hispanics and 34% higher in Blacks when compared to Whites. In the United States, Hispanic, Black"

 <EOD> Diagnostic and surgical procedures on a patient with right internal jugular venous hemangioma.
Intraluminal venous hemangioma of the internal jugular vein is an extremely rare entity. A 50-year-old man presented himself with a 9-month history of painless swelling over the right cervical, parotid, and submandibular regions. There were no remarkable associated signs or symptoms. Diagnostic catheterization of the inferior epigastric vein and the deep veins of the right axillary region were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a large mass in the right internal jugular vein. Surgical excision of the hemangioma was performed under the guidance of angiographically marked right external jugular vein. The right internal jugular vein was ligated to the right arm. Postoperative follow-up showed good venous patency. <EOD> Torsional Vibration of a Rigid Spherical Object in an Unsteady Flow at Very Low Reynolds Number



# Introduction
Studies of the motion of fluid around a spherical object are ubiquitous and include applications that range from fluid flow through human bronchoscopes to blood flow under laminar conditions inside heart microvessels. For large Reynolds numbers, it is well known, since the seminal paper of Bernoulliin the eighteenth century, that the motion of the fluid around any sphere is essentially rotational about some axis, which passes through the center of the sphere and perpendicular to the direction of the flow. This type of motion is called vortex. The presence of a vortex is due to the Coriolis force, which rotates any fluid element passing near a curved surface. The magnitude of the Coriolis force, F c , exerted on an object moving in a fluid is:
  F c = −(2/r) ∇v × ω = −2C Ω × v,(1)  
where r is the distance of any point in the fluid from the center of the sphere of interest, v is the fluid velocity in the direction of the motion, ∇ is the derivative operator in the direction of the radius vector from the center of the sphere to the point in the fluid, Ω is the angular velocity of the sphere in the laboratory frame, and C is a constant. The Coriolis force acting on a spherical object produces an instantaneous torsional force, which is proportional to the torsion of the object, and a torque, which tries to slow down the torsional rotation. Depending on the rotation period of the spherical object relative to the time scale of the flow in front of the sphere, the motion of the object may be steady, oscillatory, or chaotic. At a very low Reynolds number, the Coriolis force is proportional to the tangential velocity component. The latter is negligibly small at leading order in the low"

Recent advances in prostate imaging and radiotherapy technologies have led to a paradigm shift of radiotherapy in the management of prostate cancer. Prostate cancer is a common disease affecting men and its natural history remains controversial, despite a variety of approaches for evaluation and treatment. PSA is still the most widely used tumor marker for prostate cancer. It is a specific glycoprotein produced by the prostate gland and secreted into the blood. Increased serum PSA results from prostate cancer, inflammatory prostatic conditions, or benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It has been found to be a useful marker for early detection and management of the disease, but it is not tumor-specific and thus leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment   The diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer: a review, Litwin     Prostate carcinoma: a review of prognostic tools, Choong     Prediction of prognosis and disease aggressiveness by determination of serum insulin-like growth..., Chen  .

There is some clinical and experimental evidence suggesting that the standard of care, particularly for the advanced stage of prostate cancer, could be changed in the near future.
An integrated approach using various functional imaging technologies is considered to be a promising approach to provide comprehensive information regarding tumor behavior, leading to a more accurate definition of prostate carcinogenesis and the individualized patient management plan.
Prostate cancer has been observed to be a heterogeneous disease with some degree of metastatic ability from diagnosis. Prostate cancer is often clinically silent until a palpable tumor is detected on digital rectal examination or prostate specific antigen (PSA) is elevated.

 <EOD> Challenges and Opportunities in Translational Surgical Oncology Research. A Summary of the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Translational Surgery Committee
Surgery continues to be the most effective treatment for patients with advanced cancers, while also being central to successful long‐term survival in the case of early cancer. As the role of surgery increasingly extends into that of a neoadjuvant strategy, this annual session focused on translational research directed toward cancer surgery, and addressed specific research strategies for both targeted and systemic therapy, including immunotherapy, the identification of predictive and prognostic makers using genomics, proteomics, or metabolomics, and the integration of these data in patient management. <EOD> Flexibility in response to conflict in the anterior cingulate cortex.
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) has been implicated in the control of behavioral adjustments after conflict. Although human cingulate cortex is known to be anatomically heterogeneous, it remains uncertain whether single neurons are engaged in tasks emphasizing conflict resolution or in those emphasizing performance ongoing in the ongoing task. Recording single-cell discharges from the middle part of the medial frontal gyrus in monkeys performing a flanker task, we have found that some cells exhibited selectively enhanced firing rates when incongruent flanker stimuli appeared, whereas other cells showed increased activity only when specific stimulus combinations were presented. This distinction was also manifested at the population level; whereas response variability during correct responses was higher for incongruent than for congruent or mixed trials, the opposite effect was observed for error responses. An analysis of neuronal spike rates in both conflict types revealed a rapid switch from control to noncontrol conditions, characterizing ACC plasticity for resolving conflict. <EOD> High-intensity focused ultrasound guided by virtual sonography: a new option worth considering.
To the Editor: The study by Ghanem1 of High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) guided by high-resolution ultrasound for the treatment of thyroid nodules that are benign and of a volume that is greater than 5 mL provides important information. The study demonstrated that only 2 of the 15 patients experienced mild and transient symptoms, and that all nodules achieved volume reduction, with two-third of the nodules not requiring any treatment for an average follow-up of 24 months. It is known that thermal ablation is considered safe and effective for these cases,2,3 but there are still disadvantages concerning the accuracy of thermal ablation. First, the ability of HIFU to precisely target a small, deep-seated tumor has some limitations, so thermal ablation can still only treat larger nodules. Second, HIFU is not as minimally invasive as US-guided radiofrequency ablation (RFA), as the latter uses a smaller needle to deliver the current for thermal ablation and does not require anesthesia.

Mouse monoclonal antibody C7 to myxoma virus neutralized the virus in a complement-independent fashion. The neutralization of myxoma virus by C7 was effective against both intracellular and cell-free virions, whereas rabbit antisera against myxoma virus neutralized the virus only against intracellular virions. The neutralization activity of C7 was not inhibited by preincubation with myxoma virus-specific antigens. The neutralization specificity was analyzed using four myxoma virus strains. The results indicated that strains M16 1K and M16 5C were more sensitive to C7 than the other strains.

Input Text: Mentoring to be Active for Rural Appalachia Children

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Diet, Physical Activity, Fitness

Appalachians die more frequently and at younger ages from obesity-related conditions than those living elsewhere. High prevalence of overweight, obesity, and extreme obesity in Appalachian children increases the severity of diabetes. In rural Appalachia, the diabetes mortality rate is 11% higher than the national rate.Over the course of two years, this study will test the effects of the Mentored Planning to be Active + Family intervention on physical activity outcomes (MVPA, exercise bouts, sedentary behavior) and health outcomes (body composition: BMI, body fat, % body fat, weight) among rural Appalachian 7/8th grade children suffering from overweight and obesity. Having teens deliver the content via structured peer mentoring increases social support, motivation, and self-regulation to sustain PA behaviors to improve health outcomes as children enter high school. Using local residents for intervention delivery leverages rural Appalachians' preference to receive health information via established social networks and extends delivery of the program into the community. This study is a community-based randomized controlled trial targeting 7th grade students in rural Appalachia. Half (n = 144) will receive MPBA+F; the other half (n = 144) will receive self-guided (usual care) modules. Tenth-grade (n = 73) students from the same rural Appalachian counties will serve as peer mentors delivering MPBA for the peer mentoring group. Parents will provide a family reinforcement program during 8th grade and provide assessments of child behaviors and health outcomes. The long-term goal is to reduce the high rates of OW, OB/EO and type 2 diabetes in Appalachia youth through effective, sustainable interventions. Improving self-regulation, self-efficacy, and social support to increase intentional exercise and MVPA among underserved youth suffering from early-onset OB/EO builds healthier lifestyle behaviors at a critical development time.

The authors describe a case of recurring epibulbar tumor in an old male of 70 years of age. The epibulbous tumor was removed. Histology examination confirmed it was an adenoma sebaceum. No similar case was reported before. <EOD> Incomplete repair of chromosomal breaks caused by radiation
When irradiated mammalian cells are plated by means of mechanical disaggregation and incubated in the presence of actinomycin D they undergo a very large increase in the frequency of chromosome aberrations. It has been known for some time (Gross, 1950; Hopper & Catcheside, 1953 ; Puck & Marcus, 1957) that when the same cells are allowed to recover for 48 hr before plating chromosome aberrations are greatly reduced. One might expect that during recovery some sort of a repair mechanism becomes activated and is responsible for the reduction in yields of chromosome aberrations. The present experiments are concerned with this repair mechanism for the repair of radiation-induced chromosome breaks and its relation to the surviving fraction of cells. Although our experiments were performed with mammalian cells, they can be applied to the repair of chromosome breaks in any cell type. The method is similar to that of Cieslik-Bielicka (1964) who studied the effect of low-dose rates on chromosome aberrations and on cell proliferation, although she was apparently unable to get a stable cell line. All the cultures used in this work were derived from a single mouse. When a primary mouse tumour initiated by 3:2-benzpyrene was induced to grow subcutaneously (Henderson & Shore, 1951) a substrain was selected whose cells were plated and incubated without the addition of any colcemid. A cell strain was established which could be split and subdivided and which was free from spontaneous chromosome aberrations (Fenech, 1975). This strain of mouse cells was found to be highly susceptible to radiation-induced chromosome aberrations (Fenech, 1976a); the yields of aberrations are of the order of 1 chromosome aberration per 10 mitotic cells. <EOD> Molecular identification and characterization of a new D-galacturonic acid-producing lactic acid bacterium, Weissella malaysiensis sp. nov.
A number of novel LAB isolates, which were recovered from fermented foods and beverages, were found to degrade lactose and produce D-galacturonic acid (D-GalA). They were characterized taxonomically by analysis of 16S rRNA and housekeeping genes (rpoA, rpoB, and RP II).

Objectives: The PI3Ki AZD6482, targeted to p110α, showed promising activity against preclinical PIK3CA-mutant pancreatic and breast cancers. However, in melanoma patients, inhibiting a single isoform caused minimal benefit. Here, we investigated the potential therapeutic effect of p110α inactivation in melanoma models.Methods: Western blot analyses were used to confirm the activity of AZD6482 in A175. 2D cultures were used to show dose-dependent growth inhibition. Cell cycle analysis was conducted to show the mechanism of action of 3.36 pM of AZD6482. In vivo, A1649 and A175 melanomas were used to evaluate the effect that AZD6482 had on tumor growth.

This study was designed to investigate the neurologic symptoms, such as numbness and stinging, in pregnant women. These symptoms were mainly found in the cervical region of women during pregnancy. 1) The prevalence of neurologic symptom in 6 week to 39 week pregnant women. 2) A significant increased rate of numbness and tingling in 4th to 12th week of pregnancy compared to non-pregnant women (P < 0.05). 3) Stinging sensation in cervical region of 92.3% pregnant women. Stinging and burning sensation was found only in the cervical region of pregnant women. 4) The results suggest the numbness and stinging sensation in the cervix are the results of a change in the sensory system related to the endocrine changes during pregnancy. <EOD> The FDA has approved the use of a new 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring system called iHealth Star for people with diabetes.
The FDA has approved the use of a new 24-hour continuous glucose monitoring system called iHealth Star for people with diabetes. The system uses a plastic finger clip to transfer the 24-hour blood glucometer test to the hand, according to the product’s website.
According to the company, iHealth’s website, the sensor is easy to insert or remove and can transmit data wirelessly to an iHealth monitor or smartphone app.
The sensor can automatically detect when the skin has been disrupted, a feature that can avoid accidental sensor removal, the company says.
The iHealth sensor only works in conjunction with the iHealthStar reader and the iHealth Rx-52 monitor. The sensor sends a strong electromagnetic signal to these handheld devices, which then transmit information to the sensor, a process that lasts about 16 hours, according to the company.
The company notes that the sensor may be replaced every 30 days, using a special disposal box provided by iHealth, and the data is stored on the sensor itself for easy access. Data was stored on the device when there is no WiFi or 3G/4G device available for the user to connect to, the company says.
Users of the iHealthStar system must use the iHealthSTAR reader to transfer information about the sensor to the iHealthRx52 monitor, according to the company. The Rx52 device displays the user’s glucose readings in different colors, with the lowest being green and the highest being red, according to the company’s website.
The recommended price of the sensor is $39.99, with the purchase of one iHealthStar reader and one iHealthRx52 monitor for $159, while the purchase of two readers and two monitors will be $169, according to the company.
The US Food and Drug Administration announced in 2008 that the Glooko system was regulated as a glucose meter and medical device after it approved the product in November 2007, when it was known as the Raven. The product and all other products available on the market were not previously regulated as medical devices by the administration, as the US FDA’s Center for Devices and Recording does not regulate wireless medical devices, and Glooko began selling the product through the US Amazon as a glucose meter.
The new iHealthStar glucose sensor and glucose meter will be available starting Sept. 8, 2013. The device was cleared by the FDA as a Class II product to collect information for an unapproved glucose system for diabetes management. <EOD> Anticipated and observed work-related changes affecting physical activity levels and health of people with multiple sclerosis after job loss due to the pandemic

INTRODUCTION
An unusual case of retrograde acute appendicitis associated with a retrocaecal appendix has been observed.


CASE REPORT
A 20-year-old patient had suffered acute appendicitis for the past 5 days. During surgery, we found a retrocaecal appendix, the beginning of a retrograde appendicitis. The postoperative course was simple.


DISCUSSION THIS IS
the second case reported in literature. <EOD> Impact of COVID-19 on the clinic of general surgeons with a specialty in general trauma.
AIM
To assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general surgery in Austria based on the collective expertise of 2 trauma centers in Upper Austria, 5 general hospitals and 1 non-trauma center in Vienna.


METHODS
All centers were contacted after permission was obtained from the local Ethics Committees and agreed to participate in the study and to support the work with data collection. Data was collected retrospectively for the total month of April 2019 and 2020 at every hospital of the network involved (9 hospitals). Data was collected and analyzed for patient demographics, injury severity score, type of surgery or intervention, the frequency of surgery according to weekdays of admission and transfer times to and from the hospital. All data was anonymized and transferred to the Department of Surgery of the Medical University of Upper Austria, Linz.


RESULTS
In contrast to a reduction of surgical and nonsurgical interventions of 41% to 36% in the general trauma hospitals the Trauma Centers of Upper Austria had to accommodate 39 operations in that period (2019 vs. 2199; n.s.). The most frequent surgical interventions were laparoscopic cholecystectomy (18 vs. 61), hernioplasty (12 vs. 46), inguinal hernia repair (12 vs. 39) and laparoscopic appendectomy (3 vs. 19). There was no change in the ISS (2019 ISS: 10.8±7.4 vs. 2020: 11.4±7.5). The transfer times to and from the hospitals were not influenced by the pandemic (n.s.).


CONCLUSION
The impact of COVID-19 on daily clinical routine in trauma surgery was minimal over the observed period. The major changes were seen in the absolute numbers of surgical procedures performed during that month.


TRIGOS URGENT RESEARCH NEEDS
There is a need for randomized controlled studies which assess the relative influence of the pandemic on trauma workloads and surgical services in the future. We suggest that studies based on national datasets should be initiated to monitor and assess the evolution of pandemic-induced changes in clinic with regard to surgery and trauma workloads. <EOD> EFFECTS OF NALOXONE HYDROCHLORIDE ON BLOOD PRESSURE IN PATIENTS WITH RENAL FAILURE

BACKGROUND
Barium reflux testing is frequently performed prior to reoperative fundoplication despite conflicting evidence about its benefit. We assessed utility of endoscopy in patients with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms undergoing primary fundoplication. The study was conducted to: (1) identify predictors of pathology detected and (2) determine if patients who undergo endoscopy and pathology testing have a complication or reoperation rate higher than reexploration alone.


METHODS
Retrospective cohort study of patients from 1970 to 2010 undergoing reoperative fundoplication.


RESULTS
Two hundred ninety patients, with a mean age of 56.2 years (range: 22-77 years) and median follow-up of 5.9 years (range: 0.1-26.9 years), underwent primary fundoplication for medically intractable GERD. At time of reoperative fundoplication, 60% underwent endoscopy and pathology testing; 40% underwent reexploration alone. Pathology testing was 3.4 times more likely to be performed when endoscopy was performed (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.9-5.8). In the 111 patients with pathology results available, a Barrett's esophagus was detected in 26% (28); 74% were negative. Barrett's malignant transformation occurred in only 6 (1.7%), 2 with high-grade epithelial dysplasia. Endoscopy performed prior to reoperative fundoplication had no statistically significant detriment on complication (P = 0.26) or reoperation (P = 0.41) rates while patients undergoing reexploration alone had significantly more frequent complications (P = 0.004) and significantly more reoperations (P = 0.047). Eight patients (2.8%) had complications (4.3/100 reoperations), including reoperation for persistent respiratory symptoms (n = 3), perforation (n = 3) and unplanned reoperations not directly related to reoperation (n = 2).


CONCLUSION
Endoscopy was commonly performed in patients reoperated for severe GERD symptoms. Patients with negative endoscopy results had a complication rate and reoperation rate equivalent to reexploration alone. <EOD> Efficacy of a novel antimicrobial wound cle"

### Objective

The aim was to compare the effectiveness of high reality simulation and high reality and virtual reality based simulation applications on the simulation-based learning, reflective thinking and therapeutic communication skills of students in terms of improvement.

### Participants

The study took place during the 2021-2022 academic years.
Students participating in the 2nd academic year training module named ""Nursing Fundamentals -Care of the Patients in Hospital"" held at Hacettepe University Faculty of Nursing were included in the study.
The students in the experimental group (n=38) who received high reality simulation training, and the students in the experimental group (n=38) who received high reality and virtual reality simulation training were compared statistically.
Students were included in the study by determining to have voluntarily participated in the research and having given their signed written consent, being in the 2nd year study, not having participated in the high fidelity simulation and virtual reality based simulation training before, not having missed any theoretical and / or practical training lessons during the training period and not having participated in another research.

### Materials and methods

In all groups, the simulation-based learning scale, reflective thinking scale and therapeutic communication skills scale were applied to the students before their training and at the end of the training to determine the learning, reflective thinking, therapeutic communication.
A preliminary exam conducted on the training module ""Nursing Fundamentals -Care of the Patients in Hospital"" showed that the content areas of the module included in ""Diabetes Mellitus"" had the most theoretical and practical trainings. Therefore, in the study, the participants were planned to first complete the Pre-test by filling out the pre-test and high reality and / or high reality and virtual reality-based simulations, and to complete the post-test by filling out the post-test form after completing training.
The research was conducted in line with the principles of good clinical practice, and the clinical training was carried out in 2021-2022 academic years.
The high reality simulation and virtual reality simulation applications, ""Diabetes Mellitus"", were applied to the groups with a training date and time organized by the education administration of the faculty. The groups participating in the training received 9 high reality simulation, and 9 high reality and virtual reality simulation training applications on a bi-dimensional projector screen connected to a computer. For simulation-based applications, the educational area was arranged in a 3 * 6 meter and a 6 * 12 meter in the experimental group, and a 6-sided patient room was prepared, which was completely separated from the field of view.
The simulation-based application was conducted in a single group of 80-minute blocks for every training session. The high reality and virtual reality training application of 120-150 minutes was applied within 2 training sessions. The high reality simulation trainings were given with an educational approach of 1 hour by holding interactive face-to-face and informative applications. For the virtual reality-based simulation applications, the applications were made through a 360-degrees viewing application. The applications were made by taking real-life 360° photos in suitable situations for education and training.

Students were assigned to two groups. Training was arranged in line with the education programs in the curriculum. The research used the high reality simulation (training area / projector / computer) for both groups and the same virtual reality-based training (360° viewing program in line with teaching / simulator / application) application. For both high reality and virtual reality simulation applications only one simulation scenario was applied with 12 participants in each scenario. The simulation scenarios are;

## Presentation of a case
A 22-year female patient, with the diagnosis of osteosarcoma of the humerus, was referred to this center with the symptoms of gross hematuria and flank pain from one year ago. At presentation, she did not have any complaints. A history of chemotherapy was noted. Two years after initial presentation, a diagnosis of bone sarcoma of the left arm was made with the histopathological examination of the biopsy material. The patient was treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (VAC regimen). Three month after the completion of chemotherapy, after evaluation of the lesion by computerized tomography, metastases of the left axillary lymph nodes, left kidney, and left adrenal gland were determined. All 3 metastases were metabolically active on positron emission tomography scan.
A 2-stage resection was performed; a hemodilution chemoresection (papaverine) for renal metastases was added to the second surgery one year after initial presentation. As the urology department had not experience with this method, we performed the procedure in collaboration with an anaesthesiology and intensivist unit.
The hemodilution chemoembolization was performed using an intraarterial injection of papaverine (10 cc) administered through a catheter placed into the left interlobar artery within the 2 surgical sessions. After the injection of papaverine, a contrast medium injections of 0.5 cc was performed via the above-mentioned catheter in order to control the cystic appearance of the kidney after the chemotherapy injections. The cystic appearance of the kidney was evaluated by computerized tomography scan both before and after treatment. After the second surgery, the chemotherapy regimen started, including cisplatin, epirubicin, ifosfamide, and doxorubicin.
Two years after the chemotherapy, a control computerized tomography scan revealed no signs of active disease. A metastasis of the left axillary lymph node, which was inactive before the initiation of chemotherapy, became active, and so, a reassessment for the metastasis of the kidney was performed with a computerized tomography scan. The computerized tomography scan demonstrated a 5 cm mass in the left kidney and the upper pole, which was larger than the 1.5 cm mass, that was present before the chemotherapy.
After the surgical excision of the metastasis, histopathological evaluation revealed the osteosarcoma of the left kidney. The left adrenal gland pathology showed adrenal tissue with adrenal medulla tissue, without sarcoma cells, and negative immunohistochemical staining.
The patient's postoperative period was uneventful. The symptoms disappeared, with no complications, and the patient was discharged on the first postoperative day without any complications.
Computerized tomography scan demonstrated no recurrence of the disease, and this fact was evaluated after one year.

 <EOD> Intralesional Tranexamic Acid in Combination With Flap Preparation Before Extraction Sockets to Reduce Alveolar Ridge Resorption: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
PURPOSE
To evaluate the efficacy of intralesional tranexamic acid to reduce alveolar ridge resorption after tooth extraction.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
A triple-blind, parallel group, prospective, randomized clinical trial was carried out at the College of Dentistry, King Saud University. A total of 42 patients needing mandibular posterior tooth extraction were recruited. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: Group CX (control) composed of 21 patients who were subjected to extraction and flap surgery, followed by sutures, and Group BX (treatment) composed of 21 patients who were subjected to extraction, flap surgery, and application of 5% intralesional tranexamic acid. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurements (g/cm2) were measured using a cone beam computed tomography device. Measurements of the cortical bone thickness (CBT) at 4 sites of the socket (mesial/distal buccal or lingual and mesial/distal lingual) at the levels of crestal and apical bone were made. All measurements were taken at the day of extraction and after 6 months of healing. Differences in BMD values between the 2 groups, either at the day of extraction or after 6 months, and in the cortical bone thickness between the time of extraction and after 6 months of healing were analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures.


RESULTS
Twenty-one patients completed the study in the control group and 20 patients in the treatments group. The decrease in BMD for Group B at the coronal level was significantly higher than Group C (4.97 versus 4.11, P value = .03). There were negative percentages of reduction in BMD for both groups after six months, ranging from -1.41 to −0.33 for Group C, and ranging from -1.3 to −0.27 for Group B (P < .01). A significant higher percentage of reduction in BMD was observed in Group B compared to Group C at 2 sites, while at the apical level, only Group C showed a significant higher percentage of bone resorption. Buccal and lingual CBT were reduced and the reduction was higher in Group B compared to Group C at both the coronal and apical levels (P < .05). At the apical level, only Group B showed a considerable reduction in buccal and lingual CBT. Group C revealed a nonsignificant decrease in buccal and lingual CBT at the coronal and apical levels after six months, while Group B showed significant reductions in the thickness of cortical bone at the coronal (P = .02) and at the apical levels (P = .04), with the percentage of reduction varying from 62% to 140%.


CONCLUSIONS
The intralesional injection of 5% tranexamic acid following tooth extraction showed a positive influence on preventing the decrease of BMD and CBT after an extraction when compared to the placebo group. Moreover, the significant decrease in BMD as well as CBT after tooth extraction could explain the possible reduction of bone quality and thus may not be considered a reliable measure of alveolar ridge dimensional changes. <EOD> Anomalous left circumflex artery aneurysm: angiographic correlation for surgical management.

Objectives: To develop a sensitive, convenient, and rapid fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (FQ-PCR) method for the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Methods: The coding regions of RpoT gene and RPL2 gene were selected for primer design. The FQ-PCR was established based on TaqMan fluorescence probe technology. The test results were analyzed by 2(-DeltaDeltaC(T)). Results: The FQ-PCR standard curves of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv), M. avium, M. intracellulare, and M. kansasii were 43.28%, 92.04%, 93.64%, and 93.67%, respectively, and the PCR efficiency was above 96%. The amplification and detection limits of the FQ-PCR for the detection of mycobacterial pathogens were established at 663-1 000 genome copy numbers. The linear range of the FQ-PCR assay was 6.7-6.7×10(7) genome copies. Sensitivity, specificity, repeatability, and reproducibility were analyzed by using the FQ-PCR and the previously established gene X-prolylacyl-prolyl aminopeptidase P (PepA) method. Results showed that the FQ-PCR had 50% higher sensitivity than the PepA method. The sensitivity of the FQ-PCR for the detection of mycobacterial pathogens from clinical clinical specimens was analyzed in 200 clinical specimens. Compared with the PepA method, the coincidence rate was close to 97.5%, and the sensitivity was significantly improved. Conclusions: The FQ-PCR for the detection of mycobacterial pathogens has"

An 18-year-old woman was referred to the dermatology department for evaluation of papulonodular lesions on her chest, abdomen, and upper part of the thighs of six months’ duration. She had no mucosal, oral, or nail involvement. Family and medical history were unremarkable. She used hormonal contraception for the last three years without any problems. Dermatological examination revealed multiple reddish to brown, firm, well defined, non-follicular, papulo-nodular lesions on the chest, abdomen, and thighs (Figure 1). She had no lymphadenopathy. Chest radiography and high resolution scan were normal. We made the diagnosis of sarcoidosis based on the clinical and radiological findings. In particular, typical cutaneous sarcoidosis lesions including lichenified papules, subcutaneous infiltrates, and cutis anserina were present on skin biopsy. After diagnosis was established, immunosuppressive and topical corticosteroid treatments were commenced with good response. On a follow-up visit, the patient revealed that, two weeks after diagnosis, multiple red to brownish papulonodular skin lesions developed on her left palm, which were initially thought to be a staphylococcal infection but later on proved not to be an infectious process. There were a total of 32 papulonodular lesions on palm and left dorsal hand. These lesions were firm, nontender, movable to a certain degree, non-follicular, and free of crusts (Figure 2). There was no lymphadenopathy on the palm and all other systemic examinations were unremarkable. Serologic workup for connective tissue diseases was normal. Histopathological evaluation of the skin lesions on the hand revealed an intense perivascular and perifollicular lymphohistiocytic infiltration (Figure 3). The patient’s physical examination, histopathologic and laboratory findings led to the diagnosis of LS. Systemic corticosteroid treatment was discontinued. The lesions on left palm, abdomen, and upper portion of the thighs resolved completely. <EOD> Apoptosis of lymphocytes and monocytes and its relation to disease activity in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus: possible involvement of complement
The objective of this study was to investigate whether complement might mediate or promote apoptosis of T and B cells in patients with active SLE. Lymphocytes from SLE patients display a greater propensity to undergo apoptosis compared with lymphocytes from the control group. This increase occurs in both B and T cells with a particularly striking induction in T cells. Lymphocyte subpopulations, such as CD4 and CD8 T cells, are highly sensitive to complement‐induced apoptosis. The involvement of complement in lymphocyte death could be demonstrated by blocking the C5a receptor with RP‐76210 (6‐‐1,2,4‐triazoloquinazoline‐3,4‐dione), which attenuated the enhanced level of apoptotic cell death in SLE patients. In addition, CD4+ T cells from SLE patients expressed significantly higher levels of the membrane complement regulatory molecule CD59 than those from healthy controls, and blocking CD59 with monoclonal antibody enhanced apoptosis of CD4+ T cells in vitro. Our data support a model that lupus patient lymphocytes are primed for apoptosis in patients with active SLE and complement may have a substantial role in lymphocyte‐apoptosis and might be responsible for the decreased number of lym"

 <EOD> Envisioning the Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic: Trauma Nurses Forecast the Impact of COVID-19 on Violence and its Consequences
Supplemental digital content is available in the text. <EOD> Ovarian cancer stem cell markers and stem cell transcription factors: basic and clinical implications.
Ovarian cancer is one of the leading causes of gynecological cancer deaths in women after breast cancer. Since 100 years ago, surgical resection is generally recommended for the successful treatment of ovarian cancer patients. Unfortunately, most women are diagnosed in advanced stages when metastasis has already occurred. One of the obstacles is that early clinical symptoms of ovarian cancer are vague. Thus, ovarian cancer patients at advanced stages are usually considered incurable with the current standard of care, and chemotherapy is often used. Furthermore, despite chemotherapeutic agents are available, patients might face unpredictable side effects, resulting in low quality of life and/or high level of morbidity. Even, chemotherapy might fail to improve patients' survival in long-term treatments. Recently, cancer stem cells (CSCs) are suggested to be responsible for tumor relapse after chemotherapy. CSC-targeted therapy might be a powerful tool for ovarian cancer treatment. In this review we focused on the importance of CSCs in both ovarian cancer development and relapse, and introduced CSC markers to identify potential CSCs and its signaling mechanisms in ovarian cancer. In addition, we propose CSC-targeted therapies involving chemotherapeutic agents and targeted therapies and discuss the necessity of biomarker-based clinical trials. <EOD> Preoperative Evaluation of the Proximal End of the Tibia After an Oncologic Resection by Computed Tomography and Multiplanar Reconstruction
Background: Oncologic resection of the proximal part of tibia is indicated for tumors extending into the proximal tibia and fibula and involves wide surgical margins. The proximal bone segment may have to be resected. Because the proximal and distal tibial segments are structurally and functionally different, preoperative planning for a total tibial replacement is essential to provide the best outcome. Although computed tomography (CT) is a well-known technique for evaluation of the distal tibial segment, there is no standard method for evaluation of the proximal tibial segment. The objective of this study was to describe the use of CT with multiplanar reconstructions as a tool in an evaluation of the proximal end of the tibia after an oncologic resection. Methods: We reviewed 19 patients with bone tumors of the proximal part of the tibia or metaphyseal/diaphyseal tumor. The CT images, magnetic resonance images, and plain radiographs were compared to determine the tumor extent, proximal bone segmental involvement, and the need for additional resection. Results: Magnetic resonance imaging confirmed tumor involvement in 18 of the 19 cases. CT was crucial in determining the proximal extent in 10 of these patients, and multiplanar reconstructions in 8 of the remaining 8 cases. Tumoral extension into tibial diaphysis and partial segmental involvement, which require additional resection of the proximal part to achieve negative margins, were identified in 7 of the 18 patients. Conclusion: CT is an asset for preoperative planning of a wide surgical resection to achieve negative margins, especially in patients with metaphyseal and diaphyseal tumors.

Cefdinir at concentrations achieved in human serum, ie, 0.2 and 2 micrograms/ml, had no significant effect on the killing of four strains of Staphylococcus aureus and of two strains of Staphylococcus epidermidis by human neutrophils. These results indicate that this cephalosporin does not interfere with the neutrophil activity which would be necessary for optimal therapy of systemic infections caused by S. aureus and of those caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci. <EOD> The Coxsackie virus type 4 VP1 residues 165, 171, 173 and 175 in neutralization epitope 1 of the surface loop are essential for virulence in mice
The RS domain is a 221‐residue‐long and conserved surface loop in the structure of the major immunogenic P2 domain of the Coxsackie virus type 4 (CVB4) VP1 and the majority (∼80%) of CVB1 and CVB3 VP1s. The role of the RS domain in CVB virulence in mice and as a major neutralization epitope is not clear. We identified three amino acid residues (165, 171, 173 and 175) in the RS domain as being involved in neutralization by a CVB4 monoclonal antibody (MAb). By using an enzyme‐linked immunosorbent assay, it was shown that the 2C12 MAb recognizes the RS domain residues 169, 171, 173 and 175. Site‐directed mutagenesis of amino acids 165, 171, 173 or 175 of the RS domain abolished virus replication in monkey and HeLa cell cultures. In contrast, the RS domain mutant of CVB4 (C‐ΔRS) did not replicate in BALB/c mice or neonatal rats. Intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected mice showed clinical symptoms of diseased virulent CVB4 infection within 68 h after C‐ΔRS injection (42 ± 3.0), which were significantly delayed compared with 26 · 4 ± 1.4 h, 24 · 2 ± 1.8 h and 20 · 3 ± 0.7 h for wild‐type CVB4, CVB1 and CVB3 (P = 0.0001). C‐ΔRS also did not replicate in the hearts of i.p. injected mice 168 h post inoculation. Taken together, the RS domain is necessary for CVB4 growth and for systemic replication of the virus in the target‐mouse organs, the heart and kidneys. Therefore, this loop may be a promising target for neutralization and neutralization‐based immunotherapy. <EOD> The association between body mass index and coronary artery calcification among overweight and obese young adults.
BACKGROUND
Obesity is a major public health issue in the United States associated with risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD), including type II diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Coronary artery calcification (CAC) is a risk factor for future coronary events, especially among young adults. It is unknown if high-normal body mass index (BMI) elevates CAC risk, while other cardiovascular risk factors are normal.


METHODS
Blood specimens were obtained from 197 subjects age 18-21, 36 boys and 161 girls, between 2005 - 2007; subjects are all non-Hispanic white race/ethnicity. BMI was normal"

# Abstract
A 10,000 to 11,000 word summary is required as a separate text file to accompany all submissions. These summaries are double screened, double edited, and are the only part of the manuscript which all referees read. They therefore have a direct, although indirect, influence on the fate of all manuscripts. The Editors emphasise that these short summaries are used to help the referees get the gist of the paper, not to replace the review which follows. The reader should learn enough to judge whether the paper is suitable for publication. As the Abstract is used for indexing, its content is expected to follow the same categorisation, i.e. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) used in the MESH (Medical Subject Heading) database . The Summary is not a synopsis: the text should present the information with neutral tone; it needs to be short and succinct. It is important to present the key messages in an attractive, intelligent layout, using descriptors and key words. The main text body and the discussion should be brief, but this is not the case of the summary: here you should focus on the key factors of your study, the new methodological or conceptual issues that arise, the most innovative aspect or the most important finding. Please try to provide a concise description that will help readers to decide whether the study is for them or not.
The abstract should be structured as follows and not too lengthy or complicated: Title - Author list (include your name and affiliation)

Sera from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) were shown to suppress the growth of uninfected myeloid leukemia cells in vitro. Using the human myeloid‐leukemia cell line ML‐1, we studied the inhibitory effect of serum on colony formation by ML‐1 cells infected with the oncoretrovirus MSV‐g3 (ML‐1‐MSV‐g3). The suppressor factor was identified as interleukin 3 (IL 3) and its functional receptor. <EOD> Diffusion, depletion and swarming.
The diffusion of point particles in three-dimensional lattices is discussed in terms of the distribution of the total volume of the void space. This leads to a simple criterion for the swarming of the particles. The criterion predicts that the equilibrium distribution will swarm and that it should occur in a nonequilibrium steady state where particles are constantly leaving the system via an open boundary. Numerical verification of the criterion is found in a one-dimensional lattice of harmonically interacting particles. A number of physical models and their analogues among natural phenomena are examined using the criterion. An attempt is made to understand the results in connection with experiments in animal spatial distributions. <EOD> The genetics of neurogenetic disorders.
In the last 10 years, our understanding of the genetic basis of human neurogenetic and neurodevelopmental disorders has radically increased. The recent progress made within several conditions has not been limited to the identification of common and rare mutations, but has led to an unprecedented genetics revolution by shedding light on their pathogenetic underpinnings. <EOD> Role of Cdc25A tyrosine phosphorylation in the modulation of mitogen‐activated protein kinase activities and interleukin‐2 production in T lymphocytes
Cdc25A, a dual‐specificity phosphatase of MAP kinase, is tyrosine phosphorylated in response to mitogenic stimuli in T cells. Here, we show that such phosphorylation is induced as early as 1–5 min after T cell stimulation, but tyrosine phosphorylation is maintained at the peak levels throughout the period of 0–60 min of the induction of mitogenesis. Using an antiserum directed against Cdc25A phosphorylated on Y250, we demonstrate in this report that mitogen‐activated protein kinase (MAPK) tyrosine phosphosphatase activity is inactivated in response to T cell stimulation. This is in parallel to a marked reduction of ERK activity. Since ERK inactivation is mediated through the phosphatase activity of Cdc25A, we conclude that tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc25A is responsible for inhibition of ERK activity. The tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc25A is also found to be accompanied by a marked reduction of tyrosine phosphorylation of its substrate, MAPK. The transient tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdc25A following T cell stimulation is thus shown to be involved in the modulation of its specificity of action on the mitogen‐activated MAPK. Moreover, we demonstrate that inhibition of Cdc25A by its tyrosine phosphorylation leads to inhibition of T cell interleukin‐2 synthesis by inactivating ERK, suggesting that the enzyme can be involved in the regulation of IL‐2 production. <EOD> Phosphoinositide signaling in Dictyostelium: a network of core signaling pathways and effector proteins in chemotaxis and aggregation.
All extracellular signals are transmitted through the plasma membrane before they reach their receptors within the cell.

Dictyostelium discoideum cells are known to signal through three PLC-coupled phospholipid-signaling pathways, activated by adenylyl cyclase, cAMP receptors, and cGMP recept"

Summary
----------------------------------
 The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree of improvement in speech function after treatment in a group of children with CPV who will receive a PF surgical treatment, and to investigate the correlation between the results of both patient- and parent-reported outcome measures. This will make us establish a gold standard for speech function and quality of speech evaluation after surgical treatment in children with CPV.

Background
--------------------------------
 Velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is the abnormal function of the soft palate or velum, and therefore results in inadequate phonation and/or a speech articulation error on the nasal or velar sounds.1-3 It is a common condition following surgical treatment of cleft palate, the incidence varying from 16-90%.3 The surgical correction, pharyngeal flap (PF), is performed when a speech therapist detects poor speech outcome after palatal repair.3 The outcome is defined by the speech pathologist based on the clinical assessment of the patient's nasal resonance, velopharyngeal motion and nasometer findings in speech.4 It is a subjective assessment that lacks the objectivity or the gold standard to evaluate the degree of speech improvement after surgical treatment.

Background: Why Was this Study Done?
----------------

Several studies have been conducted on pharyngeal flap surgery for correction of speech and voice problems5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,2 and all conclude on improvement of speech quality. However, a gold standard to assess speech function in connection to surgical treatment using pharyngeal flap has not been established. The aim of this study is to evaluate the degree of improvement in speech function after surgery in a group of children with CPV who will undergo a PF surgical treatment for correction of their VPI, and to investigate the correlation between the results of both patient and parent reported outcome measures. With these results, we will then establish a gold standard for evaluation of speech function and quality after PF surgical treatment in children with CPV.

Summary 2 - Author/Facility: [/INST] Centre Hospitalier Valida
Description


Background:
[/INST] Surgical procedures to correct pelvic organ prolapse are associated with a series of complications caused by vaginal cuff dehiscence, the most serious complication of which is a vaginal wall hematoma with bleeding, which necessitates surgical intervention. Such complications, whose incidence varies between 0.5% and 14%, are the most frequent causes of urinary retention; they are also responsible for a significant number of morbidity events such as hemorrhage and wound infection, and sometimes even mortality (0.1% of cases).

[/INST]
Although no evidence-based recommendations are currently available, the most frequently cited literature advocates for the use of non-absorbable sutures, and the technique used for laparoscopic colporrhaphy is of particular interest given that it is directly related to a surgeon's expertise. This study aims to compare the advantages of two surgical models consisting of two types of materials used for suturing the vaginal wall.

[/INST]

Objectives:
[/INST] To evaluate the effectiveness of barbed absorbable sutures for vaginal cuff closure after laparoscopic hysterectomy compared to that of standard absorbable sutures. Secondary outcomes are the hospital stay, postoperative complications within 90 days, the quality of life index and the sexual function (vaginal function index) at day 90

[/INST]
Methods


Patients and Design:
[/INST] The study consists in a single-blind, randomized, parallel-group and prospective protocol. Sixteen patients are being assigned to receive laparoscopic colporrhaphy with 0-caliber barbed absorbable sutures. On the other hand, another 16 patients, who are identical on the baseline measurements, will receive laparoscopic colporrhaphy with 0-caliber standard absorbable sutures. The primary outcome concerns the rate of complications requiring recourse to surgery in relation to complications requiring clinical monitoring only and in comparison with the control group. Secondary outcomes have been selected as to their importance in the daily practice of general and obstetric gynecology.

Aim:
[/INST] The study has the aim to compare the effectiveness of two different surgical models on which patients will be distributed, for the purpose of treating vaginal wall dehiscence (primary outcome) in relation to complications requiring clinical monitoring only and with respect to the control group. Secondary outcomes have been chosen as to their importance in the daily practice of general and obstetric gynecology.

Timing:
12 months are required to recruit 24 patients.

Setting:
[/INST] Data are collected in medical wards of Centre Hospitalier Valida, Tunis.

Sample Size:
[/INST] This study has been designed as a monocentric, randomized, blinded, and parallel-group interventional trial with a 2x2 table and using a noninferiority sample size estimation. A global α risk of 5% is used for this trial. The overall power is 80%, and the estimated proportion of compliant populations is 0.15, while the non-inferiority margin has been defined by consensus as 0.0744. The total sample size is 48 patients (24 per group).

-----------------------
This project is designed to test a neurobiological model of gambling addiction that considers inter-individual differences and the multifactorial nature of the disease. Researchers hypothesize that there are two opposite brain phenotypes in gambling addiction: striatal hyper-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hypo-reactivity to emotional stimuli, and striatal hypo-reactivity to reward combined with amygdala hyperreactivity to emotional stimuli. These phenotypes are hypothesized to characterize two distinct subpopulations of gamblers: impulsive and emotional gamblers, respectively. The primary hypothesis is tested in the lab by determining whether the impulsive and emotional phenotypes are characterized by diametrically opposed brain reactions to reward and emotional stimuli, respectively. The secondary hypothesis is tested in real life by testing the hypothesis that brain phenotypes are capable of predicting a link between emotions and gambling behavior in gamblers' everyday lives.

Low-dose, long-term oral imatinib (IM) can induce durable hematological and cytogenetic responses in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), but not in patients with aggressive CLL. We report the results of the oral administration of 800-mg IM therapy in ten patients with symptomatic and/or progressive CLL. IM was started at 200 mg daily to achieve a steady-state plasma level (AUC 50 microM x min). The median cumulative dose administered was 5760 mg (ranging 1080-12240). Seven patients (70%) experienced hematological responses and 60% had cytogenetic responses. One patient developed a grade II-III anemia, 6 patients a grade I-II neutropenia and 4 patients a grade II-IV thrombocytopenia. The maximum cumulative dose of IM tolerated was 12,240 mg. A dose reduction was necessary in 4 patients. IM therapy induced long-lasting stable complete remission in 2 patients and partial remission in 3 patients; the response was stable in 1 of the cases. It is concluded that IM is effective to induce durable hematological and cytogenetic responses in patients with stable and advanced CLL. It is not clear whether the therapeutic index of IM may result in improved survival in patients with CLL. <EOD> Prenatal Exposure to Ambient Fine Particulate Matter and Blood Pressure at 12 and 24 Months of Age.
Background and Objectives: Exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (EFPM) and its constituents is positively related to blood pressure (BP) among adults. Whether EFPM is related to childhood BP is not known. We examined EFPM in the first year of life and 24-month BP. Methods: EFPM was determined in children who had 24-hour urine samples collected at 12- and 24-month follow-up visits in Project Viva, a 20-year study (2002-2022) of children born at 13 hospitals in eastern Massachusetts. We determined EFPM mass and estimated EFPM constituents (elemental mass and organic mass) in the 12-month samples and mass and isotopic EFPM in the 24-month samples. Urinary EFPM was adjusted for creatinine; blood pressure was determined as the standardized deviation score (SDS) from normative (healthy) children. Results: We analyzed 12- and 24-month EFPM data in 400 (13%) and 748 (23%) children. The correlation between EFPM mass at"

Input Text: Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth in Critically Ill Patients

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) remains to this day a syndrome that is not fully understood. Initially, it was considered quite rare, but today there are reports suggesting a SIBO prevalence between 6 to 15% of healthy, asymptomatic people and reaching 80% in patients with irritable bowel syndrome. It is often involved in various disorders, such as diarrhea and malabsorption. It is defined as an increase in the number and/or disturbance in the type of bacteria in the upper part of the intestinal tract. SIBO occurs when the homeostatic mechanisms of the small intestine are disturbed. The two main conditions that favor microbial overgrowth in the small intestine are decreased acid secretion from the stomach and small bowel dyskinesia. The literature is scarce concerning the effects of SIBO on critically ill patients. To our knowledge this is the first study investigating the effects of SIBO on mechanically ventilated patients. It is a non-invasive observational study employing a modified technique to obtain exhaled air from the ventilator tubes to perform a standard hydrogen breath test for SIBO diagnosis. Lactulose is used as a substrate. Specifically, each patient is administered 20 g of lactulose diluted in 400 ml of water through the nasogastric tube. Measurements are performed at 0-15-30-45-60-90-120-180 min from lactulose administration. During measurements, a valve attached to a collecting bag at the end of the expiratory limb of the breathing circuit, is kept open and the collecting bag is filled by several patient exhalations. After valve closure and bag isolation, the air is drawn by a 50 ml polyethylene syringe which is connected to the valve system to prevent losses and/or contamination. Then the air is blown into the breath hydrogen monitor and the expired hydrogen measurement is recorded. The hydrogen breath test is repeated at predetermined, protocol-based time intervals for all participants included in the study; 1st/day of admission, 3rd, 5th and 7th day of ICU stay. The 1st day measurement serves as a measure of eligibility, and patients exhibiting abnormal values of hydrogen breath testing at Day 1 are excluded from the study. An increase by more than 20 ppm of eH2 from baseline within 90 min was considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. Moreover, an increase by more than 12 ppm of eH2 from baseline within the first 30 minutes followed by a second rise within the next 15 minutes (double peak) was also considered an abnormal measurement suggesting SIBO. The primary objective of this study is assessment of the prevalence of SIBO on critically ill mechanically ventilated ICU patients. Secondary outcomes include investigation of the effects of SIBO on ventilator associated pneumonia, as well as ICU length of stay and allcause in-hospital mortality rate in critically ill patients. The number of days from enrolment to a) discharge from hospital or death; or b) day 28; or c) day 60 after discharge from hospital, whichever should follow in the order above.

The Effect of Exercises of Different Intensity Applied After Total Knee Arthroplasty on Exercise-Induced Hypoalgesia: Randomised Controlled Trial

Summary:
Patients undergone total knee arthroplasty (TKA) hospitalized for > 7 days randomly assigned to either HIE group or LIE group. The HIE group undergone five sets of 15 repetition knee extensor for muscle strengthening and TKA-specific exercises. The LIE group undergone two sets of 8 repetition knee extensor for muscle strengthening and TKA-specific exercises. The pain severity assessed by Visual Analog Scale(0-10 mm). Change of Pressure Pain Thresholds (PPTs) were measured over quadriceps and biceps brachii (mmHg) and muscles immediately before and after exercise. The authors compared the two groups for change of pain severity and change of PPTs.

Background
In patients after total knee arthroplasty (TKA), the pressure pain threshold (PPT) on the paretic limb is 2-20 mmHg less than on the non-paretic limb 1, 2 . Exercise induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is a reduction of pain in response to a noxious stimulus after an exercise of higher intensity than one used in the noxious stimulus 3 . The EIH was tested to see whether muscle damage is caused by a different exercise intensity and by the time that has passed after the exercise 3 .
EIH can be tested on individuals experiencing pain. EIH should be tested on patients with chronic pain. EIH is not tested on patients after TKA 4 . EIH was assessed by using the standardized noxious stimulation methods (high temperature or electrical). These methods are not suitable to use in patients with reduced skin sensitivity such as patients with diabetic complications, nerve or ganglion damage. The EIH assessment on TKA patients using a pressure algometer to assess skin sensitivity might be a more suitable method in patients following TKA 5 .
Introducing new physical exercise to patients following TKA could be a challenge. The patients might experience pain and discomfort in response to an exercise that is not very intensive. In patients with knee pain after TKA in which there is a low quadriceps strength 6 , introducing an intensive exercise program might produce pain and discomfort. A high intensity exercise program (HIE), for example, is a physical exercise that requires a patient to perform a physical exercise above his ability. Patients who perform a high-intensity exercise would experience pain and discomfort when they were unable to maintain the exercise 7,8 . A low-intensity exercise program (LIE), for example, is a physical exercise that requires the patient to match his ability 7 . The patients who perform a low intensity exercise would not experience pain and discomfort when they were unable to perform the exercise 7,8 .
To the best of our knowledge, no randomized controlled trial evaluated the effect of EIH on exercises of variable intensity compared to HIE and LIE in patients following total knee arthroplasty.
The aim of this study was to investigate whether EIH is present following exercise in patients following total knee arthroplasty and if so, if it changes with exercise intensity.

Purpose
To evaluate the effect of EIH on exercises of variable intensity compared with HIE and LIE in patients following TKA. The hypothesis is that EIH will be present in patients with TKA and that the intensity of the pain will change with exercise.

Background
Patients with knee pain after TKA experience altered pain sensitivity 6 . There was a low quadriceps strength in patients with knee pain after TKA 6 . Exercise might facilitate EIH 7,8 . Patients have low-intensity pain that does not impede exercise 8 . No studies assessed the relationship between HIE and LIE on EIH in patients with chronic pain 7-10 .

Research Questions

1. Does HIE increase and LIE will decrease on EIH in patients following TKA?
2. Does EIH change with exercise intensity on patients with knee pain following TKA?

 <EOD> Correlation of endoscopic morphological findings and pylorus-ligated duodenogastric reflux in dogs.
The relationship between endoscopic morphology and findings of pylorus-ligated duodenogastric reflux was investigated in 27 adult mongrel dogs. Endoscopic examinations were performed prior to and after pylorus-ligation and on successive days 6, 24, 48 and 72 hours later. Following pylorus-ligation, gastric changes were not observed on endoscopy until 6 hours later and, subsequently, these changes increased in frequency and severity. On Day 2 of observations, most dogs showed severe changes in the form of thickened rugae and whitish or yellowish patchy mucosal hyperplasia. These changes decreased in frequency and severity during subsequent observations, except that at 72 hours after pylorus-ligation, a group of dogs showed persistent gastric changes, in addition to those observed on the previous day. Pylus-ligated duodenogastric reflux was assessed by serial changes of acidic gastric content, as determined by titratable acidity and pH. After pylorus-ligation, titratable acidity and pH were decreased on days 4 to 24 following surgery and then restored to the baseline levels. There was a significantly negative correlation between the endoscopic score and the titratable acidity. Therefore, it is suggested that a relationship exists between certain endoscopic morphological findings and gastric acidity in pylorus-ligated dogs. <EOD> .
Surgical complications in the intra- or post operative course of 244 paracenteses (129 therapeutic paracenteses, 115 paracentesis procedures, 3078.9 drainage procedures performed in 9126 patients), most of them performed by interventional radiology or gastroenterology, are evaluated retrospectively. There were 15 patients (2.1%) on the average with surgical incidents. Twelve of these 15 patients developed a hemorrhagic complication. Eight of these were caused by paracenteses while 4 complications occurred after therapeutic or diagnostic procedures. In 4 instances a paracenthic perforation was detected in an ultrasound examination or x-ray. This number increases to 8 paracenthic perforations if a liver biopsy is added. After therapeutic or diagnostic paracenteses the paracentesis catheters were usually removed on day four after paracentesis. 80% of the catheters were removed on day three and at the latest on day five. Hemobilia was the most common surgical complication caused by paracentesis catheters. The incidence of hemobilia caused by paracentesis catheters was about 2.5%. After therapeutic or diagnostic percutaneous transhepatic bilioduodenal drainage insertion the drains were usually removed on day 14 or day 18. A drain removal after one week will increase the risk of developing a hemorrhagic incident, and at the latest after removal of the drain on day 14. In summary, the incidence of surgical complications following percutaneous procedures is on average every 2 to 3 procedures. <EOD> .

Compounds 1, 2a, and 4a can easily be isolated as the hydroiodic acid salts by acidifying in anhydrous acetonitrile the respective Cr(III)-DADPm(OTf)(-) salts. The monosubstituted compounds 2b and 4b have been obtained by replacing one bromine atom in compounds 2a and 4a, respectively, by sulfur. Compounds 1 and 4a crystallize in the monoclinic space group C2/c, while the other compounds crystallize in the triclinic P-1 space group. Compound 1 is characterized by two-fold pseudosymmetry, due to half-site inversion, and in all the other cases by threefold site symmetry. Compound 1 behaves in most cases as a weakly bound complex. However, in aqueous solution, a reorganization occurs resulting in a 1:1 electrolyte, namely, trans-. In CH3CN/water (1:1), the complex cation and the unbound anion exhibit twofold symmetry and are arranged head-to-head to give a 2:1 aggregate. An inspection of the crystallographic data of the complexes, compounds 2a-b, 3, and 4b, reveals that the compounds crystallize in the hydrated state; the crystal lattice consists of either a 1D chain of molecules or 2D grids containing aqueous and organic species and hydrogen-bonded water molecules. <EOD> TPX2 regulates the function of EB1 in hepatocellular carcinoma

Background: Extra-binding domain (EB1) and thymosin-β-4-x linked protein 2 (TPX2) is involved in centrosome duplication, mitotic spindle assembly, chromosome congression, and mitosis progression in many tumors. However, the interplay between EB1 with TPX2 and its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still elusive.Methods: The roles of EB1 and TPX2 on HCC growth were studied by cell cycle arrest, proliferation in vitro and vivo, cell cycle, cell proliferation and cell apoptosis analysis. The expression levels of EB1 and TPX2 in HCC were detected by IHC staining. Finally, the in vivo and in vitro effects of TPX2 and EB1 inhibition on HCC were tested.Results: Through gene expression profiling (GEP) and bioinformatics analysis, EB1 and TPX2 were selected as novel target proteins of HCC. And, the expression levels of EB1 and TPX2 were significantly different in HCC and paired paracancer tissues. The expression of TPX2 was positively correlated with the expression of EB1, which may participate in the occurrence and development of HCC. Silencing or overexpression experiment indicated that EB1 and TPX2 were key proteins in HCC cell proliferation and apoptosis. However, we found that EB1 or TPX2 did not have an obvious effect on the cell cycle. These results were further confirmed by the analysis of the expression level of EB1 and TPX2 during the development of HCC by staining. Silencing TPX"

 <EOD> Exploring Healthy Life Expectancy Among Adults in Brazil and its 26 States Using Bayesian Multi-Cause Hazards Regression

Introduction: Brazil is one of the largest countries in the world with great socioeconomic and health inequalities between its cities. This study sought to describe and forecast mortality trends by age, sex and geographical region and estimate deaths to reach life expectancy based on multiple causes of death in Brazil.Methods: Data were used on estimated mortality and life expectancy of 26 states in Brazil, from 1990 to 2015, and projected from 2016 to 2025. The model used the Bayesian Multi-Cause Hazards Regression model. The model includes demographic components, gender, ethnicity, geographical region, economic indices and life expectancy.Results: Total mortality exhibited no changes between 1990 and 2010 on the population above 50 years old, and showed a fall in 2015 and 2016 (− 0.1% and − 0.7%, respectively). The highest percentage points of change in 2015 were in elderly in southern Brazil and elderly women, followed by adults in North-South. The 2015 reduction of 0.24% to life expectancy at birth suggests that there was a relative reduction of 0.28% to 66.97 years. Elderly women and adults registered the highest percentage points of life expectancy increase between 1990 and 2015. Southeast and women recorded the highest increase of deaths per 100,000 inhabitants from 1990 to 2025 (4.5% and 4.3%), followed by North (3.4%) and women (2.0%). The highest increase of deaths from external causes is in men in Northeast (+ 5.9%), followed by men in Southeast (+ 4.7%), women in Southeast and Rio de Janeiro (+ 4.2% each), and men in North-South and women in Rio de Janeiro (+ 4.1% each).Conclusion: In a country where the socioeconomic disparity reaches the poor regions for the rich ones, Brazil reached an important progress in life expectancy between 1990 and 2015, mainly due to a decrease in mortality among poorer regions and elderly. This progress was affected, however, by the reduction in life expectancy in 2015 and 2016, followed by the increase of deaths from external causes.

# Introduction
Population ageing is a demographic phenomenon that impacts countries and requires healthcare systems to be configured to provide universal access to health, considering the complexity of demands of the elderly population. The elderly population has been increasing in all world regions and even though most countries, such as Brazil, are already observing this phenomenon, it is still considered to be in its early stage, since the proportion of the elderly is low. Therefore, it is not yet a burden for any demographic system.
The world has an enormous diversity among its geographical areas, due to the social, economic and cultural aspects. Among other factors, this makes it difficult to understand the influence of external causes of death on the mortality rate. In this regard, the study of the external causes of death is, at present, an area of interest for public health   Mortality due to external causes in Brazil from 1980 to 2015: descriptive..., Souza Silva   , since the data on these causes of death can be considered indicators of the public health system   Mortality by external causes in Brazil and in the world in the..., Moura  .

In Brazil, the elderly population comprised 11.6% of the total population in 2017 and 81.78% of the population was 60 years or older in 2018, while women older than 80 years accounted for 9.5% of the total population.

BackgroundProstaglandins and NO produced by prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-2 are involved in central and peripheral pain. In a dose-dependent manner, bupivacaine, a local anesthetic, has been reported to cause nociceptive, inflammatory, and neuroinflammatory pain. The aim of this study was to examine whether NO or prostaglandins are responsible for bupivacaine-induced pain and nociceptive responses or if the NO- or prostaglandins can also mediate inflammatory pain induced by bupivacaine. MethodsIn 90 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, an incision of length 1 cm and width 0.5 cm was made through the epigastric fascia. The rats were grouped according to the number of rats and anesthetic concentration. Sizes 0–00 syringes were used for intratissue injections. Rats were injected in the rat subcutaneous tissue with either 20 &mgr;l isotonicsolution, bupivacaine (0.18%, 0.36%, 0.72%; n = 10/group), selective inhibitor of inducible NO synthase, NS398 (0.03–0.3 mg/kg), or indomethacin (0.2–20 mg/kg). Mechanical allodynia was assessed by von Frey filament before and 1 hr after the injection. ResultsThe 0.36% bupivacaine injection resulted in the highest degree of allodynia, but there was no significant change between groups. Pretreatment with NS398 significantly alleviated the degree of allodynia (P < 0.0001) induced by 0.36% bupivacaine and indomethacin (P < 0.0001). ConclusionsWe concluded that both NO and prostaglandins are involved in bupivacaine-induced pain and nociceptive responses but that the NO- or prostaglandins can also mediate neuroinflammatory pain caused by bupivacaine. <EOD> .
OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the effects of intractation therapy in the treatment of severe burn and smoke inhalation injury.


METHODS
From April 2004 to March 2006, 17 patients of severe burn and smoke inhalation injury were studied. The intractation therapy (the combination of intravenous dexamethasone sodium phosphate injection, tranexamic acid plus intestinal tranexamic acid sustained release tablet) was given for 8 successive days after treatment of severe burn and smoke inhalation injury. The blood gas, lung compliance (CL) before and after treatment of 6 h intracavitary instillation and at the 3rd day, 7th or 14th day of intractation therapy were determined; PaO(2), PaCO (2), PaO(2)/FiO(2), CPIS, CL were determined at the 1st, 3rd,6th or 14th day or after withdrawal of catheters.


RESULTS
The CPIS score dropped from (12.35 +/- 2.47) to (8.71 +/- 1.41) after 6 h intracavitary instillation and to (5.29 +/- 1.10) and (4.38 +/- 0.57) at the 3rd or 14th day after 4 days or 8 days of treatment of intractation therapy , the value of PaCO (2) dropped (P < 0.05), the mean artery pressure (MBP) was kept between (50.03 +/- 8.67) and (91.89 +/- 10.90) mmHg(1 mm"

Understanding the relative importance of direct and indirect interactions in determining community structure is central to biodiversity research. Diatoms are one group that has garnered much attention for their importance in oceanic biogeochemical, ecological, and evolutionary processes. Diatoms are also an important food source for marine and freshwater organisms, and the study of diatom communities and their dynamics is key to understanding ecosystem dynamics such as primary production and nutrient cycling, including the eutrophication and trophic collapse of freshwater ecosystems (Dinis and Magalhães 1990). In the terrestrial realm, leaf-litter food webs are critical for the maintenance of the energy flow as a source of detrital nutrition (McIntosh and Likens 2001). In ecosystems where detrital resources are primary and nutrient-rich, the diversity of primary producers is positively related to the diversity of consumer species (Williamson 1995). The positive relationship between plant and animal diversity and biomass is frequently represented as a U-shaped relationship (King and Sheldon 1995). This type of relationship, which we will refer to as the “abundance–diversity U hypothesis” here, was originally conceived and described for aquatic plant communities, then extended to the analysis of terrestrial grassland and marine ecosystems. Using the example of the U-shaped relationship, we describe here an unusual association between marine diatoms and fish biomass (DFB) and then focus on a possible link to human environmental perturbation and climate change. Fish biomass is a widely used index of human influence on the health, abundance, and diversity of marine ecosystems (Dunn et al. 1999), and, as a by-product of oceanic fisheries, a potential index of marine biodiversity. Fish communities have been proposed as good indicators of marine biodiversity because fishes have large spatial distribution ranges, exhibit complex trophic relationships, and can be affected by a number of interacting anthropogenic stressors (Tomanek et al. 2001). However, many researchers are unsure about whether these characteristics are unique and can be used to determine the health of other species (Hilborn and Jennings 2009), particularly those that appear to be under less pressure due to changes in marine communities and ecosystems (Chivers et al. 1989, Fulton 2002). Because benthic diatoms form the basis of energy flow in subtidal biotic communities, they have been used in conjunction with fishes as biodiversity and ecosystem indicators for oceanic biota (Hargrave and Roleda 1974, Werding and Hargrave 1981, Chase et al. 1991, Delefosse and Lejeusniak 1995, Chivers et al. 1989). In 1980, Roleda and Hargrave (1980) proposed that algae, sponges, and bryozoan assemblages were indicators of the ecological status of"

[a] <EOD> A Case of Tuberculosis of the Stomach Complicating Cancer of the Stomach
A. F., AGED 49, a labourer, was admitted to the West Middlesex Hospital on 9th June, 1942, under the care of Mr. C. Shires. He gave the following history. In January, 1941, after a fairly strenuous day's work he began to feel very sickish. He gradually lost most of his appetite and began to vomit frequently. In April, 1941, his doctor examined him and found a gastric ulcer at the gastro-oesophageal junction. Since then he has been vomiting continually, has lost much weight, and has been unable to do any work, nor have the symptoms improved under medical treatment. The patient himself looked very ill, and on examination was found to be considerably wasted, though there were no symptoms of toxaemic collapse. The gastric tumour was felt at the left side of the upper part of the abdominal wall, about two inches below the costal margin, and gave a distinct thrill on manipulation. This was the only focal symptom of the lesion. There was nothing remarkable in the chest; the blood-investigations showed no deviation from the normal. For the purpose of further investigation he was transferred to the Hammersmith Hospital, under the care of Mr. S. E. Naylor, where a barium meal was performed on 19th June, 1942. A film was taken in the right oblique view. No tumour was seen in the gastro-oesophageal junction, but in the lower part of the stomach above the gastric fundus there was a very marked narrowing of the lumen due to displacement of the gastric wall by a rounded, well-marked, but otherwise undifferentiated, mass. This was well seen in a delayed study made in the supine position on the following day (Fig. 1). At the same time and from the aortic arch to the first part of the duodenum a barium meal was followed by a radiograph made in the erect position (Fig. 2). A comparison of the two films at once showed that the mass in the stomach was actually a tumour and not merely a constriction of the lumen. In the lower half of the spleen there was also a similar rounded mass surrounded by normal tissue. Unfortunately, the stomach tumour could only be seen in profile and was not visible on the lateral view. It was suggested that the tumour was probably a cystic growth and that the liver mass was cystic as well. A radiologist at St. Bartholomew's Hospital was asked to express an opinion on both x-ray films. His opinion was that the gastric tumour was malignant, and that the spleen tumour was benign at the time they were prepared. On 5th July, 1942, the patient passed a tumour, which was hard, very irregular, white and fibrous in appearance (Fig. 3). One end resembled a thin piece of string and the other was a thick, solid piece, one inch in length and one-half inch in diameter. A barium meal was repeated as an out-patient on 13th August, 1942, (Fig. 4), but little alteration in the upper part of the stomach could be seen and only a slight narrowing was seen in the lower part of the stomach. <EOD> Cumulative Effect of Adverse Intrathymic Events on Lupus Patients

The antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay is well suited to the measurement of the activity of large numbers of mononuclear cells from cancer patients or normal donors. One such assay in which 51Cr-labelled target tumour cells are incubated with dilutions of human serum from donors with or without an ongoing immune response in the presence of complement-poor syngeneic macrophages of the same species, has been used successfully by numerous investigators. However, the amount of variability encountered when assessing such assays has sometimes made the comparability of results problematic. A simple modification of the original ADCC assay has been evaluated in which human serum, at a variety of concentrations, is substituted for the syngeneic complement-poor macrophages of the original assay. The human serum preparation was obtained commercially prepared as ""pooled"" human serum. The cytotoxicity of fresh normal human serum obtained from three of the authors, prepared by the same manufacturer, indicated inter-lot variation (62%) and thus this source of variability cannot be ignored. The standardization of this assay by these factors would facilitate comparability between laboratories performing this type of immunological assay. Of interest is the observation that an aliquot tested at 20% by standard ADCC produced the same amount of cytotoxicity when tested in this modified assay with human serum replacing macrophages. Thus, the use of one type of serum preparation in a standard assay would permit the quantification of ADCC with a reduced amount of technical effort. <EOD> The relationship between the rate of tumour growth, ovarian status and cisplatin dose on the growth delay of ovarian tumours.
Cisplatin induced growth-delay in transplanted ovarian tumours was analysed as a function of ovarian function and cisplatin dose administered. Drug (0, 0.5, 1 or 2.5 mg/kg/day i.p.) x time (2 or 7 days) combinations were randomized. At 2 days after the last cisplatin injection, mice were implanted with 6 or 7 mm s.c. tumours and their response measured by the length of time required (growth-delay) for their tumour to re-grow to 3 times their pre-implant size, approximately 6 days. All female mice were subjected to an ovariectomy prior to tumour implant and all controls were tumour-bearing ovariectomized mice. The data were fitted with different models. These models showed that there was a significant influence of ovarian hormones on the cisplatin-induced effect on MTU-1 and CAKI-1. None of the models fitted well on the data of SW-626. Ovariectomy combined with cisplatin treatment gave a significant growth delay at all doses tested and an induction of mRNA expression of the GADD153 protein was seen when compared with intact tumours. The effect on cisplatin induced growth-delay was a function of the drug dose. <EOD> Cystic hygroma masquerading as a mediastinal goiter. A case report.
Cystic hygroma masquerading as cervical or mediastinal goiter has never been described. A 16-year-old boy was referred to our hospital for a right lateral neck mass that had increased in size for the past year and caused dysphagia. On physical examination, a cystic mass, 4 x 4 x 6 cm in size, was noted to be just beneath the right submandibular gland. The patient's symptoms subsided completely after surgery. Histological sections revealed mesenchymal structures, cyst walls, vascular channels, blood-filled lumen, and stromal degeneration. Therefore, the mass was diagnosed as an aortopulmonary cystic hygroma in a neck position. <EOD> Increased circulation concentration and decreased renal excretion of amylase, asialomaltose, isomaltotetraose, and polyethylene gly"

Larynx carcinoma as a frequent tumor, is a subject of interest for cancer research. In our experiment we investigated the immunoreactions of the two immunoreactive proteins-cyclic citrullinated peptide (Cyclic citrullinated peptide immunoglobulins) and rheumatoid factor (Rheumatoid factor immunoglobulins) in patients with squamous larynx carcinoma and the healthy individuals as the control group. The two immune proteins, cyclic citrullinated peptide, rheumatoid factor and their immunoreactions were investigated by the immunoenzymatic method, using enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) test. It was found that the Cyclic citrullinated peptide and Rheumatoid factor immunoreactions were expressed. The immunohistochemical studies showed the presence of immunocytes CD45 at the inflammatory infiltrates of the connective tissues of the larynx cancer, the lymphoid cells CD3 located in the germinal centers of lymphocytes, B lymphocytes--CD20 in the subcapsular location, plasma cells CD138, and the cells macrophages CD68. At the larynx carcinoma level, all immunocytes CD71 were positive. The studies revealed also some immune proteins CD11c--present in all immune cells. All studied tissues in patients with larynx carcinoma presented the markers CD71 in eperythrocytes, and in lymphocytes. The immune reaction of the immunoglobulines IGA1, sIgA2, sIgM, sIgG, sIgG1, and sIgG3 were discovered in the epithelial cells. <EOD> .

The authors discuss the pathogenesis of scleral damage and the predisposition of the sclera itself to damage by any substance applied and the mechanism of action of dimethazine. They draw attention to the need for the frequent use of mydriatics or miotics in ophthalmic surgery. <EOD> .

Input Text: The role of the maxillary premolar in the masticatory system
The effect of miniscrew-activated rapid palatal expansion on the periodontium of the maxillary first premolars in adults: cone beam computed tomography evaluation
Purpose: Evaluate the effects of miniscrew-activated rapid palatal expansion (MARPE) on alveolar bone remodeling of maxillary first premolars (FPs) through cone beam computed tomography (CBCT).
Methodology: Fourteen participants aged 19 ± 3.7 years with skeletal class 1 malocclusion were included. The palatal aspect of the maxillary FPs were chosen, and two pairs of miniscrews were placed on maxillary bone. Next, MARPE was applied using a screw-activated expander (SAX) connected to the miniscrews for three months. CBCTs were obtained before and after, which were evaluated in terms of the changes in the buccal, palatal and lingual alveolar bone crest heights of the FP. The CBCT images were also reoriented to determine the buccopalatal position of the alveolar crest heights of the FP.
Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test (α = 0.05) were used to evaluate the differences in the buccal, palatal and palatal alveolar crest heights.
Results: After treatment, buccal and palatal crest heights were reduced in all FPs. The changes in the lingual crest height were varied.

 <EOD> The use of 2-nitrobenzoic acid for the determination of free amino acids in biological materials.
Lyophilized preparations of free amino acids have been subjected to colorimetric titration with 2-nitrobenzoic acid and the color produced has been evaluated spectrophotometrically at 420 mμ. The intensity of color developed appears to be directly related to the concentration of the amino acid present but its intensity is a function of the length of time the color is permitted to develop. Existing methods for titrating acid solutions have been checked against present methods. A colorimetric titrator for neutral solutions based on the use of 2-nitrobenzoic acid would serve the dual purpose of determining the free amino acids present and providing a means of estimating carboxylic acids. <EOD> Inhibitory mechanism of caffeic acid against influenza virus infection.
We examined the effect of caffeic acid on human influenza virus infection in vitro. On infection, caffeic acid inhibited virus adsorption as well as virus growth in all of the virus strains examined. When the virus was adsorbed into MDCK cells in the presence of caffeic acid, fluorescent-labeled viral proteins were found to remain on the surface of the cells at a level not significantly different from that of the uninfected cells. These suggest that caffeic acid may not act on the virus adsorption, but on the virus entering cells. By the electron micrograph of MDCK cells, caffeic acid was shown to prevent virus entry into the cells; the virus particles were densely packed and adsorbed to the surface of the cells. The present results indicate that caffeic acid may inhibit influenza virus infection at an early stage of the replication cycle by preventing the virus penetration into the cells. <EOD> Association of interleukin 1 (IL-1) type I receptor gene polymorphism and endometriosis
Interleukin-1 (IL-1) is a cytokine that is involved in inflammation. There is evidence that polymorphisms in cytokine genes affect expression and therefore the risk of disease. It is possible that the pro-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic action of IL-1α, may increase endometriotic lesion growth and dissemination, which has attracted us to study the association between the polymorphism at position –889 (G/A, codon857Arg/Gln) of IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1RI) gene and endometriosis. The frequency of AA allele was significantly higher in patients with endometriosis (P=0.001, Pcorr=0.013), than in the control subjects. However, no difference in frequencies of other genotypes (GA vs GG, P=0.315, Pcorr=0.630 and AA vs GA, P=0.458, Pcorr=0.642) was found. In conclusion, a genotype of IL-1RI (–889) gen polymorphism associated only with the presence of endometriosis is an underdominant trait in Polish women. <EOD> .

### Background

Non-purulent cellulitis is the leading cause of emergency department (ED) visits and is one of the most frequent infections treated by emergency physicians. Streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) are the most common isolated organisms worldwide.23 In a US survey 343 emergency physicians estimated that 23% of their total work was spent managing ED patients with cellulitis. The majority of cellulitis cases are caused by trauma or insect bites.22 However, some cellulitis has also been associated with surgery.2 There are several accepted treatment algorithms used for patients with cellulitis. Most agree that patients with mild disease (e.g., minimal erythema of lesion <3cm, no edema or tenderness, or purulence) should be treated with oral antibiotics.4 It has been suggested that the use of intravenous (IV) antibiotics or hospital admission is overuse, as IV antibiotics provide no additional benefit and hospital admission provides no additional treatment benefit if an oral antibiotic regimen can be tolerated.8 Oral antibiotics have also been suggested to be associated with lower rates of treatment failure and re-purulence. 6,7 The current consensus is that patients with a limited area of cellulitis with no local complications can be adequately treated with oral antibiotics alone. 8 This recommendation reflects that the infection is usually limited in distribution and most of the associated complications (e.g., abscess, necrotizing fasciitis, bacteremia and sepsis) are not associated with the degree of cellulitis.3,6,7 There is little or no risk for cellulitis to worsen into serious and life-threatening infections such as necrotizing fasciitis, abscesses, or sepsis 9-10 even in patients with purulent cellulitis. 6 It is also important to note that although IV antibiotics are commonly recommended for cellulitis associated with an abscess, purulent exudate, bullous infection, or extensive cellulitis, 6-7 there is limited evidence that this approach improves outcomes.24,25

A 65‐yr‐old Japanese man was hospitalized because of fever and rash on both thighs. He had bronchial asthma, and about 18 days before admission, ingested 30 g of Chinese red salvia containing 2.7 g of a tanshinone for a 14‐d period for asthma. On admission, a skin eruption and a macular eruption were noted on both thighs, and he complained of the worsening of asthma symptoms and high‐grade fever. Drug eruptions caused by the medication were suspected clinically, and discontinuation of medication and administration of antihistamine was initiated. Although the lesions improved gradually, 6 days later pneumonitis developed. Bronchoscopy revealed an increased white blood cell count with an abnormal lymphocytes of 90%. Treatment with prednisolone (35 mg/day) improved the clinical symptoms within 7 days. Two months later, high‐dose methylated‐daunorubicin (90 mg) and carboplatin (400 mg) were administered because he developed a bone marrow malignant lymphoma. On the first and second days after the chemotherapy, there was severe nausea with vomiting, and his fever spiked at 105°F. Because pneumonitis was suspected, the dose of prednisolone (30 mg) was increased, but there was no significant change in clinical symptoms. On the 19th day, the patient's general condition deteriorated significantly (fever of 102.8°F, severe pneumonitis) and he died of asphyxia 3 days later. Although pneumonitis caused by traditional Chinese medicines is rare, physicians should be aware of this clinical possibility in the future. <EOD> Impact of Preoperative Pulmonary Rehabilitation on Postoperative Length of Stay in Lung Surgery: A Prospective Study

Background: Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is an essential component of lung cancer treatment. We investigated the impact of a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation program on the postoperative length of hospital stay (LOS) in lung surgery. Patients and Methods: A total of 124 patients with lung cancer were divided into a preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) group and a control (NPR) group on the basis of the preoperative treatment modality. During the preoperative treatment, patients in the PR group conducted PR four times, while the NPR group did not. We compared the effects of lung function, quality of life (QOL), degree of depression, and the actual length of hospital stay (LOHS) between the two groups. Results: The forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), and forced expiratory flow 25-75% (FEF 25-75%) in the PR group were significantly higher than those in the NPR group. The St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) score and the Hamilton Eight-item for depression inventory (HAMD) score in the PR group were significantly lower than those in the NPR group. The mean of actual LOHS was 3.0 days in the PR group and 8.0 days in the NPR group. The actual LOHS in the PR group was significantly shorter than that in the NPR group (P<0.05).Conclusions: Preoperative pulmonary rehabilitation could improve the"

 <EOD> Mini-MICL Surgery for Coronary Bifurcation Treatment. A Single Center Experience.
Objective
A large range of approaches have been developed to treat coronary bifurcation; including conventional percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and dedicated percutaneous approaches. To date, the Minimal Invasive Coronary Lyse (MICL) concept has not been investigated for management of bifurcation lesions. The objective of our study is to describe this innovative surgical technique for bifurcation treatment and to report our early experience.


Methods
Data from 110 patients from the cardiac surgery department of Bichat hospital undergoing coronary surgery from May 2016 to March 2017 using the MICL technique were reviewed; 44 were bifurcated lesions. Technique, mortality and morbidities were analyzed. This is the first study on bifurcation lesions treated with the Minimal Invasive Coronary Lyse (MICL) approach.


Results
Bifurcation lesions were treated by MICL surgery and associated conventional procedures, such as endarterectomy, with no additional mortality or morbidity observed when compared to the matched conventional coronary artery bypass surgery controls.


Discussion
This case series reports the feasibility and outcome of bifurcation lesions treated by MICL. MICL has already been shown to be a safe procedure (1-month mortality 1.4%); this case series demonstrates the feasibility of the MICL techniques in bifurcation lesions. Larger series and randomized trials are needed to compare these new techniques to PCI bifurcation procedures in the current practice.


Conclusions
MICL is a simple and reproducible technique which allows bifurcation lesions to be treated by conventional coronary surgery, with no additional mortality or morbidity observed. <EOD> Development and Validation of a New Questionnaire to Assess Fitness Behavior
Abstract The purpose of this study was to create a fitness behavior measure with established psychometric properties which could be used to assess an individual's levels of participation within all fitness domains: sports, exercise, physical education, and strengthening. We used a purposive survey sampling method. Two hundred and nine subjects between the ages of 5 and 60 completed the survey and had a demographics questionnaire administered. A principal components analysis showed that the 33-question survey created five subscales. Each subscale loaded well indicating good construct validity. Using test retest reliability scores, the questionnaire proved to be stable over time (r=0.81). The overall level of fitness that an individual achieved according to an average score on 3-domains correlated highly with the level of activity that he or she performed (r=0.70); furthermore, this pattern is consistent with previous research on cardiovascular fitness. Fitness behavior appears to be a unidimensional concept that describes the totality of an individual's fitness related activity. <EOD> The influence of pigmentation on the susceptibility of the hairless mouse to UV‐induced skin cancer
The hairless mouse has been used as a model for human skin since the first description by Russell and Burch in 1954. The influence of the skin color on hairless mice on the carcinogenic and photo‐protective effects of UV radiation has been investigated. The genetic background of the mice was either albino or pigmented. Pigmented mice were found to be much more resistant than non‐pigmented mice to UV‐induced hairless skin carcinogenesis, which suggests a protective effect of pigment production. The skin tumor incidence of pigmented hairless mice was similar to that of the CBA/H mice, which are highly resistant to UV carcinogenesis and have eumelanin‐pigmented skin. <EOD> Acute and Late Toxicity in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated within the Randomized Phase III DeCOG Trial (NCT00496241)

 <EOD> Neutrophils from patients with autoimmune pancreatitis show markedly impaired cytoplasmic Ca2+ mobilization and apoptosis
Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP), once described as granulocytic epithelial lesion, is becoming accepted as a subtype of pancreatitis characterized by infiltration of neutrophils with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies in the pancreas, peri‐ and extrapancreatic tissues, accompanied by plasmacyte infiltration. To elucidate possible roles of neutrophils in the process of AIP, we investigated the responses of neutrophils to various stimuli and the expression of adhesion molecules. Neutrophils from AIP patients had markedly attenuated mobilization of Ca2+ compared with healthy volunteers, but they did respond normally to interleukin (IL)‐8‐stimuli. Ca2+ mobilization was completely restored when peripheral blood cells of AIP patients were incubated with IgG depleted sera obtained from AIP patients. The neutrophils from AIP patients had also markedly reduced ability to adhere to endothelium, even though the expression of β2‐integrin (CD18) was normal, but the expression of L‐selectin was attenuated. The neutrophils from AIP patients were also markedly resistant to the induction of apoptosis. These aberrations in immune responses might be closely related with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and subsequent neutrophil infiltration. AIP might also be relevant to the development of vasculitis. <EOD> Immunosuppressive Activity of the Neuropeptide Substance P: Implications for Diseases with Exaggerated T Cell Responses

Substance P (SP) is a neuropeptide originally discovered in sensory neurons of the dorsal spinal ganglia and the dorsal root ganglia in vertebrates. Since then, the molecule is not unique to neurons and can also be found in neuroendocrine cells. There is compelling evidence that SP is a universal neurotransmitter, both within the central and peripheral nervous systems. One of the main functions of neuropeptides is to adjust and to modulate the function of cells of the immune systems. There exists a large number of receptors which bind the neuropeptide substance P belonging to the G i protein coupled receptor family. In addition, the neuropeptide has also receptors which belong to the so called ""neurokinin receptor family. "" This neuropeptide is involved in many physiological processes including immune responses. In particular, it is able to inhibit the inflammatory response initiated by an antigenic stimulation. This review highlights the immunosuppressive activity of the neuropeptide substance P and its potential role in inflammatory diseases such as allergies, rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. The involvement of the neuropeptide in these diseases is still a matter of speculation. This review also puts emphasis on SP as pharmacon. There is evidence that SP might serve as a powerful therapeutic compound in the context of exaggerated T cell responses and inflammatory reactions.

# Introduction
The neuropeptide substance P (SP) is a 11-residue long peptide containing the tetrapeptide Arg-Phe-Gly-Phe, where Arg1 represents the active amino acid in SP and Phe8 represents the C-terminal amidation. This Cterminal amidation increases half-lifetime as well as the binding characteristics and bioactivity. The second amino acid Phe (or phenylalanine) of SP is essential for cell membrane-mediated binding   Substance P analogs: identification of a residue at the seven-position crucial for..., Schröder  . Accordingly, the sequence is referred to as SP. The peptide belongs to a family of molecules called neuropeptides. It is synthesized in a variety of peripheral tissues, as well as in immune cells.

 <EOD> Clinical, Laboratory, and Radiologic Characteristics of 63 Children With SARS-CoV-2 Infection: A Multi-Center Study of Cumulative Cases of Children in Saudi Arabia

Objective: SARS-CoV-2 infection has been considered a pandemic by the World Health Organization with severe morbidity and high fatality rates observed mainly in the elderly, immunosuppressed patients, and patients with preexisting comorbidities. Few studies have focused on identifying the distinct clinical, laboratory, and radiologic features of children and adolescents infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the clinical and radiologic presentation, laboratory findings, and the clinical outcomes among children and adolescents in Saudi Arabia infected with SARS-CoV-2 infection.Method: Cumulative SARS-CoV-2 cases (n = 341) among the ages of 0 to 20 years from five major treatment centers and academic institutes in Saudi Arabia were reported and retrospectively reviewed.Results: Sixty-three (18.7%) out of 341 patients were 18 years old or younger. Of these, 37 (59%), 13 (20.6%), one (1.6%), and twelve (19.3%) were 0 to 5 years, 6 to 12 years, 13 to 16 years, and 17 to 18 years old, respectively. The youngest child was one year old and had neonatal sepsis, and the youngest known symptomatic child was 3 months old. Male sex was predominant in young children; however, it was evenly distributed among school-aged children. Fever (46.0%), cough (51.7%), shortness of breath (23.8%), and myalgia (31.3%) were the presenting symptoms of the illness in more than half of the children evaluated. Thirteen (20.6%) cases were asymptomatic. Most children (67.7%) had mild disease, followed by moderate disease (28.6%) and severe disease (3.7%). The majority of asymptomatic patients had mild disease (43.5%), while moderate disease was mainly observed in symptomatic patients (30.0%). A total of 36.5% of children were admitted to the hospital and needed supplemental oxygen therapy, and none required invasive mechanical ventilation. A comparison between"

 <EOD> Acute kidney injury: a new paradigm.
Acute kidney injury (AKI) is an abrupt decline in kidney function or reduction in urine output that may necessitate renal replacement therapy (RRT). It is associated with high morbidity and mortality. AKI is common (1–57%), with high prevalence in emergency departments and hospitalized internal medical patients. Risk factors include older age, male gender, malnutrition, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver disease and other comorbidities. AKI in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is independently associated with prolonged ICU stay and increased risk of chronic kidney disease as well as increased health care costs. Acute renal replacement therapy and long-term dialysis are associated with high morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients with AKI. In patients on maintenance haemodialysis, AKI is independently associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and survival of AKI in such patients is even worse. <EOD> Neuroendocrine Changes Involved in the Prevention of Ovarian Failure in Neonatally Androgenized (Androgen-Induced Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) Mice
Neonatal androgenization of mice induces the development of a polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)like phenotype in adulthood. Hyperandrogenism induces a chronic state of low fertility in these mice, probably by affecting the sensitivity of the pituitary to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). This hyperandrogenism was studied to observe the time course of its effects on hypothalamic GnRH secretagogues and inhibitors, pituitary content and response to the gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) buserelin. Mice neonatally treated with 20 microg of dihydrotestosterone propionate in sesame oil every other day for 22 days were characterized using estradiol benzoate (EB) primed plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) release by pituitary, GnRH content and expression in the hypothalamus including cFos studies (LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio), as well as pituitary and ovarian responsiveness to buserelin. We were unable to detect differences in content of GnRH in the medial basal hypothalamus of neonatal control and androgen-induced PCOS mice. Neonatal androgenization induced a chronic increase in the LH/follicle-stimulating hormone ratio compared with nonandrogenized neonates. This hyperandrogenemia led to an earlier positive response of LH to GnRHa on PND 7, although on PND 22 it was still similar to control."

379,"[/INST] <EOD> Rhabdomyosarcoma of the Head and Neck in Childhood
Seventy-nine cases of rhabdomyosarcoma originating in the head and neck of children under the age of 15 years have been studied over the 10-year period 1961-71. The diagnosis was made by histological examination of biopsied primary tumour material in 37 cases and by autopsy findings in the remainder. Of the 50 cases of histologically verified rhabdomyosarcoma, 23 (46 per cent) were of the embryonic type, 4 (8 per cent) of the botryoid type and 23 (46 per cent) of the spindle cell type. The incidence of the latter two types in the head and neck of children, a site for which there is little reference in the literature, makes this study quite different from the series previously reported. Prolonged survivals were found in cases of botryoid and spindle cell types of embryonic rhabdomyosarcoma when they were restricted to the bone of the skull, e.g. the paranasal sinuses, whereas those cases localized in the brain spread early to extraneous parts of the central nervous system. In those cases of the spindle cell group presenting as primary osteogenic sarcoma of the bones of the axial skeleton, survival was better than in those cases where lymph node metastases were present. This paper discusses therapeutic problems related to the clinical behaviour of the different histological types of sarcoma in the head and neck, as well as the prognosis in relation to the type of surgery performed. Rhabdomyosarcoma cases of the botryoid type had a better prognosis than sarcomas of other histological types. <EOD> The effects of anti-diabetic drugs on oxidative stress and inflammation in type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The major goal of treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is to maintain normoglycaemia and reduce long-term complications. Oxidative stress and inflammation are known to play an important role in the development of insulin resistance, and anti-diabetic therapy may cause adverse effect by disturbing the balance between anti-oxidative and pro-oxidative systems. Some anti-diabetic therapies can also cause oxidative stress by reducing beta cell mass or directly inducing oxidative stress. The purpose of this review is to give details about how anti-diabetic therapy affect the oxidative stress and inflammation. Insulin, sulfonylureas, meglitinide, α-glucosidase inhibitors, biguanides, glucagon-like peptide analogues, thiazolidinediones, acarbose, amylin analogue, and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors may potentially cause oxidative stress or inflammation. These negative effects on oxidative stress and inflammation may lead to the reduction in beta cell viability and increase the damage to insulin target tissues. Therefore, the risk of developing these adverse effects should be considered in choosing an anti-diabetic therapy. In particular, it is recommended that patients at high risk of vascular disease and heart failure avoid thiazolidinediones. Furthermore, sulfonylureas and long-acting insulin have an increased cardiovascular risk. Thus, in some patients, alternative therapies should be considered before giving anti-diabetic medicines to avoid negative oxidative stress and inflammation. <EOD> Prevalence of overweight and obesity in Asian and Pacific Islander young adults: The California Young Adult Health Survey
Over the past 30 years, Asian and Pacific Islander (API) young adults' (ages 18–25 years) body mass index (BMI) has increased, however, evidence on overweight prevalence stratified by sex and ethnicity is limited in this population. The California Young Adult Health Survey (2014–2017) collected data on sociodemographics, obesity/overweight, and acculturation of 1,111 young adults, of whom 11.4% were overweight or obese (35.2% overweight and 64.8% obese).

Input Text: [INST] Use of a Smartphone App to Motivate Weight Loss in Overweight and Obese Individuals

Study Overview
================-

Detailed Description
-----------------
This will be a randomised controlled trial to assess the short-term weight loss effect of using a smartphone app to motivate weight loss.

One hundred participants will be recruited through weight management and obesity clinics, general practitioner surgeries, pharmacies, and advertisement material, and will be randomised to either control group (usual care, receiving the app) or intervention group (usual care of self plus app). Patients will be followed up to 12 weeks using mobile phone-based self-monitoring. Intervention participants will be provided with an app and instructions on how to use the app to self-monitor their weight during the 12week intervention period and follow-up. An SMS and automated SMS, or text, messaging system integrated with the app will also provide positive reinforcement of weight loss and other self-monitoring data (number of daily steps, heart rate and time spent sitting, time spent in moderate physical activity and time spent in vigorous physical activity each week). The control group will receive usual care via their GP. Usual care will include dietary modification and/or pharmacological therapy for the management of type 2 diabetes if eligible or lifestyle modifications such as dietary/exercise modification and prescription of medication for weight loss management. Participants who require lifestyle modification will attend a dietitian and health-care professional for further review 3 months after their initial visit. Weight loss will be measured in kilograms (baseline, after 12 weeks and 26 weeks) and compared to participants' baseline weight. In addition, participants' self-monitoring of weight and diary will be analysed. Changes in blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, insulin and cholesterol will also be assessed. Lifestyle behaviors such as physical activity levels, fruit and vegetable intake and caffeine consumption will be measured using repeated questionnaires at 0, 4, 12 and 26 weeks. The questionnaires will be administered via the app and also remotely via standard and secure email methods. Data will be analysed using linear mixed modeling to determine overall weight loss at 12 weeks from baseline. A qualitative analysis will be conducted on 10% of the study's participants, to explore the reasons for adherence and non-adherence to the intervention. This will be a random sample of the participants and will be selected in consultation with the research team's research governance board. A questionnaire, including demographic information and items from the Theory of Reasoned Action survey, will be administered to the selected participants. The content of the theory of reasoned action survey will explore weight loss behavior.

### General Information

### İ. Study Design/Objective:

The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy of 20 ml, 25 ml, 30 ml TPVB application on post-thoracotomy analgesia and to investigate the relationship between pain scores and serum interleukin-6 levels. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between post-thoracotomy pain and serum interleukin-6 levels in the treatment with 20 ml, 25 ml, and 30 ml doses of local anesthetic in TPVB application, which is an advanced regional anesthesia technique in pain management after thoracotomy surgery.

### II. Trial Type:



### Study design

This study will be an experimental-controlled, prospective, randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled. Study will consist 3 groups of patients, with each group having 30 patients, total of 90 patients.

### III. Sample Size:

To determine a sample size of 30 patients, sample size formula for 2 independent groups was used with alpha value = 0.05 and statistical power value = 0.80, while assuming the mean differences of 1 and 40% standard deviations of 1 in both 50 µL and 100 µL groups, the calculated sample size was 7 for each group. This is an advanced regional anesthesia technique, and studies related to the thoracic paravertebral block used different doses of local anesthetic (15-50 ml) in TPVB application to relieve postoperative pain after thoracotomy surgery. In this study, 3 different doses of TPVB application (20 ml, 25 ml, and 30 ml) on 90 patients will be compared in terms of postoperative pain scores and serum interleukin-6 levels.

### IV. Setting:

The study will be conducted on patients who are planned to be underwent thoracotomy surgery in Istanbul Haydu training and research hospital anesthesiology clinic, thorax surgery clinic and thorax intensive care unit.

### V. Study Schedule:

Participants will have a face-to-face interview with the researcher in outpatients' clinic. When the patient is discharged from the hospital after thoracotomy surgery, they will be taken into the study process. All blood samples and interviews will be taken by"

We reviewed the cases of 55 patients who were treated for cystic hygromas (CH) at our institutions between January, 1972, and December, 1988. The diagnosis was made in utero in 35 cases, and six other patients were diagnosed by the fetal karyotype. Seven patients were diagnosed at birth with CH as a feature of an anatomic anomaly complex, and 11 patients presented during infancy or childhood with a growing mass in the neck. A review of the English‐language literature showed that three types of CH were reported on the basis of clinical and pathological features or associated anomalies: (1) the isolated type, presenting during prenatal life or infancy or childhood; (2) the syndromic form, associated with different groups of anomalies; and (3) the combined form, associated with solid tumors or other soft tissue masses. Four patients presented with malignant mixed germ cell tumors, and three of them were found to have abnormal karyotypes and to have progressed to neoplasm within a few years of the cyst lysis. Two patients received preoperative chemotherapy from a neonatal or infancy period. The average follow‐up period in the 55 children is 13.5 years (range, 5–26 years). Complete resorption of 51 CH was achieved by means of surgical intervention in 24 patients, including preoperative chemotherapy, and by sclerotherapy in four patients (40%). Twenty‐one of the 30 patients with the syndromic type underwent surgical resection of the CH, including eight patients with chromosomal anomalies and four patients who were diagnosed prenatally as having Klippel–Trenaunay syndrome, and the CH disappeared in 14 patients. The cystic hygroma disappeared in all four patients with the combined type without surgery. There have been no late recurrences in the patients treated surgically. <EOD> An unanticipated consequence of the Covid-19 pandemic: the impact of the pandemic on the mental health of children with chronic illness.
BACKGROUND
Children, families and health professionals face ongoing challenges as a direct result of the Covid-19 pandemic. In this project, we focused on the experience of children with chronic illness in the Northern part of the health region of Waterloo.


OBJECTIVE
The objectives of this study were to explore: 1) the mental health and wellbeing of children with chronic illness during the Covid pandemic 2) the coping strategies of the children.


METHODS
With the assistance of parents and children on the team, the authors developed a semi-structured interview guide and then conducted a series of interviews with five children and their parents (n=10) via Zoom. Interview questions were focused on how children with chronic illness coped during the Covid-19 pandemic. Interviews were recorded. The team listened to the interview recordings and took notes, which were used to draft reports. The interview data and the team's notes were used to analyze, create a data collage and interpret the data. Findings from two children with the same diagnosis of cerebral palsy and the same care pathway were compared and contrasted during the analysis.


RESULTS
Three themes emerged from our interviews regarding the children's coping. These included, 1) how children with chronic illness felt emotionally during the pandemic; 2) the emotional impact of changes made to care, services and hospital visits and 3) how children with chronic illness coped. Coping strategies included using routines (e.g., staying active) and having a sense of purpose (e.g., staying connected with family and friends). Interestingly, similarities existed between the two families interviewed. This led to an important finding that needs further exploration, namely that emotional impact may not be influenced by diagnosis, but rather may be influenced by care pathways and interactions with the health care system. For example, the two children interviewed had different care pathways, one in a day program five days/week and one at home doing physiotherapy, and they had different interactions with the health system. This finding highlights the importance of the children's individual experiences.

 <EOD> High-resolution scanning electrochemical microscopy

Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is capable of imaging structures of nano and micro scales. However, the resolution of SECM is still limited by the lateral diffusion of the redox species. This study proposes a new concept of SECM using high speed scanning electrochemical microscopy (HS-SECM), which is expected to overcome the lateral diffusion limitations. The spatial resolution of HS-SECM was examined in an electrochemical double-layer capacitor fabricated with reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films and Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles and a Pt/PB composite electrode (PB/PT) as a working electrode in an aqueous borate solutions, respectively. Electrochemical images of the electrodes were systematically compared to those of potentiometric SECM at the same pixel density, showing a resolution of ~ 100 nm. Moreover, the PB nanoparticles were imaged directly from the SECM image with the pixel resolution of ~ 300 nm. These results are well matched with the theoretical analyses of mass transfer, indicating that the proposed SECM with HS-SECM achieves the lateral resolution ~ 10 times better than that of conventional mass transport-based scanning microtechnique. It should lead the future trends in SECM to achieve a much greater lateral spatial resolution in micro-scale electrochemical structures.
Scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) is a powerful technique capable of visualizing electrochemical structures on the spatial scales of nano to micro meter 1-6 by scanning the redox reaction front on a conducting substrate. The spatial resolution has been further improved by using novel scanning mechanisms such as high-speed scanning SECM 7 , non-contact tunneling mode-SECM 8-10 , and the scanning electrochemical photoimaging (SEPI) based on electrochemically generated oxidation products   The scanning electrochemical photoimaging microscopy: high-resolution imaging of electrochemical species, Soda     The scanning electrochemical photoimaging microscopy applied to the surface imaging of a biological..., Kuwabara     Scanning photoelectrochemical imager-a new technique to probe surface compositions of aqueous system, Kuwabara  .

Since the introduction of 3M-PVC-materials with improved flammability, the incidence of skin burns caused by medical devices has decreased. After examination of about 300 hospitalized patients, we found 16 patients (7 in the surgery, 6 in the gynecology ward and 3 in the intensive care unit) with burns, 6 caused by electric current, 4 by hot water, 3 by hot air or steam and 3 by boiling water. A further two patients showed burns caused by hot steam (after a shower or a bath) and alcohol and acetone (after using a disposable suture needle). Two health care workers reported severe burns caused by a disposable screwdriver in the OR theatre. A disposable scalpel and an electric heating cup caused burns after intravaginal sonography. During our routine visits, we saw two patients with burns. One patient had used a disposable catheter after intravesical therapy with mitomycin C. He had not noticed that she had attached the catheter upside down. The second patient was burned by a disposable transurethral catheter which was inserted in the bladder for about 3 days instead into the rectum, as he had not been conscious the previous night. The patient in the intensive care unit was also burned by inserting a transurethral catheter into his rectum. Finally, a patient was injured during the insertion of a ureter catheter by mistake into his vagina instead of his ureter. The medical staff have to be aware of the fact that an insecure handling of disposable medical devices is possible and the consequences may lead to considerable burns in patients or professionals. <EOD> Identification of a Novel Haplotype, HLA-DQB1*02:171, by the DiDea Typing Software

It is generally recognized that pre‐operative heparin therapy reduces the incidence of venous thrombo‐embolism and therefore should be used routinely in surgery. However, it is difficult to achieve optimal heparin therapy in a hospital routine. The authors investigated the efficacy of the cation channel blockers (CCB) as an alternative or in addition to antithrombotic therapy in surgery. The authors made a prospective analysis of the data on all cases of heparin prophylaxis during surgery in the period from October 1996 to June 1999. Two hundred and seventy‐five patients received subcutaneous injections (60 000 IU) of heparin three times a day (200 000 IU) in the period from the 10th day prior to surgery to the first post‐operative day. Two hundred and eighty‐seven patients received prophylactic injections of cation channel blockers (10 mg) 3 h before skin incision. Fourteen patients received prophylactic injections of cation channel blockers in combination with heparin. Prophylactic therapy with cation channel blockers was associated with reduction in the incidence of thrombo‐embolic and throm"

 <EOD> Comparison of the biological activities of the intact lipid A molecule from three Salmonella serovars with their fatty acylated and de-O-deacylated lipid A species following inoculation of mice.
The abilities of the intact and acylated lipid A species from three Salmonella serovars to induce pro-inflammatory responses and elicit protective immune responses following subcutaneous inoculation of mice were examined. Although in their native state, all the lipid A species behaved similarly in vivo, the acylated lipid A species were less immunogenic and exhibited lower Th1 and Th2 profiles, as evidenced by decreased IFN-gamma and increased IL-4 levels. A similar trend was observed in the case of the de-O-deacylation-treated lipid A species where the degraded compounds elicited relatively low innate immune responses. The results were consistent with the biophysical profile of the acylated and deacylated lipid A species with respect to their increased resistance to digestion and inability to stimulate murine macrophage and monocytic cells in vitro. Overall, these results highlight the importance of maintaining the structural integrity of the lipid A molecule as an important factor contributing to the immunopotentiating activity following inoculation. <EOD> The influence of the CYP3A5 polymorphisms on the phenytoin and C-di-CMP metabolism in vitro

 <EOD> Effects of demented and schizophrenic illness in old age.
104 residents, 40-94 years old, from a county home in Sweden, were examined for signs of cognitive impairment. All the residents were also examined clinically for evidence of psychiatric illness and for signs of dementia. 24 residents had been psychiatrically diagnosed as mentally ill before coming to the care home and were grouped as “recently demented ills,” “older demented ills,” or “recently schizophrenic ills” according to their illness history. There were 6 previously undiagnosed cases of schizophrenia and 3 of depression. 33% had a recent demented illness and 34% had an older demented illness, often as complicating cerebral dysfunction in somatic illness. <EOD> Tissue Distribution of Fibrinogen in Normal and Hypofibrinogenemic Man *
Summary The concentration of fibrinogen in tissue extracts from various normal and hypofibrinogenemic subjects was measured by both the fibrin clot solubility and the FDP (Fibrin-Derived Polypeptides) assay technique. In those subjects who were deficient in circulating fibrinogen, the fibrinogen concentration in muscle was always substantially higher than that in plasma and usually similar to that in bone marrow extracts but it was always considerably lower than that in liver extracts whatever the concentration of fibrinogen in the plasma. In one subject the concentration in liver extracts was considerably lower. In some subjects the concentrations of fibrinogen in liver extracts were lower than those in bone marrow. This study showed that tissues taken from an individual are not identical nor do they have the same fibrinogen content. The tissue with the highest concentration was the bone marrow. <EOD> The role of epidermal progenitors in skin barrier acquisition and maintenance: a closer look into the skin stem cell niche and their contribution to skin biology



# Introduction
The skin is the largest organ of the human body comprising complex functional regions. It is covered by a stratified epithelium, the epidermis, and an underlying stroma of connective tissue. The epidermis is a stratified squamous epithelium comprising four distinct layers that progressively detach from the outermost stratum corneum at sites of external pathogenic attack and desquamate by a slow, programmed and tightly regulated process. An intact and healthy skin barrier separates the external environment from the deep tissue layer, which contains the internal organs. The epidermis forms a protective barrier against noxious and mechanical stress and against infectious microbial invasion. Maintenance of the skin barrier is of high importance for our survival and in the development of healthy young skin, epidermal homeostasis relies entirely on"

Input Text: Phenotyping Patients With Alcohol and Cannabis Use Disorders Using the Addictions Neuroclinical Assessment <EOD> .
Although the use of ultrasound has improved the efficiency of prenatal diagnosis the high number of feticide and the problem of multiple pregnancies led to a reconsideration of the indications for this technique. In order to avoid these two inconveniences a prenatal diagnosis program based on systematic karyotyping before prenatal ultrasound examination of all pregnancies was elaborated and applied. The objectives of this study were: 1) to assess the feasibility and reliability of such a program based on systematic cytogenetic before ultrasound examination in the general population; 2) To evaluate the efficicacy of the screening of the congenital malformations by ultrasound examination of the fetus before the onset of the pathology; 3) to assess the efficacy of diagnostic ultrasound in improving the genetic counselling of the parents. In the first period of 31 months, 6294 pregnant patients were studied in the department of obstetrics of the Aix-Mazeille hospital. A systematic cytogenetic study before ultrasonography had been performed in all the pregnancies (2616 patients). In the context of this program, 5149 pregnant women were studied by ultrasound for early and high-risk pregnancies, and 3949 pregnant women having normal characteristics were analysed after 16 weeks of amenorrhoea. The results have shown that a systematic cytogenetic study before ultrasonography was not useful in the detection of structural or numerical chromosomal anomalies. The detection capacity of prenatal ultrasound for anomalies was 63.2 p.c., whereas in the case of multiple pregnancies it was greater than 80 p.c. The results indicate that prenatal ultra-sound examination is an efficient procedure to discover chromosomal and structural abnormalities, and to improve the genetic counselling. In fact it seems that the prenatal ultrasound diagnosis is of greater value than a cytogenetic study performed with conventional techniques. <EOD> Implications of Recent Advances in Psychoneuroimmunology for Psychoanalysis
Both psychoanalysis and immunology are concerned with how experience and the inner world are reflected in the functioning of the body and the immune system. Neuroimmunology is a discipline which attempts to integrate these two levels of reality. The concept of ciliated immune cilia was advanced in 1974 by the author and, since then, a number of the major observations regarding the psychoneuroimmune model have been confirmed. Based upon neuroimmune function, specific clinical observations can be made which apply to any psychoanalytic patient. These findings have implications for both the analyst and the analysand. In particular, analyst and patient may share a common immune profile, and the concept of a mutal immunological bond seems to be operative in any psychoanalytical treatment of any intensity. <EOD> LncRNA FOXD2-AS1 promotes cell progression by modulating miR-129-5p/CUEDC2 axis in gastric cancer

Input Text: The Impact of Positive, Neutral and Negative Expectation Speech on Manipulative Therapy Intervention in Patients With Chronic Low Back Pain: a Pilot Study


Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
=================
Background: The term contextual effect has been used to reinforce the view that the placebo effect should be understood as an effect related to the use of inert treatments. Thus, the placebo effect should be distinguished from the effects of a specific treatment. There is evidence of the effect of the context of the treatment (with a positive or negative attitude towards treatment) and manipulation of patients' expectations on pain perception. Positive expectation, in which there is a focus on the resolution of pain and an improvement of patients' general state of health, promotes a reduction in pain perception. Conversely, negative expectation promotes an increase in pain perception. It has been reported that positive expectation increased the analgesic effect of acupuncture and massage, and the use of a placebo pill for knee pain. However, it is also believed that it is not only the expectation of improvements that affect pain perception, but also the positive expectations regarding the treatment (e.g. acupuncture) and negative expectations, such as regarding the negative effects of sham or inert interventions. 
                                                                                            In addition to expectation, it is necessary to consider that different interventions, such as manipulative therapy (MT), also induce placebo effects, and there has been previous research investigating this issue.
                                                                                            According to , MT can promote a significant degree of perceived benefit and the mechanisms of MT and placebo analgesia can occur simultaneously. This could happen because MT induces sensory input that interferes with pain perception.
                                                                                            In addition, when MT is performed properly, with adequate post-activation of the muscles involved to improve muscle performance, the perception of pain increases because the patient experiences a muscle contraction. Thus, the more effective MT is, the more pain perception is increased. The placebo analgesia phenomenon also seems to occur by psychological mechanisms such as the expectations for pain decrease. According to , MT and placebo analgesia can produce similar physiological effects. The authors also report that, with a strong sense of confidence (much greater than would be present during a sham procedure) and the use of verbal suggestions, both MT and sham procedure can induce similar effects.
                                                                                            Therefore, we can hypothesize that expectation of positive results can be induced by MT, and this may interfere with the effects described in the literature regarding placebo analgesia. Thus, it can be speculated that the expected improvement of the health condition can be similar or even higher than in the case of MT intervention. We propose to investigate the impact of positive expectations of improvement after real and sham manipulative therapy interventions. In this way, we may understand the effects of the manipulative therapy on pain perception after real or sham intervention.
                                                                                            According to , there is no single therapy that is highly successful in every treatment context, and the results are similar to those of traditional interventions. However, in the same study, manipulation techniques were highly superior to psychological therapies, and this may indicate that the contextual factors play a role in determining the effectiveness of each individual or combined therapies. We suggest that the combination of MT and positive expectation on the results can be superior to a single MT or negative expectation in the result of a placebo therapy, and MT and positive expectation may also be superior to placebo therapy with negative expectation.
                                                                                            Our findings may contribute to a better understanding of the effects of MT and the role of expectation in this treatment process.

Input Text: Effects of Semaglutide on Intracranial Blood Flow and Brain-Barrier Permeability in Type-2 Diabetes

Detailed Description
=============

Preliminary Data From A Previous Clinical Trial (unpublished; Katz et al., 2018)
 
Objective: 
  
To explore the effects of semaglutide on intracranial blood flow and brain-barrier permeability in type 2 diabetes.

Design: 
 
Double blind and placebo-controlled, parallel group, MRI trial.

Participants: 
  
Sixty diabetics aged 40-65 years recruited across 3 university sites in Canada. Diabetics taking glucose control medications including insulin, metformin, sulfonylureas, or SGLT2 inhibitors. BMI range 23-40 inclusive, and a fasted glucose control HbA1C 7%-11%.

Intervention: 
  
During a 20 week period the participants received 1.24 mg and 2.46 mg of semaglutide or a placebo. 
 
Assessment: 
  
Pre-and post-MRI assessments included fasting blood samples for determination of blood sugar (glucose), lipids (HDL, LDL, triglycerides) thyroid stimulating hormone, creatinine (eGFR), LDLc/HDLc ratio, thyroid function. MRI scans and functional MRI assessments were taken pre-and post-treatment. 
 
Results: 
  
Preliminary Results: 
 
Semaglutide significantly improved intracranial blood flow (IBF) from baseline as determined by decrease in number of distal vessels and length distribution. The positive effect was independent on other cardiovascular parameters (BP, lipids, etc). Semaglutide also improved blood-brain barrier (BBB) Ktrans (quantified as Ktrans) in diabetes. Ktrans is a measure of BBB permeability. We hypothesize that the mechanism of BBB permeability improvement is secondary to improved endothelial function and vascular perfusion in the brain.



# Abstract
====================
Semaglutide is an approved drug to treat diabetes with weight loss as one of its benefits. Semaglutide reduces stroke incidence in T2D, but whether semaglutide directly affects diabetes-related brain complications is unknown. The purpose of our study was to determine the effects of semaglutide on blood flow and BBB in T2D. Sixty participants (30 T2D) aged 40–65 with BMI range 23–40 were recruited from two sites in Canada: one academic medical center and one private practice/clinical research center. Eligible subjects were treated with semagutide or saline, and fasted blood and baseline and post-contrast magnetic resonance imaging scans were performed at the start and the end of the intervention. BMI, weight, and BP decreased in all T2D subjects, but remained stable in healthy subjects. 
Semaglutide improved blood flow in T2D, decreased the mean number of distal vessels (0.87± 0.18 baseline to 0.82±0.17 after semaglutide, p<0.001), and decreased the length distribution. 
The improvement in brain flow was independent of the changes in BP, lipids, or gastric emptying. 
Semaglutide significantly improved BBB Ktrans, (13.48± 1.62 baseline to 10.72±2.24 after semaglutide, p<0.001) in T2D (normalized to baseline)."

Colonic diverticula can be a cause of acute complain in older people, mimicking disease processes as acute bowel obstruction, diverticulitis, colonic perforations, or hemorrhage with large diverticula more prone to be complicated. However, acute inflammation or hemorrhage is very rare in patients with diverticula smaller than 5 mm. We report the case of a 93‐year‐old man who presented with an acute abdomen with signs of an inflammation with internal herniation of a giant colonic diverticulum of 18 × 12 × 9.5 cm, which developed by strangulation and ischemia as the primary cause. This unusual case underlines the importance of CT scans of the abdomen for patients presenting with acute nonlocalized pain as an imaging tool to exclude a malignant entity or complication of a colonic diverticulum. <EOD> Palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of in situ generated 2-silyl indoles with thiols: direct synthesis of 5,6-dihydropyrrolopyridine derivatives.

[/NOTE] <EOD> Identification of immune responses in children with Down syndrome related hospitalisations.
Immune dysfunction is reported in children with Down syndrome (DS). Hospital admissions, including respiratory infections, are also reported more frequently in children with DS than compared to age-matched peers. T-lymphocyte differentiation and the immune response were assessed in 24 children hospitalised with infectious complications, including 12 children with DS and 12 age/sex-matched children with non-Down syndromic congenital cardiac defects. A significant reduction in relative counts of T-cells and natural killer (NK) cells and elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were found in the DS group; CD4+ T-cell counts were low in both DS and non-DS groups. Lower T helper/T suppressor, CD4/8 ratio in the DS group suggested a significant impairment of the adaptive response in these children, which was also seen in the non-DS group. Elevated proinflammatory cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and IFN-gamma were seen in the DS group. These findings demonstrate a relative inability to increase immune response in children with DS and emphasise the importance of assessing humoral and cell-mediated immunity in children with DS. More severe T-cell immunodeficiency in children with DS than their non-DS counterparts may explain their higher risk of infectious diseases and greater susceptibility to invasive fungal infections. <EOD> Listeria monocytogenes Influences CD3+ T Cell Differentiation through Nuclear Translocation and Activation of the Transcription Factor NFAT and CaMK

Listeria monocytogenes is a prominent food-borne pathogen causing severe infections in newborns, pregnant women and immunecompromised, often elderly, individuals. An important immune-induced mechanism of immune defense against L. monocytogenes infection is adaptive immunity through CD4 + T cells. Upon phagocytosis of L. monocytogenes by innate immune cells such as macrophages, the bacteria induce phagosomal maturation to phagolysosomes, which results in lysis of the organism. However, L. monocytogenes employs a number of virulence factors to evade phagosomal maturation and the phagolysosomal environment, thus establishing itself in the cytosol of the host cell. An important virulence factor is the poreforming secreted pore-forming protein listeriolysin O (LLO), which induces Ca 2+ influx across the plasma membrane of infected cells, and thereby activates calcium-dependent proteins and transcription factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether LLO could influence CD4 + T cells by activation of transcription factors and/or protein kinases, which in turn would result in differentiation of memory T cells. For this purpose, we analyzed cell surface marker expression as well as cytokine production profiles of activated T cells in response to whole bacterial lysates, LLO or its recombinant form (rpLLO), both in the presence and absence of Ca 2+ . As a consequence of activation by lysteriolysin, CD4 + T cells increased the expression of CD25 and CD27, and produced large amounts of the Th-1 type cytokines IFN-γ and IL-2. We also found nuclear translocation of the transcription factor NFAT and CaMK activity in LD-infected T cells. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that LLO promotes different"

In short, the nociceptive system was stimulated and EPs were recorded to explore nociceptive properties of RF electrical stimuli. This study will also explore the use of a novel automated electrophysiological pain model, based on a device that can automatically apply sharp mechanical stimuli, in order to obtain evoked potentials. This technology makes it possible to obtain pain-related markers from patients in a standardized manner, with the aim of improving the diagnostic efficacy of physiological measures and the reliability of EP-based evaluation of the nociceptive system. The results may open the door to a new generation of automatic devices and automated research studies.

Conduct: [/INST]
This study protocol was based on previously published literature examining the nociceptive system in humans. Two different types of stimulation were used, RF and pinprick. The effects of the intensity and the speed of application of the electrical stimuli on the evoked potentials were quantified, as well as the thermal tolerance to warm and cold stimuli. In the RFEPs, we expected to observe latency and amplitude changes related to the RF stimulus parameters. In a single subject, these changes should appear in order to compare the results. For the pinprick stimulations, 50 subjects received pinprick stimuli at 5 random points on the body, and the intensity of the pinprick pains was recorded when they were applied automatically. The obtained results should suggest possible physiological and/or structural changes related to the physical mechanisms of the pain sensation and conduction pathways. Since subjects received a painful stimulus, the results should not appear on all subjects.

Potential Risks: [/INST]
Potential risks for participants will be minimal. No blood samples or other invasive procedures were required from the subjects. Therefore, there is no risk of injury or complications from participating in the study. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that the electrodes used for the pinprick and RFEPs could induce pain similar to that applied by the pin. This may increase the temperature of the electrical circuit, which could cause some unwanted damage to the subjects.

General Notes: [/INST]
Study subjects will be healthy people, from 18–60 years of age. Subjects with neurological impairments, such as Parkinson's disease or spinal cord injuries, will not be recruited. Subjects not fully understanding the content and scope of the experiment or unable to comply with its instruction should not participate. Likewise, pregnant women and individuals with heat sensitivity disorders will be excluded from the study. Participants will be randomly assigned to one set or another. They will participate in the second set as well, but their brains will not be stimulated in the first set. We must ask the permission of the subjects before carrying out the measurements.

Background of the Study: [/INST]
The study is based on previously published studies in humans and aims to provide new physiologically relevant data on human EPs to assess the effect of electrical stimuli on the nociceptive system. This study is based on two previously published EPs:
 1. The nociceptive system responses elicited by radiofrequency (RF).
 2. The nociceptive system responses elicited by pinprick.

Thus, our study is aimed at obtaining EPs obtained from the following two stimuli:
 1. The effects of the intensity and the speed of the electrical stimuli on RFEP latency and amplitude.
 2. The effects of pinprick pain tolerance and pain on the nociceptive system.

Experimental Rationale: [/INST]
Although the nociceptive system has already been described by means of EPs, there has been no study to compare the RFEPs with another nociceptive technique. However, we assume that the effect and changes in the electrophysiological responses and latency will be similar to those evoked by pinprick stimuli.

Background:  [/INST]
This study protocol was based on previously published literature in humans examining the nociceptive system. The study aims to provide new physiologically relevant data on human electrical EPs by assessing the effects of electrical stimuli on the nociceptive system, specifically the responses evoked by RF.

 <EOD> Internal fixation of the tibial plateau fractures.
We treated 40 tibial plateau fractures with internal fixation: 11 of the fractures were in 11 professional football players, and 29 were in non-athletes. The fractures occurred because of motor vehicle accidents involving the football players and falls involving the non-athletes. The 11 football-player fractures were classified as Type II (n = 4), Type III (n = 3), and Type IV (n = 4) using the AO scheme. The 29 fractures in non-athletes also were classified as Type II (n = 6), Type III (n = 9), and Type IV (n = 13) using the AO classification or as undisplaced (n = 7), transverse displaced (n = 10), and comminuted (n = 12) using the Mason classification. Thirteen fractures were unstable and were fixed with locking plates and two screws (n = 3), or with three (n = 10). Nine fractures had unacceptably large metaphyseal gaps; these lesions were treated with cerclage reinforcement alone, and the remaining 21 were treated with bone graft alone.

Since the first reports of an immunologic role for lymphocytes in liver diseases were published in the mid-seventies, the understanding of the immunopathogenesis of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E (non A/E) and other liver affections was continuously improved by intensive studies on the mechanisms of immune regulations. In spite of the progress achieved in understanding the basis of immune dysregulations during liver diseases, no therapeutic concepts have been established so far. The aim of the present update was to review the most recent literature dealing with pathogenesis, immunopathology and new therapeutic approaches of chronic intrahepatic and extrahepatic lymphomas. <EOD> On the Inheritance of the Genetic Defect(s) in Hereditary Deafness
The role of genetic factors in hearing was studied in 130 consanguineous Pakistani families of 155 children ascertained through 24 sib-pairs with varying hearing abnormalities. Both pure-tone and the auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds showed that genetic factors were involved in hearing sensitivity. Deaf siblings (without middle ear pathology) had a significantly higher incidence of the presence of deafness in their consanguineous parents (57%) than among the normal siblings (26%). The incidence was 40% for the presence of deafness in parents or sibs of deaf patients on the one hand and 28%, (of normal sibs ) on the other hand. It was concluded that both non-genetic (environmental) and genetic factors were involved in the etiology of childhood hearing loss and that hereditary factors were found to be most important. <EOD> Assessment of Influenza-like Illnesses for Detecting Respiratory Syncytial Virus Surveillance Trends.
BACKGROUND
Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a leading cause of infectious disease in children that causes substantial disease burden and health care costs. RSV can be spread by respiratory droplets and may be difficult to distinguish from influenza viruses. Current US sentinel surveillance system (SSS) for influenza-like illnesses (ILI) misses RSV detections. Increasing surveillance is a prerequisite for future RSV vaccine candidates.



METHODS
We compared ILI to respiratory outbreaks, emergency department (ED) visits, and respiratory virus detections in ILI surveillance. We analyzed ILI surveillance in 339 clinics in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Surveillance Outlets, a collaboration between CDC, the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, and other state and local health departments. We also monitored RSV in outpatient and inpatient health care facilities. We compared surveillance in SSs to surveillance in outbreak facilities.



RESULTS
Influenza and RSV outbreaks showed significant correlation of health care visits (p < 0.05). Weeks with ILI ≥50% were similar to RSV in outbreaks compared to ILI case ≥30% in 1 and outpatients <0.0% ILI infection <0.950% illness. Weeks with case of influenza flu000 outbreaks infection in healthcare 0 illness with RSV was detected patients of the case0.

 <EOD> Phosphatidylcholine in the treatment and diagnosis of liver disease.
The phospholipid, lecithin, phosphatidyl-choline, has many physiologically important roles. The main sites include the liver, lung, kidney and blood vessels. In the liver, it is actively involved in the synthesis of lipoproteins in the blood plasma. A diet which is rich in lecithin can improve hepatic function in patients with liver disease due to portal hypertension and in patients with cirrhosis. This paper reviews the current knowledge of the use of phosphatidyl-choline in the treatment and diagnosis of liver disease and discusses its advantages and disadvantages. <EOD> The role of HLA class II in the immunogenicity and immunopathogenicity of vaccines.
The immunogenicity of vaccines is largely dependent upon the activation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and is strongly influenced by the peptide binding motif of the CTL epitope. The importance of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I in CTL activation is known, but the role of HLA class II in CTL activation is largely unknown. The activation of class-II-restricted CTLs was first demonstrated with the use of a model vaccine consisting of the gp160 envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In the process of vaccination, this protein undergoes proteolysis to yield an amino-terminal fragment (gp160-N), which is presented by HLA-DR1-restricted CD4(+) T cells. The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I- and class II-restricted epitopes of viral gp160 overlap. Vaccination of DR1(+) individuals stimulates both MHC class I- and class II-restricted CTLs, whereas immunization of non-DR1(+) individuals stimulates only class I-restricted CTLs. The gp160-N peptide is capable of eliciting both MHC class I- and class II-restricted CTLs. However, only class I-restricted epitopes bind to HLA-DR1 with high affinity. The class II-restricted epitope binds to HLA-DR1 with considerably low affinity. This suggests that a combination of high-affinity binding to MHC class I and low-affinity binding to MHC class II, in addition to appropriate physiochemical properties, is important for the successful vaccination strategy. <EOD> PREVALENCE OF NUTRITIONAL RISK CONSTITUTES IN ELDERLY PATIENTS WITH MULTIMPARTERIAL FRACTURES: A NATIONWIDE STUDY

PURPOSE: Osteoporosis imposes an economic burden of $19 billion annually, with a 100% increase in medical costs every 1 g/dL decrease in BMD. Osteoporosis is a major cause of bone fragility and increased fracture risk, making it a serious clinical problem. Due to the aging population, the number of patients with fracture associated with osteoporosis increases year by year. Osteoporosis cannot be diagnosed with dualenergy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) alone, and evaluation of muscle mass and function, nutritional status, and body balance are required. Because many elderly people with osteoporosis live alone, diagnosis is difficult. Sarcopenia is a muscle disorder associated with aging and is characterized by age-related loss of muscle mass and muscle strength, physical activity, functioning, and nutritional status.

 <EOD> Identification of the in vivo receptors responsible for adipose and brain uptake of N-palmitoyl-D/L-homocysteic acid in rat.
The in vitro uptake of N-palmitoyl-D/L-homocysteic acid (NPHC) into various tissues including adipose tissue, liver and brain cortex in rat, was investigated in studies with 14C-labeled NPHC. At 37 degrees C, uptake of NPHC into fat cells followed first-order kinetics (Km 0.24 mM, Vmax 0.15 nmol/min per g, t1/2 beta 15 min). The in vitro Vmax and Km were much higher for fat than liver cells and almost no difference was found between the Vmax but a marked difference was found in Km values between fat and brain cells. The in vitro uptake of NPHC into fat cells and liver cells showed competitive inhibition (Ki was 67.9 and 99.6 microM in fat and liver cells respectively) by D-sarcosine with an almost six times higher potency than L-sarcosine (Ki was 412.7 and 335.3 microM in fat and liver cells respectively). The inhibition of NPHC uptake by either D- or L-sarcosine, was more effective in adipose cells compared to liver cells. The inhibitory potency of DSarcosine on NPHC uptake into fat cells did not decrease with increasing concentrations of D-sarcosine. Moreover, the in vitro uptake of NPHC into adipose and liver cells followed linear kinetics (Km 74 microM, Vmax 69 and 97 pmol/min per g respectively), over a wide range of NPHC concentration. These results suggest that adipose cells possess two classes of different in vitro uptake mechanism for NPHC, one with a high affinity and another with a low affinity. Moreover, in vivo distribution studies in rats revealed a higher accumulation of NPHC in adipose tissue than in the brain.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) <EOD> COP9 signalosome controls activity of the human protein kinase DYRK1A by regulating its subcellular localization and stability

DYRK1A is a highly conserved, non-classical protein kinase. The most prominent abnormality of DYRK1A is its overexpression in Down's Syndrome, a genetic disorder associated with intellectual disability and pathologies like Alzheimer's disease. Although the regulation of DYRK1A activity is relatively well characterized, it remains elusive how increased DYRK1A expression in Down's Syndrome affects its activity. Here, we employed a genetic and immunohistological approach to show that DYRK1A levels and its inhibitory phosphorylation state are directly inversely proportional to COP9 signalosome (CSN) activity in human neuroblastoma cells and brain. In contrast, overexpression or deficiency of full-length CSN caused no change in overall DYRK1A levels in these cells. Instead, DYRK1A activity is regulated by CSN by controlling its subcellular localization and stability. In the CSN knockdown cells, hyperactivated, phosphorylated DYRK1A localises to the nucleus and increases cellular DYRK1A levels probably by inhibiting its autophagic degradation. CSN deficiency also results in overaccumulation of nuclear DYRK1A, which hyperphosphorylates and activates its nuclear substrates"

 <EOD> Developmental changes in the effect of an inter-aural correlation on spatial unmasking.
The benefits of spatial separation for speech understanding are well known to decline throughout development. These benefits are at least in part due to an inter-aural processing advantage, whereby information in the target signal is better extracted if it is encoded in a different manner to the masking noise when it is spatially separated. The strength of this inter-aural processing advantage may depend upon the correlation between target and masker signals, measured by the interferer. The current study investigated the impact of development upon the interference ratio, defined as the difference in interference in the masked thresholds for two spatial configurations, differing in both level and spacing, when the maskers are uncorrelated and correlated in the left-right direction. Five- to 6-year-old and young adult listeners performed an adaptive speech intelligibility task for sentences in noise. Spatial unmasking effects were observed for both age groups, but 5- to 6-year-old children showed a greater unmasking due to inter-aural correlation. The findings indicate that the interference ratio varies with age, in the sense that older listeners show a larger increase in interference ratio with decreasing spatial separation/increased masker level. Together with previous findings, the results imply that the development of inter-aural processing plays a central role in the maturation of speech in noise understanding over childhood. <EOD> On the origin of the 1977 U.S. outbreak of Legionnaires' disease: the possible role of water distribution systems.
There is a general consensus, based on clinical, environmental, and epidemiologic information, that the water cooling towers at large industrial complexes or parks were the vectors for Legionnaires' disease (LD) that plagued the Eastern part of the United States in 1977. However, many have questioned the ability of cooling towers to be involved since epidemiologically they were not significantly associated with more cases of LD in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia in that year than the background risk. This paper considers the possibility that water distribution systems could have been involved, and, based on analogy with similar outbreaks as well as a consideration of the epidemiologic case definitions used in the 1977 outbreak, we conclude that this possibility must be considered seriously. In summary, there is now direct epidemiologic support for several hypothesized modes of transmission for airborne LD, all of which invoke water and its distribution systems. Furthermore, these three studies, in addition to several epidemiological studies from New Jersey and Delaware and the study reported in this paper, together suggest the water distribution system should be considered as a potential source for this outbreak of LD. <EOD> Changes in pulmonary function during exercise.
The effect of exercise on pulmonary function has received increasing interest since it was recognized in I955 (Barach and Gollan, I955; Chirillo et al., I964), that changes in lung ventilation which occur during exercise are associated with changes in pulmonary volume and flow (Widdicombe, I961). The lung function of a normal person in the resting state is measured by a number of factors (Goldman, 1966), the most important of which are lung volume and pulmonary flow rate. Exercise is a powerful stimulus to lung volume changes and causes a large increase in pulmonary flow and minute volume (Pattle, 1956; Gollan, I957; Widdicombe and Nixon, I960). During vigorous exercise these factors may be 2-10 times those achieved in quiet breathing, and the functional lung volume may change to only a small extent. Pattle (I956, I964) found that 20 minutes of light exercise increased expiratory tidal volume to 1300 ml; he also showed that this large increase in lung volume can occur without increase in lung expansion, with a consequent increase of the proportion of dead space in total respiratory volume. <EOD> Pain assessment tools: overview of instruments identified in a comprehensive review for an ongoing research.

 <EOD> Flexible and Wearable Temperature Sensor Based on PEDOT/Ag Nanothermocouple with Super-Narrow Intrinsic Resolution

Citation: Wang, S.; Zhang, Y.; Hou, M.; Yu, Y.; Sun, Z.; Li, W.; Wu, Q.; Zhang, Z.; Zhao, Y. Flexible and Wearable Temperature Sensor Based on PEDOT/Ag Nanothermocouple with Super-Narrow Intrinsic Resolution.Abstract:The conventional thermocouple is bulky, expensive, and hard to be miniaturized. Here, a highly sensitive flexible and wearable temperature sensor was fabricated by assembling a hybrid nanostructure PbO/Cu@PEDOT/Ag (POPA) thermocouple on a thermally conductive, stretchable polyimide (PI) substrate by drop-casting and vacuum filtration. The POPA film, obtained by the in situ growth of Cu on a PbO@PEDOT core-shell nanober array, exhibits the unique high temperature sensitivity of up to 211.2 mV K −1 and the outstanding intrinsic resolution of 0.01 K, which shows good thermoelectric performance at a low temperature below 425 K, and at the same time, it is highly sensitive for the detection of body temperature. The temperature sensor with excellent sensitivity, linearity, stability and repeatability can be easily realized by in situ growth of Cu onto core-shell nanobers, which will effectively reduce the cost and complex operation processes of the sensor. Therefore, the POPA temperature sensor is proposed as a new sensing platform for multifunctional wearable sensing electronic systems in the future.

# Introduction
As a new sensing platform, temperature sensors can accurately monitor the temperature information in various industrial applications and medical diagnosis, such as the body temperature of newborns, the temperature distribution of electrical circuit boards, the temperature change of electronic components to predict overheating, the temperature change of machining tools to prolong the life of blades and so on.

Intrinsic brain complications in children with primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) include mainly nocturnal hypersomnolence leading to daytime sleepiness, increased motor activity and hyperactivity of arousal-alerting system. A group of PNE children with pronounced nocturnal hypersomnolence shows sleep onset insomnia (unrefreshing sleep) and poor quality of sleep. A group of children with normal and hypersomnolent sleep exhibits the decreased sleep efficiency (SE). Sleep structure of PNE children with normal and hypersomnolent sleep is characterized by an increased number of awakenings, shortened arousal time, decreased duration of rapid eye movements period (REMP) and REM density. A group of PNE children without sleep pathology is characterized by the increased number of awakenings. The first two groups of children with PNE differ by means of the decreased SE and SE and number of awakenings. <EOD> .
Granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is one of the most potent cytokines inducing mobilization of CD34+ haematopoietic stem progenitor cells into the peripheral blood (PB). This study was aimed at evaluation of the effectiveness of G-CSF mobilization of CD34+ cells in 45 patients who had undergone high dose chemotherapy. The effectiveness of stem cells mobilization was measured by the number of CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood and by the number of CD34+ cells collected in the apheresis. The number of CD34+ cells collected per apheresis procedure, with a daily application of G-CSF mobilizing the cells into PB, ranged from 1.4 x 10(5) to 43.7 x 10(6) cells in the individual patient. In 20 patients who received CD34+ cells in the peripheral blood, the number of collected CD34+ cells was positively correlated with the number of cells in the peripheral blood in the day of harvest. The correlation between the number of CD34+ cells in the donor's blood on the day of the apheresis and the number of the cells collected in the procedure was statistically significant. A strong positive correlation between the number of the collected cells and the number of CD34+ cells in peripheral blood in the patient on the day of harvest was observed. The data shows that the mobilization of cells can be predictably performed in PB of a donor by applying G-CSF, and that the number of CD34+ cells in the donor's peripheral blood is the indicator of successful mobilization. The optimal mobilizing dose was established as 5 to 10 mg of G-CSF daily. <EOD> Phosphoproteome analysis of rice plant roots under phosphate starvation.

Input Text: CONFIDENTIAL Clinical and Neuroimaging characteristics of patients with probable Alzheimer type and subcortical type vascular dementia

Study Overview
================-
Clinical background
================-
- Increasing life expectancy, coupled with improved medical facilities, results in an increasing incidence of dementia and in particular Alzheimer disease (AD). However, this is partly compensated by the reduced incidence of post-stroke dementia (PSD), presumably as a result of better management of vascular risk factors.
- Despite reduced incidence of stroke, the relative prevalence of vascular dementia (VaD) has remained relatively unchanged at levels of approximately 15-20%: Pure subcortical VaD (PS-VaD) has recently been described according to the NINDS-AIREN criteria (International cerebral vascular dementia investigators, 1994 ).
Need/Background
================
Research problem and gaps: (1) A few studies have reported clinical and radiological features of PS-VaD and compared them with AD. However, these studies have been performed only in Western countries, and results from South Asia are scarce or unknown. Such comparison may help in identifying a group of patients who would benefit from a different treatment.

Study design
================-
Objective of the study

### Primary objective
The primary research question addressed by the study is: ‘Are clinical and neuroimaging characteristics in patients with Alzheimer type and subcortical type vascular dementia (PS-VaD), different in patients from South Asia compared to Western Europe?’.

### Main secondary objective
The secondary research questions addressed by the study are: `Are there clinical or neuroimaging predictors to distinguish the subgroups?` and `Can this distinction improve patient selection for a randomized treatment trial?`

### Exploratory secondary objectives
Exploratory secondary research questions addressed by the study are: `What is the association between amyloid and clinical or radiological parameters in VaD or AD?‘ and `Do neuropsychiatric symptoms at baseline predict conversion of VaD to different types of dementia over time?`

Outcome measures

 <EOD> Diagnostic yield of a fast, automated cell enrichment and preparation method for the detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae by polymerase chain reaction in urine (FastCT/GC) compared with conventional methods.
BACKGROUND
Chlamydial and gonococcal infections are among the most common reportable infectious diseases in the United States. Tests that are rapid and can be performed at the point of care are desired. The goal was to evaluate a new test that combines cell collection and lysis, automated sample handling, nucleic acid extraction, amplification, and detection of Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.


METHODS
From February to April 2005, 233 urine specimens were submitted for culture using both microscopy and an automated blood culture instrument, Gram stained for cell count and morphology, and analyzed by a Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae PCR assay. Each sample was then evaluated separately using FastCT/GC. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of the FastCT/GC test were determined and assessed for agreement with the standard culture method. The impact of specimen matrix, sample volume, and PCR method on the sensitivity of the test was also evaluated.


RESULTS
The overall sensitivity for both FastCT/GC and conventional PCR was 94%. For the 14 specimens that were inconclusive using conventional PCR, 11 could be tested by FastCT/GC; all were definitively positive or negative. This included 5 specimens with very low levels of C trachomatis DNA, 6 with low levels of N gonorrhoeae DNA, and 1 with both C trachomatis and N gonorrhoeae DNA at low levels. In all instances, detection occurred within 40 min. The sensitivity of the cell culture method was 88%.


CONCLUSIONS
A new method of specimen manipulation in conjunction with polymerase chain reaction greatly simplifies the diagnostic testing process when compared to conventional methods (cell culture and blood culture) and a PCR-based PCR test. <EOD> Transsphenoidal Resection of Basal Interpeduncular Schwannoma with Preoperative Localization by Dynamic Contrast-enhanced MR Images.
J Korean Neurosurg Soc 49 : 669 A 27-year-old man presented with mild left hemiparesis and dysarthria, and mild left side Babinski s sign. He had no history of severe trauma. Initial MR imaging findings displayed a large mass that was located in the left base of pons extending into the interpeduncular cistern, adjacent to the left internal carotid artery (ICA, Fig. 1). The mass was relatively well circumscribed and had heterogeneous intensity on MR imaging and slight contrast enhancement on T enhancement dynamic contrast-enhanced MR image (Fig. 2). The transverse and coronal reconstructed images of T2WI, DWI, and T2WI-FLAIR sequence revealed that the left basal pontine mass was located adjacent to the left ICA and the left foramen ovale. The MR images showed the mass was located in the pontine paramedian and basal interpeduncular cistern, adjacent to the midbrain, not far from interpeduncular cistern area (Fig. 3). The preoperative radiology findings that this lesion was a small and soft tumor of pontine paramedian and basal interpeduncular cistern were expected. Our patient underwent a left transsphenoidal endoscopic approach for tumor resection. We performed a detailed dissection of the skull base and pterygopalatine fossa to expose the tumor, and then we removed the tumor successfully. The size of the tumor was 3.5 cm×2.5 cm×4.5 cm. Postoperative MR image showed small residual of the tumor. There was no new neurological signs. At 2-year follow-up, the patient demonstrated no evidence of recurrence on MR imaging and had no neurological symptoms. <EOD> Comparison of HRP-TaqManTM versus HRP-APTT for the measurement of factor VIII activity.

 <EOD> A model for the synthesis of phosphatidic acid from glycerol-3-phosphate and water-soluble phosphate.
A model for the synthesis of phosphatidic acid (PtdOH) from glycerol-3-phosphate (lyso-PtdOH) and water-soluble phosphate is presented. The pathway consists of glycerol-3-P (or lyso-PtdOH):2H2O/P(i):water-soluble phosphate. It also considers the reverse reaction (with lyso-PtdOH as a phosphate acceptor) as a minor part of the system. It demonstrates that the synthesis of PtdOH from lyso-PtdOH and H2O/inorganic phosphate is a slow process (half-life 10-20 h at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C); this rate of synthesis is consistent with the intracellular concentrations of phosphate and lyso-PtdOH. The significance of this slow rate of synthesis of PtdOH is discussed. The model indicates that the rate-limiting step consists only of the initial and/or rapid formation of lyso-PtdOH rather than the rate-limiting step of the PtdOH synthesis from lyso-PtdOH and phosphate. At the high concentration of inorganic phosphate in the lysosomes (20 mM), this reaction would be expected to occur by diffusion of lyso-PtdOH across the lysosomal membrane. <EOD> Bound and free serum trypsin inhibitors in hyperlipoproteinemic patients.
Binding and nonbinding trypsin inhibitors (TIns) were compared in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia. Both forms of TIn had similar molecular weight, elution profiles on concanavalin A and wheat germ agglutinin affinity columns, and thermal stability. Neither trypsin inhibitor was associated with lipoprotein lipase (LpL) activity, whereas free TIn was found to be a minor component of chylomicrons by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. <EOD> Hormonal modulation of cerebrovascular resistance and the pressure wave.
Because cardiovascular disease and stroke are age-related problems with strong links to both high blood pressure and disrupted cardiovascular pressure waveforms, this thesis evaluated hormonal influences on mechanisms responsible for controlling the pressure wave in cerebrovascular resistance vessels in young and old animals. Vascular resistance responses were evaluated to graded elevations in blood pressure and heart rate in young normotensive (N = 15) and aged hypertensive (N = 14) spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) with (SHR-ISA) and without (SHR-C) chronically implanted intracerebroventricularly (icv) osmotic minipumps infusing l-isoproterenol or vehicle. Blood pressure was recorded noninvasively, and cerebrovascular resistance (CVR) was evaluated from arterial pressure changes in response to electrical stimulation of carotid sinus afferent nerves. The effects of icv l-isoproterenol and aging on cerebral arterial and venous vasomotion were evaluated in young (N = 10) and old (N = 9) isolated cerebral arterial rings precontracted to approximately 50% of maximum tone with noradrenaline. A transient ischemic episode was induced by reducing the cerebral blood flow of SHR (N = 6), Creneged rats (N = 6), Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (N = 6) and SHR with chronic icv l-isoproterenol (N = 8) by approximately 50%, and arterial pressure and cerebral blood flow were recorded for 1 h. Finally, the relationship between the pressure wave recorded at the carotid artery and venular blood flow was assessed in young (N = 10) and old (N = 10) rats with indwelling microultramicropumps recording cerebral venular blood flow. In the young animals, cerebrovascular pressure waves"

Participants with advanced terminal illness will be asked to take part in a study comparing live-to-recording music therapy. For this purpose they will be randomised upon their arrival at the Palliative Care Ward of the University Hospital of Zurich. They will undergo two 20 min-sesison of either live music therapy session or listening to a recording thereof, always accompanied by the same music therapist. During these sessions, the level of pain, anxiety, depression and fatigue will be assessed with the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System, the Quality of Life Questionnaire 15PAL and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Patients will have to rate their overall quality of life, anxiety, depression and fatigue. An interview for qualitative data, such as subjective musical preferences, emotions, general reaction will be performed and recorded with each patient following the music therapy session. The study investigates which kind of music therapy is judged more acceptable for patients on a palliative care ward by assessing heart rate, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity and body temperature. As foreseen by the theoretical framework of acceptability, an intervention-specific acceptability questionnaire will be filled out at the beginning and the end of the study. <EOD> .

Liver perfused with lactate and replenished with glyoxylate formed less glucose but more 3-carbon ketone bodies from glutamate. The ketone bodies were partly utilized for gluconeogenesis in preference to lipid synthesis. The rate of gluconeogenesis was higher and the rate of fatty acid synthesis was lower in lactate perfusion in the presence of 5 mM glyoxylate than in lactate alone, showing inhibition of the metabolic pathway from glutamate to C2-C4 ketone bodies and stimulation of the metabolic pathway from glutamate to glucose. 2-Oxoglutarate also stimulated the gluconeogenesis, partly suppressing reductive amination of ketone bodies to lipids. 1,2-Benzenedicarboxylate enhanced gluconeogenesis from 3-carbon compounds, but not from 2-carbon compounds. The stimulating effect of 1,2-benzenedicarboxylate on gluconeogenesis was suppressed by 2-oxoglutarate. Aminoacetone (10 mM) also stimulated gluconeogenesis and decreased fatty acid synthesis. The effects of these compounds were similar to the effects of glycine (5 mM). 2-Oxoglutarate and aminoacetone did not enhance the ketonemia in lactate-perfused rat liver in vitro. Glycine stimulated gluconeogenesis and fat metabolism with concomitant aminoacid and ketone body synthesis in vivo as well as in vitro. <EOD> .

Accurate and efficient segmentation of moving objects plays a vital role in multiple biomedical image analysis tasks, such as motion estimation, cardiac boundary detection, and registration. Several deep learning techniques applied to the tasks have achieved reasonable performances in speed and accuracy. However, the current deep learning methods mostly use fixed training patches, resulting in inaccurate detection of fast-moving objects in the whole space. Moreover, the training parameters are fixed without being optimized for a particular clinical task. In this paper, we proposed a deep neural network called the 3D ResNet model aiming to solve the aforementioned problems. This work was motivated by the observation that the convolution kernels used in image segmentation can be adjusted to work better with moving objects rather than static ones, which gives rise to a more efficient learning of deep feature representations. Therefore, to improve the effectiveness of the model, a 3D convolution kernel with higher frequency is used to capture more features of the moving objects. This idea combines with the skip connection mechanism to create the 3D ResNet model, by which the deep-level feature representations and the detailed structure of moving objects are jointly learned with an increased number of features extracted. A novel online training strategy has been developed and evaluated to adjust the model training parameters to each specific clinical task accordingly. We conducted experiments on a large multi-site data to show that the proposed model could segment moving objects better than other deep structures. Meanwhile, the online training method allows the 3D ResNet to use the most effective model for clinical tasks with different speeds or types of motions. Moreover, the proposed model could learn more robust feature representations using online training techniques, compared with the end-to-end training method. The results from this study suggest that the proposed deep model can serve as an efficient tool to segment moving objects in different clinical tasks.

Background

# Background

Due to the rapid changes in China's economy, social and cultural environment and people's awareness of nutrition and beauty, adolescent AN has become a more and more serious psychiatric disorder that has to be focused on by medical staff. It is reported that the incidence of adolescent AN increases year by year. The prevalence rate is about 0.3% according to a national survey, and the ratio of female to male is 4-10:1. In 2020, the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China included eating disorders in the list of 15 common diseases that cannot be delayed. At present, the clinical treatment of AN mainly includes nutritional therapy and psychological therapy. However, compared with normal people, patients with AN usually show poor compliance to nutritional and behavioral interventions, and easy discontinuation from the course of intervention, due to the fear of weight gain. Thus, the treatment of AN is still in great demand.
As a promising treatment method, deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) uses an electromagnetic coil to stimulate the patient's brain to generate electrical brain waves, which plays a therapeutic role on the cerebral cortex, deep brain nuclei and spinal cord, as well as inhibits dysfunctional structures and circuits. As a safe non-invasive treatment, dTMS has been widely used in refractory depression and treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In addition, studies have shown that dTMS may improve impulsivity, anxiety symptoms, and executive functioning in AN patients . To summarize, dTMS is a safe and effective method for the treatment of AN, and may be applied to patients for its potential advantage.



## Purpose
The purpose is to explore the clinical efficacy and safety of dTMS in the treatment of AN.

 <EOD> Hormonal changes in the sheep after experimental injection of estrogens into the pineal gland and after stimulation of the pineal with gonadotropic hormones.
THIS report is based entirely on findings in the ewe, a species in which ovarian function does not greatly interfere with the hormonal activity of the pineal gland (3). The sheep is considered suitable for such work because of the availability of convenient, reliable and sensitive quantitative procedures for the assay of hormones and for the determination of hormonal activities in ovarian extracts (2, 4, 6). In general the sheep is of physiological and other advantages superior to any other domestic animal and for these reasons most of the bio-asay work and a great deal of the hormonal investigations are being carried out in this species. Certain data on pineal glands of other domestic animals, as far as they have been studied with pineal glands of the sheep, may be found elsewhere (l, 2, 5). In general, the findings on the sheep concur with the results secured from other species even though striking individual variations in hormonal content or activity are not uncommon. Some of the results reported by MILLAR, BROWN and CROZE (1, 6) and some of the quantitative data secured by CROZE (7) on the sheep are of great interest, but we wish to emphasize that these results are, on the whole, not directly comparable with one another, nor do they compare well with other published data. As a matter of fact, this investigation has been carried ... <EOD> The Role of Platelet Count and its Kinetics in Predicting Mortality of Patients with Severe Sepsis and Septic Shock: A Systematic Review with Meta-Analysis

BackgroundClinical trials suggest that severity of thrombocytopenia at admission contributes to septic shock and death; however, there is no consensus statement regarding platelet count (PC) and PC kinetics as a prognostic factor for sepsis. Therefore, here we performed a systematic review with meta-analysis in aim to investigate if admission PC and PC kinetics have independent association with 28-day mortality in severe sepsis and septic shock patients, and if these associations differ between patients in the intensive care unit and non-intensive care unit.MethodsStudies were retrieved by systematic searching Pubmed and Embase using the terms: (""Sepsis"" OR ""Septic Shock"" OR ""Severe Sepsis"") AND (""Platelet count"" OR ""Thrombocytopenia"" OR ""Thrombocytopaenia"" OR ""Thrombocytosis"" OR ""Platelet number""). All studies were evaluated in eligibility by two authors independently. Quality of the included studies was assessed following the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. The prognostic performance of PC and PC kinetics in severe sepsis and septic shock patients was analyzed using Haldane-Anscombe method, sensitivity analysis, multivariate analysis and meta regressions.ResultsThirty-nine studies were included in this analysis; 31 focused on sepsis and 8 on septic shock. The included studies showed high heterogeneity, but overall meta-analysis revealed that both admission PC (>29 vs<29, odds ratio [OR]: 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-1.78, P = 0.045) and change in PC (ΔPC 1-ΔPC 2 vs ΔPC 1-ΔPC 3 , OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.13-1.74, P = 0.001) were associated with increased mortality. However, no independent association was found when adjusting for confounding factors in the multivariate analysis and meta regressions.ConclusionsAlthough admission PC was associated with 28-day mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock, it could not act as an independent prognostic factor.

Intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IVPCA) is widely used in the postoperative period. Its administration can be difficult in morbidly obese patients. We have assessed the administration of intercostal nerve blocks (ICNB) for the management of IVPCA in morbidly obese patients. A retrospective evaluation was made of the anesthesia records of 200 consecutive morbidly obese patients who had bariatric surgery. In 100 patients intercostal nerve block (ICNB) using 15 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine hydrochloride was added to IVPCA with fentanyl. In 100 patients IVPCA was used alone. The mean (+/- SD) total fentanyl consumption using IVPCA in patients receiving ICNB (42.54 +/- 40.90 microg) was significantly lower than in patients receiving IVPCA alone (270.8 +/- 197.7 microg) (P less than 0.001). Intercostal nerve block as an adjuvant to IVPCA was effective in providing postoperative analgesia in addition to decreasing the incidence of side effects and drug overuse. ICNB is recommended for patients who require prolonged postoperative analgesia. <EOD> .
Infections caused by resistant agents are becoming a more frequent problem in recent years, both in surgical patients (SAP) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The study was performed in order to evaluate the sensitivity to antimicrobials of the most frequently isolated microorganisms in our hospital. We performed a retrospective study of the frequency of infections by resistant microorganisms in a surgical-intensive care unit (SICU) of a non-university hospital in Madrid. MIC90 of the most frequent pathogens isolated since the opening of the SICU, was determined (Vitek system) as well as the frequency of infections by multiresistant microorganisms (VRS). All ICUs' patients admitted from January to June 2002 were included in the study. In the studied period, 989 patients were admitted to our ICU but 50 were excluded from the study for different reasons (ICU beds were full at the moment of admission, patients were admitted from other ICU or ICU patients have been hospitalized more than 7 days). Microbiological data came from the Central Laboratory of our hospital. We analyzed 939 records (male: 522, female: 417), age: mean 58.84 years (range 16-98), SAP: 84.9%. The most frequent microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 20.77% (MIC90 to Carbapenems: 8 mg/L), Klebsiella 12.02% (MIC90 to Carbapenems: 16 mg/l), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-bucneus 11% (MIC90 to Carbapenems: 16 mg/l), Escherichia coli 8.43% (MIC90 to Carbapenems: 16 mg/l) and Enterobacter cloacae 7.09%. 15.22% of the isolates presented high level resistance to Carbapenems, Pseudomonas Aeruginosa (16.66%), Klebsiella (16.66%), Acinetobacter calcoaeticus-bucneus (15.38%), E. coli (14.29%) and Enterobacter cloacae (13.04%).

 <EOD> The 4.1-kDa N-terminal Domain of p21-activated Kinase 1 Modulates Enzyme Activation in Response to the Ras/Raf1 Signal*

In many cell types, activation of p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1) is initiated by interactions between the N terminal of PAK1 and active p21-binding protein (PBD) domain of Cdc42. The current study revealed a critical role for amino acid residues 3-44 of PAK1 in regulating enzyme activity. Truncation of the PAK1 N terminus (amino acids 4 -102) increased PAK activity. A number of mutations in the PAK N-terminal domain were generated that disrupted binding to the PBD of Cdc42. These mutations also increased enzyme activity in bacteria, when constitutively active PAK1⌬N was coexpressed with PBD fragments containing Cdc42, Rac1, and Rac2. Additional mutations within the putative helix-loop-helix motif (residues 8 -27) of the N terminus disrupted Cdc42-and Cyr1-induced kinase phosphorylation but did not affect enzyme activity in bacteria. Furthermore, kinase activity of PAK1⌬N-PAK1 3-44 was inhibited by the Rac effector domain (residues 6 -92). These findings show that the PAK1 N-terminal domain and the PAK⅐Cdc42 docking interaction are not required for enzyme activation. However, the N-terminal domain may regulate PAK enzyme activity.

Input Text: Role of MDSCs and Cancer Stem Cells and Their Cross Talks in NSCLC

 
Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
In recent years, immune-based therapies have revolutionized the field of oncology by significantly improving survival of cancer patients. Despite sustained responses, only 20% to 40% of cancer patients respond. It has become clear that the immunosuppressive environment induced by tumor through cellular and/or soluble pathways critically contribute to hinder efficient antitumor immunity. The inhibition of these immunosuppressive networks thus represents an essential prerequisite for the improvement of responses to anticancer immunotherapies. Several immune cell populations have been identified as key actors of tumor-induced immunosuppression, among which are myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and regulatory T lymphocytes (Treg). However, in non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), the prognostic role of these cells, the mechanisms underlying their immunosuppressive functions, their non-immunological protumoral functions and their role in dampening the efficacy of immunotherapies in clinical practice are less characterized. The aim of this project is to better characterize the non immunologic functions of MDSC. We propose to assess in vitro the non-immunological pro-tumor functions of MDSC isolated from lung cancer patients

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effect of autologous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) for treatment of acute spinal cord injury (SCI) by spinal cord transplantation.


METHODS
A rat model of acute SCI was established. The SCI rats were divided equally into 2 groups: the treatment group administered with BMSCs by spinal cord transplantation and the control group not treated with BMSCs. At 1, 7, 14, 28 days after the transplantation, the locomotor function recovery, HE and Nissl stainings were evaluated.


RESULTS
Rat motor deficits at 1, 7, 14, 28 days after the treatment were significantly improved in the 2 groups. The rats of treatment group had significant better motor functional recovery than the control group. However, the results of Nissl and HE stains showed no difference between 2 groups.


CONCLUSIONS
BMSCs transplantation could improve the motor function of rats with acute SCI, which might be related with anti-inflammation, neurotrophic support and angiogenesis. <EOD> A Case of β-Cell Lymphoma Presenting as an Enlarged Pancreatic Head and Liver Metastases

[INSERT] <EOD> SUN-301 Sickle Cell Crisis Presenting with Acalculous Cholecystitis
Abstract Background: Acute cholecystitis is one of the most common biliary tract diseases. Acalculous cholecystitis occurs sporadically in younger adults and is even more rare in children. It is most often seen in patients with severe systemic illness. Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment of acute cholecystitis. Case Report: A 19-year old male with a history of sickle cell disease, previously diagnosed at 1 year old presented, after a long journey, to the emergency with cramping abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and yellowish discoloration of urine for the past 2 days. On arrival to the USA emergency room, he was vitally stable, afebrile, hemodynamically normal. He did not report any other significant past medical history or risk factors. On physical exam, his sclera were icteric. His abdomen was tender with moderate distention on the left upper quadrant and was non-tender to palpation with no rebound or guarding, and normal bowel sounds on auscultation. There was no stigmata of chronic disease on physical examination. Labs showed hyperbilirubinemia as well as significant metabolic parameters. CT abdomen/pelvis with contrast showed marked abnormal fluid in the gallbladder fossa with no acute calculus or other acute process within the gallbladder, consistent with acute acalculous cholecystitis. Additionally, the CT showed multiple gallstones without acute inflammation and without hepatic atrophy. The gallbladder was noted to fistulize to nearby structures without pancreatitis. The patient’s gallbladder appeared thickened with minimal inflammation. Erythrocyte and total bilirubin was 22 ( 0.2 -1.0mg/dl). His Sickle solubility test was 104% with an elevated level of lactic dehydrogenase of 446 U/L. His hemoglobin and hemoglobin A1c were 10.0 gm/dl and 11%, respectively. A cholecystogram/hepatobiliary iminodiacetic acid (HIDA) scan performed 2 hours after the procedure showed no extravasation at the cystic duct of the gallbladder. A transabdominal scan using a linear scan head showed no extravasation. There were no signs of pancreatitis on the hepatobiliary imaging. Conclusion: Most patients with acute cholecystitis present with acalculous gallbladder inflammation. Sickle Cholecystitis is a rare complication of sickle cell disease. We report a case of a 19-year-old male with a history of sickle cell disease who presented with yellowish discoloration of the urine; sclera icteric; abdominal pain and nausea. He was diagnosed as gallbladder acalculous cholecystitis. He was managed accordingly and did not require surgery. The incidence of gallstones in sickle cell cases varies from 0% to 19%. He had a history of prior episodes of sickle cell crisis which required hospitalizations and pain treatment. The etiology of sickle cell disease is likely a combination of the genetic alteration, increased oxygen affinity of sickle hemoglobin, changes in the intravascular oxygen gradient or vasoocclusion resulting in an altered flow dynamics of an existing abnormality in the vascular endothelial cells. There are multiple causes of gallbladder injury in sickle cell disease such as ischemia, sludge, abnormal oxygen affinity, changes in intravascular concentrations of oxygen and vasoocclusion. Sickle cell cholecystitis is treated with supportive fluid and rest. Transcatheter cholecystostomy, ischemic cholecystitis and embolization, interventional radiology and laparoscopic cholecystectomy are alternative means of treatment. Sickle cell cholecystitis is a rare complication of sickle cell disease. We report a 19-year-old male with a history of sickle cell disease who presented with yellowish discoloration of the urine, sclera icteric"

This study randomized the volunteer patient into 2 groups as follow: the patient with placing negative pressure drainage in the surgical wound and the patient without placing negative pressure drainage. Randomization To minimize the study bias, the investigators random patient into two groups by the unassociated personnel opens an enclosed envelope after the surgical procedure is completely performed and before the beginning of closing the skin layer. Blind process This study does not conceal information about surgical technique and drainage placing method. However, the investigators have controlled various surgical procedures to reduce inequality in assessment and bias. Negative pressure drainage is a drainage catheter which is placed in surgical wound for draining fluid such as hematoma, seroma, and pus. In this study the drainage the catheter will be placed in the wound for 5 days and/or removed if fluid content is less than 20 ml per day. Jackson-Pratt or Redivac catheter is used in this study because it is cheap and widespread in all hospitals. The drainage catheter is placed after completion of surgery and before skin closure. Surgical site infection (SSI) is infection at surgical wound which happens within 30 days post operatively and in this study will use in term of superficial SSI (pus oozing, cellulitis and wound culture positive) If patients have SSI, the investigators remove the drain from the patients (intervention group) and may total stitch off suture then wet dressing combine with antibiotic. the investigators evaluate and collect data by physical examination at post operation day 3, day 5,day 7 and the day that patient is discharged from hospital. Then investigators follow up the patients at 14 days and 30 days after discharged from hospital.The complication of SSI is seroma, hematoma and wound dehiscence. Seroma is the retention of clear fluid in the cavity of the body such as a surgical wound. Typical clinical presentation is fluid oozing from the wound. Hematoma is the retention of bloody fluid in the cavity of the body such as a surgical wound. It can be infected which is possible to prevent by stop bleeding intraoperatively and evaluate surgical wound every day. Wound dehiscence is partial or total separation of previously approximated wound edges, due to failure of proper wound healing.

Background
--------------
Surgery is one of the most common interventions and is increasing annually. The abdominal surgery is in the field of general and pediatric surgery and is increasingly common in both specialties. Surgery is one of the most common procedures around the world due to the increase in the demand for these operations. There has been an increase in the demand for abdominal surgery with a low mortality rate and a high incidence rate of complications. One of the complications that occur after the procedure is surgical site infection. Surgical site infection is an infection that can occur over the wound of the cut of the body surface such as incisions or opening access. Surgical site infection can also affect areas of the body, such as the area of the abdominothoracic incision and incision (laparotomy-thoracotomy). The patient who undergoes abdominal surgery may have different infections in the abdominal cavity, intra-abdominal infections, peritonitis, abscesses, and sepsis. These complications can occur due to various factors which are associated with the patient or surg"

Input Text: A Randomised Study Comparing the Immune Modulation Effect of Ribociclib, Palbociclib, and Abemaciclib in ER+/HER2- EBC

Detailed Description
-----------------
The 3 FDA-approved CDK4, 6 inhibitors provided progression-free survival benefits when combined with endocrine therapy in advanced ER+/HER2- breast cancer. However, one of the proposed mechanisms that influence the overall survival difference is the different influence of the 3 CDK4,6 inhibitors on tumor microenvironment and/or immune system. There was no head-to-head comparison of the 3 CDK4, 6 inhibitors in the same study. Moreover, a direct comparison of the influence of different CDK4, 6 inhibitors on immune system in a prospective setting is still lacking. Neoadjuvant therapy provides a window to obtain tissue samples before treatment, during treatment, and after treatment. We aim to compare the immune modulation effects of palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib with letrozole in neoadjuvant treatment for ER+/HER2- early breast cancer. We will collect tumor tissue, blood, and stool samples prospectively before treatment, at 2 weeks after treatment, and after 12 weeks of treatment at the time of surgery. Immune modulation effects will be compared between 3 treatment groups from breast tumor RNAseq analysis.

## Introduction
-------------------------------------
Dementia is a diagnosis that does not exist in isolation from the person living with dementia (PLWD) and their social context. Rather than focusing solely on clinical manifestations of a disease, which does not reflect the complex set of challenges that PLWD and their caregivers face, the World Health Organization encourages a global movement toward “dementia in all policies,” recognizing the crucial need to focus on supportive care rather than solely curative care [1]. Supportive care that focuses on the person, prioritizes community, and promotes person-centered care is defined by the World Health Organization as an “integrated approach to caring for the person with dementia or cognitive impairment, taking into account the concerns and care of the person and his or her carers, and providing support to and enhancing abilities to perform meaningful, everyday activities, while enhancing quality of life and engagement for all” [2]. Supportive care models recognize the importance of support for PLWD and their families [3][4].
The Home-Based Primary Care (HBPC) Program is a model of supportive care for frail, noninstitutionalized adults with serious illness and complex health care needs. Supported by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Center’s Independence at Home projects, HBPC programs have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing utilization of both formal and informal care in comparison to other post-acute care models . Anecdotal reports from the front lines of this work, and from our own research in HBPC, suggest that these programs may also be effective in addressing the care-related needs of PLWD. We have found, however, that many HBPC practices struggle with how best to incorporate PLWD into interventions and to assess, support, and encourage caregivers. Formal supports, such as educational materials and community resources, are rarely accessible or integrated into care. Practices vary in their knowledge, experience, and comfort with providing quality and culturally appropriate dementia care. To address these gaps, we designed Dementia Care Quality at Home (Dementia Care Quality at Home) and conducted a pilot study. Dementia Care Quality at Home (DCQ at Home, hereinafter referred to as Dementia Care Quality, or DCQ) is a supportive care intervention for PLWD and their caregivers that incorporates a standardized assessment, educational resources, and a team-based case conference approach to problem-solving. The pilot study demonstrated that it is feasible to provide dementia care education to HBPC providers and staff and provide education to and support for caregivers  (N = 93, 95% female). However, we found that recruitment of staff (44/100) and caregivers (61/187) was less than anticipated.

## Objective
This pilot study will establish feasibility, acceptability and fidelity of Dementia Care Quality in the setting of two HBPC practices, as well as demonstrate the safety of implementing this intervention to patients and caregivers. This pilot trial allows for the collection of quantitative and qualitative data on participant experiences, with the ultimate goal of preparing a full-scale randomized controlled trial to test the DCQ intervention and to assess the impact on the health of PLWD and their caregivers. In addition, we anticipate that the results of this pilot study will contribute to the development of tools for assessing dementia care intervention feasibility, acceptability, fidelity, and intervention effectiveness.

## Pilot study aim
| The primary aim of the pilot study is to assess acceptability and feasibility of implementing HBPC Dementia Care Quality (DCQ) program by caregivers and practices.|

## Secondary aim
| Secondarily, we will assess the preliminary impact of HBPC Dementia Care Quality (DCQ) program by caregivers.|

## Practice settings and locations
------------------------------
The two HBPC practices participating in this pilot study are affiliated with the University of Rochester Medical Center, located in Rochester, New York. Both practices employ a holistic team-based approach to HBPC care, with at least one physician trained in HBPC, registered nurses as primary team care providers, and social worker, pharmacist, and behavioral health specialist support. Home-Based Primary Care teams see patients in the home and can also assess patients at"

 <EOD> The impact of a 5-h workday on physician well-being, patient care satisfaction, quality, and costs: an exploratory study.
BACKGROUND
As the US population ages, there is an increasing need for more physicians to provide high-quality health care to a greater number of older adults with multimorbidity. However, burnout of physicians is at an all-time high. Given that fatigue is the primary driver of burnout, interventions to reduce physician fatigue are urgently needed.


OBJECTIVE
The objective of this study was to determine whether a 5-hour workday results in improved physician self-reported well-being measures, without a detriment to patient care or patient satisfaction scores.


DESIGN
We conducted an exploratory nonrandomized clinical trial to examine whether a 5-h workday improved primary care physician well-being, patient care satisfaction, and quality measures including potentially avoidable emergency room visits in a large integrated health system (253 providers at 3 locations).


PATIENT POPULATION
Eligible patients were adults who were 18 years or older, English speaking, had a regular ambulatory care provider, and were continuously enrolled in the health plan for at least 6 months during a 1-year measurement period.


PRE- AND POSTINTERVENTION SURVEY RESPONSE RATES AND HOSPITAL DISCHARGE DATA
The rates of response to the electronic employee satisfaction surveys were 50% preintervention and 76% postintervention; the rates of response to the electronic patient satisfaction survey at 3 months were 77% preintervention and 84% postintervention. For the postintervention 1-year period, 84,927 patients were included in our comparison. Before and after the intervention, the rates of potentially avoidable emergency room visits were 10.8% and 9.3%, respectively (P < .0001). There was a significant reduction in physician well-being scores, such as the perceived stress level and the amount of work that felt unmanageable.


DISCUSSION
A 5-hour workday resulted in improved patient-reported satisfaction and a decrease in potentially avoidable emergency room visits. This pilot project suggests that a shorter workday can significantly improve physician well-being and has the potential to reduce emergency room visits, improve continuity of care, and deliver high-value care to patients. The use of information and communication technology in health care enables patients and providers remote access to services during a 5-hour workday. Such an intervention could significantly reduce patients' wait times in the emergency room and outpatient clinic and free up physician time for patient-centered, higher-value care. <EOD> In Vivo Validation of an Accelerometer-Based Wireless System for Free and Prosthetic Gait Analysis in Canines

This paper introduces and validates an accelerometer-based system for in-field acquisition of motion-sensor-based gait patterns. The main features include lightweight, low power, ease of use, real-time data transmission and full-body gait analysis, features that would enable the routine acquisition of gait kinematics under everyday living conditions. Fourteen adult healthy dogs participated in the study. The motion sensor system, which is composed of eleven wearable triaxial accelerometers combined with a 2.4 GHz radio-frequency transmission and processing unit, was placed on the animal's back, at the base of the neck and each of the metatarsal joints of both front and hind limbs. The wireless accelerometerbased approach was compared to a standard optical motion capture system used for video-recording gait pattern over five walking sessions under lab conditions (control-lab). A significant relationship was determined in all sessions between the two systems with an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC between 0.84 and 0.98. Standardized correlation coefficients of the mean acceleration values showed a strong level of agreement (r = 0.78-0.96). The present study provides in vivo validation of an accelerometer-based wireless system in freely moving dogs and"

Group A (n=8):
1-No statistically significant differences were found between groups A and B in Wv, W3DV , and W2DVDV (P>.05)
2-Statistically significant differences were found in all wear values after 6 months of use, regardless of the materials used (P=.001)

Group B (n=8):
1-Statistically significant differences were found between groups A and B in Wv (P:=.033), W2DVDV (P=.025),W3D (P:=.021), W3DV (P:=.016), W2DV (P:=.014) and W2DVV (P:=.024)


Detailed Statistical Analysis
=============================
This study used non-parametric methods because the continuous variables do not have normal distribution. Therefore the continuous variables were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney test.
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to examine the changes in the studied variables between the experimental and control groups and within each group separately for each denture type.
The Shapiro-Wilk Test was used to test the normality of distribution of the studied variables and the skewness, kurtosis, Q, Z. The p-values of the Shapiro-Wilk Test, kurtosis, Z, and skewness were used to detect the distribution of the studied variables.


Conclusion
=================
The preliminary results of this study revealed that the 3D, 2D V, 2D V V V and S HH of the denture teeth made with CAD\CAM system were higher, whereas the S V, S V V
and S V V V were lesser than those of the denture teeth with prefabricated teeth (P >0.05). No significant improvement of these parameters in the new dentures was observed after 6 months compared to those of the previous dentures.

Use the following format for the summary: The title, trial type, start month, start year, last month, last year etc and summary. The summary should be a short, concise description of the content of the trial. It is not a meta-analysis.
Trial Overview
----------------
This study was conducted at Centre Hospitalier Valladolid Spain and involved 99 subjects undergoing anesthesia for their surgical intervention. This included liver metastasis and intensive liver tumors. Data was collected and analyzed for 3 years. The study aimed to compare the effects of the intra-operative use of propofol and sevoflurane on the prognoses of patients undergoing surgery for primary brain, liver, lung, and ovarian cancers and the investigation of its mechanism of action and determine 3 year overall survival.
Trial Design
-----------------
Clinical trials are research studies whereby those participating in the trial usually undergo one or more changes to their usual care or treatment whilst in a clinical trial.
The design of a randomized controlled study aims to minimize the chance that any differences in outcomes are caused by chance rather than the impact of the change(s) that are being investigated. A study has two basic groups (called the arms) and participants are assigned (randomly assigned) to these groups. One group usually receives a placebo, and the other group receives the actual intervention of interest.
A prospective study is a study design whereby data are collected or is done prior to the trial participants receiving their treatment (intervention). A prospective trial often will collect data for the purposes of measuring the potential benefits, such as survival and overall survival. A prospective trial will generally consist of two arms but this was not the case with this study but nonetheless the above design was used.

The design of a randomized controlled study aims to minimize the chance that any differences in outcome are caused by chance rather than the impact of the change(s) that are being investigated. A study consists of two basic groups (called the arms), and participants are randomly assigned to these groups. One group usually receives a placebo, and the other group receives the actual intervention of interest.
A prospective study is a study design whereby data are collected or is done prior to the trial participants receiving their treatment (intervention)
Clinical trials consist of basic two study groups which will have different types of anesthetics. The control group receives intravenous propofol, and the intervention group receives inhalation sevoflurane. The anesthetics are considered to be an appropriate anesthetic for the patient.
The trial will take place at the hospitals Valadolid. The trial is conducted in three waves. The study recruited patients from the three waves from September 2002 to January 2005.
The trial will compare intra-operative use of propofol and sevoflurane on the prognoses of patients undergoing surgery for primary brain tumors, liver, ovarian cancer over the course of 3 years. The primary outcome was overall survival of the patients.
The results should be able to show that sevoflurane is more beneficial when compared to intravenous propofol for use with anesthesia.

Input Text: Dissemination of Physical Activity-related Health Competence in Vocational Education of Nursing Care Study Overview <EOD> Association of C-reactive protein with markers of inflammation in type 1 diabetes
Abstract.  C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase protein with known association with cardiovascular risk, is a biomarker of inflammation that may be elevated in type 1 diabetes (T1DM). We aimed to assess this association using several inflammatory biomarkers. T1DM subjects (n = 70) and 76 healthy controls had their CRP, IL-6, TNF-α, fetuin-A, homocysteine, and adiponectin levels measured. Associations between CRP and each inflammatory marker within group were evaluated using linear regression; and differences in association magnitude and their corresponding interaction terms between groups were evaluated using general linear models. T1DM subjects had higher CRP and IL-6 than controls (mean values; 3.5 vs. 2.4mg/L and 1.17 vs. 0.62pg/mL, respectively; both p < 0.001). In T1DM, but not controls, increasing CRP was associated with increased fetuin-A (p < 0.001). In controls, but not T1DM subjects, increasing CRP was associated with decreasing adiponectin (p = 0.012). No association was observed between IL-6 and CRP in either group. Within group, CRP was not associated with TNF-α, homocysteine, or age in either group; or with body mass index (BMI) in the controls. This is the first report to show that CRP was associated with fetuin-A and adiponectin in T1DM, but only fetuin-A in the controls; indicating that this acute phase protein may reflect different inflammation states with T1DM status. <EOD> .
During a two-year period eleven patients (ten men, one woman, average age: 45 years) were operated on because of a dissecting aortic aneurysm at the Department of Thoracic Surgery of the University of Berne. Eight patients showed the disease as a complication after a previous thoracic operation, often combined with a valvular heart disease, especially aortic valve incompetence. In most patients in the first place a combination of symptoms caused by the aortic dissection was operative indications. The aneurysm was resected up to and including the aortic valve in all patients. Three patients underwent additionally a graft replacement of the thorax aorta, one patient needed a replacement of the aortic arch as well. Postoperatively one patient developed a subphrenic abscess with fistula into the right pleural cavity, which was conservatively treated. Two other patients died postoperatively. Four patients (36 %) showed recurrence and progress of their disease during follow--up observation times from 4 to 48 months. <EOD> Heteroaggregation of nanoparticles: an analytical perspective

Driven by recent advances in the design of new colloidal nanostructures and nanoparticles (NPs), and by their application in numerous research fields and technological applications, the need for knowledge about how they interact with their environment is of fundamental importance with significant effects on process design and performance of both new and existing systems. In this article, an overview is presented on the heteroaggregation between nanoparticles and molecules, macromolecules, or other nanoparticles to obtain new nanocomposites, nanoconjugates or nanoassemblies with enhanced optical, structural and/or mechanical properties and/or multiple stimuli responsive functions. New functionalities can be offered to those materials in response to environmental stimuli and/or in the presence of particular substrates. For these complex functionalities, new applications are possible. The current challenges of this research field and the advances achieved in the last decade are discussed, highlighting the analytical results with the aim of enhancing further research in this challenging field.

Purpose / Goal
-------------

Description: To evaluate the efficacy of daflon vs. metformin or in combination, in comparison to placebo, in reducing insulin resistance in patients with PCOS. (Metformin is used to treat hyperinsulinemia, which is the main cause of the hormone imbalance that leads to PCOS.) 100 Patients will be enrolled in the study. Each participant will receive 20 tablets of the study drug at random and will use these 20 tablets for 4 months, after which they will be asked to come back to the clinic for a follow-up evaluation. Results will be recorded in terms of the following markers: fasting insulin (FINS), Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), and IL-6 (a cytokine produced by white blood cells and other immune system cells) levels. The outcome will assess the improvement of inflammation and glycemic index. Primary outcome measures will be assessed using paired t-test (Wilcoxon signed rank test). The effect size, mean difference, and 95% CI for these indices will be calculated at a 0.05 level of significance. Pearson’s correlation coefficients will be used for analyzing correlations. The sample size is based on the following assumptions: 100 participants will be recruit in the trial, 94 participants will complete the trial, and the required sample size is 46 participants who will be evaluated for efficacy and safety. Based on previous studies, the average expected effect size for FINS will be d=0.7. Standard error is assumed to be 0.25; α=0.05 and 1-β = 0.8. The sample size of patients with PCOS (5-10%) in a population of this size is expected to have 12 participants with PCOS; α=0.05 and 1-β = 0.9.

# Background/Need for Study
Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common hormonal disorder among young women of reproductive age, and is defined as irregular menstrual periods, enlarged ovaries, and increased levels of androgen, an estrogen and progesterone precursor. The syndrome is also known for its association with insulin resistance, diabetes, obesity, and dyslipidemia. Women with PCOS are 40% to 70% overweight, with 34.2% of them having the metabolic syndrome. It is a disorder of unknown etiology, although several hypotheses have been proposed including defects involving insulin binding to its receptor and changes in the insulin receptor gene. The syndrome causes hirsutism, acne, increased scalp hair, and male pattern baldness. It is also associated with the formation of cysts in the ovaries, which can cause infertility. The disorder affects between 5% and 10% of women of reproductive age, and around 7% to 8% of women in the United States. Currently, there is no accepted cure for PCOS and treatments are only for symptom relief.

# PCOS Treatments
Currently, there are several treatments for PCOS that target weight loss, improve symptoms, and address complications, including oral medications, topical medications, procedures, and lifestyle changes. The most common oral medications include insulin sensitizers such as metformin and thiazolidinediones which are used for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and are increasingly being used as a first line therapy in patients with PCOS, and low-dose aspirin with folate which are used to regulate blood flow to the follicle to stimulate ovulation and improve pregnancy rates. Other oral medications include oral contraceptives (combined or progesterone only) to minimize irregular menses and to prevent excess androgenic effects of elevated LH activity. Other medications include anti-androgen medications to relieve symptoms of acne and hair growth. Procedures such as laparoscopic ovarian cystectomy, hysterectomy or laparoscopic myomectomy are also possible, while l"

[/CONTINUOUS V ARBITRARY] <EOD> The relationship between antimicrobial susceptibility and pneumococcal survival in patients with bacteremic pneumococcal infections.
Antimicrobial sensitivity, pneumococcal capsular type, and pneumococcal survival were retrospectively determined during a 3-year period in patients diagnosed as having pneumococcal bacteremia. The patients were allocated to three groups according to drug sensitivity. In patients whose isolates were sensitive to penicillin in vitro, mortality was significantly lower (27%) than in patients with strains intermediate (66%) or resistant (50%) to penicillin (chi2 = 9.5, df 2, P = 0.009). Pneumococci of serotype 1 had the lowest serum survival. <EOD> Lumbar lordosis in low back pain patients.
Abstract Low back pain patients have been shown to have significant increase in lumbar lordotic angulation relative to age‐matched normal controls. We measured this increased lumbar lordosis in patients with low back pain, preoperatively, post operatively and at the six‐week follow‐up. An identical number of lumbar lordosis measurements were also done in a random sample of low back pain patients undergoing operation. Twenty‐six and twenty low back pain patients were seen pre and post operatively, whereas 60 and 136 patients at six weeks follow‐up, respectively. Preoperatively the low back pain patients showed a large proportion of increased lordosis of between 5° and 10°, with the highest incidence of increase being in patients with postoperatively and six‐weeks follow‐up respectively.

 <EOD> A novel monoclonal antibody against rat and human glutathione reductase: production and functional analysis



# Methods
The monoclonal antibody (mAb) was produced against the purified rat liver GR (rGR) by using lymph node cells of immunized Balb/c mouse as the immune envelope producing cells and myeloma cells of NS1 mouse for the fusion. The antibody positive hybrid clones were selected and cultured in-vitro to produce the antibodies. The positive hybridoma was also injected subcutaneously into the hind leg of the BALB/c mouse in order to prepare ascites. The specificity and sensitivity of the antibody were determined against various tissues by immunostaining and Western blot techniques. Glutathione reductases were isolated from the cytosolic fractions of rat kidney and mouse liver using DE52 anion exchange chromatography and immunoblotted with mAb against GR.

# Results
In the present investigations, a new monoclonal antibody designated as 25/4/29 was obtained against the purified rGR. The specificity of monoclonal antibody (mAb) was tested against various organs of rat and human in immunoblot and immunoprecipitation studies and found sensitive. The rat and human glutathione reductases were cross reactive and was recognized well by monoclonal antibody.

# Conclusion
Hence, these findings might be helpful to study functional aspects of glutathione reductase and its regulatory mechanisms in the future in this experimental system and for the development of anticancer drugs. http://www.jcancer.org/content/1/1/54 Page 2 of 3

 <EOD> A multigene expression signature predicts survival in advanced melanoma independent of clinical variables.
OBJECTIVE
This study sought to derive a molecular predictor of outcome in patients with metastatic melanoma, independent of established clinical prognostic factors.


METHODS
Histopathological and clinical data were derived from the Cancer Genome Atlas database of 377 patients with primary or metastatic melanoma. The gene expression patterns of 472 tumor samples were quantified to generate a signature using a supervised support vector machine algorithm. The signature was validated in a prospective case series (Cohort 2) of 101 patients with unresectable, stage III/IV metastatic melanoma treated with systemic therapy. The final clinical model was derived by multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis.


RESULTS
The signature was correlated with the melanoma survival and had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.79 (95% confidence interval 0.68 to 0.87), suggesting very good differentiation and a positive concordance index of 0.73, indicating good calibration. We found that patients with lower expression of the signature gene classifier had a better overall survival than those with higher expression . Importantly, after adjusting for established clinicopathologic parameters, including age, sex, performance status, body mass index, lactate dehydrogenase, and presence of brain metastases, the prognostic value of the gene classifier persisted.


CONCLUSION
The risk model developed by our group, and validated in an independent cohort, is an independent predictor of survival in patients with advanced melanoma. Additional studies aimed at refining tumor sampling techniques are warranted to increase tumor gene signature homogeneity. <EOD> Prenatal sonographic diagnosis and intrauterine treatment of epidermolytic hyperkeratosis

Objective: This experiment investigates the effects of age on measurements of the total vascular resistance index (RVI), with and without an autonomic nervous system response function (RFR) component. <EOD> Antioxidant activity of thiol peptides and enzymatic hydrolyzates of thiopeptide from Scylla paramamosain in hydrogen peroxide-stressed Caenorhabditis elegan
Thiol peptide is characterized by the presence of cysteine and has unique antioxidant activity. In this study, a thiol peptide named ThSP21, which contained 21 amino acid residues and two disulfide bonds, was obtained from Scylla paramamosain. Enzymatic hydrolysis was performed by Trypsin B from S. paramamosain. Seven enzymatic hydrolysates (EHs) were produced via hydrolysis of two enzymolysis times (EP1–T2 and EP2–T2). The maximum peptide production rate was observed by 24 h EP2–T2, and the maximum peptide yield was observed by EP1–T2 and EP2–T2. The total antioxidant capacity of ThSP21 was 54.80% at 1 mmol/L concentration, and the intracellular reactive oxygen species of C. elegans decreased significantly (p < 0.05) after it was stressed with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and then treated with ThSP21, EH1–T1, EH1–T2, and EH2–T1 at 200 and 400 μmol/L concentrations. The DPPH radical scavenging capacity was 26.13%, 32.35%, 35.64%, 11.96%, 30.99%, and 8.71% for ThSP21 at 2–8 mmol/L, EH1–T1 at 40–125 μmol/L, EH1–T2 at 20–50 μmol/L, EH2–T1 at 10–50 μmol/L, and EH2–T2 at 5–15 μmol/L, respectively. Therefore, EH1–T1 was the best antioxidant among the obtained hydrolysates, and the RT-PCR experiment results confirmed that the expression levels of sod-3, sod-2, and hsp-16.1 increased (p < 0.05) significantly. These results demonstrated that ThSP21, EH1–T1, EH1–T2, EH2–T1, and EH2–T2 significantly alleviated H2O2-stressed and increased C. elegans’ survival. The obtained hydrolysis products are of great value and can be applied in the functional food industry. <EOD> A case report of two brothers with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia due to f(a+) antigen of their mothers

440,"[/INST]Please summarize the rationale for this study and the objectives of this RST in brief <100 words>

Summary: [/INST]Please summarize the inclusion and exclusion criteria, number of subjects, and study design. For example: ""The number of people with advanced gastric cancer treated at the hospital for the past 5 years was estimated. The prevalence of this disease was calculated. This study is a cross-sectional study of patients with advanced gastric cancer who are available for study.""

Summary: [/INST]The authors should describe the type of RST conducted and whether the results of the study should be interpreted as the results of individual subjects or the results of a large group of subjects. For example: ""This study will recruit a large number of patients, compare the prevalence or distribution of the different characteristics of the participant patients in our hospital, and use statistical analyses to reveal the trends in the distribution or characteristics of each group of subgroups that make up the group."" -""The results of this study will only show the results of each subgroup of the sample and cannot and will not analyze the results of the individual patient."" The above two statements are equally valid as they are correct statements. The choice of ""which statement is good for RST?"", ""Which statement is most applicable to RST?"" or ""Which statement is suitable for RST?"" will be based on your judgment.

Timeline: [/INST], 1. Timetable of the RST < 100 words> <300 words> 2. Please describe why and when to perform each set of analyses in your study, including the time of enrollment and collection of data and withdrawal of individuals from the study and when they are stopped. (Please also refer to SPIRIT Checklist Explanation and Elaboration for more details): ""This study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital"".

Timeline: [/INST], <100 words> 2. Please state the time of the intervention and follow-up and the frequency of occurrence/data collection of each variable. ""These follow-ups will take place at regular intervals of 2 to 3 weeks."" ""Study participation ended after 2 years, and all data were collected for 2 years."" -""The sample size was determined by calculating the sample size of other similar studies with the help of biostatisticians, which was also determined based on the sample size estimation analysis of this study.""

Background: [/INST]The authors should provide background information on the RST to help the reader better understand the scientific rationale for conducting the RST. For example: ""According to the American Heart Association, it is recommended that adults aged 18 or over should engage in a combination of strength training and aerobic training on most, most or all days of the week in order to strengthen their cardiovascular system, muscles, neurological system, etc."" The number of times these should be repeated depends on the number of sections that describe the background of the RST.

Background: [/INST]The authors are required to describe and clarify the problem that the RST will address and clarify how the researchers plan to address these problems in detail. For example: ""Although there is a large amount of research evidence on the relationship between diet and cognitive diseases, many of them focus on the analysis of patients, leaving out the population who has a diet before they develop a disease or the control population and also ignore the individual's health status after dietary intervention. The prevalence of cognitive diseases has increased in the past 20 years, which has led to an increase in the number of the elderly and the ageing population and may have a negative impact on them. The prevalence of cognitive diseases among the elderly and ageing population is 4.4%
among seniors, although the morbidity is only about 10%.""

Background: [/INST]Please mention the relevant publications related to the RST. For example: ""We plan to conduct in-depth analysis of the relationship between diets, neurological diseases and individual diets based on nutritionist data collection. Dietary intervention may decrease the risk of neurological diseases and can improve the nutritional status and quality of life. The analysis uses a large number of RCTs and meta-analysis as references and systematically discusses the mechanism for diet plan.""

 <EOD> The Prevalence of Myopia and Its Association With Sociodemographic Factors in Saudi Children and Adolescents
Purpose The prevalence of myopia increased globally; many causes for this rapid increase and its related factors are not fully understood. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of myopia and its association with sociodemographic factors in Saudi children and adolescents. Methods This study was a school-based cross-sectional study conducted through April 2019 in both urban and rural areas of the Makkah region in Saudi Arabia. The study targeted both females and males aged from 5 to 18 years old. Sociodemographic information and history were collected from the interviewed and noninterviewed children. A full ophthalmologic examination was provided, including spherical equivalent. A refractive status lesser than −2 diopter was defined as myopia. Results A total of 4,966 children and adolescents were interviewed and 4,350 underwent full ophthalmologic examination. Myopia prevalence in this sample was 4.3%; among those, 2.5% were males, and 8.3% were urban residents. The most common refractive errors in both genders were hyperopia and no refractive errors. The prevalence of myopic parents was 1.2%, while the prevalence of myopia after the interview was 0.7%. Moreover, the prevalence of low and high myopia after the interview was 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively. The prevalence of myopia after the interview was higher in younger and rural children/adolescents. Conclusion The prevalence of myopia increased in young and rural residents. More efforts should be made to educate Saudi parents about screening their children for refractive errors. Moreover, further studies are needed to investigate the causes of the increased prevalence of myopia in this region. <EOD> .
Objective: To explore the role of PPARβ/δ in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(NAFLD). Methods: High fat(HF) diet and low fat(LF) diet group were selected, PPARβ/δ antagonist and agonist were fed in LF diet group and high fat diet group, respectively. Western blotting method was used to detect the PPARβ/δ, phosphorylation of PPARβ/δ (PPARβ/δp), FAS and SREBP-1C expression levels in liver tissue and adipose tissue. Oil-Red-O dyeing was used to detect the lipid content of liver tissue. Real-time fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was used to verify the role of PPARβ/δ in the development of NAFLD. Results: The expression levels of PPARβ/δ and SREBP-1C in liver tissue of LF diet group was significantly higher than that of high fat diet group; The expression level of p-PPARβ/δ in liver tissue of LF diet group was significantly higher than that of high fat diet group, There was a significantly inverse relationship between the expression of p-PPARβ/δ and that of adipose tissue PPARβ/δ.

The paper analyzes the results of a complex examination and treatment of 63 patients with various forms of chronic atrophic gastritis and precancerous conditions. The results revealed a significant increase in the duration of the disease after H. p. infection, irrespective of the severity of atrophic changes in the mucosa; a tendency of exacerbation of the disease was observed at the same time. The effectiveness of treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis increased when the combination of antisecretory drugs (cimetidine) and antibacterial antioxidants of combined action (citomaxin) was used. <EOD> A Randomized, Double Blind, Parallel Study of Metaproterenol versus Placebo in Patients with Asthma and Cardiovascular Disease
A double blind, randomized, controlled trial was performed in 65 adult patients with mild to moderate persistent asthma using a metered dose inhaler (MDI). The trial demonstrated that cardiovascular effects were not observed when the study patients, classified as having cardiac comorbid disease, were administered 6.6 mg and 13.2 mg of metaproterenol daily (approximately 0.2 mg of metaproterenol for each 500 mg capsule) via an MDI versus a placebo. <EOD> Synthesis and biological evaluation of 5,6‐dihydroneopterin triphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor for tRNA-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase

Transfer RNA-guanine-hypoxanthine-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase (GART) is one of the rate-limiting enzymes of the de novo purine biosynthesis pathway. The catalytic function of GART has been proposed as a potential drug target for therapies against tuberous sclerosis complex due to the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin in the pathogenesis of this neurotrophic disorder. A variety of GART-specific inhibitors have been developed, while no specific substrate analog-based inhibitor has previously been documented. Recently, the crystal structure of mouse GART revealed that 5,6-dihydroneopterin triphosphate (dh-NHTP) is a direct substrate for mouse GART, in which the substrate-binding pocket can accommodate both the N and C termini of dh-NHTP, whereas other pyridine-nucleoside analog tRNA-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase substrate analog inhibitors have been recognized to be less active due to the restricted space in the substrate-binding pocket. Therefore, the tRNA-guanine-phosphoribosyltransferase substrate dh-NHTP can be regarded as a potential lead compound for the design of GART inhibitors. To develop more active inhibitors, we synthesized more natural dh-NHTP analogues, followed by a structure-activity relationship study. Furthermore, we developed a synthetic protocol for the large-scale synthesis of dh-NHTP. The enzyme experiments revealed that dh-NHTP is a competitive inhibitor of GART, with a dissociation constant of"

 <EOD> A Fatal Case of Intrajugular Injection by Misunderstanding the Anatomical Structure Between the Internal Jugular Vein and Superior Vena Cava

Intravenous (IV) misadministration is a common clinical event but a fatal case is extremely rare in the literature. This is a case report on an elderly lady who died as a result of IV misadministration. This case is the first reported fatal case with evidence of the injected solution in the internal jugular vein. Moreover, her superior vena cava was not patent due to thrombus but had normal diameter. Both jugular veins and the superior vena cava are superficial veins on the neck. A 72-year-old woman with left-side chest pain received an injection by the patient's daughter. She was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction at a local private clinic and was then transported to Shimane Prefectural Central Hospital. She died 2 hours after the administration. There were two syringes at the time of her death. One consisted of air and had an 18G needle length of 90 mm and a total length of 155 mm. The other was filled with the injected solution was 90 mm in length and had an 18G needle tip and an 80 mm total needle length. There was no information regarding the IV administration at the local private clinic. The syringe consisted of air had a needle length of 90 mm. Therefore, we hypothesized that this syringe was used at the local private clinic. The syringe filled with the injected solution had a 90 mm needle length and a 155 mm total length. It was speculated that the syringe was transferred inappropriately and was thought to be used for another patient. The 18G needle used in this case was the most common size in IV misadministration. The length of the needle was the biggest risk factor for IV misadministration. The depth of the needle into the vein was a critical cause for IV mis"

Input Text: Study of the Influence of Intraperitoneal Insufflation of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) by Laparoscopy on the Short-term Evolution of Premature Infants With Ulcerative Necrotizing Enterocolitis

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
----------------------

ECUN is the most common extreme-premature complication (before 37 weeks of amenorrhea) requiring surgery in Europe, and the USA. This clinical condition affects 2 to 10% of premature babies between before 34 and 36 weeks of amenorrhea. Its onset is unknown but may be related to the fact that most of these babies are exposed to aminoglycoside antibiotics because of their birth weight (<1,000 g weight). If not correctly treated, ECUN may progress into intestinal stenosis and necrosis, with intra-abdominal abscess and death.

Postoperative complications (severe digestive, vascular or neurological lesions) may reach 10% of cases. Moreover, ECUN is associated with increased mortality of around 10%, even after treatment (25%). Recent studies have suggested that certain intraoperative monitoring techniques (such as Trans-oesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)) could help in preventing intraoperative complications and thus reduce the mortality. In practice, TEE is not routinely used in all prematures surgical teams but in selected cases with clinical or TEE features suggestive of postoperative complications (e.g. haemodynamic instability with cardiac dysfunction).

Although ulcerative NEC is recognized as an entity of its own in neonatology, there is a lack of randomized controlled trials focused on preterm newborns. This clinical situation remains a challenge both in gesta-tional medicine and paediatrics. For preterms, the European consensus statement in the treatment of ECUN was first published in 1998.

Preterm newborns are treated for ECUN with a 3-day antibiotherapy and a prokinetic effect to improve the restoration of intestinal transit of ingested bromide. In the absence of evidence of evolution towards necrosis, bowel resection is contraindicated and is used only in the setting of necrosis (abscess, perforation or intractable ischemia).

This trial attempts to describe the evolution of intestinal necrosis and the functional tolerance of laparoscopy.

 <EOD> Development of a novel device for evaluating functional properties of the upper limb.
BACKGROUND
Hand movements are essential for daily life and work, and impairment can dramatically reduce the performance of activities of daily living. The goal of this study was to construct and evaluate a system equipped with multitouch screens for measuring upper limb function.


METHODS
We constructed an upper limb system. In the upper limb system, we employed multitouch screens in order to develop a device to evaluate the function of the upper limb. For the design of the software for the evaluation of upper limb function, we adopted items from the manual activities of daily living, and motor function tasks evaluated in previous articles, as a measurement model. We validated the upper limb system by performing quantitative evaluations using the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) of the upper extremity, and functional independence measures (FIM), on 30 patients (10 able-bodied subject and 20 stroke).


RESULTS
The FMA-scores of the able-bodied subjects are 14.6 points (range, 11.4-17.0), 8.6 points (range, 4.0-12.0), 15.8 points (range, 8.0-21.4), 8.3 points (range, 6.0-12.0), and 32.0 points (range, 28.6-33.6) in the gross motor, shoulder/elbow, wrist/hand, coordination, and sensory-motor section, respectively. The FIM-scores in the motor subsection are 0.0 points (range, 0.0-8.0), 24.0 points (range, 21.0-27.0), and 13.0 points (range, 7.0-23.0) in the bedside (B), transfers (T), and sphincter control (S) items. Those in the cognition subsection are 2.5 points (range, 2.0-5.0), and 2.0 points (range, 2.0-2.0) in the comprehension (C) and expression (E) items, respectively.


CONCLUSIONS
These results indicate that the upper limb system is reliable and valid in the quantitative evaluation of upper limb function. <EOD> A new species of Agyneta (Agyneta) from the northeast Himalayas (Araneae: Liocranidae)

* The evolution of BD-tau levels will be characterized by: the time point when plasma BD-tau levels start to rise after onset (defined as the earliest time point (in relation to onset) that showed higher BD-tau levels compared with the previous assessment and lower levels compared with the next assessment), the type of rise (e.g. linear, exponential, or logarithmic), and until when plasma BD-tau levels continue to rise (defined as the time point (in relation to onset) compared to which BD-tau levels do not increase by ≥ 5 % compared to 1h, 2h, and 3h afterwards). 5 % were chosen without prior knowledge and in an attempt to account for assay-dependent variations of BD-tau quantifications (coefficient of variation 8-9 %)18 while keeping a biologically and clinically plausible value (rather than e.g. 10 %). This definition also ensures that an increase of plasma BD-tau levels by ≥ 5% compared to the value obtained 1h, 2h, and 3h previously is indeed a rise and not a normal variation. Plasma levels of BD-tau will be assessed using a single-molecule array assay.

It was shown, that human recombinant leukocyte interferon preparation (INF, Pharmaton, Pasteur-Merieux/Ribi) can be used for the treatment of the patients with lung-cancer. INF administered in a dose of 3 x 3mlnu for 4 months was effective, in 11 of 27 patients. The patients with metastasized lung-cancer showed a response in 3 cases. The results of the examination made before and after administration of INF, were compared with the results of 20 patients treated with chemotherapy with various combinations of antitumor agents. Significant differences were found on average in the life duration, but not of a degree of improvement in the quality of life. From the side-effects of the mentioned groups of patients no difference was found. In the group treated with INF as well as in the patients in the control group, the average life duration was higher than after treatment with the various combinations of chemotherapeutic agents (2-6 months). <EOD> Degradation of lignocellulosic biomass: fundamentals towards potential targets for bioengineering, Mekid et al. 115181
Energy supply demands have pushed the search for new means to produce renewable substitutes for the fossil resources, like petroleum and coal, which have been the major energy source worldwide. In this respect, lignocellulosic biomass is promising because of its abundance and its wide availability. Due to its biological construction, one major challenge is to develop efficient systems to generate useful products from this complex material. In this regard, the enzymatic digestion of the different polysaccharides in order to obtain free monomeric sugars represents the central biochemical process. The different types of enzymatic complexes involved in pretreatment and cellulose degradation have been identified and characterized. To develop enzymatic systems at an industrial level, many efforts have been carried out to improve the features of commercial cellulases, to improve the process itself, as well as identifying novel proteins with desired properties. Overall, the use of biologic tools to tackle the complexity of lignocellulose is being explored in order to improve the biomass conversion. This review brings an update of the enzymatic degradation of the predominant biopolymers present in the cell walls of this biomass (cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin) as well as on its regulation and bioengineering targets from the last 5 years. <EOD> A randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of oral administration of methylthiouracil to prevent hyperthyroidism in dogs receiving radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism.

The transcripts detected encoded a novel defensin (F07H11_s0171g24180), other antimicrobial peptides, and enzymes of the phenylpropanoid and monolignol synthetic pathways. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, expression patterns of four representative genes for these pathways were investigated relative to gene expression profiles detected in leaves of plants induced with fungal elicitor(2), SA, and FLA through a time course. Results indicated a strong but transient induction 48 h post-elicitation of transcription and expression of enzymes of the phenylpropanoid/monolignol pathway, and of genes encoding the GSII elicitor receptor. The F07H11_s0171g24180 defensin transcript accumulated in leaves of GSII-F9 a -treated plants until 120 h post inoculation. The presence of a consensus elicitor recognition motif (WRKY) in the promoters of all genes suggests elicitor-specific regulation of gene expression by activation of the SA pathway. Comparison between FLA-and GSII-F9 a -elicited responses indicated similar patterns of genes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis, with differences in the timing of gene induction.

AIM
To assess the safety and efficacy of the MiniMed 640G insulin pump with SmartGuard technology, which modulates basal insulin in response to mealtime insulin delivery, over 3 months in adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D).


METHODS
A two-arm randomized control trial was carried out in T1D adolescents and adults (ages 14-65), who were randomized 1 : 1 to 12 weeks of treatment with the 640 G pump with or without SmartGuard. The primary endpoint was percent time in hypoglycaemia.


RESULTS
A total of 76 patients (56 with SmartGuard and 20 without) were randomized, with 73 and three participating in the SmartGuard and non-SmartGuard groups, respectively. Baseline patient characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. Overall percent time in the hypoglycaemic range (<70 mg dl(-1)) decreased from 8.8 to 6.1 and 8.1 to 7.1 in the SmartGuard and non-SmartGuard groups, respectively (between-group difference 1.0, 95% confidence interval: -1.0 to 3.14). Percent time in the hypoglycaemic range <54 mg dl(-1) decreased from 5.3 to 3.9 and 5.0 to 3.3 in the SmartGuard and non-SmartGuard groups, respectively (between-group difference -1.4, 95% confidence interval: -3.7 to 0.9). Percent time <80 mg dl(-1) decreased in both groups, from 18.9 to 12.5 and 20.3 to 18.6, for the SmartGuard and non-SmartGuard groups, respectively (between-group difference -2.4, 95% confidence interval: -5.4 to 0.78). A nonsignificant trend was observed towards reduced hypoglycaemia in the SmartGuard group among patients using multiple daily injections (MDI) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) regimens. Mean glucose levels and daily insulin dosage were similar between the two pump groups.


CONCLUSIONS
The results indicate that SmartGuard can reduce the overall degree of hypoglycaemia in patients with T1D, particularly among patients using hypoglycaemia-prone regimens of MDI or CSII.

Recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) is common in patients attending the dental surgeon and this survey shows that it is the commonest of the recurrent oral ulcers. Most of the patients with recurrent ulcer and 5 per cent with single deep ulcers, who attended the University of Malaya Dental Clinic in July and August 1985, were subjected to a structured interview, and oral plaque examination and gingival bleeding index by one investigator. The samples were also examined with appropriate stains, and their antibody titres to herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV1), 2 (HSV2) and 6 (VZV), cytomegalovirus, and candida albicans were studied. Histopathological examination was done on the biopsies of 38 per cent of the patients. None of the patients were positive for periodontal disease. The commonest type of presentation was as single recurrent ulcer, and 17 per cent of the patients had more than one type of ulcer. The HSV antibody levels did not correlate with histology. The incidence of positive cultures of Candida spp. was about 4 per cent. The possible etiopathogenesis, including the role of viruses and candida infection was discussed. <EOD> Characterization of the Capsid of the Pseudorabies"

Input Text: Efficacy and Safety of Empagliflozin vs Finerenone Combination Therapy in Diabetic and Hypertensive Patients With Albuminuria >300 mg/24

Detailed Description
-----------------
Rationale: Empagliflozin is an oral antidiabetes medication that acts as a sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, which reduces the reabsorption of glucose in the proximal tubule. Finerenone, on the other hand, is a nonsteroidal, selective, and potent mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. In this clinical trial, we want to investigate how an anti-diabetic medication, such as empagliflozin, which can be used in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

The effect of amiodarone on the metabolism of mitochondria was investigated in isolated liver mitochondria after a short-term administration in the rat. The results obtained indicate that amiodarone inhibits glucose oxidation, whereas no inhibition of pyruvate or succinate oxidation was observed. The activity of cytochrome oxidase was found to be lower. Amiodarone depressed the content of glutathione, although the activities of glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase was enhanced. Amiodarone increased in its activity of adenosine triphosphatase. <EOD> Efficient Hydrogen Storage by an Intercalation/Deintercalation Mechanism at an Interlayer Surface of a Layered-Layered-Multilayered Perovskite: (MnMoO4)2MoO2.
Although many high-capacity hydrogen storage materials have been reported, most of them follow the physisorption mechanism, in which a large volumetric capacity is sacrificed to facilitate fast kinetics. Here we have synthesized and investigated a two-layered oxide (MnMoO4)2MoO2 via solvothermal reaction with low-cost materials. (MnMoO4)2MoO2 possesses interlayer MoO2 sheets sandwiched by (MnMoO4)2 layers, where the hydrogen-binding sites are all at the interlayer surface. Density functional theory calculations reveal that hydrogen can be intercalated into the interlayer MoO2 sheets under relatively low pressure (≤20 bar) and then released under a pressure ≤23 bar. The interlayer MoO2 sheets also can act as a depot to store ∼2.5 wt % metallic molybdenum, which can be released through intercalated hydrogen. These outstanding performance of (MnMoO4)2MoO2 are ascribed to effective electronic transfer between interlayers and the abundant hydrogen-binding configurations within interlayer MoO2. We further propose that by substituting the Mo with other elements (e.g., Fe, W, V, and U), it is possible to synthesize 2D layered-layered-multilayered perovskite frameworks hosting many hydrogen atoms in their interlayer spaces (H/MoO2 ≈1.3) at low temperature. This work sheds fresh light on the hydrogen storage behaviors of transition metal oxides and may benefit their practical applications. <EOD> Diagnosis and Management of Hidradenitis Suppurativa–An Indonesian Experience

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
====================
1. SYNOPSIS OF THE STUDY Sponsor / Sponsor-Investigator Sponsor: Prof. Kerstin von Plessen Sponsor-Investigator: Prof. Daniel S. Schechter Investigator: Mrs. Sandra Rusconi Serpa, MSc, FSP Study Title Feasibility of a brief manualized psychotherapy for traumatized mothers and their young children: Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) Short Title / Study ID CAVEAT Feasibility Study Protocol Version and Date Version 1.0, DATE Study registration Registered on international register (clinicaltrial.gov) provisionally Study category and Rationale This feasibility study conforms to a clinical trial of category A Background and Rationale The present study aims to determine if the manualized brief psychotherapy Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure-Approach Therapy (CAVEAT) can be administered to violence-exposed mothers and their young children (ages 1-5 years) in the ambulatory care center of a Swiss public hospital (SUPEA, CHUV) during a psychotherapy of 16 sessions. CAVEAT is based on an amalgam of four existing evidence-based psychotherapy models (Child-Parent psychotherapy, Parental Mentalization, Interaction Guidance, Prolonged Exposure) for parents, infants and young children and traumatized adults that led to the novel, core therapeutic technique developed by Prof. Schechter and colleagues Clinician Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Session(s) or CAVES which has been shown to be successful in positively altering mothers' perception of their young children in two open trials. From the existing literature, the investigators know that parent-child relationship-based psychotherapies improve significantly maternal sensitivity to their child's communication, which is in part based on maternal capacity to perceive more accurately the young child's emotional communication and to take the child's perspective. Moreover, dyadic psychotherapy models using video-feedback and support of parental mentalization have been shown across models more generally to improve the quality of mother-child interaction. Risk / Benefit Assessment The risks of participating in this study are estimated as minimal (category A). The proposed intervention involves standard, validated psychotherapeutic procedures with the addition of clinician-assisted videofeedback exposure to naturalistic challenges that are typically stressful for young children and that are in situation by the clinician in collaboration with the child's mother during the filmed parent-child interaction sessions. This latter technique has been used without complication in both mental health referred and non-referred pediatrics samples with positive clinical effects in both studies. The investigators estimate that the risks of such an intervention are therefore limited. Though, if a matter arises that is severe, urgent or cannot be dealt with in the psychotherapy as conceived in the model, proper interventions and/or referrals will be made. Regarding the potential benefits An increase in maternal ability to take her very young child's perspective To respond more sensitively to the child's developmental needs and emotional communication, To be aware of what triggers posttraumatic stress during parent-child interactions, Reduction in re-experiencing, avoidance, negative cognitions, and hyperarousal in day-to-day life with one's child ages 1-5 years and/or problems with their parenting, and/or problems with the parentchild relationship. Acquisition of increased tools for self and mutual regulation and stressreduction during and between parent-child interactions. For mothers with a young toddler aged 12 months or younger, the study will also help assess how early the trauma-exposed mother's ability to respond sensitively to the child's communication can be improved and therefore early intervention might be introduced for this patient group, thereby helping the child in the long run and preventing future developmental problems."

SCS produced a sensory block comparable to systemic analgesia but allowed greater pain tolerance without a reduction in mean arterial pressure. <EOD> The effect of short-term β-adrenergic blockade on muscle perfusion and oxygen utilisation in men.
OBJECTIVE
To investigate changes in muscle blood flow during treadmill exercise after 1 h of infusion of a short-acting, nonselective β-adrenergic blocker (bupranolol) into healthy subjects.


DESIGN AND PATIENTS
Seven male subjects with normal electrocardiograms were randomized to receive bupranolol 0.5 mg kg(-1) i.v. in one exercise trial and to receive a placebo in the other. All subjects performed two exercise tests on an electrically braked cycle ergometer with the same workload (50 W 76.6 +/- 2.5 years, and 156 +/- 3.6 W in the placebo trial and by 15.8 +/- 1.4 years and by 99 +/- 11.1 W in the bupranolol trial.


MEASUREMENTS
Thigh blood flow and muscle oxygen saturation were measured with a dual light-emitting diode spectrophotometric system. Arterial and mixed venous samples were withdrawn and analysed to determine oxygen uptake.


RESULTS
Thigh blood flow, muscle oxygen saturation and VO(2)-peak) significantly decreased after bupranolol (130.9 +/- 2.6 vs 186.9 +/- 13.4 mL min(-1) 100.0 +/- 0.5 vs 149.0 +/- 5.5 mL min(-1); P = 0.001) were significantly suppressed, whereas treadmill endurance times were significantly improved. Exercise VO(2-peak) was significantly changed.


CONCLUSION
β-Blocker administration reduces muscle blood flow, but does not modify muscle oxygen uptake during intense exercise. This drug could be used to improve treadmill endurance time in chronic heart failure patients. <EOD> .

Intra-arterial chemotherapy with melphalan followed by radioplaque brachytherapy in choroidal melanoma - A phase I clinical trial

Background: [/INSERTION]
--------------
Choroidal melanoma is one of the most common types of primary intraocular malignant neoplasms, with 5-yr survival rate inferior to 70%. Treatment is usually initiated with brachytherapy. Although the brachytherapy results in a higher cure rate and the lower occurrence of metastasis, the tumor can develop radioprotective strategies to hinder the radiation-related cell damage, therefore, new methods are needed to improve treatment options for choroidal melanomas.

Purpose: [/INSERTION]
---------------
The aim is to investigate the safety profile of selective intra-arterial intra-arterial chemotherapy with melphalan (7.5mg) plus subsequent ruthenium brachytherapy, for choroidal melanomas with a thickness equal to or higher than 8 mm and to assess to efficacy in tumor reduction and globe salvage.

Methods: [/INSERTION]
------------------
This is an ongoing trial that evaluated the safety profile of intra-arterial chemotherapy with melphalan followed by ruthenium brachytherapy, to be performed in the Department of Radiation Oncology of Hospital Vale do Rio Doce, in Brazil. Three subjects will be included to evaluate the safety of the treatment, at a single dose of 7.5mg of melphalan in the ophthalmic artery. They will be assessed through the ophthalmic and clinical examination, systemic and blood tests and the assessment of electroretinograms at multiple timepoints: Baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months after the intervention.

    <en>Trauma is a leading cause of global mortality or incapacitation in survivors. The population involved is mainly young adult men affected by preventable injuries. Knowing the incidence of injuries, mechanisms of wounds, approaching strategies, and outcomes is essential to review individual interventions and collective policies to improve prevention. Casualties in Colombia had a high incidence in previous decades; injuries and attributable deaths have recently decreased, but they are still the third cause of mortality. Contrary to high-income countries, interpersonal violence is the predominant mechanism involved. Data registries are used worldwide in specialized centers that focus on providing healthcare in trauma. Nevertheless, it is necessary also to know the incidence in community and non-dedicated general hospitals. Determining the characteristics of patients admitted to the emergency ward by injuries will provide essential information on the severity, mechanisms, type of population affected, immediate or consequential care delivered, and outcomes. Such an analysis will give knowledge to prioritize policies, resources, upgrade clinical practice guidelines, and improve results.</en>

      Trauma es la causa más comun de mortalidad o incapacidad en supervivientes. La población afectada es principalmente joven, hombres, atendidos por causas evitables. Conocer la incidencia, los circuitos traumatológicos, las estrategias posibles y los resultados es esencial para determinar las intervenciones individuales y las políticas colectivas orientadas al mejoramiento de la prevención. La mortalidad por trauma en Colombia ha tenido un claro decremento entre las últimas décadas. La población afectada la mayoría es masculina, joven y, como en la mayoría de centros terciarios del mundo, se presenta por acciones violentas. En Colombia se han implementado registros de morbilidad por trauma de gran relevancia. No así en hospitales no especializados o de comunidad, y por lo tanto, las información disponibles son cada vez más escasas o fragmentadas. El conocimiento de algunas variables como ser la incidencia del trauma en los diferentes grupos afectados, el tipo de lesión o cirugía reparadora y el pronóstico y evolución en el cuidado de acuerdo con el escenario de atención, es de vital importancia para conocer la necesidad de políticas, recursos, de mejorar las guías de actuación clínica, y de mejores resultados general del manejo de esta situación.</es>

The sample from the AIDS group was taken from AIDS patients registered in Health Assistance Unit from two reference hospitals in Sāo Paulo during the period of 2001 and 2004 in order to conduct the study. The second sample for comparison group was taken from the Health Examination Center of Faculty of Medical Sciences of University of Sāo Paulo during 2004. The following anthropometric and hormonal aspects were measured: body mass index (BMI), waist to hip index (WHI), waist to height index (WHI), arm muscle area (AMA), body fat (BCF). Data were collected in a cross-sectional study. Data for comparison groups were collected by similar method for AIDS groups. A logistic regression was used to verify the relationship between AIDS and anthropometric and hormonal characteristics adjusted for age, physical activity, and smoking habit. Men with AIDS presented a similar total body mass (57 kg) when compared to the men without AIDS (59 kg), but they had a 16.6% increase in fat mass and about a 20.67% increase in WHI. A strong tendency of decreasing lean mass among men with AIDS was detected (AMA = 26.4 cm2). In conclusion fat mass increase and WHI increase among men with AIDS had showed a clear relation with this disease. <EOD> The Effect of Combined Pulse Fortification and Biodiesel on the Rheological and Structural Properties of a Biomass-Derived Asphalt Matrix

The UDS test involves the following steps:

Before the Test
Urodynamic Studies have 3 steps, and the order of these steps is dependent on a specific condition:
1. Urinating into a collection cup (clean pad or toilet)
2. Urodynamic study which includes:
	* Inserting a catheter into the bladder and connecting it to tubes
	* Recording 5-7 minutes of data
	* Using Urodynamic study software and reviewing the data
3. Removing the catheter

After the Test
Urodynamics and its technology is always in the process of development. This is why the steps may be changed in the future, by adaptating to a new technology that changes the number of steps.

Urodynamics steps

## Before the Test
1. Preparing for the test
	* Getting rid of any liquid using our urinalization device and putting a clean pad on the catheter
	* Getting ready by being dressed and sitting down
2. Starting the UDS test
   * The nurse will insert an urethral catheter in your bladder to collect the data
	* Then, the nurse will connect the tubing to the catheter and put the catheter inside a protective covering
	* Finally we can start the UDS test.
	* We will keep you in a waiting room for the duration of the test.
	* Once the recording is done, we will remove the catheter from your bladder.

## After the Test
1. Preparing the collected data
   * The nurse will connect the tubing to the catheter in order to collect the data
	* We will give the collected data to the Urologist
	* The Urologist will review our data
	* You can go home.
2. Removing the urethral catheter
     * The urethral catheter will be removed after the completion of the test

3. Test results
	* Your results will be analyzed by urologists and will be returned later

## Preparing for the test
Getting rid of any liquid
To avoid possible complicications, it is recommended to remove the liquids from your bladder by urinating into a clean pad or in a toilet and then wearing it for approximately 30 minutes, or until the urine is completely dry.
Sitting comfortably
We recommend to sit and get dressed before the test. You can be dressed in whatever comfortable clothing that you want. You do not need to wear special clothes.
Before the UDS test
Once we are ready, you will be guided towards a room where the test will be performed. Please be informed that your family can stay with you throughout the test.
A nurse will be with you throughout the test.
Before the recording
Before the test is done, we will have to measure your intravenous blood pressure. In order to do so, we will put an IV catheter in the forearm, through the vein and insert a cannula. This cannula will be connected to the IV and a syringe will be used to draw your blood, so we can check the blood pressure in the test. We will put disinfection gel on your forearm to ensure cleanliness.
Starting the UDS test
You will be provided with an option of watching the test. If you would prefer to do so, we will arrange a place for you so you can sit and watch. We encourage you to relax as much as possible and be very comfortable. The test consists of many steps, which take approximately 5 to 7 minutes to complete. The nurse will inform you when to relax. To ensure your comfort, the catheter insertion will be performed with minimum touching.
We will keep a paper that shows the time of the test. We will keep the patient in a waiting room and will let him or her know when the test has taken place. We will remove the catheter when the test is over. It typically takes approximately 5-7 minutes, and once the test is done a nurse will inform you.
After the test
After the test, we will put disinfection gel on your forearm to ensure cleanliness. We will insert the catheter in the forearm and remove the IV cannula. All used disinfectant gel will be collected with a tissue and in a waste bag. We will give you an information letter indicating the date of the test and a summary of the test results. Urologists will review the results and return them to you shortly"

Study Overall Summary
=================


This study aims to investigate the relationships between ACEs, the quality of life of women with breast cancer in remission, and biological variations in order to identify vulnerability/resilience profiles and facilitate tailored interventions to at-risk patients.




### Rationale

Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide. Cancer recurrence and secondary treatments are distressing to patients. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are early traumatic experiences related to maltreatment and neglect. They have been associated with high stress responses and increased risk of mental and physical morbidity, including cancer, in adulthood. Although ACEs are predictors of a wide variety of diseases and adverse health outcomes among adult cancer survivors, 
their significance in breast cancer is unclear. Furthermore, there is currently no biological and psychosocial profile of ACEs identified among women with breast cancer.

### Aims

1. To identify biological and psychosocial differences in breast cancer patients with and without ACEs, and 2. To study the effect on quality of life of psychological variables such as attachment and resilience.




### Participants

The participants include 40 women with breast cancer, 18 to 65 years of age, in remission and with a DINS score and ≥12, and currently on hormone therapy; the other inclusion criteria are detailed in the study description.

### Procedure

The study consists of three sessions:
- An initial individual research interview to collect relevant sociodemographic information, assess quality of life and mood (to screen depression), and complete the ACE Questionnaire. 
- Clinical data analysis, including oncological profiles, quality of life, and chronic stress assessments.
- A second session with a biological examination at the Centre for Functional Genomics at the Centre Hospitalier Universitaire Vaudois (CHUV) to collect biological data.
- A third interview to analyze the quality of life of the participants, and the quality of life and the epigenetic impacts linked to the ACEs. At the end of the study, a fourth session will be scheduled to check the participants’ quality of life and the chronic stress of the participants.

### Measures

- The ACE Questionnaire consists of 13 questions that address important life experiences regarding the environment to which participants were exposed during their childhood. The study is based on the French version of the questionnaire.
- The ACEs, Attachment Style and Quality of Life Questionnaire (ACE-ASQ) is a questionnaire based on the ACEs, attachment issues and mental health of children in Quebec. This questionnaire will be used to obtain biological and psychological data.
- The International Personality Disorder Examination Questionnaire (IPDE-58) is a screening tool for detecting the presence or absence of ACEs in the adult population.

### Ethics

No blood samples or other invasive investigations will be taken as part of this study. Moreover, given the observational nature of the study, no treatments will be applied.

### Funding

This study was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF 185860) and the Swiss Cancer League (KL 3778-08-2019).

Input Text: Low-Glycemic (LGI) Diet in Pregnant People With Epilepsy

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description


Pregnant people with epilepsy have concerns about their pregnancy and the potential ramifications of antiseizure medication usage, and there is currently no optimal diet for those with epilepsy (Tomson et al., 2018; Meador et al., 2021). There is evidence that low glycemic index diets are beneficial for seizure frequency in the non-pregnant population, but currently no evidence of benefit in pregnant women with epilepsy. Furthermore, little is known about dietary mechanisms and the impact of diet, both during pregnancy and post-partum, on gut microbiota and associated metabolites (Olson et al., 2018). This study aims to study the impact of the low glycemic index diet on seizure frequency, gut microbiota, and metabolites during pregnancy.

UNLABELLED
In spite of considerable progress in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) over the last two decades, results in children in remission from ALL continue to be dismal since leukemic cells are resistant to conventional chemotherapy. In 2 recent studies, autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) after salvage chemotherapy for relapse in childhood ALL has been shown to result in complete remissions (CR) in more than 70% of children. The 2 prospective trials analyzed also demonstrated that children who were in first or second remission could be effectively cured with autografting alone (24% and 62% 2-year event-free survival , respectively). In a retrospective study by Rizzari on 110 children with ALL in second bone marrow remission from 1995 to 2001, autografting with peripheral blood stem cells was shown to be comparable to transplantation with bone marrow stem cells, without major toxicity. These data support the feasibility and activity of ASCT in children with ALL who have failed multiple courses of intensive chemotherapy.


CONCLUSIONS
ASCT would appear to be an attractive alternative to conventional chemotherapy in children with residual, recurrent, or progressive disease. The role of this consolidation procedure in the future standard of care approach needs to be established in the next 2 or 3 years. <EOD> Effects of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Salinity on the Growth of the Heterotrophic Dinoflagellate Amphidinium klebsii: An Optical Study Using Flow Sorting and Optical Coherence Tomography.

 <EOD> Efficacy of Piroxicam in Combination with Tetracycline and Amoxicillin on Pulpitis



# Background
Dental caries is a common disease and the most common oral diseases in primary teeth. It is one of the public health problems that need to be considered in each country. Toothache is one of the most common signs of pulpitis, while dental pulp is the core of tooth tissue that supports its physiological activities. Toothache can cause severe pain, and the main therapy for it is tooth extraction in many countries; however, extracting a tooth is a very complicated procedure that can cause adverse consequences, thus many researchers have been interested in searching for proper remedies that can treat different stages of pulpitis.
Inflammatory diseases are some of the major factors contributing to tooth extraction. A study indicated that some diseases such as dental pulpitis, dental cysts, and irreversible pulpitis can cause inflammation in the oral mucosa. Pulpitis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can be caused by deep bite, caries, and trauma, and may lead to tooth pain ranging from mild to severe. Some signs and symptoms of active pulpitis include spontaneous, continuous, and sudden toothache that is induced by cold, hot, and sweet foods.
Pain is one of the symptoms of pulpitis that is mainly caused by inflammatory mediators such as interleukin and prostaglandins, thereby causing an increase in pulp tissue vascularity. An increase in vascularity may cause the migration of leukocytes and lymphocytes, and increase in vascular permeability that can be assessed through an increase in vasodilator peptides levels in vascular endothelial cells, and an increase in plasma protein leakage in pulp tissue. If the pulpitis is not treated, there is a probability that the condition will be transformed into periapical inflammation, then pulp necrosis, which causes toothache in an acute and severe manner that requires urgent treatment.
Toothache, as a complication of pulpitis, is considered as one of the main complications that can cause tooth extraction. Therefore, it is necessary to study treatments that can control and treat root pulp inflammation, and also reduce toothache. Treatment of pulp inflammation is performed by either using drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and antibiotics or performing root amputation. A study showed that root amputation does not always lead to less pain and severe inflammation, and using drugs together with tooth extraction can even be more effective. Piroxicam is an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits cyclooxygenase enzyme, and therefore it is an effective drug to treat nerve pain and acute inflammation. Another study concluded that piroxicam can treat chronic and acute painsand inhibiting intercellular adhesion. Amoxicillin is an antibiotic with good effects for inflammatory and tissue destruction, and it also reduces tooth pain, causes inflammation disinfection, and decreases the number of oral bacteria. Tetracycline is one of the broad spectrum antibiotics used to treat systemic infections, which can reduce abscesses and cause inflammation disinfection and a reduction in the number of oral bacteria.
A study claimed that anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics alone or in combination therapy can help reduce the pain caused by pulpitis more efficiently, and they can also prevent acute and chronic inflammation and improve the healing process which leads to pulp recovery and reduces inflammatory cytokines, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor(G-CSF), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).
A study carried out in India showed that the combination of drugs can lead to better pain control and tooth recovery in cases of pulpitis, and also can treat inflammation that has"

The effects of early weaning on the ovarian function of immature female rats were investigated. When 21-day old female rats were weaned 3 weeks after birth they did not show estrus within 3 weeks, and there were no corpora lutea in the ovaries after 2 weeks of early weaning, whereas they did within 3 weeks after weaning of 7 days of age. Estrus did occur after ovariectomy, removal of the uterine cervix or both, and ovaries removed from 21-day old weaned rats still showed no response to hormonal replacement therapy, whereas both pituitary and ovary from rats weaned 7 days after birth responded to the therapy. The weaned rats showed a low blood progesterone level. Injection of estradiol benzoate (1 microng/rat body weight) to these rats resulted in a decline in blood progesterone below the sensitivity level of the RIA, suggesting that these rats are resistant to estrogen positive feedback. The weaned rats did not show the increase in body weight in the early phase. These results suggested that the maturation process of the ovaries of rats weaned 21 days after birth was delayed in the hormonal and morphological aspects. <EOD> Incorporation of Dendrimer into Thin Film of Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) to Improve Anti-Fogging Properties



# Introduction
In recent decades, it has become apparent that the environment is facing a global energy crisis as a result of the rapid growth of the global population. Therefore, new development and improvement processes are being created to reduce energy use and increase the economy. Various studies are ongoing to improve existing technologies rather than focusing solely on the use of renewable energy. Conventional glass used in windows, doors, and mirrors is easily damaged in high-humidity and hot weather conditions and, consequently, has a short life span.
Such factors, which are unavoidable in real life, should be considered when designing various devices in order to minimize inconvenience in daily life. To this end, a hydrophobic material is being widely used to prevent condensation inside rooms or automobiles. Among hydrophobic materials, some papers   Effect of Polyimide (PI) Coated Plastic Films Containing Nanoparticles on Properties of..., Kim     Superhydrophobic Surface with Nanocomposite Coating and Its Application in Anti-Fogging Window, Jumaludin   have investigated the usefulness of hydrophobic coating materials.

The decrease in blood pressure occurred when both the arteriovenous pressure gradient and the venous capacity of the limb were decreased. <EOD> In vivo effect of TGF-beta 1 on beta-catenin/T cell factor-and Wnt-mediated transcriptional signaling for the regulation of intestinal epithelial cell phenotype.
BACKGROUND & AIMS
The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) family of growth factors has pleiotropic activities including modulation of cellular phenotype, and this regulatory function is critically dependent on its ability to modulate TGF-β/beta-catenin/T cell factor (TCF)-mediated transcription. This is a tightly controlled process, and the question arises whether TGF-β is able to modulate Wnt signaling that involves beta-catenin/TCF-dependent transcription. We conducted studies to establish the effect of TGF-β on the expression of Wnt receptors and effectors and how these might affect gene transcription and phenotype.


METHODS
Small intestine primary epithelial cultures were established from wild-type and Axin (a Wnt signaling pathway component) deficient mice and treated with TGF-beta 1 (15 h). Expression of target genes was examined, and functional studies were conducted. The effect of TGF-beta 1 on Wnt-mediated gene transcription was examined using transient transfections and electrophoretic mobility shift assays. These were followed by examinations of the effect of overexpression of Axin and Axin-L1402P in TGF-beta 1- treated cells.


RESULTS
We have revealed that TGF-beta 1 selectively modulated expression of both the Wnt and beta-catenin mediators. TGF-beta induced up-regulation of components of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway (i.e., frizzled 2 and disheveled), whereas expression of components of the wnt inhibitory Wnt/DKK-1/beta-catenin pathway (i.e., Wnt5a, Dkk1, and Wif1) and beta-catenin/TCF target genes were down-regulated. Concomitant with the inhibition of Wnt-mediated transcriptional signaling, was down-regulation of epithelial phenotype genes (i.e., villin and claudin-4). We found that Wnt signaling inhibition occurred in large part by selective modulation of Axin components. In studies with Axin-deficient cells, we made novel observations related to intestinal epithelial phenotype (i.e., villin and villus height), Wnt transcriptional signaling, and TGF-beta-induced gene expression.


CONCLUSIONS
The role for TGF-beta in control of intestinal epithelial phenotype and transcriptional signaling is regulated in part through modulation of functional Axin components. <EOD> .

Introduction:

Auricular Acupressure therapy is an important technique of Chinese Acupuncture, in which acupuncturist stimulates auricular acupoints with various devices.

Auricular acupressure, a kind of manipulation which stimulates or supports the internal organs, in China it has been used to cure headache, gastrointestinal disease, respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, urinary disease, metabolic disease, and other diseases and to regulate physiological activities like circulation, digestion, secretion, etc.; even it can regulate neuroendocrine and immune functions.

The auricular acupressure with auricular seed is a method which stimulates the auricular acupuncture points with auricular seed and acupoints.

Practice results have demonstrated a positive effect of warm auricular acupressure on blood circulation of peripheral blood.

Recent studies have also demonstrated auricular acupressure with auricular seed promoted blood circulation and heat production of the ear’s skin; these effects were similar with the effects of auricular acupuncture with moxibustion, even the effects were more efficient and faster than that of acupuncture with moxibustion.

The purpose of this paper is to report results of auricular acupressure with auricular seed at Baihui (GV20) area, to enhance blood circulation and heat production of the ear’s skin.

Auricular points of the external ear are rich in autonomic nerves and have more nerve branches than anywhere else in the body; these auricular acupoints and their surroundings share the same blood and lymphatic vessels as the internal organs. Their functions can be reflected in the inner organs and even throughout the whole body. Some studies have shown auricular acupressure and cupping at auricular acupuncture points may exert a therapeutic effect on the related diseases via the nerve reflex system.

Some auricular acupoints at the surface of the external ear such as Baihui (GV20) area can affect the respiratory and circulatory organs and also can regulate immune function; these acupoints are located on the surface close to the scalp; they are commonly used to cure many complicated diseases. Auricular acupressure with auricular seed is a technique of acupoint pressing of auricular acupuncture points, which stimulates auricular points with auricular seed combined with acupoints. Since acupoints that are closer and share blood vessels tend to be affected in the same way, the treatment with auricular seed plus auricular acupoint press has higher efficiency than the treatment with auricular seed alone for many diseases. The treatment with auricular acupressure with auricular seed and the therapy of acupuncture with moxibustion both can exert a therapeutic effect on many diseases.

Many researchers believe auricular acupressure with auricular seed can enhance the function that may not be affected by the traditional way; it has a similar efficiency with acupuncture with moxibustion, a more efficient effect than acupuncture with moxibustion. In clinical practice, when using auricular acupoint pressing, one has to choose the auricular point appropriately, place it correctly, press it forcefully and continuously for a long time. In the treatment of auricular acupressure with auricular seed, the seed is also a medicinal agent with a curative effect on diseases such as rheumatics; the therapeutic effect of auricular seed is superior to that of non-medicinal seed.

AimsTo examine the impact of lifetime and recent (last 4 years) anorexia nervosa on secondary school-attendance and school performance.MethodThe 25-year follow-up of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study cohort, a prospective longitudinal study of predominantly Caucasian subjects recruited at the age of 16-19 years in 1968. School attendance and school marks were collected at the age of 18-19 years and 22-23 years, respectively. Lifetime diagnosis of anorexia nervosa was determined by a self-administered assessment questionnaire completed by subjects at age 42-50 years. School marks were compared between subjects with and without anorexia nervosa lifetime diagnosis and in those with and without recurrent eating disorders. The effect of recurrent eating disorders on school attendance was also examined. Logistic regression was used to analyse the effects of lifetime diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, early menarche, maternal education level and country of birth on school marks at age 22-23 years.ResultsAnorexia nervosa was strongly associated with lower school attendance and performance. The rate of school absence due to illness, hospitalization and treatment was significantly higher in subjects with anorexia nervosa lifetime diagnosis and in those with eating disorders compared with those without. Poor school marks in subjects with anorexia nervosa lifetime diagnosis were significantly and independently associated with recurrent eating disorders, a delay in menarche, being born in a non-dominant country of birth and having a mother with low education.ConclusionsWe conclude that the negative impact of lifetime and recent (last 4 years) anorexia nervosa on school attendance and school marks is substantial. It is more profound in subjects with multiple episodes over time.

Dear editor, The clinical diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris (PV) is relatively easy, due to its characteristic skin lesions. Oral and ocular lesions are highly specific due to their atypical histology and typical clinical lesions, with a positive Nikolsky's sign. Histology is considered the gold standard in diagnosis. However, a reliable and cost-effective alternative method would be desirable in some patients. Although dermoscopy can be a useful tool for diagnosing various skin diseases, no dermoscopic findings have been reported in PV. Thus, the aim of this study was to describe the dermoscopic findings of PV. Thirty patients (21 females and 9 males) with a clinical diagnosis of PV were included. Their ages ranged from 21 to 83 years (median 58 years), and 16 had previous oral mucosa lesions. The lesions were classified as follows: two as erosive nonbullous, 16 as erosive bullous and 12 as plaque lesions. Dermoscopy (Dermlite DL3N dermoscope) was performed on a white background, and images were analyzed using ImageJ. The following dermoscopic items were quantified for each lesion: presence of the following, with and without a corresponding morphology. Dermoscopic examination showed that presence of the dermoscopic findings was different in the three types of lesions (Figs 1A, B and C), and each variable was associated with lesion type. In the 72 lesions studied, the most frequent dermoscopic findings were: polymorphic scales (n = 40; 55.5%); whitish areas (n = 31; 42.8%); erosion (n = 22; 30.5%); yellowish areas (n = 18; 25.0%), and arborizing vessels (n = 15; 20.8%). In this retrospective study of 72 cases of PV, the main dermoscopic findings of oral PV were scaly, whitish areas and erosion; a reticulate pattern was infrequent. These findings differ from those described in other types of ulceration, such as oral lichen planus (OLP): yellowish areas, reticular and/or homogeneous white lines, a yellowish halo (in 56%), and a reticular appearance (in 14.7%). Dermoscopy has been described as an auxiliary tool in the differential diagnosis between OLP and PV, especially in atypical mucosal PV. In OLP, the presence of homogeneous white lines (a reticular appearance) was associated with malignant transformation, atypical lymphoid cells and the disappearance of the yellowish halo with regression. In patients with previous lesions, the identification of polymorphic scales, reticular patterns, yellow tonic (cobblestone) structures and whitish areas and/or erosions (with or without yellowish stipulations) were associated with clinically classic PV. Oral lesions that do not show the above-mentioned clinical and dermoscopy findings should be re-evaluated after some period of observation (e.g., 3 months), since some of the lesions could be of the autoimmune type (in contrast with infectious in the initial stage) or a reactive process, i.e., a cicatricial pemphigoid (which is also a rare mucosal pathology). This study had some limitations: a small number of lesions and sample size, without a control group of OLP, and the retrospective nature of the study. However, this technique could be a reliable and noninvas"

PURPOSE
To assess the feasibility, toxicity, and response rate resulting from concurrent docetaxel, carboplatin, and external-beam radiation in patients with locally advanced or metastatic human papillomavirus (HPV)-related oral cavity squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).


PATIENTS AND METHODS
Fourteen patients were treated with weekly neoadjuvant docetaxel at 35 mg/m2, weekly carboplatin at an area under the concentration-time curve of between 2 and 2.5 mg/mL/min, and weekly concurrent radiation at 30 Gy (Phase I/II trial). In Phase I, docetaxel was given once weekly for 4 to 6 cycles, depending on toxicity. In Phase II, docetaxel was given weekly for 6 cycles.


RESULTS
Treatment was well tolerated. Common neurologic toxicities were headache (57%) and neuropathy (50%). All patients completed external-beam radiation without delay. The cumulative dose of chemotherapy and radiation was 90 to 450 mg/m2 of docetaxel, 36 to 98 mg/m2 of carboplatin, and 169 to 410 mg/m2 of 5-fluorouracil, and 60 to 75 Gy. There were five (36%) confirmed complete responses. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the objective response rate was 29%.


CONCLUSION
We have successfully completed Phase II toxicity and response analyses for this protocol in a small single-institution cohort of patients who are poor candidates for surgery. This combination chemotherapy regimen was well tolerated and produced durable complete responses in approximately 40% of patients. <EOD> Pregnancy‐associated breast cancer patient experience and perception of information received regarding adjuvant treatment options

Background:The functions of GPCR subtypes can be modulated by heteromerization. Results: The sensitivity to natural ligands and inhibition by antagonists were altered by heteromerization of S1P 1 with S1P 2 or S1P 3 . Conclusion: Heteromerization of GPCR subtypes can change the characteristics of in vivo physiology. Significance: Modulation of the heteromerized GPCRs may be an effective anti-inflammatory strategy.
Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is produced by the mammalian sphingosine kinase with an elevation in inflammatory diseases and has multiple functions by stimulating five different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Among the five S1P receptors (S1P 1-5 ), the S1P 1 and S1P 3 are the best-characterized subtypes in vivo for the functions in the immune system. However, the sensitivity to S1P and the pharmacological profiles of these two subtypes vary considerably among the GPCRs. Here, we report that the responses to S1P were modified when the functionally divergent S1P 3 subtype was co-expressed with S1P 1 , thus forming a heteromeric receptor complex. This change in the ligand sensitivity occurred not only in the case of S1P but also with diverse analogs. This S1P 3 -S1P 1 heteromeric receptor complex was found to be a stable ternary complex, which was not formed by S1P 1 homodimerization with S1P 3 or S1P 2 in addition to the previously documented heterodimerization with S1P 2 . Moreover, the S1P 3 -S1P 1 complex displayed similar pharmacological profiles with"

Detailed Description
---------------------
This study investigates the effect of an online money management program on improving financial self-efficacy in the adult population with SMI. Financial self-efficacy is one of the important positive assets in promoting financial well-being of an individual. It is defined as one's self-perceived ability to manage financial matters. SMI are characterized by persistent deficits in behavioral control which have important negative consequence on individual financial decision-making and management. Studies showed that 70% of adults with SMI are having problems with their finances. They are highly financially vulnerable because of their unstable jobs, poor employment outcomes, and challenges in daily functioning, such as self-care and day-to-day activities like preparing meals. Financial problem increases their risk of relapse of the mental health problems and have negative consequence on their financial well-being. Financial wellness promoting programs have become an increasingly important intervention in the mental healthcare plan for people with SMI because of its close link to mental, physical, and social well-being. The primary aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that Money management program will lead to significant improvement in financial self-efficacy compared with the wait-list control group. Secondary aims will assess the hypothesis that Money management program leads to significant improvements in financial behaviour, financial attitude, psychological well-being and quality of life compared with the wait-list control group. As an exploratory aim, the study will explore whether psychological variables such as psychological well-being and quality of life are mediators between money management program and financial self-efficacy, financial behaviour, financial attitude, and the financial well-being. It has been shown in other research that psychological variables partially mediate financial self-efficacy and financial behavior. According to Theory Change Model (TCM), psychological well-being and quality of life are important predictive variables of improved financial behavior.

Background
============
[/WORD]

Mental illness is one of the public health problems which cause significant social dysfunction and financial instability. Financial issues are increasingly recognized as important contributors to the reduced health and the quality of life of people with SMI. SMI is one of the most common mental health problems for which a person may be hospitalized. SMI is an important group of conditions which includes schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, persistent delusional disorders, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizotypal personality disorder, substance/medication-induced psychosis, and bipolar or manic psychosis. SMI are caused by genetic and prenatal problems. SMI is also often associated with several other conditions like medical disorders, developmental disabilities, and personality/psychological problems. The prevalence rate of mental disorder, including SMI, is consistently increasing in all countries, and SMI is a significant risk factor to financial stability and well-being. A study from the United States showed that people with mental disorders had significantly lower levels of financial well-being compared with those without mental disorders, and the gap between the level of financial well-being between the group with mental disorders and the group without mental disorders increases year by year. Another study also showed that the prevalence of moderate to severe financial problems was 31% in a general population-based study and 48% in a study using a clinical population from the United States. Research from Canada also showed that 70% of adults with SMI have financial problems, which are very closely linked to the mental health problems. These findings highlight the importance of financial well-being and its relationship to the mental, physical, and spiritual health of people with mental disorders. Financial management is a key aspect of SMI treatment and people with SMI often make poor financial decisions. Financial management involves budgeting, understanding credit, purchasing a house or a car, managing and investing income and assets, and choosing and receiving support and assistance. Studies suggested that 70% of adults with SMI have financial problems which are linked to mental health problems. The negative consequence of uncontrolled psychiatric illness, such as symptoms, poor medication adherence, comorbidity, and relapse, increase the risk of financial vulnerability"

The development of novel therapeutic agents during the last two decades and their widespread application in gastric cancer has changed the treatment results. However, although curative resection provides the only potential long-term survival the survival rate of gastric cancer patients has not changed significantly during the last three decades. Recently, a large number of clinical studies have revealed the important role of tumor markers for monitoring of patients who have gastric cancer. The most frequently used tumor markers in gastric cancer are carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and serum CA 19-9. CEA is mostly used for monitoring of the efficacy of chemotherapy in patients with advanced gastric cancer. Elevation of CA 19-9 level is also shown to be associated with increased stage, metastasis and poor prognosis in gastric cancer patients. This review will describe the most important tumor markers studied in gastric cancer and the importance of tumor markers in patient management. <EOD> .
Pelvic floor muscle relaxation is a promising treatment to prevent urinary incontinence. Nevertheless, several methodological issues should be addressed in the evaluation of the effectiveness of relaxation therapy to determine the validity of the therapy and its integration into health care programs for the prevention or treatment of continence disturbances. The evidence that pelvic floor muscle training is effective in children and young women with urinary incontinence is growing, as is the evidence that pelvic floor muscle training can be effective in adults with stress urinary incontinence, although the methodological quality of these studies was poor. Future studies should take into account the methodological factors that may have contributed to the poor methodological quality of the studies available. Other promising therapeutic methods are pelvic floor rehabilitation and the use of devices to enhance pelvic floor training are promising as well as the combination of both. <EOD> .
BACKGROUND/AIMS
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 infection is the most frequent genotype in Japan. We tried to evaluate the efficacy of interferon (INF)-alpha therapy in patients with genotype 2 infection.



METHODS
A retrospective analysis of 60 patients with chronic HCV was carried out. We analyzed the therapeutic effects of IFN-alpha therapy in genotype 2 patients without IFN-resistance.



RESULTS
The sustained response (SR) was seen in 21 of 30 patients with negative-HRas. However, SR was found in 7 of 30 patients with positive-HRas. We compared the SVR at the end of 6 and 12 months, the responses were also seen in 60 patients at the end of 6 months. The therapy was terminated in 57 patients. The sustained response was found in 28 of 57 pa r ients at the end of 12 months. Only 3 patients did not achieve a response in the end of 124 mth r epidermal blood test, which was not response, and negative HCV infective results at the study outcome results.

 <EOD> Identification of two Coxsackie B virus replicative forms
A strain of murine Coxsackie virus B3 (MuCV-3) contained in infected HeLa cells was fractionated with the use of an ethanol extraction method. A nucleic acid preparation containing four distinct components (A, B, C, and D) was separated. Three of these components (A, B, and D) could be identified as nucleocapsid RNA, DNA, and RNA, respectively, by their properties in CsCl density gradient centrifugation and by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Two of the components (B and C) did not show sedimentation coefficients characteristic of replicative intermediates in CsCl density gradient centrifugation and RNase T1 sedimentation; however, when the particles carrying components B and C were treated with RNase H, a component with sedimentation coefficient characteristic of a replicative intermediate was formed. This intermediately sedimenting component was found to contain RNA and DNA, with a content of the former much greater than that of the latter. Under CsCl density gradient condition, the sedimentation coefficient of the intermediate component depended on the RNase H concentration in the formulation employed. The sedimentation coefficient of RNase H varied with the conditions of the RNA isolation procedure. These findings are interpreted as indicating that component B (containing the RNA-DNA hybrid) is the molecule which migrates as a replicative intermediates in CsCl density gradient centrifugation and the replicative intermediate component C is a replica consisting of the RNA-DNA hybrid molecule converted to a closed circular duplex molecule. The RNase H content of MuCV-3- and VE6-infected HeLa cells was 6 to 15 times that present in uninfected cells, and MuCV-3-induced mouse leukemic cells contained about 30 times more RNase H than normal mouse lymphocytes. The findings support the view that this particle-bound RNase H is the enzyme which controls negative-strand RNA synthesis in viral replications. <EOD> In the course of several weeks, we are going to showcase a new range of the best products from the world of gin around the world.

Stroke of good fortune.

It has been observed that both strokes of good luck and strokes of bad luck occur more often than we would expect. There are a few, simple ways we may do to increase the likelihood of a stroke of good luck:

#1: Avoid Negative Thinking and Surround Yourself with a Positive Atmosphere
Our thoughts can affect our luck. If you are consistently thinking negatively about things -- no matter how little or large they may be, you may find that it is difficult for you to find the good in your life.
Surrounding yourself with a positive atmosphere and positive people is the best way to change your luck for the better. If your friends and colleagues are all focusing on something negative, try to get a different group of people. If your closest friends complain about their spouses, why would you want a love life that is full of problems too?
#2: Try Something New everyday
Even when the weather is bad, why not make a positive effort to change your day to a good one. One suggestion would be to pick up that book you meant to read. If you want to get a chance at something new, make sure you learn something new every day.
Teaching yourself new skill is a great way of spending a day. For example, if you are unable to play a musical instrument or sing well, learn to play it or sing, just to have a good day. And who knows, you might just be able to learn something new.
#3: Donate Something
This is an easier task than you think. There are many ways to donate, but the best way out of it may be to purchase something from a thrift store and sell it again, or to put the unwanted dresses in the donation box.
#4: Take Advantage of Good Luck
It's important to keep your eye on the good luck. Everyone knows that those who are positive and optimistic are able to attract more luck.
#5: Prepare a List of Things to be Grateful For
Even when your life feels bleak, it is important to remember what you want and think about what you have already achieved. It can be easy to feel like your life is going nowhere, or that you never have anything to appreciate. <EOD> The APC gene and its role in colorectal tumorigenesis
The adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene is altered in all of the familial adenomatous polyposis and sporadic colorectal tumors, and the gene is deleted in nearly all of the familial adenomatous polyposis cases and a subset of the sporadic cases. Furthermore, APC gene alterations occur in less‐differentiated tumors. In general, the genes altered in tumors are frequently those that are involved in cell proliferation, survival or differentiation. Therefore, the APC gene might act to inhibit cell proliferation, and, in the absence of a functional gene, this inhibition may be compromised. This article reviews the known functions of the gene, and discusses the hypothesis that the function of the gene is to inhibit or delay progression through the cell cycle. <EOD> HIV-1 Tat enhances the replication of cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr herpes-simplex virus in vivo. An ex vivo model.
Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Tat is a multifunctional protein. The immunosuppressive function associated with Tat is poorly understood, although Tat has been shown to induce apoptosis in lymphoid cells by several mechanism, such as the Fas-mediated signal. In contrast, Tat has been shown to protect Jurkat T lymphoid cells against cytotoxic insults. We show that in in vitro and in ex vivo settings Tat enhanced human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Epstein-Barr viruses (EBV) yields. Tat stimulated in vitro human dendritic cells for monocyte CD83 expression and induced higher virally induced apoptosis mediated mostly by Fas/FasL pathway. The enhanced apoptosis resulted in a higher yield of virally activated dendritic cells when pulsed with HCMV or EBV lysate. By using this model, HIV-1 Tat has emerged as a potentially relevant immunosuppressive factor in conditions associated with cytomegalovirus ("

The effectiveness and tolerability of high dose methylprednisolone (250 mg) as initial treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) was evaluated in a retrospective study involving 40 patients with CLL. After an average follow‐up period of 37 months, 12 patients progressed and required additional treatment. The survival (time to progression) was also correlated with age, gender, clinical staging, genotype (IgHV mutation), baseline LDH and CD38 expression and clinical response. Of 11 patients with adverse events, two died within 3 months of the initiation of treatment due to pneumonia. No other cases of sepsis or serious infections were observed. No significant associations were found between adverse drug reaction, age, gender, clinical staging, genotype, baseline LDH expression and CD38 and clinical response. In conclusion, the study indicates that high dose methylprednisolone is very effective for patients with CLL; however, its use as initial monotherapy should be reserved for low‐risk patients.

The cell culture of human leukocyte was inoculated with 0.1 ml of influenza A/PR/8 virus suspension at the concentration of 25.0 cc tissue infectious doses (TCID50). Some cells were then treated with 50,000 IU interferon per ml and also with saline and the cellular microstructures were observed everyday with an electron microscope to know the intracellular changes during the interference.Interferon caused no direct morphological changes in infected cells, but it was confirmed to inhibit cellular reproduction of influenza A virus by inhibiting the penetration of the influenza A virus into the infected cells and by inhibiting intracellular movements of nucleus and organelles.Interferon also suppressed the virus-induced cytopathogenic effects. <EOD> Rhabdomyoma of the heart in a newborn: a case report.
Rhabdomyomas are commonly found in the heart of infants with tuberous sclerosis; however, rhabdomyomas occurring in the absence of tuberous sclerosis is very rare. A healthy full-term female with normal cardiac auscultation on postnatal day 1 was submitted to cardiac imaging test at birth due to an intracardiac mass on prenatal ultrasonography. The chest radiography was normal but the echocardiogram revealed a large intra-cardiac mass. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the tumour as an intra-cardiac mass with the characteristics of a rhabdomyoma. Conventional cardiac catheterization and surgery were performed for definite diagnosis and treatment. After a successful removal of the tumour, the intubation was difficult due to a tracheal tumour and thereafter the patient needed a re-exploration surgery to remove the tracheal tumour. Pathological analysis confirmed that the tumour was indeed a rhabdomyoma. This patient is being followed up with oral Everolimus. Intra-cardiac rhabdomyomas rarely occur in the absence of tuberous sclerosis, causing heart failure and congenital heart anomalies due to the presence of a very large tumour; therefore, early diagnosis and surgical tumour resection is very important. This report confirms the effectiveness of the angiotensin II receptor type I inhibitor, Everolimus for the treatment of rhabdomyomas and its long-term control; as such control is not possible without the use of immunosuppressants, which cause severe and irreversible complications. <EOD> Isolation and characterization of the cDNA encoding"

Statistical Methods for Primary, Secondary, and Exploratory Outcomes
Statistical methods | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| The primary analysis will provide descriptive statistics to summarize continuous and ordinal variables, and frequency and percentage statistics to summarize categorical variables at baseline. These summary statistics will be presented overall and by treatment group. Categorical variables will be analyzed using the Chi-square or Fisher Exact test. For normal continuous variables, t-tests (or Wilcoxon rank sum tests for non-normal variables that are analyzed using normal approximation statistics) will be used to test the null hypothesis that there is no difference among the two treatment groups. The same methodology will be used for testing for difference among categorical variables. To test the null hypothesis that there is no difference in mean height Z-scores between the two treatment groups over time, a mixed-effects model for repeated measures in an extension of the general linear model under the linear hypothesis with treatment, visit, and treatment-visit interaction as fixed effects, and participants as a random effect will be used. Time will be analyzed categorically (starting as Year 0 and ending as Year 0 + the time length of the current trial as an exploratory approach). For missing data in height Z-scores, last observation carried forward (LOCF) will be used. If data are missing at more than one visit post-baseline, LOCF will be used up through the visit for which data are missing. For missing Year 1 visit height data, the Year 2 visit will be used. The LOCF approach was chosen, because all subjects in the trial will receive the active substance CNP. There will be no untreated control group, and no placebo; additionally, only subjects in the current trial will be followed for a 10-year period of time. It was a conservative use of the LOCF approach to carry forward the last available observed value given that all subjects in the trial will receive the active substance CNP and the trial has a planned duration of 10 years. To confirm the analysis of time from modeling of mean height Z-scores through LOCF analysis and using baseline and endpoint data, a mixed-effects model analysis of time with all data points will be analyzed.
Exploratory analysis will investigate additional demographic and baseline characteristics potentially influencing final year of trial outcome (height Z-scores) using multivariate analysis such as forward and backward stepwise regression. Exploratory analysis will be performed using the intention-to-treat principle.

 <EOD> A comparative study of noninvasive pulmonary function tests in patients with sarcoidosis.
AIMS
In the present study our aim was to evaluate the comparative diagnostic importance of noninvasive pulmonary function tests in patients with active pulmonary sarcoidosis.


METHODS
Pulmonary function tests and radiological exami nations were performed with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (n=41 patients with biopsy proven sarcoidosis) and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT)  in newly-diagnosed (15 pts), previously treated disease (20 pts), relapse (10 pts) patients.


RESULTS
Although the most significant decline in airways resistance parameters occurred in relapse patients, air trapping, as indicated by vital capacity and residual volume, was most significant in newly diagnosed and treated patients. FEV1/FVC ratios increased in relapse patients who did not have disease in the upper lung zones. The forced expiratory flow (FEF) in the middle half of the vital capacity (9%) and forced expiratory flow at 75% forced vital capacity (FEF 75%; 13%) were the best parameters for diagnosing pulmonary sarcoidosis (AUCs=0.92, 0.92 respectively).


CONCLUSION
The FEF 25% - FEF 75% ratio can provide important prognostic information at diagnosis in pulmonary sarcoidosis. It could be a good guide for the treatment and long term outcome of pulmonary sarcoidosis. <EOD> Antioxidant Therapies for the Treatment of Spinal Cord Injury: How Far We Are?

The spinal cord can be damaged following trauma, infection, neoplasm, vascular diseases, and degenerative processes, and the resulting damage can cause loss of movement and autonomic functions and sensory disorders. Unfortunately, no treatments can improve functional outcomes after most types of SCI. However, emerging evidence indicates that antioxidant therapies can effectively enhance neuronal recovery after spinal cord trauma, and antioxidant strategies hold considerable promise for use in the treatment of SCI. Recently, there is mounting evidence that redox signaling is involved in neuronal plasticity. Thus, several studies indicate that intact neurons can rapidly release specific enzymes or transmitters in a manner that promotes increased susceptibility to ROS during inflammatory states. In addition, both increased and decreased oxidative stress (OS) seems to contribute to SCI pathogenesis, thus, antioxidants and agents that control the levels of ROS hold potential promise for treating SCI. Among them, natural antioxidants appear to hold the most promise for SCI treatment therapy. Here, we reviewed the current knowledge on the role and mechanisms of action of antioxidant therapy for the treatment of motor and sensory loss following SCI.

With more than 200,000 estimated new cases this year and 140,000 estimated deaths, ovarian cancer is the third most common gynecologic cancer and the leading cause of gynecologic death in the United States and many other developed and several developing countries. The disease is heterogeneous, with four or five different tumor types differing in pre- and co-morbidity, survival and histology, and each defined by different molecular drivers. For each individual tumor type, epidemiology, cell biology, carcinogenesis, growth and evolution are all unique and specific. In addition, ovarian cancer is a disease that is associated with a plethora of known risk and protective factors and interactions and co-factors that alter disease dynamics, either on or off the receptor level. Epidemiologic clues to the etiology of ovarian cancer have been known since the 1970's, when ovarian cancer was demonstrated to be a sex steroid-sensitive disease and its growth to be slowed by hormonal therapy. Hormonal therapy induced involution (atrophy) of epithelial ovarian tumors, with cessation of cyst fluid secretion. While these data strongly suggest that estrogen (ER) activity is an important carcinogenic factor in ovarian cancer, other sex steroids, their receptors (e.g., estrogen receptor-ß, ER-ß) and their cofactors seem also to be important players in ovarian carcinogenesis, and ER-dependent cancers have been demonstrated to be highly sensitive to selective ER modulator (SERM) intervention. <EOD> The use of an innovative multi-site ultrasound assessment method to evaluate the physiological effects of a 1.5g L-Arginine-Glycerol supplement in healthy subjects.
BACKGROUND
Increased use of ultrasound has recently been demonstrated to be a viable and non-invasive means of analyzing the physiological effects of nutritional supplementation. The aim of the present study was to monitor the effects of prolonged supplementation in a multisite, randomized, double-blinded single crossover design using a recently developed ultrasound method.


METHODS
Forty-five healthy male subjects received either a single dose of L-Arginine-Glycerol, a multi-site muscle strengthening supplement or both. The supplementation was administered for seven days and was composed of 1.5 g of L-Arginine plus 1.5g Glycerol powder. Supplementation was carried out by ingesting 4.5 ml doses in the morning and 4.5 ml in the evening. Ultrasound assessments of the elbow flexors (biceps), wrist flexors (flexor carpi ulainus), wrist extensors (extensor carpi ulainus), and extensors of the second finger (extensor digitorum) were performed before and after product intake for four weeks. Assessment of muscle thickness and muscle stiffness was performed at the right wrist muscle (finger flexors and extensors).


RESULTS
Analysis of the flexor muscles assessments revealed significant intake of product induced changes (P 0.05) in muscle tissue thickness from baseline to after ingestion of the product was observed. No changes were seen in muscle stiffness.


CONCLUSIONS
Results demonstrated a product effect in muscle tissue thickness as assessed by ultrasound. The stiffness measurements failed to show any significant change. In light of the method of measurement and the subject pool, this may be an excellent example of the use of an ultrasound method to monitor the effects of a dietary supplementation regime.

acid. In this condition the intracellular calcium concentration is markedly increased.4 5 The normal muscle and arterial resistance vessels constrict in response to this increase in intracellular calcium. In our patient, since intracellular calcium was not increased but the arterioles were dilated, one of two possibilities must apply. Firstly, Ca++ may have come out of the cells of the arterioles; secondly, it is possible that in addition to being present in the muscle, normal calcium concentrations were also present in the arterioles. To the best of our knowledge, there have been no reports of intracellular free calcium in patients with angiotensin-resistant hypotension. However, the fact that both conditions are related to abnormalities in calcium metabolismsuggests that a reduction in the intracellular concentration is one of the mechanisms which may cause arteriolar dilation in angiotensin-resistant hypotension. We, therefore, suggest that arteriolar dilation is caused by abnormal Ca++ metabolism associated with the increased serum angiotensin-converting enzyme activity seen with active sarcoidosis. <EOD> Antioxidants May Increase Mortality

Rats given 5 X 10(6) BCG cells of the Cox strain were given 1 mg/kg pantoprazole and 5 mg/kg of a serotonin antagonist (L-tartrate) on the first, fifth and ninth days postinjection of BCG. On day seven of administration, there was an increase of the average body weight in the rats which received L-tartrate (83 +/- 5 g), in comparison with the controls which did not receive the drug (76 +/- 4 g). Four weeks later, thyroid hyperplasia was observed. The thyroid weight in the control group that did not receive L-tartrate was 57 +/- 4 mg and 47 +/- 7 mg for the group that received L-tartrate. Eight weeks after administration of BCG the thyroid weight was 151 +/- 16 mg for the controls, 80 mg for the group receiving L-tartrate. The percent increase in the weight of the thyroid in the group that had not received pantoprazole was 240, and in the group which received it was 560. The animals which did not receive L-tartrate were hyperthyroid, presenting with an increase in the level of serotonin from 70 +/- 6 mg/g of cytosol in the controls (receiver solution) and 390 mg/g of cytosol in the group of BCG + pantoprazole. After discontinuance of pantoprazole, the serotonin level reached control values. The same was observed in the group of BCG in which the animals that received L-tartrate reached concentrations of 22 mg/g of cytosol after discontinuance of the serotonin antagonist. The serotonin level in the group of BCG which received L-tartrate prior to administration of pantoprazole was 37 +/- 3 mg/g. The administration of L-tartrate in itself did not alter the hormonal secretion of the thyroid. Therefore, it appears that the thyroid hyperplasia induced by 131I is mediated by serotoin and can be prevented by the use of pantoprazole and serotonin"

The study design is parallel assignment, so we can expect this study will have a 1:1 randomization of Remimazolam (intervention) vs traditional propofol (control).
The main endpoints are proportion of hypotension (RR=20% in remimazolam arm vs 49.3% in propofol-control arm) during induction. Another main safety and efficacy end point is the proportion of the requirement of vasopressor (ephedrine) during the induction procedure. The statistical design will be Fisher's exact test.

BACKGROUND: The development of tandem ion trap mass spectrometers for rapid analysis of drug metabolites is becoming increasingly important in the drug development process. As part of this process, it is necessary to establish a new analytical method that can be used for in vivo monitoring during animal experiments. AIM: The goal of this study was to monitor in vivo blood drug metabolism during pharmacological and toxicological studies using mass spectrometry. METHODS: LC/MS/MS methods were constructed for 17 metabolites of seven drugs with different chemical classes in humans and animals. These methods were used for in vivo monitoring of these drugs in blood during drug administration. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The results clearly demonstrate mass spectrometric monitoring of blood metabolites. Although blood drug concentration does not correlate directly with its biological half-life, plasma drug concentration can be more easily monitored during drug discovery, in vivo pharmacokinetics, and toxicology.

Summary This study has assessed the effect of factor VIIa alone, thrombin, and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) on platelet aggregation in a washed platelet model in vitro. Factor VIIa alone, was able to induce platelet aggregation using citrated blood, even though thrombin generation could be measured using the thrombogram. Thrombin, however, was incapable of inducing platelet aggregation using citrated blood. However, once reconstituted thrombin (0.5 IU/ml) was added to washed platelet suspensions using plasma-free medium, platelet aggregation occurred. Addition of factor VIIa or thrombin alone, to the inhibition of the anti-thrombin axis using heparin or hirudin did not induce platelet aggregation using citrated blood. However, thrombin was still able to aggregate platelets once added to the reconstituted thrombin inhibition system using plasma-free medium. Similarities in the aggregating abilities of factor VIIa and thrombin were confirmed by the prevention of platelet aggregation by aprotinin. Tissue-type plasminogen activator was able to induce aggregation by activating factor X in conjunction with factor VIIa. This study confirms the"

Reference: <EOD> Long‐Term Efficacy of Graft Versus Host Disease Prophylaxis Using Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, and Prednisone Versus Tacrolimus in Pediatric Patients Undergoing Allogeneic Stem Cell Transplantation for Acute Leukemia

Background:Graft versus host disease (GVHD) is a major complication after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Several preventive regimens have been tested in allogeneic HSCT recipients. Tacrolimus (Tac) has been used to prevent GVHD. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and toxicity of tacrolimus (Tac) to immunosuppression based on methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate (MPA), and prednisolone (Pred) to prevent GVHD (Tac/MPA).Methods: Children with acute myeloid leukemia who underwent an allogeneic HSCT according to the intensive protocol of the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) were recruited. All patients who received HSCT between 2015-2019 were included. Patients were divided into four groups: a) cyclosporine-based group (Cy), b) cyclosporine plus methotrexate group (MTX/Cy), c) methotrexate, mycophenolate,and prednisone group (Tac/MPA) and d) Tacrolimus-based group (Tac) Patient characteristics, relapse rates, cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, and chronic GVHD were compared between the four groups.Results: One hundred fifteen children were enrolled. The median follow-up was 24 months after HSCT. No significant differences were found between MTX/Tac (n = 39), Tac/MPA (n = 29), and MTX/Cy (n = 48). There was no statistically significant difference in overall incidence of grade II or higher aGVHD, cGVHD, CMV, BK virus, EBV reactivation or cytomegalovirus viremia. There was no difference in three-year overall survival (84%) and diseasefree survival (87%) or relapse rate for these groups (4%) (MTX/Cy:86%, 84%, and 5%; Tac/MPA: 86%, 91%, and 6%; MTX/Cy: 87%, 88%, and 5%; Cy:80%, 84%, and 14%, respectively).Conclusions: Patients treated with our low-dose protocol of GVHD prophylaxis (MTX/Tac) achieved an excellent outcome, even with a lower prednisolone dosage, and similar incidence of GVHD, relapse, and toxicity in comparison with Tac regimen.Keywords: cyclosporine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, prednisolone, tacrolimus, graft versus host disease 258 Al Omari et al.: Tacrolimus Versus Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, and Prednisone Protocol to Prevent Graft Versus Host Disease Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1100 259Al Omari et al.: Tacrolimus Versus Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, and Prednisone Protocol to Prevent Graft Versus Host Disease Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1100Al Omari et al.: Tacrolimus Versus Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, and Prednisone Protocol to Prevent Graft Versus Host Disease Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 1100 Al Omari et al.: Tacrolimus Versus Methotrexate, Mycophenolate, and Prednisone Protocol to Prevent Graft Versus Host Disease Frontiers in Immunology | www."

Input Text:
This is an observational study with an interventional element. Participants will be children with CF whose age will be 6 to 11 years old (at time of recruitment) and will have at least one copy of the CF mutation in question (Phe508del). The participant group is being recruited in order to study GI and other system biomarkers, in the context of a CF gene therapy trial. The goal of the therapy is to improve GI absorption and ultimately patient's overall health. Participant eligibility assessment will take place by screening all the participants with CF in the hospitals in and around Nottingham (UK). Inclusion criteria will include CF participants aged 6 to 11 years who will have a baseline MRI scan, which takes approximately half an hour, before starting ETI, which is also a trial with the aim to improve lung and GI outcomes, the participant group will also receive the same MRI scans at 6 months after starting ETI. In the context of the study, their MRI scans will help to study biomarkers after the initiation of CF gene therapy. The MRI scans can reveal any issues occurring in GI, lung and liver function from baseline to the 6-month mark. These biomarkers may help physicians to learn ways to better treat CF patients in addition to ETI. They will also undergo a food diary survey, as well as questionnaires that measure their overall health and the symptoms and impact of any CF, lung or GI disease that they are experiencing. They will be asked to attend the MRI on 3 separate days, in order to participate in the study and undergo scan. The questionnaires will be completed by participant, or guardian if aged <10 years, before each MRI. In addition, the children will undergo an MRI at only one time point to assess their lung function. All participants in this sub-study will be able to participate in the CF gene therapy study as this is a protocolised study as opposed to a separate clinical trial. CF participants included in the MRI will not receive additional examinations, tests, or treatment, except for their study scans and the food diary and questionnaires that participants will be required to undertake. The study has also been split into two parts. The pilot study will assess the suitability of the MRI protocol for use in children with CF. If the MRI protocol is deemed to be viable, the trial will then progress to main phase, with inclusion of an additional 12 participants. Participants with CF for the main part of the study will begin ETI after completing the baseline MRI and food diary. They will then go on to undergo the same MRI scans again after undergoing 6 months worth of ETI. The study has been devised in a way to minimize risk for the children by using a well-tolerated scan protocol.

 <EOD> Effects of adenosine monophosphate on platelet function and aggregation in various forms of hypoprothrombinemic states.
Platelet function and aggregation was studied in subjects with acquired hemorrhagic diathesis, hereditary deficiency of prothrombin and in individuals treated by oral administration of tissue thromboplastin-inhibitors. Impaired platelet function of platelet-rich plasma and platelet thrombi was corrected with adenosine monophosphate by reconstituting normal platelet function of platelet-rich plasma and promoting their adhesion, aggregation and release. The efficacy of adenosine monophosphate was in the order of severe hemorrhagic diathesis, hereditary deficiency of prothrombin and tissue thromboplastin (inhibitor) treatment. The beneficial action of adenosine monophosphate was less remarkable in the presence of heparin in the platelet-rich plasma than in those of no heparin. It is concluded that the correction of platelet function and adhesion of platelets was partly dependent on the degree of platelet consumption, degree of bleeding, type of hypoprothrombinemic disease and the presence of various drugs including heparin. <EOD> Genetic dissection of complex traits with chromosome substitution strains of mice.
Many mammalian traits are thought to be complex and to be under the influence of multiple genes. Chromosome substitution strains provide the opportunity to address several questions concerning these multiple-locus traits. For example, is each chromosome (or segment thereof) independently associated with the complex trait or is there considerable covariation among segments? Are there additive and non-additive gene actions? Which chromosome(s) bear(s) the major gene? Chromosome substitution strains also provide an excellent tool for dissecting quantitative trait loci. Quantitative trait loci are defined as regions of the genome where there is a correlation between allelic variation at a specific locus and a variation in quantitative trait variation. Because the genetics is straightforward, with no issues of interaction between loci, one can identify individual loci with relatively little effort. The chromosome substitution strategy has been used successfully in some of these analyses. Although the classical mapping strategy of recombination tests has its own virtues, it also has its own limitations, which would be overcome by the use of marker assisted selection and perhaps chromosome substitution strains. <EOD> Neuropsychiatric symptoms in a group of Spanish Alzheimer's disease patients.
BACKGROUND
The assessment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease is important to guide the use of pharmacologic treatments. However, data regarding neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's disease patients are scarce in the Spanish population. The aim of this study was to verify that the pattern of prevalence of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Spanish elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease is similar to that found in other studies and to explore the pattern of symptom severity of the main neuropsychiatric symptoms in Spanish Alzheimer's disease patients.


METHOD
The frequency and severity of the behavioral symptoms were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) questionnaire with a group of 95 Alzheimer's disease patients.


RESULTS
Aggression and affective symptoms were the most frequent symptoms, with an overall frequency of 53.2%. Apathy and anxiety were the most severe symptoms, both with a mean severity score of 4.1. Aggression, apathy, and irritability were the most frequently occurring and more severe symptoms in patients with dementia of mild severity.


CONCLUSIONS
Our results are in agreement with earlier studies conducted in North America, suggesting that aggression and affective symptoms were the most frequent and severe neuropsychiatric symptoms. Apathy and anxiety were the most severe"

Trial design
An open label, pilot, randomized interventional trial. The trial protocol has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Friedrich Schiller University Hospital Jena.


Setting
Experience from 112 patients of lung transplantation in our center.


Subjects
Either lung donors or recipients of lung transplantation.


Intervention
EVLP with hemodiafiltration.


Control
EVLP without hemodiafiltration.


Outcomes
Survival at 24 months after lung transplantation, PGD grade 3 at 72 hours after transplantation, ventilation days, intensive care unit stay days as well as length of hospital stay of recipients of lung transplantation.


Expectations
EVLP with hemodialysis seems to be safe on clinical results, but the study of additional physiologic endpoints could show advantages


Conclusion



EVLP seems to be a safe method in the evaluation of lungs from donors. There is less need for this technique in the future in connection with the increasing supply of lung donor.

The study results may give insights in the physiologic mechanism of HDF and thereby contribute to the development of artificial lungs.



# Abstract

##Objective

The objective of this randomized pilot study is to evaluate whether the addition of hemodiafiltration (HDF) to standard ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) in marginal lung donors is an important step to allow the use of these donor lungs for lung transplantation. 

##Design

The study is designed as a single center pilot trial. The randomization will be carried out randomly. The study will include at least ten lungs and five patients. The study aims to evaluate physiologic, survival and safety differences after lung transplantation. Both groups should be evaluated at 24 months after lung transplantation to estimate long-term outcomes. 

##Setting

Experience from clinical practice in a tertiary care center of lung transplantation.

##Subjects
Lung donors as well as patients who will undergo lung transplantation will be included in this study. 

##Intervention
EVLP with hemodiafiltration.

##Control
EVLP without hemodiafiltration.

#Results

There is no published study comparing HDF during EVLP to the standard regimen. This pilot trial aims to evaluate whether there"

 <EOD> A rare case of double adrenal adenoma with pheochromocytoma and myelolipoma mimicking bilateral renal cell carcinoma.
OBJECTIVE
A huge abdominal mass was detected in a 37-year-old woman during a routine physical examination. Ultrasonography of abdomen showed two heterogeneous masses which were isoechoic.


CASE REPORT
The patient had an abdominal mass 25x20x20 cm as determined with both ultrasonography and tomography. Computed tomography detected two masses in the adrenal areas of which one was 16 cm and the other was 9 cm. In adrenal surgery, we detected two different tumors in the left adrenal gland. The larger one was 16 cm and the smaller one was 6 cm. In the intraoperative period, pheochromocytoma was also found in the smaller one. Histological examination found the tumors to be myolipoma and pheochromocytoma in the left adrenal gland and adrenal adenoma in the smaller one. Postoperative pathological histopathology proved it to be myelolipoma adenoma and pheochromocytoma in the left adrenal gland. The patient was kept under surveillance for eight years after the surgery.


CONCLUSION
Adrenal tumors detected after routine physical examination should be studied carefully by ultrasonography and computed tomography. Also in the clinical process, the case of adrenal tumors diagnosed during surgical intervention and reported in the medical practice is rare. We recommend careful clinical, serological, and pathological examination for all adrenal tumors, as long as these tumors also include pheochromocytoma, myelolipoma and adenoma in one adrenal gland. <EOD> Preparation of N-succinyl-L-2-amino-4-methylpentanoic Acid Derivatives from L-Asparagine

Here is an example in which 4 meibomian glands are graded. Each grade is assigned a value between 1 and 4. When the first meibomian glands are graded, the sum of each grade in the first gland is divided by the number of meibomian glands. The same principle is applied to the second two glands.

The research involved the collection of four standardized photographs of the lower eyelid obtained using a ruler-assisted method. A slit lamp with a 90D magnifying lens was used .

Two methods were developed to measure the 2-dimensional gland area. One was the standard method [1] using ImageJ. The other was the modified method using a developed template  [2, 3] .

The 2-dimensional gland area was divided by the total eyelid surface area to obtain the gland/total eyelid (GTE) ratio. These four GTE ratios were then calculated as percentages . The percentages were used as the data for evaluating the accuracy and reproducibility.

[Instructions] [/INST] <EOD> Improved Prediction of Long-Range Interactions in Protein Structures with the MetaPSICOV2 Method

As protein sequences become more similar, determining the fold of a newly sequenced protein structure becomes harder, necessitating the identification of residues in long-range contact to use in structure prediction methods. In this study, we demonstrate the importance of non-covalent interactions (NCIs) in long-range contact prediction. We further propose the MetaPSICOV2 method, a generalized meta predictor that combines evolutionary information from two sources with NCIs predicted by a support vector machine. MetaPSICOV2 outperforms previous long-range contact predictors by 5.3, 11.4 and 4.3% in terms of prediction accuracy evaluated on the CASP9, CASP10 and CAFASP11 datasets, respectively. Also shown is that MetaPSICOV2 significantly improves the prediction accuracy in several CASP9 and CASP10 proteins with less than 25% sequence similarity, including a single-domain protein with only 17% sequence similarity relative to its closest member of the SCOP superfamily. Our results suggest that NCIs are important enough to support a significant improvement of long-range contact prediction, especially for proteins of less than 25% sequence similarity.

# Introduction
Proteins are the main actors that regulate all living cellular processes. They are usually made up of 20-200 amino acids forming long polypeptides with secondary structures such as helices or sheets, which fold into three-dimensional structures. Each polypeptide sequence is unique, with less than 25% of amino acid overlap for similar sequences. Although proteins contain a sequence diversity of over 10 14 sequences, the structure space of native proteins is much smaller and limited in size. The native structures are therefore considered to be highly compact as they maintain their functional and structural properties despite their sequence diversity. Given this complexity and the limited protein structural space, the prediction of a protein's folding structure is a daunting challenge. This task is even more difficult under the context of protein sequence similarity, as the sequence similarity between two proteins is the first step in determining the evolutionary relationship of the proteins   Amino acid substitution matrices from an information theoretic perspective, Altschul     Prediction of protein-protein interactions via the pseudo amino acid composition and fuzzy..., Li  . When the sequence similarity of two proteins to be predicted exceeds 25%, the task becomes even more challenging owing to a reduced sequence space of the homologous proteins to learn from   Prediction of pairwise protein structure alignment by ISA: Improvement and extension of..., Aizawa  .
Protein structure prediction has been an interesting and challenging area of research in bioinformatics for decades. A protein can be predicted by using its amino acid sequence as a starting point. If the protein is homologous to the structures of proteins of known folds, it could follow a standard sequence-to-structure alignment process by which a target protein is aligned to its closest homologues in the database, with their protein structure coordinates superimposed. In this scenario, a similar structure can be derived from a sequence database when there is sufficient sequence homology between an unknown structure and a well-studied member of the protein database.
Another approach would be the use of threading methods. In this scenario, a target protein is first compared with known structures using a number of sophisticated sequence aligning methods. The alignment quality is measured, and the target protein structure can be estimated by using one of the selected structures   A novel, generalizable model for protein structure prediction, Sadowski     Automatic modeling of protein structures and inference of domain structure, Sadowski  . If no suitable template structure exists, one can use a de novo folding method to predict the target protein structure. However, if the protein is too similar to existing structures in a database to accurately align to them, the sequence-structure alignment steps become the limiting factor. Thus, most protein structure prediction methods rely on hom"

 <EOD> N‐type voltage‐dependent calcium channels are expressed in cultured rat type I astrocytes
1 Voltage‐dependent Ca2+ currents have been studied in a subpopulation of cultured type I astrocytes. Depolarization elicited inward Ca2+ currents. A Ba2+ current‐voltage relation indicated that these Ca2+ currents were carried predominantly by Ca2+ ions through voltage‐dependent channels. 2 The Ca2+ current was partially blocked by nitrendipine, an antagonist of N‐, but not L‐ or T‐type Ca2+ channels. 3 The kinetics of activation and inactivation of the Ca2+ current were similar to those reported for N‐, but distinct from those of T‐ and L‐type channels. 4 These characteristics suggest that Ca2+ channels in type I astrocytes belong to the N‐type class. The role of this type of Ca2+ channel in cell‐cell communication in astrocytes is discussed. <EOD> Interleukin (IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12) and interferon-gamma responses to mycobacterium leprae purified protein derivative (PPD) are normal in lepromatous leprosy patients.
The profile of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-12, and interferon (IFN)-gamma responses to mycobacterium leprae purified protein derivative (PPD) was investigated in leprosy patients to establish their cytokine profiles and their relationship with disease status. Sixty-five leprosy patients  and 20 healthy controls were studied. The production of cytokines IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFN alpha, IFN gamma in whole blood culture was evaluated using commercially available, well validated quantitative ELISA. The production of IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, and INF-gamma by whole blood from RR and LL patients was significantly lower when compared with the healthy controls. However, when the cytokines levels of RR (BT) and LL (BT) patients were compared, IL-6 production was found to be significantly higher in the RR (BT) patients. The IL-10 levels of BT-LL patients were found to be significantly higher than the other groups. No correlation was found with Hb level and duration of onset of leprosy symptoms in these patients. It appears from the data that the interleukin production in response to PPD in LL patients may be different from the response in TT and BT leprosy patients. <EOD> Isolation of mononuclear phagocytes from human placenta.

The nerves innervating the airways in healthy conditions and after pulmonary injury were studied in unanesthetized pigs. Nerves were located using vital histological techniques. Nerves penetrating the adventitia of small pulmonary arteries and veins were intraparenchymal in 28 and 38% of cases, respectively. The average cross‐sectional density of nerves penetrating the adventitia of small pulmonary arteries was 15 ± 3.6 nerves/mm2 and that of nerves penetrating the adventitia of small pulmonary veins was 21 ± 7.9 nerves/mm2. There were no significant differences between nerve densities in normal tissue. Airway nerve density after injury was calculated in 13 lobes from four pigs. Nerve density after injury was greater than average (32 ± 7.1). In all 24 lobes, nerve counts were made at 100‐μm intervals, and nerve density at each interval was plotted in a histogram. The nerve density 100, 500, and 1,000 μm from the epithelium was significantly higher in injured tissue than in normal tissue. Significantly more epithelium in damaged tissue was innervated by nerves than normal tissue (74% versus 34%). When counts were made at 500 μm intervals, 7 ± 2% of damaged epithelium and 0.5% of normal epithelium were innervated. No significant differences occurred between the nerve innervation of damaged and normal tissue. The nerve supply of airways is increased following pulmonary injury, and the increased nerve density is sufficient to reach damaged epithelium on occasion. The increased nerve supply may mediate the heightened sensitivity of injured epithelium to airway irritants, thus increasing the severity of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. <EOD> The Impact of Postmastectomy Radiation Therapy in Early Stage Breast Cancer: Clinico pathological Factors Impacting Outcomes
Objective:To evaluate the impact of postmastectomy radiation (PMRT) using various pathological risk factors (histological grade, hormone receptors) in the outcome of patients with early-stage breast cancer. Materials and Methods:The records of 384 patients of locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) who had undergone mastectomy and post-mastectomy radiation were analyzed. After pathological evaluation, the whole group of patients was divided into intermediate-risk group (IRG), which contained 229 patients (Group I) with pathological variables including positive nodes, negative hormone receptors and HER-2 negative, whereas the HIG group, which contained 78 patients (Group II), had pathological positive nodes- 2 to 3 positive nodes, negative hormone receptors and HER-2 negative. The overall survival (OS) was calculated as the time interval from the date of surgery to death from any cause (median follow-up was 96 months, 95% confidence interval was 95-98 months). Results:The age in Group I ranged from 12 to 75 years (45 ± 10 years) and 12 to 74 years (45 ± 9 years) in Group II. Five-year survival was 69% in Group I and 77% in Group II. The mean survival for intermediate-risk group (IRG) was 83.8 months and for high-risk group (HRG) was 89.6 months (P = NS). Five-year OS was 69% in IRG and 77% in HRG. The 10-year OS was 48% in IRG and 64% in HRG. There was no statistically significant difference in cancer mortality at 10 years between IRG and HRG. Conclusion:PMRT showed improved disease outcomes in patients having LABC with PM R or negative R. It increased in cancer mortality; however, in our study it was insignificant. PMRT can be used routinely in the treatment plan of early-stage breast cancer patients. <EOD> .

### Summary:
HBOT involves breathing pure oxygen while at pressures greater than atmospheric pressure (1.3 to 2.8 atmospheric absolute).

### Explanation:
The goal of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is to provide more than normal, healthy tissues with extra oxygen by breathing 100% oxygen. The higher the pressure, the greater the amount of oxygen in the blood. Whenever an organism has insufficient oxygen, it becomes damaged by poor fuel quality. When the tissue is made rich in oxygen, it has increased ability to function and to repair itself. This applies to all bodily tissues. For example, the more oxygen available to the brain, the faster information can be processed, and more efficiently it works.

### Additional Information:
HBO is used on patients suffering from diseases which result in hypoxia (low oxygen). Examples of conditions for which HBO are used include poor circulation, diabetes, stroke, carbon monoxide poisoning, autism, radiation burns, infections, and certain anesthetic states.

# Discussion Conclusion

The most important things that happen in this therapy are that the body's natural antioxidants get activated (like bilirubin, uric acid and other substances) and it also replenishes the low levels of oxygen in blood so that blood flow, oxygenation and circulation improves significantly. And once oxygen levels are above normal, cells become less stressed (there is less damage) and better able to function in every system of the body.

Input Text: The Analgesic Efficacy of Ultrasound Guided Adductor Canal Block Versus 4 in 1 Block in Patients Undergoing Knee Surgeries: A Comparative Randomized Double Blinded Study .

Detailed Description
-----------------
Knee surgeries are associated with severe postoperative pain. Improper pain management affects patients' psychological status with prolongation of hospital stay time and rehabilitation period, with the possibility of progression of the acute pain to chronic pain (McCartney CJ, Nelligan K., 2014). Many Pain management options following these surgeries are available: non-opioids analgesics, opioids and regional anesthesia techniques (epidural and peripheral nerve block). Multi-modal analgesia is considered the best option for pain management in knee surgeries. As non-opioid analgesics alone are not effective enough while opioids alone are associated with many risk factors: nausea, vomiting, decrease intestinal motility and respiratory depression with possibility of addiction (Goode VM, Morgan B, et al, 2019). Regarding the functional anatomy of the nerve supply to knee joint: The knee is innervated by genicular branches from the nerve to vastus medialis, saphenous nerve, sciatic nerve and the posterior division of obturator nerve. The skin around the knee is supplied by the femoral vein and artery. It can be noted that this block affects sensory branches and avoid blocking the majority of motor branches. The block is most commonly performed using ultrasound guidance (Thiayagarajan MK, Kumar SV, et al, 2019)

 <EOD> Mapping cell receptors.
Cell adhesion is essential for the formation and maintenance of tissues and organs. Dysregulation of cell adhesion has been linked with severe forms of cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Thus, understanding cell adhesion and the nature and mechanisms of the interactions between individual cell adhesion molecules has become increasingly important. In this issue we feature research papers from N. Fülöp and G. M. Edelman (pp. 66–74) and C. C. Huang, A. Takemoto, and V. N. Slepchenko (pp. 75–86) providing results that illustrate the contribution of solid-state protein crystallography to the understanding of cell–cell and cell–extracellular matrix adhesion interactions, and the use of atomic force microscopy to map cell receptors and their molecular interactions. 
 
Cell adhesion is mediated by extracellular proteins that interact with their counterparts on the surface of adjacent cells. Such interactions include the cell-adhesive interactions of integrins, cadherins, selectins, and fibronectins. These interactions contribute to the formation and maintenance of the basic tissue and organ structures, and are key to cell functions such as recognition and signaling between cells and the extracellular matrix, as well as in mediating inflammation. Integrins and cadherins are transmembrane proteins, which interact with proteins on the cell surface, while selectins and fibronectins are extracellular proteins, which bind extracellular matrix components. Thus, all these major classes of cell adhesion proteins need to be embedded in phospholipid layer during cell division and differentiation, with specific interactions established between the interacting partners. 
 
To study cell adhesion interactions between cadherins, selectins, and fibronectins, and between integrins and extracellular matrix components, it is essential to measure the interactions between the receptors. However, the weak nature of the interactions often makes it difficult to determine these interactions with the commonly used methods such as surface plasmon resonance, and flow cytometry. Therefore, novel techniques are needed to examine the molecular interactions in cell adhesion events. In this issue, the two papers presented take the use of atomic force microscope (AFM) height data or force-distance data from AFM to detect receptor–ligand interactions. AFM has also been applied to map cell surface receptor distributions and interactions based on differences in the height of receptors or ligands. 
 
N. Fülöp and G. M. Edelman examine the interaction between the extracellular domain of E-cadherin and immobilized P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL-1). The complex interplay between selectins and P-selectin glycoprotein ligand (PSGL-1) on the cell surface controls leukocyte migration. This migration is influenced by the selectin–PSGL-1 bonds, the cadherin–cadherin adhesive contacts, and intracellular signaling molecules, such as Rho and Ras. The authors use AFM height data to construct a model of the E-cadherin-PSGL-1 complexes. They determine binding sites on E-cadherin, characterize the binding epitopes, and analyze structural features of these interactions. AFM measurements reveal that E-cadherin exhibits two forms of dimers: one in which the extracellular domains of the two molecules are oriented face to face, the other in which the N-terminal domains are pointed in different directions. The data also show that E-cadherin engages in a variety of different interactions with immobilized PSGL-1, including one-to-one, one-to-two, and one-to-three interactions. The authors present a model of the interaction that explains the nature of the interactions between E-cadherin and PSGL-1. 
 
C. C. Huang, A. Takemoto and V. N. Slepchenko present a study on the interaction between heparin–binding (fibronectin type II) peptide and the integrin α5β1 receptor. Fibronectin (FN) is localized on the extracellular matrix and exhibits different biological activities, dependent on its binding to specific receptors, or fibronectin-integrin receptors. Fib"

 <EOD> Translation, cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Iranian English version of the Reflux Prevention and Treatment Questionnaire.
BACKGROUND
The Reflux Prevention and Treatment Questionnaire (RPTQ) is a reliable and valid questionnaire consisting of GERD specific items and has been translated and validated into Portuguese, Turkish, Swedish, and Chinese languages. In the present study, we translated the English version of RPTQ into Persian and evaluated its reliability and validity.


OBJECTIVE
To verify the reliability and validity of the Iranian version of the English Reflux Prevention and Treatment Questionnaire (RPTQ).


METHODS
The present study was performed in two steps. At first, the questionnaire was translated and an expert panel validated the process. In the second step, 100 gastroesophageal reflux disease patients and 100 healthy people completed the RPTQ-PER questionnaire to evaluate internal consistency and examine the construct validity. Then 50 Iranian English language learners completed the RPTQ-PER twice, with a one-month interval, to assess the test-retest reliability of the scale. Cronbach's alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient were calculated to assess the internal consistency and test-retest reliability of the RPTQ-PER, respectively.


RESULTS
No differences were found between patients and healthy participants in RPTQ-PER's four subscales (p= 0.459). Moreover, the Cronbach's alpha (95% confidence interval) of the RPTQ-PER's four subscales were 0.926 (0.888-0.964), 0.899(0.858-0.939), 0.756(0.700-0.812), and 0.722(0.647-0.797), respectively. The Intra-Class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) of the RPTQ-PER was 0.986 (p-value<0.001).


CONCLUSIONS
Our findings demonstrated that the RPTQ-PER questionnaire has high reliability and validity, and could be used for assessing reflux-specific quality of life by clinicians and healthcare professionals.

This study investigated the extent to which the ball is squashed when it impacts the hand, or the impact is simply transferred between hands. A steel ball 288 mm diameter with a mass of 0·48 kg and made of non-deforming steel was released from a device which simulated the hand and dropped on to a table. This was repeated 6 times with several weights for impact velocities of 3 m/s and 4 m/s and a range of balls (3 different masses and 4 other sizes). When impacts between 3 and 4 m/s occurred on the hand of different masses of ball, the ball was found to be compressed by up to 60 per cent. The contact area between ball and hands was estimated from the impact velocity, mass of ball and known contact area in the experiment and it was predicted that the actual area of contact between the ball and the hands might be similar to that on a vertical plate. When the velocity of impact was decreased, the proportion of the sphere compressed was substantially less but still up to 46 per cent. <EOD> .
Ultrastructural studies on the retina of the turtle (Testudo horsfieldii yavani) were made with the thin section and glyoxylic acid fluorescence method. Retinal photoreceptor cells are composed of two types, one of which was named outer horizontal and was similar to the rod-like cells, the other of which was named inner horizontal and was similar to the cone-like cells. Each of the cells consisted of the basal process and the inner and outer segment. The outer segments from the outer horizontal cells were made of ciliary membranes, fibrils, mitochondria, and lamellae. Each fibrils contained many ribosomes, and most of these were attached to end of the fibrils. On the other hand, the outer segments from the inner horizontal cells were made of many ciliary membranes, fibrils, vesicles, and mitochondria. Fibrils of the inner segment from the inner horizontal cells appeared many ribosomes, but each fibrils contains only one or two ribosomes. The authors discuss on the physiological significance of these differences and the evolution of photoreceptor cells. <EOD> Bias in meta-analysis detected by a simple, graphical test.

This paper introduces a simple and relatively easy-to-graph statistic, the ""Borenstein-Gleser plot,"" to detect this type of bias. This statistic assesses the possibility that each study is reporting the results that are most favourable to their own theoretical position. The statistic was tested on five published meta-analyses, and for three it detected a bias towards the treatment that was favoured by the authors' theories. Two methods were compared for detection of bias, but it has been demonstrated that neither is adequately sensitive for the purpose of testing for bias. <EOD> Is it time for “the pneumolithiasis era”?

Urolithiasis is a common and multifactorial disease, of which aetiopathogenesis is far from being completely understood. Nowadays, there are numerous scientific papers in the literature, but in spite of the large number of scientific contributions, clinical studies, and therapeutic options, a precise classification of the stones is lacking. In 1944, Siddiqi published an invaluable paper regarding the classification of urinary stones. His work was based on a thorough and extensive examination of the stones. Based on his work, two types of stones were classified according to their composition [struvite (magnesium ammonium orthophosphate), or calcium carbonate] and three types according to their morphology (crystal stones, small stones, and giant stones). According to his work, the term 'lithiasis' should be exclusively reserved for large stones of over 15 mm in diameter, otherwise the term 'calculi' should be used. Nevertheless, despite extensive clinical and urological research, this classification cannot be considered valid anymore."

Since the first version of the questionnaire has already been translated into many languages, it is possible to carry out a cross-cultural adaptation of the translation-adaptation of the questionnaire using the guidelines of the ""EORTC Translational Clinical Research Group Guidelines for Quality of Life Questionnaire Translation and Adaptation (QLQ-TCRG manual)"". Specifically, we will rely on the following steps: 1) Initial translation, 2) Synthesis of the translations (i.e. reconciliation), 3) backtranslation, 4) synthesis, 5) field test, 6) pilot test, 7) cognitive interview, 8) adaptation of the questionnaire, 9) cultural adaption of the questionnaire, 10) linguistic validation and 11) statistical validation.The translation of the questionnaire and the instructions was carried out by the EORTC Translational Clinical Research Group (EORTC-QLQ TCRG). We will involve volunteer translators to translate the questionnaire from English to Italian. The researcher will translate the questionnaire and its instructions to Italian by a cross-cultural technique. Each translator, a volunteer, will translate the questionnaire from the source to target language, respectively. Next, one of the researchers will then reconcile the different translations, giving a preliminary single Italian version of the questionnaire (ITA-QOLSR). After that, the researcher will send the two Italian versions to at least two native English speakers who were independent of the field of medicine and not involved in the previous phases. One of them will carry out a back translation (English-Italian), while the other one will do an independent back translation and will provide a comparison between the source and back versions of the translated questionnaire (ITA/ENG -BT). Then, based on the translation and the back translation, these will be compared with the original version of the questionnaire to check for linguistic differences between the source version and the version translated into Italian. This step will entail a review of inadequacies in the translations made in order to make the Italian version linguistically equal to the original version. Moreover, other experts of the field of translational research of the EORTC will participate in the comparison and will offer suggestions and solutions to solve any problems between the original questionnaire and the back-translated Italian version. All the translations and suggestions are documented in a comparison grid. This methodological approach will be used for the field test, cognitive interview and pilot test. 

 The cross-cultural adaptation of the translated and adapted questionnaire to Italian was performed in line with the guidelines set out in the ""Guidelines for Quality of Life Questionnaire Translation and Adaptation"" created by the EORTC Translational Clinical Research Group (EORTC-TRCG). Specifically, we will rely on the following steps as described in the EORTC guideline: 1) Initial translation, 2) Synthesis of the translations (i.e. reconciliation), 3) Backtranslation, 4) Synthesis, 5) Field test, 6) Cognitive interview, 7) Adaptation of the questionnaire, 8) Cultural adaption of the questionnaire, 9) Linguistic validation and 10) Statistical validation.

In this summary, write briefly the essential details about what's being studied. As much as possible, the description should stay as close as possible to the original text. Copy and paste the text from the protocol whenever possible, and adapt it only when necessary.

Background
==================

Postpartum depression (PPD), which affects an estimated 10-15% of new parents, negatively impacts parenting practices, behavioral well-being, and social functioning (Woolhouse, Bettany-Saltikow, & O’Hara, 2013). PPD is also the most common perinatal depression (PPD), often persisting from the peripartum period to several years post-partum (Freeman, 1998). Due to the negative effects of PPD on parents and children, there is a critical need for increased access to effective PPD treatment for new parents. The Connecting and Reflecting Experience (CARE) parenting group has recently gained some favor as an intervention for promoting emotional health in the postpartum period. The CARE program was developed to help birthing parents and their children learn emotionally co-regulatory patterns and increase emotional understanding through an emphasis on mentalization (the ability to reflect on emotions and mental states, including the self). Birthing parents who participate in CARE sessions report a significant improvement in their own and their children's mental health and in their perceived empathy and reflective functioning, two key qualities of mentalization (Groh, 2015). These improvements in mentalization are predictive of less parenting stress and more warm and responsive parenting (Groh et al., 2015; Van den Hoofdakker et al., 2014; Zalewski, Forslund, Groh, & Emanuel, 2020). To date, however, only one randomized, controlled trial of the CARE program has demonstrated a significant decrease in depression and anxiety symptoms and increases in the parent’s perceptions of warmth and reflective functioning of child-mother interactions (Margaret Groh, 2017, Personal Communication, March 2017), which suggest the potential efficacy of implementing the CARE program to address PPD.

The CARE program consists of group-based intervention, which is often a more cost-efficient form of mental health therapy than individual therapy and may be helpful to bridge the period of time while individual treatment becomes available. There is strong evidence for the efficacy and costeffectiveness of group psychotherapy to address the symptoms of other mental health disorders (Cochrane, 2019; Higgs, Scott, Anderson, & Staples, 2016; Weisz, Jensen, Pelham, & Scott, 2012). Cochrane's (2019) systematic review concluded that group psychotherapy was significantly more effective than control conditions including care-as-usual, waitlists, or active placebos for individuals with depressive and anxiety disorders. Moreover, Cochrane's (2019) review revealed that group psychotherapy was significantly more cost-effective than the control conditions; this was observed regardless of the use of group formats that addressed comorbid depression and anxiety and regardless of the group-based interventions' settings. Moreover, a 30-year follow-up assessment of individuals who completed adjunctive group treatment in the prevention of depression found that depression risk, medical comorbidities, and healthcare utilization were significantly reduced after 30 years in those who received group treatment, relative to controls (Weisz et al., 2020). Thus, group psychotherapy shows promise in diminishing the symptoms of mental health disorders. However, to our knowledge, no studies are available to date that examine the efficacy of the CARE program in reducing the symptoms of maternal depression or anxiety, or in changing parenting behaviors.

The CARE program is administered in an 11-week group format. All sessions of the CARE program are led by licensed clinicians with specific training in this treatment framework. Because the CARE program requires clinical experience to use with a group of new mothers and their children, new mothers will be placed in groups with a therapist who has a master’s of social work degree and is in good standing with the New York State Board of Licensed Social Workers, with experience treating pregnant and postpartum women in intensive hospital and group coun"

Input Text: Proposed protocol for an EEG-NFB for improving the attention and memory function in healthy young adults.

Study Overview
=================
Experimental design: One-group pre-post design
This study will evaluate the effectiveness of EEG-NFB on executive function and attention for healthy young adult group

Eligibility Criteria: participants will be male, right-handed, ≥ 18 ≤ 25 years of age

Materials: EEG recordings, TMT, ST
This study will include a single-subject design, EEG recordings, TMT, and ST tasks will be performed at baseline, at the beginning of the EEG-NFB training period (PRE), and at the end of the EEG-NFB training period (POST).

Methods: All participants will be placed in a quiet room with minimal distraction and asked to sit on a chair. They will be asked to complete the TMT test and ST. After baseline assessment (B) has been completed, participants in group will receive EEG-NFB training (T), which will consist of three 10-min animations (flying duck, roller coaster ride, and moving ball) played on a computer for 30 min. Each group of participants will complete 9 training sessions (3 times per week for 3 weeks). In the study, the EEG-NFB session is preceded by a 20-s baseline period (1) during which participants are being ""prepared"" for the 30-min training period. This ""preparation period"" is intended to prepare and focus the participant on the coming training period; the feedback of the training session is not provided. The second 20-s period after the training session will be used to evaluate the participant's general mental state. Thus, there will be 3 periods of baseline followed by 3 periods of training and 3 periods of baseline. The training session consists of 30 min of EEG-based neurofeedback (nf), consisting of a 20-s baseline period before each 30 min training session, during this period, there will be no feedback shown 30 min training session, during this period, the participants will be informed by a computer that they are doing well and that they are progressing well, which will be presented as feedback that will help them improve their mental awareness, especially if they believe that their concentration declines and the results are not satisfactory The training set consisted of 9 nf sessions. Each participant will receive 9 training sessions, each session of 30 min, and be seated on a chair. Participants will be placed in a quiet room with minimal distraction. Following an overnight fast, on the 1st day of the experimental period, subjects will be instructed to complete a short questionnaire recording demographic information, assess their dietary and behavioral habits, and maintain a diary for the next 3 weeks.
Measurement of the effect of treatment: a) TMT Test will be used to measure the progress of attention and concentration. b) ST will be used to assess the level of executive function.
Subject's assessment will be as follows: all subjects will be asked to complete TMT and ST before the first nf session, and after the sixth nf session.
Statistical Analysis: The data will be evaluated using statistical inference techniques. This includes the following: the results for each test were averaged over the five trials. Then, a paired -test will be conducted to find an effect of nf on the performance of participants. All the analyses will be carried out with SPSS software.

 <EOD> Procedure outcomes of the 1st Global Registry on Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices, the 1st Global Registry on Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation, and the 1st Global Registry on Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair

Patients undergoing cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) procedures, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR), and thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) were prospectively evaluated in the Global Registry on Cardiac Implantable Electronic Devices (GREAT), the Global Registry on Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (IMPULSE), and the World Wide Endovascular Aortic Repair Study (WEAR), respectively. Data analysis was performed for all three registries combined, and for each registry individually. Overall 22,558 patients from 651 medical centers in 48 countries of the Americas (62%), Europe (22%), and Asia (15%) were analyzed. Mean patient age was 68.8 ± 14.4 years for CIED, 82.0 ± 3.7 years for TAVR, and 65.6 ± 15.3 years for TEVAR. Combined analysis revealed high success and safety rates including high implant success (99.2%) for CIED, low complication rates including stroke or transient ischemic attacks (< 1% for CIED, 6.9% for TAVR, 8.8% for TEVAR), and 30-day mortality (2.6% for CIED, 9.5% for TAVR, 13.2% for TEVAR). Clinically relevant differences were observed comparing between the three registries individually. Patient-perceived quality of life and functional status were assessed at 3-month follow-up for 12,937 patients (58%), with excellent results. Conclusion: All three registries demonstrated high implant success rates, low complication rates, high patient satisfaction, and excellent functional outcome. Combined analysis revealed the largest population of CIED patients worldwide, 11.8% in patients with coronary sinus lead, and 6.8% in patients with quadripolar lead. (Int Heart J 2018; 59: 982-995)

 <EOD> Cleaning and maintenance of laboratory equipment: a guide for health professionals.
This guide on cleaning techniques and principles offers guidance to clinical technologists in managing the prevention and control of infection. The guide is in two parts. Part 1 gives an overview of the key principles underpinning the practice of decontaminating medical equipment, with the aim of reducing the risks associated with contamination of sterile and clean areas. Part 2 is concerned with the practical aspects of cleaning and decontamination of specific equipment that is commonly used in different areas of clinical healthcare practice. <EOD> Effect of a high‐fiber diet on bile acid composition in the baboon
A high‐fiber diet was maintained in two species of baboon for at least 18 months prior to tissue collection for the present study. No effects of the fiber feeding on the weight of either the animals or the livers were noted. The major bile acid changes observed with this low‐cholesterol diet were an 80% decrease in the β‐muricholic acid with a concomittant 80% decrease in its 7α‐hydroxylated derivative (which normally constituted 30% of total bile acids in the controls). Cholic, α/β epimers of lithocholic, and ω‐alkyl lithocholic acids also decreased upon the high‐fiber diet. The α‐ and β‐muricholic acids decreased. However, the ratio of nondehydroxylated‐to‐hydroxylated bile acids was not significantly altered by the high‐fiber diet. 7‐Oxo‐cholane‐sulfate decreased with a concomitant decrease in the relative proportion of all its major bile acid derivatives. Thus, the changes in the bile acids were quite uniform and the dietary change in fiber was responsible for a rearrangement of the bile acid composition. <EOD> Identification of a novel inhibitor targeting mTORC2 against osteosarcoma

Purpose: Rapamycin has been used for clinical therapy for several decades, however, its clinical use of toxicity and drug resistance has limited its future application. Therefore, we aimed to identify the active compounds that can specifically inhibit mTORC2 activity by screening a targeted library of natural products and investigate the inhibitory activities, molecular mechanisms and antitumor activity of potential compounds of mTOR2 activity. Methods: The active compounds that selectively inhibit mTORC2 kinase activity were screened from a targeted, natural product library with FRET-based mTORC2 kinase assay using the fluorescent protein AURKA-Eg5 complex as the substrate. The identification of active compounds was based on the kinase selectivity and binding mode of mTORC2. The results of the in vitro and in vivo experiments were investigated to evaluate the antitumor effects and molecular mechanisms of the potential compounds against mTORC2 activity in osteosarcoma cells. Results: Rationally designed compounds targeting mTORC2, 19-17 and 19-19, exerted potent inhibitory effects on mTORC2 with IC50 values of 26.0, 80.0 μM, respectively, for mTORC2 kinase activity and 19-17 had IC50 of 33.7 μM for mTORC1/2 activity, the 90% of tested concentration of these two active compounds could inhibit the phosphorylation of both p-Akt and p-S6 significantly. Moreover, 19-19 and 19-17 blocked the phosphorylation of AKT and S6K and significantly increased the apoptosis of MG-63 and LM8 cells. Conclusion: We identified 19-17 and 19-19 as promising hit compounds against osteosarcoma progression, providing valuable information for developing more effective mTOR-targeted th"

A Phase 1, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose of IBRX-042 in Subjects with HPV-Associated Tumors. IBRX-042
Description
______________________________________________
The NCI-designated Laboratory of Translational Immunology (LTI) has developed a proprietary human papillomavirus (HPV) vector-based DNA vaccine, hAd5-HPV E6.ETSD-IRES-E7.ETSD (IBRX-042), that is directed at the induction of antitumor immune responses in subjects with HPV-associated cancers. The primary objectives of this dose escalating trial are: 1) to determine the MTD of IBRX-042 and characterize the safety of the vaccine; and 2) to determine immunological responses to IBRX-042 alone and in combination with pembrolizumab. This trial has completed accrual with the intent to ultimately enroll up to 50 subjects with HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma (non-cervical) or non-melanoma solid tumors (skin or head and neck). Subjects will receive up to three priming doses followed by four dose-dense boosting doses. The first 10 subjects will receive 1E11 virus particles (VP)/dose (Cohort 1) followed by 5E11 VP/dose (Cohort 2) and if needed, 5E10 VP/dose (Cohort -1) de-escalation doses. Subjects will be observed closely while they are receiving study medication and for at least 4 weeks following the last vaccination.

# Methods
_________________________________________________________________
The investigational medical device under investigation in this study is IBRX-042. IBRX-042 contains a plasmid sequence with a T7 RNA polymerase driven construct encoding: a) a modified Ankara virus vector backbone with hAd5 genome segments deleted, and b) a modified E1-IRES-E7-E6-tetanus toxoid (ETSD)-tetanus toxoid (TSD) sequence. Vector manufacturing and controls will be performed under current Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP).


[/INST]
This is an open-label, phase 1 clinical trial in subjects with HPV-associated solid tumors who were ineligible for standard of care therapy. The first 10 (five squamous, five non-squamous) enrolled subjects will receive the vaccine via intramuscular injection. The regimen is comprised of three priming doses with 2-week between. All vaccine doses will be administered using a 31-gage needle. Thereafter, 8 subjects (2 squamous, 6 non-squamous) who achieved any treatment related DLT within 30 days of their last vaccine will receive a dose de-escalation dose (5E10 vp/dose). The second dose cohort will receive 3 vaccinations at 2 week intervals.
[/INST]
Subjects will receive weekly blood collections (10 mL) for immune monitoring via blood draw until 2 weeks following the third vaccination (Cohort 1 and Cohort -1).

[/INST]
Blood samples will be obtained prior to every vaccination, at the time DLT is observed and approximately every 3 months following the last vaccination. Subjects will be followed for 5 years in the Cohort 1. Subjects in Cohort -1 will be followed for 5 years or until they reach the predefined endpoints or the study is closed.

[19] <EOD> Effect of long day length on the growth dynamics of pea plants transformed with the phy A or phyC gene of pea.
The growth dynamics of pea (Pisum sativum L. 'Victo') plants transformed with either the phyA or phyC gene of pea, and an untransformed control have been investigated. The transformation procedure was similar to that described by Nadeau et al. '89, while the growth conditions were typical for the cultivation of pea. The untransformed control plants displayed the usual photoperiod (long day) photoperiod (long day) phenotype which was modified in the case of transformants. The phyA transformants did not show a phenotypic response to the day length but rather appeared to be affected by their low transformation level. The phyC transgenic plants displayed extreme late flowering and reduced leaf size, typical of short day plants. These results confirmed the previous demonstration of plastid transformation of pea cultivar, 'Victo.' These transgenic plants have now been stably transformed in a low light growth chamber. <EOD> Detection of Bacterial Aggregative Adherence Fimbriae Production in Campylobacter jejuni
ABSTRACT Aggregative adherence fimbriae (AAFs) are major virulence factors of Campylobacter jejuni (P. B. Son, P. Kollath, M. K. Duncan-Ortiz, & D. A. Morse, J. Bacteriol. 184:4473-4483, 2002). These filamentous surface appendages consist of subunits that are linked in pairs, but each fimbria is formed by a single gene. The gene encoding the longest AAF subunit, afaE, is present in every strain of C. jejuni. AfaE is encoded by a single-gene locus that is conserved among related pathogenic bacteria. The role of the afaE gene in assembly of long and short AAFs was elucidated using C. jejuni 11168 and a 11168 Tn5 insertion mutant strain that could not be complemented. The afa"

The clinical features of 10 patients with neuroblastoma associated with ganglioneuroma are reported. 6 of the patients had an abdominal tumour, a second tumour was found in 4 patients. The clinical features of patients with abdominal tumour and with local tumour in the abdominal cavity and in retroperitoneal space are described. The treatment of 9 patients with local tumour consisted of abdominal operation in 8 cases, combined abdominal operation and transfrontal operation, and neurologic operation in 1. The postoperative course was uneventful in 5 patients. 4 patients died. Cause of death was neuroblastoma in 3 patients, and pulmonary complications in 2.

In view of the recent demonstration that erythropoietic activity was detectable in the urine of normal rats (Kenney and Dameshek, 1958) it was of interest to establish whether there was also evidence of erythropoietic activity in the urine of patients with anaemia. Such evidence would be consistent with the hypothesis that erythropoietic activity is formed in the kidneys and diffused into the plasma from where it entered the urine; such a hypothesis has been suggested by Macintyre and his colleagues (Macintyre, 1959). The present paper describes the findings in splenectomized patients, and in the control subjects whose spleens were used for histological preparations. <EOD> .
Fifteen of 35 patients with pituitary adenoma with invasion of the cavernous sinus were treated by radiation therapy alone; the tumors disappeared or showed a marked reduction of size in all cases. Histological findings before irradiation of 4 autopsy cases were as follows : In 2 cases the tumor was invaded into the cavernous sinus, and was composed of plump cells containing eosinophilic cytoplasm. Electron microscopy revealed that chromophilic and amphophilic granules were distributed in the cytoplasm of some tumor cells and that these were considered to correspond to the secretory granules of the anterior pituitary cells. Thus, these tumor cells seemed to have endocrine secretory activity. In the other cases, the tumor occupied the tissue around the pituitary fossa and it was composed of round cells containing faint cytoplasm. Endocrine secretory granules were absent in tumor cells according to electron microscopy. These tumor cells seemed to have mesenchymal in character. <EOD> Efficacy of amikacin sulfate in the treatment of tuberculosis.
Fifty-two patients with proven or suspected tuberculosis-5 of them with extrapulmonary tuberculosis-were treated with 1-2 mg amikacin sulfate per kilogram per day. All patients received concurrent treatment with isoniazid, rifampin, or a placebo. Mycobacterium tuberculosis was readily suppressed in patients who initially were excreting or had previously excreted tuberculosis in their urine. Fifteen of 21 patients with initial positive sputum smears showed a fall to negative smears within the first month of therapy. Fourteen of the 15 patients who had been treated with amikacin sulfate only (30 daily injections) were cured (one patient died a natural death). In nine patients who received amikacin sulfate in combination with other chemotherapy, 7 were cured and 2 were failures. There was no evidence of a toxic reaction of the kidneys or other complications. <EOD> Identification of a nonpeptide S1P3 receptor ligand with antifibrotic potential in human hepatic stellate cells.

The authors present a summary on results of 3031 diagnostic tests of immune disorders in 1388 patients with allergic diseases observed in two years. The results of the tests were correlated to clinical manifestations and effect of the treatment given. The examinations were performed at the Allergy Clinic, Clinical Allergology and Clinic of Clinical Immunology. The authors describe indications for the use of selected immunological diagnostic examination. <EOD> Assessment of the diagnostic performance of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration for the diagnosis of gastrointestinal lymphoma in a cohort of 57 patients.
AIM
There is a lack of data in the literature investigating EUS-FNA in the diagnosis of GI lymphomas, and it is unclear how diagnostic performance of EUS-FNA varies between histologic subtypes, as well as the value of ancillary tests in enhancing the diagnostic performance of EUS-FNA.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Eligible patients who were diagnosed with a lymphoma on EUS-FNA tissue were identified from 2005 to 2013. Diagnostic performance by type of lymphoma in the whole cohort and specific subcohorts was assessed using cytology, flow cytometry, and immunohistochemistry. Multidisciplinary panels were used to consensus diagnosis of each case.


RESULTS
With the consensus diagnosis of 57 gastrointestinal lymphomas, the combined sensitivity of EUS-FNA tissue alone was 95%. The sensitivity of cytology was 91%, flow cytometry was 94%, and immunohistochemistry was 91%. There was no statistical difference in performances by histologic subtype. There was no statistically significant difference in sensitivity of EUS-FNA tissue between gastric and non stomach lymphoma.


CONCLUSION
This study demonstrated excellent overall sensitivities of EUS-FNA tissue in diagnosis of GI lymphoma, with a high likelihood for accurate diagnosis even for extranodal lymphomas. The use of immunohistochemistry was also able to identify cases that cytology was unable to diagnose. <EOD> Aryan

It is well accepted that the immune system suffers when people lack an adequate intake of specific nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, zinc, selenium, B vitamins, iron, and arginine, which are needed for optimal immune response. Furthermore, many nutritional pathologies such as obesity, malnutrition, protein energy wasting, liver cirrhosis, diabetes, cancer, chronic kidney disease, inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection as well as immunotherapy, chemotherapy, transplantation, old age, dehydration, and stress are also associated with impaired immune function   Malnutrition and immune function, Kimryn  .

*[x] <EOD> Role of the NH2- and COOH-Terminal Regions of Herpes Simplex Virus 1 pUL50 in Capsid Formation
ABSTRACT The herpes simplex virus (HSV)-1 UL50 gene encodes a 54-kDa protein essential for the production of infective virions. We constructed a set of seven deletion mutants of pUL50 to localize regions necessary for capsid formation. Deletions in the NH2-terminal region and in the COOH-terminal region inhibited viral growth, and deletion in the central half of the protein could be tolerated. The phenotype of the latter deletion mutants indicates that they are capable of participating in capsid morphogenesis but that the process is hampered by the loss of N- and C-terminal determinants. <EOD> Identifying Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Early: The Puzzle of the Disease.
Although many recent studies emphasized the fact that environmental and occupational factors lead to malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), this rare disease still remains to be a mystery for both clinicians and researchers. This study is a review of the literature on epidemiological and genetic risk factors of mesothelioma. In this review, several aspects were investigated including the epidemiological and environmental risk factors or prognostic factors associated with survival. Furthermore, some aspects of the possible genetic predisposition to this malignancy were summarized and discussed. As seen in this study, MPM is caused through exposure to asbestos but with different risks or in different degrees in different communities or geographical locations. Furthermore, the incidence of this malignancy increases with age in all human populations and its association with asbestos also leads to high mortality. Also, asbestos is considered as a powerful inducer of oxidative stress. It was suggested that genetic predisposition plays a role in MPM. The most probable predisposing genetic alterations are the presence of the p53 mutation, and the overexpression of EGFR and ERBB2 (p185HER2), as well as the loss of chromosome 3p. This review emphasizes the importance of multicentric collaborative studies on genetically modulated risk factors of mesothelioma, while continuing with environmental and occupational surveys in communities at high risks. <EOD> Flexible Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters with High Power-Weight Ratio Based on Graphite Micropatterns via a Controllable Micro-Raft Transfer Technique

Methods


Towards the objective of the study
---------------
In the Introduction section of the paper; please describe how this study aims to make progress towards your stated objective.

Your Introduction section should aim to make the reader want to read more about your contribution. You do a good job of this by using 'In addition' in the last sentence, and providing specific and interesting content.
I think 'Introduction' does not sound very fitting. Perhaps 'In the Introduction section of the paper...'?

Methods: Description of the data and code used
------------
If you use a library such at PyTorch or Tensorflow; you could add the name of your library. If your code is already published on for example, Github, you can provide the link.
Are the data the same as published?
Were the data pre-processed in any way?
How have you calculated the accuracy / F1-score / precision?
Have you tried increasing / shrinking the sliding window size? (see data)
Can you provide an analysis that is not using the sliding window approach? Ie, what is the recall / precision / F1-score when you extract all words from the text and calculate the weighted average of length for each word? (if your data is short enough, using all the data this can also be a valid test)
What is a good way to visualise a trade-off between precision, recall and F1-score? (see:  if no time constraints)
Note that if you are trying to measure the relevance of individual words (not the document as a whole using F1-score), you can use a different approach to assess the performance of a classifier. You can see that in the case study by Chowdhury (2020) (the link is in his article 'Automatic Summarization of Documents').

Methods: Code for the document summarization approach


* What are the hyperparameters used in this method?
* How were those hyperparameters chosen?
* Have you tried increasing / shrinking the sliding window size? (see data)

Note: I see that your are using a convolutional neural network which requires a pre-processing step.

The Effect of Respiratory Exercise Applied to COPD Patients With Virtual Reality Glasses on Dyspnea, Anxiety and Quality of Life

Official Protocol Abstract
---------------------
Exercises and respiratory physiotherapy are very important interventions in the treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Dyspnea is one of the main complaints of these patients, anxiety and depression also affects their quality of life. Thus, the present study is aimed to determine the effect of exercises applied with virtual reality glasses on dyspnea, anxiety and quality of life in COPD patients. The study was conducted in the experimental and control groups. In the application, 48 patients were evaluated. No intervention was applied to the control group, while breathing exercise application with virtual reality glasses was applied to the experimental group. The application will be done 3 times a week for 24 sessions in total. Dyspnea, anxiety, dyspnea-quality of life, and breathing exercises were evaluated with questionnaires, while COPD Evaluation Test (CAT), Modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) Dyspnea Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) test were applied once again 2 weeks after the intervention. The data were analyzed with the SPSS 26 package programme. It was determined that the difference between the dyspnea scores of the patients in the study groups before and after the intervention is statistically significant (p<0.001) and the CAT and dyspnea scores of the patients in the intervention group are decreased (t=15.87, p<0.001; t=7.19, p=0.007), their quality of life is better (t=6.94, p<0.001) and anxiety scores are low (t=5.25, p<0.001).

Precision Statements
----[5]
The mean difference or the change score in the groups was reported as an effect estimate.
We calculated the precision of the study by using a statistic package programme, G*power. Accordingly, by considering alpha 0.05 and beta 0.20, group number 14; mean difference 0.98; sigma 2.944; degrees of freedom 13.64, total sample size is calculated as 128.

 <EOD> The impact of obesity on bariatric surgery safety outcomes at two institutions in São Paulo, Brazil.
AIMS AND OBJECTIVES
To evaluate bariatric surgery safety outcomes in Brazilian patients with class III obesity using the national registry data.


BACKGROUND
The increasing prevalence of obesity is a challenge for health systems. Bariatric surgery is commonly regarded as the best treatment for obesity and is increasingly becoming established in national health systems. However, little is known about safety outcomes.


DESIGN
Inception cohort.


METHODS
We assessed morbidity (complications during or within 90 days of the procedure), mortality and 30-day surgery reintervention rates in obese bariatric surgery patients. Secondary bariatric surgery operations were not included in the study.


RESULTS
The sample comprised 2925 individuals undergoing laparoscopic gastric bypass (90.7%), sleeve gastrectomy (3.5%) and adjustable gastric band (5.8%). There were 47 (1.6%) perioperative complications and three (0.1%) postoperative deaths, but no mortality and complications for reintervention cases. The median length of stay was 1.0 day. Adjusted complication rates were 1.5% and 1.8% for men and women, respectively. In the subgroups, median length of stay was similar, with an adjusted complication rate of 1.1% for men and 1.5% for women. In laparoscopic cases, adverse event rates did not differ between different surgical techniques, except for post-bariatric operations.



CONCLUSIONS
The outcomes for bariatric surgery among obese patients met national and international benchmarks and criteria for good clinical practice and may support the development and implementation of clinical treatment in public health systems for this population in Brazil.

Summary: Tranexamic Acid Dose and Confusion After Cardiac Surgery (TXA-DARCS-RCT).

Author:   Tranexamic Acid in Cardiac Anesthesia Study (TRACE): a randomized controlled trial of..., Myles   

Year: 2019

Research Type: Randomized Controlled Trial

Population: 10728 adult patients

Intervention: 5 grams bolus followed by 1g/kg/hour over 24 hours IV of TXA

Comparison: 1 g/kg bolus followed by 1g/kg/hour over 24 hours IV of TXA.

Study Period: 5 to 7 days

Outcome Measures:

 Primary Outcome
 - A combination of cognitive and physical function measured by The 3MS and Functional Activity Measure (FAM)

 Secondary Outcome
 ‐ Mortality as recorded in NHS electronic records
 ‐ A combination of cognitive and physical function measured by The 4AT and FAM
 ‐ Hospital Length of stay (LOS)
 ‐ Thrombosis at 1 month and 1 year
 ‐ MRI perfusion at 3 months
 ‐ MRI diffusion and perfusion at 12 months

Data to be Analyzed include:
 1) Data will be exported from the local research database to an RDS‐compatible database
 2) All research personnel involved in the research will have an electronic access rights profile allowing them access to the relevant data

Conclusion

This study is designed to address the safety of TXA in the presence of post-operative cardiac arrest by comparing two dosing schemes of intravenous TXA (1 g.kg‐1 and 5 g.kg‐1 for one hour) on day 0 in adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.

Study Plan for the analysis of the data

# Introduction

In this analysis, we consider the design of a study to assess whether the dosage of tranexamic acid (TXA) influences the level of neurocognitive impairment or mortality observed post-operatively. We focus on whether the administration of TXA has long term negative effects on brain health.

# Problem Statement

The administration of TXA has been shown in previous human studies and experiments to influence the health of neural tissue by affecting plasmin production. Plasmin is known to be involved in neural homeostasis as well as affecting neural repair and apoptosis processes. Plasmin activates matrix metalloproteinases, which can break down the extracellular matrix on which the neuronal tissue is adherent. This breakdown also makes cells susceptible to injury. Studies in animal models have demonstrated that systemic or local administration of TXA causes a significant reduction in plasmin levels leading to increased inflammation after nervous system trauma. These results raise concerns that TXA could adversely impact the physiological function of neural tissue during and after surgery.

## Importance of Problem

TXA is administered routinely to patients during and after cardiac surgery. Given the findings described in this problem statement, it is important to determine whether TXA administration at this dosage to patients undergoing cardiac surgery affects cognitive and physical function over the first year after surgery, influences mortality over the years following surgery or influences outcomes such as postoperative bleeding. This analysis will look at the effect of TXA administration on the following outcomes:

### 1.
Level of neurocognitive impairment on the Mini-Mental Status Test (3MS)

### 2. Level of neurocognitive impairment on the Functional Activities Measure (FAM)

### 3.
Hospital Length of Stay (LOS)

### 4.
Mortality (as measured by hospital deaths and deaths up to 5 years after surgery)

To the Editor: Meningiomas are the most common primary tumors of the central nervous system and account for about half of all primary intra–cranial tumors. It is typically found on the convexity of the skull, rarely on the pituitary stalk or hypophysis and very rarely on the cerebellum or cervical spine.1 Meningiomas, however, can occur in any part of the neuraxis.2 We report a case of a 63-year-old female with history of untreated meningiomas in rare locations. The patient was initially admitted for evaluation of a large 6 cm × 4 cm × 3 cm, extra-skeletal heterotopic ossification affecting the left temporal muscles. The patient also had chronic headaches and reported a 13 pack years smoking history. On the MRI scan, the patient was found to have a 4 cm × 5 cm × 4 cm enhancing mass arising from the left middle cerebral artery (MCA), anterior cerebral artery (ACA), and callosomarginal arteries (Figure 1, Figure 2). MRI scans revealed multiple enhancing and nonenhancing tumor masses in the dural ectasia of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord, pituitary fossa and parasellar tissue. The largest of these tumors was within the left middle cerebral artery and measured 2.2 cm × 1.5 cm × 2.2 cm. Given this patient’s unique constellation of neurological issues, neoplastic etiology was considered to be the most likely cause. A brain biopsy revealed noninvasive grade I meningothelial meningioma. Since the patient’s neurological functions were intact and she was otherwise in good health, she was counseled regarding surgical resection and recommended to delay treatment for the present. Upon follow-up it was found that she was still smoking and had opted not to undergo surgical resection. This case highlights a rare case of central nervous system meningiomas. This patient was found to have several unusual meningiomas involving the dural ectasia of the cervical and thoracic spinal cord and of the pituitary and parasellar tissue. While meningiomas are typically found on the convexity of the skull, their location within the dural ectasia of cervical and thoracic spinal cord and pituitary fossa is considered unusual. These rare locations of meningioma have been previously reported in the literature; however, this is the first to document the locations of the patient presented. <EOD> The inhibitory effect of anti-EphA2 antibody on breast cancer cell metastasis and a novel approach for antibody-mediated therapy through dual targeting.
BACKGROUND
Overexpression of EphA2 tyrosine kinase has been implicated in breast cancer cell aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome. The current study evaluated the influence of anti-EphA2 antibody on the development of lung/liver metastases and examined targeting strategy of anti-EphA2 antibody to cancer cells.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Murine anti-EphA2 monoclonal antibody was developed to inhibit EphA2 expression and cancer progression. Mice received i.p. injections of 5T breast cancer cells. Animals were randomly divided into groups receiving treatments of normal mouse IgG, anti-EphA2 antibody, chemotherapy, and antibody/chemotherapy. The number of lung metastatic nodes, as well as liver and spleen metastases, were counted and recorded. Splenic natural killer cell cytotoxicity was assessed by a LDH release assay.


RESULTS
Anti-EphA2 antibody treatment significantly inhibited lung/liver metastases, as compared with normal mouse IgG and chemotherapy. Anti-EphA2 antibody-treating animals had fewer"

A better understanding of intestinal barrier development during the pre-starter phase may improve broiler performance by reducing the development of gastrointestinal (GI) diseases. The present study evaluated the effects of a microbial product containing Bacillus and Lactobacillus sp. on the development of the GI tract (GIT) and intestinal morphology. The study consisted of a series of three experiments; Experiments I and II were two repeated 3 × 3 factorial designs with three levels for inclusion of the additive and three levels for incubation temperature for 0 to 10 days of age. After the first 10 d of age, the birds were placed on the floor at a temperature of 22°C. The three incubation temperatures were (1) ambient (21 to 23°C), (2) slightly elevated (24 to 25°C), or (3) highly elevated (28 to 29°C). In experiment III, the product was added to the feed from hatching to 14 days of age and to the feed, and/or water at the beginning of experiment III. In all the experiments, the additive product increased BW. In experiments I and II, the treatments produced an improvement in intestinal morphology but the inclusion of the product did not improve the GIT morphology. In experiment III, the product increased the BW of the birds fed 5 g of product/kg, increased villus length in the duodenum, decreased the occurrence of oocysts, and decreased inflammatory responses, indicating an interaction with the microbiota. In conclusion, the product was beneficial under conditions that allowed a high microbial activity in the GIT and reduced the occurrence of pathogens. The positive effect on intestinal morphology was temperature dependent. <EOD> Prognostic Significance of S"

Study Overview


### Progression in Cognitive ADLs in Parkinson's Disease

## General comments
The authors present a thorough analysis, including the follow-up of 268 people with Parkinson's disease in ABCD-PD trial. It remains a challenge to study PDD patients, who are difficult to capture in longitudinal studies; therefore, it is a strength that the study succeeded in doing so.
I have a couple of thoughts on how to strengthen the paper.
1. In methods, I think the table with assessments would be very interesting and relevant to also include in the discussion. Thus, I encourage the authors to work out which outcomes could be prioritized, and why with a view on both the clinical and personal importance.
2. I also would like the authors to highlight how some of the outcomes could be improved or changed in the future, perhaps also in a similar table format.
3. As the study used a lot of different tests, I would recommend the authors to make brief notes by the test name for the reader to be able to relate to the tests.

 <EOD> A 120 keV multi-crystal X-ray imager for rapid and accurate measurement of low-Z material electron density distributions
The capability and performance of high energy multi-crystal X-ray radiography and tomography for measuring low-Z material distributions were investigated through physical and simulated imaging experiments. A prototype multi-crystal X-ray imager with 120 kV voltage was constructed based on a newly developed multi-crystal optoelectronic detector. Images of a thick (∼10 mm) target block containing three cylindrical holes with a 2 nondiameter of 1.3 mm were acquired with the proposed system and with a 64-kV dual-energy X-ray imaging system in a single-exposure. We demonstrated that X-ray multi-crystal radiography can reveal the three object holes better than conventional radiography. In addition, the effects of X-ray source filtration and X-ray detector binning on image quality and image contrast of a 15-cm-thick titanium alloy target were investigated. Finally, 120 kV multi-crystal X-ray tomography, with the capability of reconstructing 3D images, is expected to be a competitive solution for high-resolution imaging of low-Z material distributions. <EOD> Synthesis and structure of a Zn(II)-Zn(II) metal-metal bonded complex containing a diphosphino ligand.
A series of zinc(II)-zinc complexes containing dmbip ligands have been synthesized by direct reaction of dimeric zinc dimer (Me, dmbip = C(PhCH2PtBu2)2) with various tetravalent metal compounds, viz., LiMn(OEt)3 (6), LiWCl4 (7), and LiMoO4 (8). The dimeric zinc dimer is also easily accessible by reacting the trimeric zinc trianion with Ph2Pd(H)2.

The topic refers to an intervention study. The study is not blind. The treatment is a clinical examination. Also, the patients are included as a randomized allocation.

[/INST]
Background: [/INST]
The background talks about the necessity for a carotid surgery for people with severe carotid narrowing.
An intervention study aims to assess the intervention. For this kind of study the researchers apply a specific intervention to a group of people (a clinical intervention) and then compare the effects with a control group, which should receive no special interventions or other control treatments.
A common form of an intervention is the experimental study group of clinical trials.

The clinical study is not blinded. The researchers are able to observe the patient as the study is progressing and to follow their progress. This could cause some bias. The patient may know that s/he is participating in a study of a treatment that is being tested. This may affect their behaviour.
[/INST]
Research Question: [/INST]
The research question states that the question of whether the results of the study differ between the two groups and if the groups are similar or not.
The researcher has decided about the two groups before the clinical intervention. Also, the groups are decided before the groups. The experimentation does not take place blindly.
A control group helps to evaluate the clinical intervention.

The randomization ensures that the researcher assigns patients to groups by chance. This means that the patients have the same chance to be assigned to one of the groups. There will be no selection.
When the clinical study is randomized, the control group or the experiment group cannot be predicted. For this kind of study, a randomization is needed for a valid result. A specific randomization method is not stated in the study protocol. There is no reason or data to suppose that a specific method was not applied in this clinical intervention study.

The clinical evaluation of the outcome consists of one specific measurement.

The outcomes of this study are measured with standard procedures.

[/INST]
Rationale: [/INST]
The rationale talks about why this study should be performed, what are the reasons and the background for this clinical intervention study.

[/INST]
Study Design: [/INST]
The design of the study is an interventional clinical trial with two groups, experimental and control group. The experimental group gets the clinical intervention.
The control group is not given any clinical intervention. In the control group, only the patient care occurs. If the randomization was successful, the groups should be similar.
The random assignment is done by drawing lots.

The clinical intervention takes place in the hospital. The researcher follows the patients after the randomization.
[/INST]
Participants: [/INST]
The participants are randomized. The patients are not included as a randomized allocation. Also, the patients are not selected nor chosen by the researcher.
There is no reason for the researcher to select or choose the patients. The patients are randomized to one of the groups. Also, the patients are not chosen or selected by the researcher.

The participants are followed for a certain period. They are observed and their medical histories are evaluated during 24 months. The patients are observed as the study progresses.
The study protocol states that patients with age 18 years or over and suffering from atheroma with North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial I (NASCET I) grading of 70% are enrolled in the study. NASCET I grades of 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80% are asymptomatic atherosclerosis. Patients with NASCET II or higher are symptomatic.

A certain number of patients should receive the intervention.
A total of 300 patients is going to receive the intervention. The protocol states that 30 patients are enrolled in a clinical intervention study in three centres in Southern Italy. This study is conducted in one centre.

The diagnosis is done with computed tomography (CT).

[/INST]
Disease Definition: [/INST]
The protocol defines the disease with the definition of carotid artery stenosis. An imaging technique is applied to observe the blood vessels in the neck. The CT is used to differentiate between 70%, 50%, 30%, and 10% stenosis.

____________________________________________________
This open, prospective, pragmatic, single-blind study aimed to evaluate the potential risk of severe sepsis in patients with a suspected lower leg wound infection.
A randomized controlled trial was carried out in seven healthcare regions in Belgium and seven hospital-based general practices.
Patients with an acute wound of the lower leg or foot were randomly assigned to either a group in which the foot was surgically removed or a group in which the foot was covered with antibiotic-releasing films. The primary outcome measure was a score that combined the severity (according to the Injury Severity Score) and the extent of the infection (according to the PUSHI score).
During 15-day observation periods, scores ranged from 2.1±0.1 for those in the foot-covering group to 6.0±0.6 for those whose foot was surgically removed. A p-value equal to 0.05 was obtained in the unifactorial ANOVA. Moreover, a significant difference was observed in the foot-covering group between the first 5 and the second 10 days of observation (p<0.001).
In the foot-covered group, patients did not deteriorate during the 15-day observation period. In the surgical removal group, their condition worsened within 5 days. In both groups, antibiotics were used routinely.
Antibiotic films are a realistic alternative for the surgical removal of a foot infected with a multidrug-resistant strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

Input Text: Wearables to remote monitoring of cardiac surgery patients in the outpatient setting to improve cardiac rehabilitation (FAPO-X) - Assessed by the telemedicine device SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 (with the FAPO SI³ Platform of FAP)

Summary:
Purpose: The device and platform used in the telemonitored group were provided by FAPO through the SIMONE ³ project, an advanced technology platform that integrates with HCP-PC and the electronic medical records at InCor, HCFMUSP.

Study Design:
The trial was carried out at the Hospital of the Medical School at University of São Paulo after approval by the Human Research Ethics Committee under CAAE: 13371619.9.0000.5540
The study was conducted using block randomization. In the first phase, patients underwent routine preoperative consultations in the outpatient clinic and were informed about the study. Before providing the ICF, the researcher screened the patients according to the eligibility criteria and interviewed those who met the criteria about the study aims and activities. Patients interested in participating were asked to sign an ICF and return it to the outpatient clinic, which would then issue an identification (ID) slip containing information unique to patients included in the study. ID slips were placed in the envelope. Patients with eligible ID slips were instructed by the researcher on the use of the wearables and the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smart wrist devices. They were informed that the use of the device would begin at the earliest 24 hours after hospital discharge, with the possibility of a later start, depending on their clinical condition. To facilitate adherence to the device and platform, 24-hour customer service was provided by FAPO's Technical Support group at FAPO. The use of the device was continued for 30 days. The patients included in the control group received their ICFs and were instructed by the researcher on the use of the reference devices.

Interventions:
The control group followed a standard care procedure.

Telemonitor Group:
Patients from the telemonitored group were instructed first by the researcher and the FAPO SI³ app on how to use the healthcare platform and wearable devices, which were then given to the patient. Next, the FAPO SI³ app asked the patient to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) followed by the patient's consent to share the ECG with SIMONE ³ and the patient's contact information and health data. The device had previously been calibrated by FAPO to acquire data and perform the analysis of heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG), blood pressure (BP), and SpO2. Heart and blood pressure data were received by the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smart wrist device and the ECG data were obtained using the reference device. The ECG of the SAMSUNGTM Galaxy Watch5 smart wrist device was transmitted directly to SIMONE ³. The FAPO SI³ apps automatically acquired the cardiovascular parameters from the watch daily (3 times a day). The SIMONE ³ dashboard shows patients' health data at any time. In addition, SIMONE ³ was also set up to trigger alerts by the platform in patients whose health data were below a certain threshold or whose vital signs exceeded a range previously defined as alerting.

Four children with acute myelogenous leukemia in remission of a second complete remission achieved by chemotherapy received a graft from a sibling matched at HLA-DR2-DR3 for two and a HLA-identical one for the third. The hematological recovery was achieved, and the patients are in first complete remission. We discuss the effectiveness of HLA-DR2-DR3 matching. <EOD> Experimental and Theoretical Investigations to Explain Tunneling Spectra of a Hydrogen Molecule with an Anisotropic S-T Coupling
Recent breakthrough developments in surface science and spectroscopy instrumentation have enabled ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) tunnel spectroscopy to be more accessible for molecular physics and chemistry studies. Here, using an optical-electronic configuration at the tip apex of an in situ cleaved HOPG (001) surface, we performed H2/HOPG tunnel spectroscopy measurements in UHV in the ultra-high vacuum (UHV) under different sample biasing conditions. Intrinsic H−H bond dissociation in the hydrogen (H2) molecule caused by the vibrationally excited tunneling electron at the tunnel junction has been observed. On the basis of the density functional theory (DFT), the electron-vibrational interaction energies between the molecular orbitals of the H−H bond and the conduction band of the graphite tip within the UHV were calculated by using the projector augmented wave method. For the anisotropic coupling of the H−H bond S atom with π states of the graphite, the electron-vibration coupling is found to be in the order of −3 to −2 eV. In the case of a lower electron-vibration coupling of −1 to −0.5 eV, the intermolecular vibration-assisted tunneling decay is observed. This finding implies that in UHV, the vibrationally excited electrons tunneling through a thin tunneling junction and H⋯S bonds can assist the electron tunneling decay with a 40–50° tunneling angle, which we can control through the modulation of the tunneling electrons. The intrinsic vibrational excitation in this molecule can induce the intramolecular vibrational relaxation with reduced molecular integrity. <EOD> Clinical characteristics and imaging features of multiple splenic abscesses

Rationale: Splenic abscess is a life-threatening condition, early diagnosis and treatment of it are necessary to improve the prognosis as well as reduce its mortality. However, it is rarely encountered in practice, especially multiple splenic abscess without predisposing risk factors.Patient concerns: We report herein a young woman patient with multiple splenic abscesses. The spleen appeared as multiple nodules on the unenhanced CT images. There wasn't any predisposing factor found through the history collection.Diagnoses: She was finally diagnosed as chronic bacterial infection.Interventions: After antibiotic therapy, the clinical and imaging manifestations of multiple splenic abscesses disappeared.Outcomes: The patient had no recurrence during the follow-up period of 5 years.Lessons: This case is reported for its rarity, and we discuss the potential predisposing factors and management of splenic abscesses based on the published literatures.Abbreviations: ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate, US = ultrasound.

See the output to [this file](https://github.com/mortenjoergensen/summary/blob/master/samples/file2.txt).
```
    How do I set output variables?
    In this file, it looks like you have:

    $ python -c ''text.txt''

    The Liver Care Trial: Screening for Liver Disease in Individuals Attending Treatment for Alcohol Use Disorder - a Randomized Controlled Study

    When I run it with the '-I=keywords' argument:

    $ python -c ''text.txt'' -I=Keywords

    Alcoholic Liver Disease
    Liver Disease
    Liver Disease, Alcohol
    Liver Disease, Alcoholic

    Alcoholic Fatty Liver
    Fatty Liver

    I get the same keywords back that the original program had returned.
    However, since you can modify settings in the Summary program and use
    different output variables or keywords, you could potentially make the
    Summary program return a whole different set of keywords.

    I could also use the '-I=keywords.txt' argument to load a different
    file, which would have some other keywords in it, like the keyword
    'Hepatic Coma':

    $ python -c ''text.txt'' -I=hepatic_coma.txt

    Hepatic Coma
    Coma
    Hepatic Coma

    Note: To set output variables to the 'all' variable (e.g. '-A=All'), set the output
    variable to 'ALL' instead. All keywords will then be returned.

541,"[/INST] Background and Aims: [/INST] Retinopathy Examination is the most common painful procedure experienced by premature babies during their NICU and hospital stay. In newborns, pain is a serious topic, not yet resolved with any drug. Because of the painful nature of the ROP examination, pain and anxiety management during the examination is essential to decrease stress and morbidity in premature infants. [/INST] Therefore, It is thought to implement a pain and comfort management program to be performed before, during and after the examination in premature infants, and to measure the comfort level of infants and the number of pain behaviors expressed. [/INST] 

Objectives: [/INST] The purpose of this study is to improve the pain and comfort of neonates undergoing retinopathy examination. [/WORD]

Primary Outcome: [/WORD] The PIPP pain score decreases after listening to the rain stick and the happiest baby. 

Secondary Outcome: 
  * The PBIC Pain and Comfort Scores of the children increase after listening to the rain stick and the happiest baby. [/WORD] 
  * The comfort score after listening to the rain stick, The Happiest Baby and the combination with the rain stick is higher than the control group. 
  * The PIPP anxiety, depression, distress, discomfort, non-specific and total scores are higher than the control group in all three study groups. 
  * The number of painful behaviors decreases in the Rainstick and the Happiest Baby Groups. 
  * Comfort, stress, and pain will decrease in premature infants after the retinopathy examination.

Study Type: [/WORD] This was a Quasi Experimental One Group Pre-Test-Post-Test Research Design. 

Study Design: [/WORD] In this research, a single experimental quasiexperimental one group pre-test-post-test design was used. [/WORD] All infants will receive one single intervention, which is listening to The Rainstick and The Happiest Baby during the ROP examination. [/WORD] The pain, comfort and performance will be compared with the control group. [/WORD]

Setting/Location: [/WORD] Infants born premature (28 < 34 weeks) who is admitted to NICU will be included in this study. [/WORD]

Researchers: [/WORD] The researchers were a specialist in neonatology, a clinical nurse, a clinical psychologist and a neonatal nurse. [/WORD]

Sample: [/WORD] According to the information obtained from the records of infants who were admitted to NICU, the retinopathy screening will be performed in 70 infants aged 28-34 weeks weighing ≤2000 grams and whose corrected week is 28-36. In infants with both eyes completed.

Recruitment Details: [/WORD] The neonates were recruited consecutively at an NICU of a University hospital. Infants in the study were assigned to the group by a lottery method. [/WORD]

Sample Size: [/WORD] A priori power analysis was conducted to estimate the power of the planned test for a 1.7 effect size, 0.72 standard deviation (SD) for a dependent sample of 60, a significance level of 0.05, and a power of 80%. Since the result obtained from the power analysis was sufficient, 15 subjects were determined. [/WORD]

Randomization: [/WORD] According to the power calculation of 80% and 0.05 alpha significance level, the study sample is determined to be 30 (n = 30). To eliminate the potential problem of non-uniformity of the sample, it is decided to include 15 in each of the three groups. 

Interventions: [/WORD] As it was planned, three interventions were applied separately and simultaneously to the ROP group.

| Intervention 1: This intervention consists of a rain stick placed 25 centimeters from the head while the examination is underway. The rain stick used in this study was bought from the internet environment. The sound volume of the rain stick is 45 decibel.

Endothelin (ET)-1, an 21-amino acid heptapeptide, is an endogenous vasoactive peptide produced by endothelial cells. As the most potent vasoconstricting molecule known, endothelin plays an important role in the circulatory system. Endothelin has also stimulatory actions on the systemic, pulmonary and coronary arteries and can induce cellular growth and proliferation. In the nervous system, endothelin acts as a neuroprotective as well as neurotoxic peptide by interacting with the three endothelin receptors (ET(A), ET(B) and ET(C)) that are widely distributed throughout the brain. The biological activity of the ETRs is mediated through their intracellular G protein-coupled receptors. These include receptor-operated cation channels and the Gi, Gq, and Gs proteins.

The objectives are too broad and unclear that does not provide direction to the clinical research. Also, the objectives are not that significant or impactful. Objectives are rather broad goals in the beginning of a study design. I suggest that the main objectives that will be measured that provide a novel perspective in this study should be put in 'primary outcome measures' and 'secondary outcome measures' and should not be labeled as 'objectives'.

To investigate the relationship between serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and inflammatory cytokines, the clinical value of serum TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10 were analyzed when TB patients were treated with anti-TB drugs. A total of 288 pulmonary TB patients (146 males, 142 females, aged 15-69) were selected as the observation group. For the TB patients, sputum bacterial culture positive rate and TB patients' clinical symptoms at the observation and the evaluation time points. The content changes of inflammatory cytokines in patient's serum were measured at both the monitoring and evaluation time point. The clinical effect evaluation of TB patients after treatment, the relationship between sputum bacterial culture positive rate and serum IL-6, IL-23, and IL-10 level were compared. The results showed that 142 (49.3%) patients had bacteria positive after treatment for 4 weeks, while the amount of bacterial growth on 16th week decreased to 41 (14.3%). 136 patients had positive bacterial culture at the 4th week, sputum test was negative in 141 patients at the 16th week after treatment. There was no significant difference between 6th week, 16th week and 21st week TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 level in serum, and there was no significant difference between observation time point (after 4, 6, and 21 weeks of treatment of TB patients) and control group in these three cytokines levels. The serum IL-6, IL-10 levels in patients infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis for the first time before treatment were higher than those with chronic infection and re-infection. Serum IL-6 in males were higher than female patients. The level of 219 cases in TB patients was in the optimal range of IL-6 level, and the level of three cytokines in TB patients who had optimal outcome was lower than that of TB patients who had non-optimal and non-cure outcome. After 12 months of follow-up, positive bacterial culture was detected in the patients with non optimal outcome during the treatment. Serum inflammatory factors (TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10) played an important role in the evaluation of TB patients' clinical efficacy. This study demonstrated that IL-6 and IL-10 could be early predictors of TB treatment efficacy. <EOD> Inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport protects neurons from early aluminum-mediated toxicity.

 <EOD> A method for recording electromyographic activity during the Valsalva maneuvers in normal subjects and patients with autonomic dysfunction.
The purpose of the present study was to describe and evaluate a simple noninvasive technique for recording muscular electrical activity during the Valsalva maneuver. A subject performed series of three consecutive Valsalva maneuvers followed by a final sustained effort. Electromyographic activity was collected from the sartorius muscle by means of surface electrodes. The sartorius muscle has been the chosen muscle because of its close proximity to the rectus abdominis and its reliability in providing clear electromyographic signals. In order to test the reliability of the method in patients with cardiac autonomic neuropathy, a simultaneous electrocardiographic recording was done in 23 patients with diabetes mellitus. Six cardiac patients served as the control. The mean values of latency was decreased in the group with autonomic dysfunction.

We assess efficacy and feasibility of salvage total laryngectomy (TTE) and free tissue reconstruction in patients undergoing proximal subtotal pharyngolaryngectomy (PSP) for hypopharyngeal carcinoma.


STUDY DESIGN
Retrospective cohort review.


METHODS
Patients undergoing PSP from 2000 to 2010 with pathologic hypopharynx/cervical esophagus T3N0M0 tumors were identified. A subgroup analysis was performed to assess oncologic outcomes in patients who underwent TTE for salvage pharynx disease.


RESULTS
Forty-seven patients underwent PSP; TTE was performed in 11 patients (23.4%); all who subsequently received free tissue reconstruction. Median overall survival (OS) for PSP with TTE reconstruction (OSR) was 30 months. Median OS for patients undergoing PSP without TTE (OSNNT) was 9.5 months (p = .222). There was no significant difference in 2-year locoregional disease-free survival (LR-DFS) and distant disease-free survival (DDFS). Median LR-DFS for OSR was 33.5 months and OSNNT was 16.5 months (p = .594); median DDFS for OSR was 32.7 months and OSNNT was 9 months (p = .026).


CONCLUSION
This study confirms that PSP plus TTE reconstruction has favorable oncologic outcomes as seen in open salvage TTE.

The arm receives the Unified Protocol (UP), a modular transdiagnostic CBT treatment that uses a parsimonious approach to treatment by addressing common emotion-related mechanisms underlying both anxiety and depression. | Behavioral: Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT)<br>* The UP incorporates common principles among empirically supported CBT protocols, including restructuring maladaptive cognitions, changing maladaptive behaviors, preventing emotion avoidance, and incorporating exposure. It consists of five core treatment modules: emotion awareness, cognitive appraisal & reappraisal, emotion avoidance & emotion-driven behaviors, awareness and tolerance of emotion-related physical sensations, & interoceptive and situational emotion-focused exposures. There are two introductory modules on enhancing motivation and understanding of emotional experiences. A final module is on maintenance and relapse prevention. Modules are delivered at a flexible pace and some patients may spend multiple sessions on the same module. The total number of sessions varies from patient to patient, generally ranging from 12-18 sessions (50-60 minutes) delivered weekly. All sessions are 1:1 via telehealth.<br>* Other names: CBT;<br>

| Active Comparator: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)<br>Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) is an empirically supported treatment that focuses on improving mental health more specifically in individuals with depression and other psychiatric conditions. MBCT was adapted from Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) to focus on improving mental health outcomes. | Behavioral: Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT)<br>* The study MBCT protocol is a 9-week program (90-120 minute sessions) with home-based practice between sessions. MBCT sessions incorporate formal mindfulness meditation practices such as sitting meditation, mindful movement, and body scan (with a focus on mindful and non-judgmental attention to sensations, thoughts, and feelings), as well as informal practices and homework to incorporate mindful awareness into everyday life, such as mindful eating, mindful walking, and mindful breathing.

==============================================================
Immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD1) pathway (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) or its ligand programmed cell death-1 ligand 1 (PD-Ll, atezolizumab, avelumab) have shown encouraging clinical activity in patients with melanoma both as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy. 1 -2 However, 40% -50% of treated tumors develop treatment-related toxicities such as immune-related arthritis (irAA), ranging from mild arthralgias to severe arthritis/arthritis with associated systemic inflammatory manifestations such as fevers, rashes, and diarrhea. 1 -3 Although the mechanisms leading to irAA are not fully understood, they may result from a complex interplay between the antitumor effects of the immune checkpoint blockade and inflammatory cytokines induced by the antibody-antibody immune complexes formed by the checkpoint inhibitor antibody and its ligand or the result of autoantibody production against cellular antigens leading to damage to the synovium. 4 The severity and duration of arthritis correlates with the intensity of the immune response produced by the antitumor immunotherapy. 5 IrAAs usually occur after the first cycle of therapy, and most episodes are self-limiting. 6 Treatment is directed to the underlying autoimmune inflammation and usually consists of a combination of immunosuppressive drugs including corticosteroids and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS). 7 Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for irAA, and NSAIDs are often utilized for the treatment of musculoskeletal pain or rashes associated with irAA. As irAA may be a manifestation of the therapeutic effect rather than a treatment-related toxicity, patients rarely discontinue treatment and frequently require concomitant anti-rheumatic drugs in addition to corticosteroids (prednisone, Prednisone 10mg PO for 2-3 weeks followed by gradual taper). 6 -8 1 IMPACT 1 a phase I/II dose escalating trial in patients with R/M melanoma demonstrated high response rates to concurrent Methotrexate + immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy, supporting the idea that Methotrexate has direct anti-tumor activity. 9 IMPACT-2 study, a phase III randomized trial, assessed the safety and efficacy of 1 cycle of low-dose Methotrexate treatment during the concurrent Pd1 blockade versus best supportive care. 10 Unfortunately, the IMPACT-2 trial failed to show a benefit for concurrent Methotrexate use during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. 10


The goals of this single arm study are to characterize the toxicity profile of a short course of high dose Methotrexate given to patients with severe irAAs being treated with combination antibody therapy with the immune checkpoint inhibitors, Nivolumab and Ipilimumab, and to characterize the response of irAAs to a 12-week course of prednisone and concomitant Methotrexate.

Background: Sleep disturbance is common in patients undergoing major orthopedic surgery, and their pain is an important cause for sleep loss.



Purpose: The aim of this prospective case‐control study was to compare the effects of general anesthesia (GA) and regional anesthesia (RA) on postoperative sleep quality of the patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty surgery



Setting: Patients scheduled for scheduled total hip arthroplasty surgery in the orthopedic surgery clinic in Bursa Medical Park Hospital



Data collection and analysis plan: Approximately 30 minutes before the beginning of surgery, a questionnaire, with Pittsburg sleep quality index and visual analog scale (VAS) scales, will be given to the participants. Patients will be evaluated for sleep quality with PIRS_20 (Pittsburg Insomnia Scale) at least one month before the surgery and before and one week after the surgery. Anesthetic type will be the primary outcome. Patients will be subjected to the study by a single attending anesthesiologist who is not involved in the follow‐up care following the surgery. The patients allocated to the RA group will be subjected to combined spinal epidural or spinal anesthesia and PENG (percapsular nerve group block with bupivacaine); they will have intravesical patient‐controlled analgesia with morphine. The patients allocated to the GA group will undergo general anesthesia with propofol and inhalational agents or intravenous anesthesia (induction with propofol and maintenance with sevoflurane). All patients will be extubated and awakened in the operating room. The patients will have intravenous patient‐controlled morphine analgesia for postoperative pain control. Patients will be followed up for the first week after the surgery

In recent years, fibroblast cell therapy has made important progress in tissue and organ regeneration, due to its unique ability to proliferate and differentiate; it also plays a key role in wound healing, and restoring the function of injured organs. In this study, we first describe a novel, time-saving method for the production of large number of human dermal fibroblasts by re-epithelization of skin biopsies obtained by a punch biopsy technique. This method differs from standard enzymatic fibroblast obtaining, because it provides a tissue that can be directly cultivated in a tissue culture medium; it produces a confluent cellular monolayer with a higher cell yield, shorter times and lower costs, compared to existing methods. Subsequently, we report on the isolation and expansion of fibroblasts from punch biopsies, which can easily be cryopreserved before and during the expansion process. After thawing, fibroblasts can be recovered and expanded as normal fibroblasts. Finally, we analyzed the fibroblast adhesion property using an automatic adherence detection system based on a ""wound-healing"" approach. Our in vitro analysis demonstrated that fibroblasts obtained by this novel method adhered faster than fibroblasts obtained through the enzymatic method. The re-epithelization of punch biopsies can be an interesting alternative to produce fibroblasts for regenerative medicine field, and it can overcome some of the existing limiting factors related to the current enzymatic method. <EOD> Synthesis of 4-chlorothiophenesulfenamide analogues via regioselective N-sulfenylation of 4-chlorothiophenol on microporous carbon using Pd/C as a heterogeneous catalyst and chlorine

The present study demonstrated the synthesis of 4-chlorothiophenesulfenyl chloride (4-CTS) via regioselective N-sulfenylation of 4-chlorothiophenol on microporous carbon (mpC) using commercial Pd/C heterogenous catalyst and pure chlorine at room temperature. The mpC catalyst containing micropores smaller than B20 nm exhibited the highest catalytic activity for regioselective N-sulfenylation of 4-chlorothiophenol owing to the increased acid catalytic activity. In addition, it was revealed that the catalytic activity of the mpC catalyst used was improved with an increase in the chlorination temperature of the N-sulfenylated 4-CTS intermediate. Based on a comparative study, the possible reaction mechanism was discussed. The method was suggested to be successfully extended to the catalytic N-sulfenylation of various aromatic compounds with C-H bonds (including aliphatic and hydroxyl C-H bonds and halogen), as well as aliphatic compounds.

# Introduction
Over the past few decades, numerous studies have conrmed that suldes are a very useful reagent class in the construction of valuable organic molecules in diverse chemical reactions.Although direct sulfenylation of terminal alkynes using TMS-Sulfenyl chloride under thermal conditions is a highly regioselective process, 5-9 the cost for this chemical process may be very high. To address this problem, a catalytic system based on low toxic and earth abundant (Pt, Pd, and Au) metals, or bimetallic Pt-M (M ¼ Au, Au, and Ru) and metal-free catalysts, including nanoparticles, metal oxides, metal carbide and nitride catalysts, have been widely applied in various C-S-C bondforming methods.More recently, a few sulfenylation methods of aryl or vinyl halides were reported to provide 4-sulfenyl-p-chlorophenols using NaHSO 3 as a nucleophilic partner, Pd(OAc)and Cs 2 CO 3 as a catalyst, and a mixture of N,N-dim"

The association between mental illness and crime is still controversial. The author explores the implicationsof this relationshipfor psychiatrists withforensic responsibilities. He emphasizes the importance of individual diagnosis for criminal responsibility rather than group diagnosis, particularly since so few psychiatrists are involved with forensic evaluation of the mentally ill. <EOD> Synthesis of γ-Lactams via C-H Bond Activation.
The utility of C-H bond activation in nitrogen heterocycle synthesis has remained largely unexplored. Through the development of a catalytic hydroboration-oxidative cyclization (BC) sequence, an expedient, general strategy to construct a myriad of cyclic structures via Csp2-H bond activation and subsequent annulation under mild conditions has been achieved. The transformation involves a hydroboration of readily-accessible arenes or alkynes to cyclopentane intermediates, followed by their direct intramolecular 5-exo or 6-endo oxidative cycloannulation. The resulting γ-pyrones are easily converted into a variety of N-heterocyclic scaffolds which can be tailored in a post-BC cyclization cascade. <EOD> Chloride channel-mediated glutamate release from cortical synapses.
Chloride currents were studied in perforated patches from cortical slices to monitor glutamate release under voltage clamp and to determine its relationship to the synaptic currents recorded extracellularly. We found that chloride channel activation elicited excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) similar to the synaptic currents elicited by stimulation with the same parameters. The EPSC amplitude was independent of the amplitude of the clamp step and did not require calcium entry. The properties of the chloride channel-mediated EPSC resemble those of AMPA receptor-mediated EPSCs in the same synapse. We propose that the currents resulting from chloride permeation carry glutamate, and in conjunction with synaptic currents, are contributors to the synaptic currents elicited by synaptic stimulation. <EOD> The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the risk for and severity of acute kidney injury

The aim of the study was to assess the effect of in vitro cultivation of the Listeria monocytogenes strains on their virulence (their capacity to multiply in a macrophage-like cell). There was found that all strains of the serotype 1/2b (of the 38 examined) were avirulent whereas most of the 19 tested strains of the 4a serotype were virulent. The majority of the tested strains belonging to different serotypes demonstrated moderate virulence. It is assumed that in vitro cultivation contributes to the partial loss of the listerial virulence in strains belonging to the 4a serotype. <EOD> .
An 88-year-old man had right internal carotid artery occlusion. Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) on the right extracranial portion of the internal carotid artery demonstrated a small segment with antegrade opacification, which was thought to be an ""aneurysmal sac"" occluding the proximal portion of internal carotid artery. The tip of an ""aneurysmal sac"" was filled with contrast agent, but its neck was filled incompletely with contrast agent. The angiography at the point of aneurysmal neck made the aneurysm disappear. The DSA images showed that, the tip of an aneurysmal sac was a ""threeway bend"". ""Three-way bend"" occurred when the contrast agent flowed suddenly to the ""aneurysmal sac"" following the flow into the main lumen through the narrow part (aneurysmal neck). This case showed that the digital subtraction angiographic characteristics of the ""three-way bend"" were important to assess the nature of an aneurysming the vascular wall. In 12 patients with carotid aneurysms, who were evaluated by both DSA and transcranial ultrasonography, ""three-way bend"" was demonstrated with DSA, and its frequency was 100%. No ""three-way bend"" was demonstrated with transcranial ultrasonography in any of the patients. The frequency of ""three-way bend"" was high when ultrasonography could not be used to observe the lesions clearly. Transcranial ultrasonography had some limitations in evaluating aneurysms. Therefore, it was necessary to select DSA in cases in which ultrasonography could not be used to observe the lesions clearly. <EOD> The role of the glycosyltransferases in antigenic variation in Trypanosoma cruzi.
A great deal is known regarding the genetic and biochemical nature of protein glycosyltransferase enzymes, involved in the biosynthetic pathway of glycoconjugates. Although their syntheses in lower eukaryotes and in mammals are well characterized, virtually nothing is known about the glycan and transferase systems in trypanosomatids. Here, evidence is presented for the existence of an enzymatic system, functionally homologous to those found in other eukaryotes, involved in glycopeptide biosynthesis in Trypanosoma cruzi. A novel family of glycosyltransferases, apparently involved in antigenic variation in T. cruzi, are also presented. The glycosyltransferases are grouped as three isoenzymatic families, each being encoded by a separate gene, located in three distinct chromosomes.

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Rationale: Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is an emerging breast imaging modality that is based on dual-energy mammography and the injection of iodinated contrast agent. A typical CEM study consists of a low-energy image (equal to a FFDM image) and a recombined image (in which areas of contrast enhancement can be appreciated). However, the situation can occur that lesions are visible only on the recombined (contrast) images (in this protocol defined as 'recombined-only lesions' or ROLs). In these cases, we need to perform 'contrast-enhanced stereotactic biopsy' (CESB), in which CEM is used as a targeting modality. However, experiences with CESB are still limited and one of the most urgent questions that need to be answered is the amount of tissue sampling that is required to reach a final diagnosis. We aim to study where the cut off will be in terms of tissue sampling volume needed (i.e., number of biopsies) for a reliable diagnosis. Objective: To determine the minimum number of CESB-guided tissue samples needed to establish a final histopathological biopsy diagnosis for ROLs. Study design: Prospective, single center, observational cohort study. Study population: Non-pregnant women (>18 years) able to provide written informed consent and with a ROL recently observed during a regular CEM examination. Intervention: Included subject will undergo CESB, consisting of an intravenous injection of iodinated contrast agent prior to image acquisition. After administration, a contrast-enhanced stereotactic localization will be performed of the ROL to determine the location and depth of the lesion within the breast. After targeting, 18 samples will be acquired using a 9 Gauge vacuum-assistend biopsy (VAB), collected in six separate and numbered cassettes, to be able to determine the chronological order of the tissue sampling. Each specimen will be histologically analyzed in this chronological order and findings will be compared with the final histopathological result after assessment of all 18 specimens. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary study aim will be to calculate the cumulative diagnostic yield per specimen, enabling us to define a minimum number of biopsies required (or tissue volume needed) to establish a reliable diagnosis using CESB. Secondary study outcomes will be general parameters of the biopsy procedure itself, such as patient characteristics, histopathological results, pain experienced during the procedure, and complication rates (hematoma, infection).

Input Text: Comparison of Quadriceps Strengthening and Kinesiotaping on Gait in Knee Osteoarthritis

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
=================
Osteoarthritis is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders in adults. It is a degenerative joint disease affecting 15%-40% of people more than 40 years of age. The term osteoarthritis was authored in 1886 by the English doctor, John Kent Spender. Clinical assessment to recognize OA from RA and other comparable conditions turned out to be broadly acknowledged by the main decade of the twentieth century enormous because of the endeavors set forward by Archibald E. Kellgren and Lawrence. The authors suggested radiographic classification criteria for OA using the radiographic grades for the thumb base, knee and hip and recommended 2 of the 3 should be evident to diagnose OA: OA of the thumb base considered grade 3, knee OA grade 2 or 3, and hip OA considered grade 0 to 2. Kellgren and Lawrence proposed 4 grade scoring system for radiographic OA:
Ground Glass and Mild Mixed
Moderate Mixed and Punctate
Severe Mixed and Advanced Osteophytic
Knee OA is a primary knee disorder with symptoms including joint pain with or without swelling, stiffness, decreased flexion on flexion-extension and crepitation. Knee OA is one of the most common forms of arthritis that can severely reduce the quality of life of a person with OA. The term osteoarthritis was authored in 1886 by the English doctor, John Kent Spender. Clinical assessment to recognize OA from RA and other comparable conditions turned out to be broadly acknowledged by the main decade of the twentieth century enormous because of the endeavors set forward by Archibald E. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition that causes other joint tissues to lose gross cartilage and to experience morphological damage. Pathological changes seen in knee osteoarthritis joints include progressive loss and destruction of articular cartilage, thickening of the subchondral bone, formation of osteophytes, variable degrees of inflammation of the synovium, degeneration of ligaments and menisci of the knee and hypertrophy of the joint capsule. Biomechanical factor that is assumed to contribute to the etiology of OA is laxity of knee joint, which is described as the rotation or displacement of femur from tibia. One research found that Varus-valgus laxity in patients with unaltered knees and unilateral OA is wider than in stable healthy participants, indicating knee joint laxity may be disease predisposing. the progress of the lateral and medial knee OA, as defined by narrowing of joint space and a degradation of physical activity, was found to have been linked with lower limb valgus-Varus alignment. The main focus in OA management is on promoting self-management, reducing pain, optimize function, and modifying the disease process and its effects. The primary treatment for OA knee conservatively is physiotherapy which includes strength training, modalities, knee bracing, resistance training and Kinesiotaping. Resistance exercise can reduce knee pain severity and leg strength in participants with symptomatic knee OA. Exercise interventions using free weights or machines have generally focused on movements with concentric muscle contractions. Previous interventions were developed based on loads lifted during the concentric phase. Kinesiotape (KT), is an elastic woven-cotton strip with a heat-sensitive acrylic adhesive structure. Kinesiotaping therapy stimulates skin receptors, thus increasing cellular metabolism, blood flow and tissue oxygenation. The KT works by lifting the skin from the surrounding tissues. This lifting causes stretching of the tissue below the tape and results in increase microcirculation. Kinesiotaping is applied to anatomical"

Diagnostic Accuracy Studies -- Planned and Ongoing Studies
==========================
Summary: [/INST] A diagnostic accuracy study compares the accuracy of a new test to make a diagnosis with the accuracy of the current “gold standard” test commonly used to make that diagnosis.

The new test may prove more accurate and efficient than the current test. We hope to find a test that is both highly accurate and minimally invasive. Our test uses specialized equipment (PET scanner) and injecting [/INST] 2 different radioactive substances (tracers, [/INST] the radiopharmaceuticals) in the blood. One tracer is attached to proteins normally present in the brain (neurotransmitters) and the other injected tracer has no connection to neurotransmitters.

The new test combines the information gleaned from these first two scans (the tracers move into areas of the brain that can detect brain dysfunction that helps differentiate people with different types of brain disorders from one another. This tracer combination has been used before in many studies of brain function and brain disorders.

We are working to develop a third scan using [/INST] the same two tracers that will help show how the brain responds to a variety of brain disorders.

[/INST] PET Scanning in Psychiatry: A prospective study of diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of a high-sensitivity PET scan with two radiotracers in patients with schizophrenia and other psychoses.

Objectives/goals of study: This prospective diagnostic accuracy study aims to test the potential of a unique PET scan that involves injection of 2 radioactive tracers into the blood and scanning a patient at a single facility that has 2 scanners to:

1) Define the test characteristics (e.g. sensitivity, specificity, predictive value) of the PET scan vs. the gold standard assessment (e.g. clinical interview of the best available diagnostic information and a medical diagnostic evaluation) in identifying patients with schizophrenia and other types of psychosis

2) Confirm the efficacy of using a unique test to distinguish people with the disorder from people without the disease.

Participants:

People ages 18 to 60 who were referred for a full diagnostic evaluation to the study center will be enrolled. Participants must be in good physical health with no known history of cancer, heart disease, diabetes, or obesity, and no history of alcohol or drug abuse within the past 5 years. Participants will be randomly selected from the pool of patients seen in the program on a weekly basis. Subjects will be provided with a $70.00 for the two scans. Those not able to commit to both scans or able to receive both scans in a few hours will not be eligible to participate.

[!include report.md] <EOD> Characterizing the Interaction of the C-Reactive Protein with Lipopolysaccharide Using Fluorescence and Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensors Technology

C-Reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory protein, and its levels in plasma play an important role in the identification of inflammatory conditions. The presence of lipoteichoic acyl chain in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of Gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharide has been reported to enhance the interaction of LPS with CRP proteins. These interactions can lead to atheroma formation due to increased expression of endothelial inflammatory cytokines under inflammatory states. Here, for the first time, we report on our investigation of the specificity of the interaction of LPS protein with CRP using a fluorescence and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor technology. Fluorescence data showed that the binding between CRP and LPS increased with LPS concentration in a dose-dependent manner, where CRP binding with LPS increased from 0.0560 ± 0.0030 to 0.9520 ± 0.0058 M (P ≤ 0.05) in the presence of LPS at a CRP concentration of 1 µM. Our SPR results showed that CRP had a higher binding affinity toward the LPS protein compared to Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi LPS. This finding suggests that the LPS component on Gram-negative bacterial membranes contributes to the higher affinity of CRP with LPS proteins.

# Introduction
C-reactive protein (CRP) is an inflammatory protein synthesized in hepatic cells of the liver in response to an inflammatory stimuli, predominantly in humans. CRP is one of the most commonly used proteins in clinical diagnosis due to its unique affinity to C-polysaccharides from bacteria, including lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipoglycan (LOS). The lipid component of LPS (lipid A) contains phosphorylated β(1 → 6)-linked glucosamine disaccharide as well as lipid A fatty acid chains.
Previous studies have shown that the lipid component of LPS has a major role in the immunogenicity and pro-inflammatory properties of this protein.
Even though LPS and LTA have been extensively studied as pro-inflammatory ligands of the innate immune system, the mechanisms underlying their direct binding to serum proteins remains unclear. Therefore, we investigated the affinity of LPS and LTA to CRP, a protein widely used as a biomarker in several diseases, including atherosclerosis.
CRP is used as an inflammation marker which shows its presence in the bloodstream during the acute inflammatory and thrombotic responses to injuries and infections. The concentration of CRP in the human blood is not affected by lifestyle or diet, and remains relatively stable over time when subjects are not experiencing an inflammation.
High levels of CRP have been associated with various pathological conditions such as obesity, atherosclerosis, lung and liver diseases, inflammatory bowel diseases, bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, and diabetes. Although LPS is an integral part of the Gram-negative outer membrane and has structural homologies to phosphorylated glucosamine disaccharides, high affinity of the LPS protein to CRP could result in various pathological consequences.
It has been shown that LPS"

Cardiovascular Complications of Ibrutinib Therapy: a Single-center Cohort Study https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02803332 -----------------------------------
Purpose: The main goal of cardioprotection is to prevent irreversible heart damage due to heart attack (for example when the coronary blood vessels are narrowed by atherosclerosis) and strokes (caused by a clot that is released from a blood vessel). One of the most important risk factors that damages the heart is high blood pressure which can lead to hardening of arteries in the heart, a process called atherosclerosis and finally heart attack which can be caused by the rupture of a damaged atherosclerotic blood vessel.
Age: Adult (18 years and older). ----------------------------

# Background
The main goal of cardioprotection is to prevent irreversible heart damage due to heart attack (for example when the coronary blood vessels are narrowed by atherosclerosis) and strokes (caused by a clot that is released from a blood vessel ).
One of the most important risk factors that damages the heart is high blood pressure which can lead to hardening of arteries in the heart, a process called atherosclerosis and finally heart attack which can be caused by the rupture of a damaged atherosclerotic blood vessel.

# History
In recent times the introduction of chemotherapeutic agents to treat hematologic diseases has led to an increase in the number of patients affected. The first two agents to be marketed were cytosine arabinoside and prednisone.
The discovery of ibrutinib was accidental - the development was based on research carried out in immunology. Although the drug binds to a specific receptor found on the surface of B lymphocytes, it is not related to the immunological response of the body to a pathogen. A more recent research has shown that the drug has two possible mechanisms of action.
One is to disrupt intracellular signals that induce cell growth and division, and thus interfering with the division of B cells. Ibrutinib inhibits the intracellular enzyme Bruton tyrosine kinase, which is responsible for maintaining these molecular signals. Ibrutinib, thanks to this feature is intended for hematologic indications.
The other is to block a receptor in the blood cells responsible for attaching leukocytes to endothelial cells lining blood vessels and entering into the circulation.
Ibrutinib binds directly to this receptor, thus blocking the transendothelial migration of leukocytes. The second mechanism is therefore aimed at stopping the development of inflammation in the blood vessels. There is some evidence to suggest that the drug may also have some anticancer properties.
According to the authors , the drug reduces the concentration of circulating white blood cells and has a modest effect on monocytes. It also lowers the concentration of the protein beta2-microglobulin, improves bone density, restores the number of peripheral lymphocytes, and increases the levels of immunoglobulins. In some studies on patients treated with ibrutinib, an increased incidence of infection was found, and other authors have reported a high incidence of atrial fibrillation.
Several potential side effects were reported in phase III trials: diarrhea, headache, fatigue, cough, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia, nausea, decreased appetite, insomnia, pyrexia, stomatitis, anemia, constipation, and thrombocytopenia. Ibrutinib, like other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, is also teratogenic.

# Phase I/II
According to the authors , the drug reduces the concentration of circulating white blood cells and has a modest effect on monocytes. It also lowers the concentration of the protein beta2-microglobulin, improves bone density, restores the number of peripheral lymphocytes, and increases the levels of immunoglobulins. In some studies on patients treated with ibrutinib, an increased incidence of infection was found, and other authors have reported a high incidence of atrial fibrillation.

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the changes of immunological parameters and disease severity after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD).


METHODS
A retrospective study was conducted on 95 children with KD (47 males, 48 females) in Department of Pediatrics, the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an, China, who were intravenous drip with high-dose IVIG in the acute phase of disease (≤7 days after admission). The immunoglobulin and adenosine deaminase (ADA) level before and after IVIG treatment were compared. Clinical symptoms and acute phase inflammatory cytokines were summarily observed and compared in different clinical subtypes. The correlation between disease severity and the level of immunoglobulin was analyzed.


RESULTS
The levels of immunoglobulin increased significantly after IVIG treatment . The levels of IgG and IgA were negatively correlated with the disease duration before IVIG treatment while positively correlated with the body temperature and erythrocyte sedimentation rate before and after IVIG treatment (P < 0.05-0.01). The levels of IgG and IgA in patients with noncoronary aneurism (NCA) was decreased significantly compared with the healthy children of the same age (983.9 ± 156.3 mg/L vs. 1 421.5 ± 101.3 mg/L; 773.7 ± 187.4 mg/L vs. 1 087.0 ± 94.8 mg/L). IVIG can quickly resolve the symptoms such as prolonged fever or irritability and significantly reduce the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. The levels of ADA were decreased significantly in patients with coronary artery aneurysm (CAA) or NCA. Patients with CAA and NCA showed more serious acute phase inflammatory reactions and delayed responsiveness to IVIG.

Input Text: Boosting Psychotherapy Effects by Means of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
The study - interventional, nonpharmacological, using medical devices, nonprofit - is aimed at evaluating the potential effectiveness of a multimodal intervention for the treatment of unipolar depression. The intervention involves the use of a neuro-stimulation technique, the Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (transcranial Direct Current Stimulation - tDCS), combined with a psychotherapy intervention, metacognitive therapy (MetaCognitive Therapy, MCT). TDCS is a noninvasive neurostimulation technique involving the transcranial application of a low-amperage electric current at a region of the cerebral cortex involved in the pathogenesis of major depression, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. It has been demonstrated how such stimulation has a neuromodulating effect on synaptic plasticity, with efficacy in unipolar major depressive disorder. The technique also has a good safety, as it is not associated with major side effects. MCT is based on the metacognitive model, according to which psychopathological processes are consequent to a cognitive style characterized by repetitive forms of thinking (such as rumination) and maladaptive behaviors such as avoidance and thought suppression. The MCT, through attention training techniques, detached mindfulness and behavioral interventions on metacognitions, has shown effectiveness in major depressive disorder comparable to that of psychotherapeutic interventions considered, within psychotherapies, to be first-line such as cognitive-behavioral therapy. The experimental design will be that of a randomized, double-blind study with three arms of treatment, each consisting of 8 sessions, involving the administration of 1) the neurostimulation intervention (tDCS), 2) of the psychotherapeutic intervention alone (MCT), 3) of both techniques in consecution (tDCS-MCT). This design is aimed at evaluating a potential additive/synergistic effect of the two interventions when combined. During the tDCS sessions, each lasting 20 minutes, the patient will apply the technique of attention training, aimed at further activating the region stimulated by neurostimulation, so as to so as to amplify the plasticity stimulated by tDCS, achieving a synergistic effect. To follow, a 40-minute MCT session will be carried out. The effectiveness of these interventions will be assessed by hetero-administered and self-administered at time zero, after treatment, at two follow-ups of 6 and 12 months. Before and after the treatment cycle (tDCS sessions and MCT sessions), a subgroup of patients will be explored, in the context of a pilot study, the TMS-EEG correlates of the change in symptomatology depression, which can be correlated with the different proposed therapeutic interventions.

PurposeTo compare the results obtained when rotation measurement is done with the “eye-to-chip” (ETC) technique and the “eye-to-screen” (ETS) technique. MethodsOne thousand nine hundred ninety-three cases were included with the ETS measurement in patients with congenital horizontal strabismus and were analyzed retrospectively. Two hundred forty-one cases were randomized to have measurement by the ETC technique, and 277 cases were included for comparison with the ETS technique. ResultsThe amount of rotations in every eye position were similar between the two methods. All rotations were higher in excyclotropia than in escyclotropia. Compared with the ETC measurement, the ETS measurement made it easier for non-trained examiners to perform the rotation measurements. ConclusionsThe ETC system can be used in measuring the rotation in horizontal strabismus. The ETS system is more convenient for non-trained examiners but is not sufficiently accurate. <EOD> The epidemiological relationship between obstructive sleep apnoea and cardiovascular disease.
Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition with important negative consequences for patients and health care systems. OSA is associated with obesity, hypertension and is currently considered an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In this review we discuss the evidence of a link between OSA and cardiovascular risks. Although the data suggest that OSA is associated with several components of the metabolic syndrome, with a large variation in sleep characteristics, the link between OSA, hypertension and cardiovascular complications could not be explained by a causal relation. Furthermore, OSA is a very heterogeneous syndrome with different symptoms and degrees of disease severity. There is also a high degree of variability in the responses to treatments and different pathophysiological roles of the individual components in the complex mechanisms of OSA. Therefore, studies aimed at better understanding of the mechanisms by which OSA leads to cardiovascular risk are needed in order to identify specific treatments for patients with OSA and cardiovascular disease. <EOD> Rethinking the 21st Century

## Rethinking the 21st century
The editors of this book (Alexandra Dragu-Radescu and Vlad-Victor Iloase) have presented a fascinating collection of essays written by well-known specialists in the field of economics, sociology, and political science. The reader finds in these essays a valuable critique of the traditional views that shape the modern world economy in the 21st century.
Economic growth and wealth are the predominant concerns facing individuals and society today. But, as 13 contributors to this book show, wealth and growth occur in a setting shaped by many elements of our culture that are largely unrelated to the economic. Thus, human nature, the family, human emotions, religions, culture, norms, institutions, and so forth have all produced wealth, growth, and prosperity.
Thus, economists, sociologists, and philosophers have to work together to identify a wide range of factors that have contributed to the remarkable economic growth that we have seen in the past, which have had a role in shaping the economic status of populations, and which will continue to play an important, albeit complicated, role in the future. 1000 B.C. to present).

[/INST] <EOD> A Comparison of the Efficacy of Bupivacaine, Morphine, and Tramadol for Epidural Adjuvant Analgesia Following Caesarean Section: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis
Objective: Epidural analgesia is the preferred choice for pain management after caesarean section (CS). However, the effectiveness of different agents for epidural analgesia is uncertain. This meta-analysis was conducted to determine the efficacy of bupivacaine, morphine, and tramadol in epidural analgesia following CS. Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, searches were conducted following the PRISMA guidelines using various databases from establishment of these databases to March 2020. A total of 2789 articles were retrieved through research databases. The final analysis was conducted on 23 published studies. A meta-analysis of 2 of the included studies was conducted via Review Manager 5.3. Results: The 2789-article database yielded 23 articles following the application of search criteria. A meta-analysis of 2 of these was conducted in Review Manager 5.3, which reported results indicating that compared with using an opioid drug alone, the use of epidural drugs containing bupivacaine and morphine resulted in no differences in VAS and OA (p > 0.05) and that compared with the use of epidural drugs containing bupivacaine and morphine alone, the VAS for pain reported by the morphine and tramadol combination group (p  0.05), and that compared with the use of epidural drugs containing bupivacaine and morphine alone, the VAS for pain reported by the morphine and tramadol combination group (p < 0.05) was lower in the first 24 postoperative hours. All the groups were similar with respect to NRS, ESS, Apgar score, adverse effects of nausea and vomiting, and respiratory depression (p > 0.05). However, the Apgar score in the first 5 minutes was significantly higher in the combination group (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Postoperative epidural analgesia with a combination of bupivacaine and morphine improves satisfaction and relieves pain in women who undergo caesarean in the first 24 hours. However, the 2 anesthetic agents have no differences in this respect. <EOD> Antigenic variation of Borrelia burgdorferi during persistent infection.
Existing infections with Borrelia species induce an antibody response directed against a limited number of B. burgdorferi surface antigens. In order to examine whether new variants of the organism arise during persistent infection and whether these new antigenic forms are immunologically relevant, a polyclonal B. burgdorferi infected rabbit serum (4-5 months after infection) was screened by immunoblot for antibodies with a high avidity against antigens that appear late on the developmental time course of B. burgdorferi. When compared to a low-avidity immunoglobulin A serum fraction, the high-avidity fraction showed an increased reactivity with linear epitopes of the species-specific antigens p39 and p35 and with p18-p21, a recently described antigen. These data indicate that new antigenic variants appear during persistent infection, among which p18-p21 might be of importance for the persistence in vivo. <EOD> Evaluation of the clinical effects of two dentin bonding agents.
The clinical behavior of two dentin primers was assessed in 300 patients. The two primers used had different characteristics and the clinical effect of these differences was estimated after a clinical investigation of 600 bonded restorations which had been placed by the patients' dentists. The mean duration of the bonded restorations examined was 4.2 years, and the patients were assessed at 3 and 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and at last examination. The evaluation after 1 to 8 years showed that the differences between the two primers were not statistically significant. We conclude that the type of dentin bonding agent has no significant influence on failure rates of composite restorations. <EOD> .

Abstract (187-197). The PEST domain (P for Pro, E for Glu, and S for Ser and Thr) of 4E-BP induces a proteolytic fragmentation of itself and its target protein eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E), thus inhibiting protein synthesis. The PEST domain of 4E-BP is essential for its amino-acid-responsive regulation in Drosophila. It has been reported that the PEST domain is required for the regulation of mRNAs for amino-acidregulated genes whose expression is negatively regulated by the Hippo pathway and 4E-BP. However, Drosophila possess another type of amino-acid-regulated gene, which is positively rather than negatively regulated by the Hippo pathway and 4E-BP. In this study, we investigated the regulation of the pivotal amino-acid-regulated gene, Slc7a5, by the Hippo pathway and the PEST domain. We found that the Hippo pathway inhibits the protein synthesis of Slc7a5, and that deletion of the PEST domain abolishes the amino-acid-responsive regulation of Slc7a5. Furthermore, the deletion of the PEST domain impairs the negative regulation of eIF4E by 4E-BP at the whole-body level; i.e., the transcription of genes other than Slc7a5 is not downregulated by the PEST-deleted 4E-BP under amino-acid starvation. These results suggest that the PEST domain is essential for amino-acid-responsive gene selectivity in Drosophila.
The Drosophila insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS) pathway consists of receptor protein tyrosine kinase, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PtdIns(3)K)/AKT, and FOXO, the CREB/"

 <EOD> The association between self-reported sleep and quality of life in patients with primary brain tumors

Purpose Sleep disturbances have been associated with neurological sequelae in patients with primary brain tumors (PBT), but no research has addressed quality of life (QoL) in this population. This study compared the QoL in PBT patients with sleep disturbances to those without sleep disturbances, and identified if those sleep disturbances are associated with a QoL decline. Methods Data from 222 PBT patients was extracted from the online self-report questionnaire data-entry system Patient reported outcome in neuro-Oncology-Low Grade Glioma (PNO-LGG) and analyzed for association between sleep disturbances and QoL using univariate and multivariate regression. Additionally, the relationship between sleep duration and QoL was analyzed with linear regression. Results The PBT population had a low prevalence of sleep disturbances (33.9 and 3.8% had sleep disturbances with an association to symptoms and insomnia, respectively) and reported low levels of QoL impairment, especially in the domains of physical and emotional functioning. Sleep disturbances were related to symptoms from other organ systems (i.e., gastrointestinal, urinary or skin), and not associated with overall QoL, social functioning, energy levels, cognition, or emotional well-being. Lower sleep durations were generally associated with decreasing physical and emotional functioning and cognitive impairment. Conclusions Sleep disturbances are only loosely associated with QoL changes in the PBT population. In this population, cognitive impairment is not associated with sleep disturbances and these two factors can be distinctly studied.

# Introduction
Primary brain tumors (PBTs) may encompass various malignancies, the most common being malignant gliomas. Although diagnosis and treatment of PBT has improved considerably in the last half-century, the prognosis remains poor, with an average patient survival of only 17 months after diagnosis.
After completion of treatment, many PBT patients may experience a variety of symptoms that can impact their daily functioning and have a large impact on overall quality of life (QoL).
It is widely documented that sleep disturbances are among the most prevalent late effects in cancer survivors, with reported rates of up to 50-70%. Studies on PBT, specifically reported high rates of sleep disturbances and insomnia, with reported prevalence rates of up to 70% and 54%. However, it is not fully understood how and which type of sleep problems may be associated with the various PBT symptoms and QoL.
Sleep disturbances are defined on an objective or subjective level. Objectively diagnosed sleep disturbances can be categorized as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insomnia, hypersomnia, parasomnias (i.e., sleepwalking or REM sleep behavior disorder), circadian rhythm disorder-shift work sleep disorder, and narcolepsy. Subjective sleep disturbance may manifest as insomnia where an individual recognizes a sleep problem without the need of confirmation by an objective diagnostic sleep testing, and are often referred to in the literature as simply sleep impairments or disturbances.

Input Text: Pilot Study of the RAPID AFib Decision Aid for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) leads to a 4-fold increased risk of stroke, accounting for 15-20% of the 50,000 strokes suffered by Canadians each year. The annual stroke risk in untreated patients is 4.5%, but varies 10-fold based on risk factors captured in clinical prediction tools. Given that oral anticoagulation (OAC) reduces stroke risk by 65%, the majority of AF-associated strokes are potentially preventable. All current Canadian and international AF guidelines strongly recommend use of clinical prediction rules to assess stroke risk, and anticoagulation of high-risk patients. However, population-based studies continue to document significant rates of risk-discordant stroke prevention therapy. Addressing this care gap is a major knowledge translation challenge. Patient decision aids are knowledge translation tools that can facilitate a process of shared decision-making to improve patient knowledge and decision quality. These tools have the potential to improve both initial therapy selection and adherence, ultimately reducing the risks of AF-associated stroke and unnecessary bleeding. We have developed and performed initial user testing for a new, web-based decision aid, called Risk Assessment and Personal preferences to Improve Decisions for Atrial Fibrillation (RAPID AFib). The tool has 3 sequential functions: (1) it estimates an individual's risk for stroke and for bleeding using published risk scores; (2) it allows them to interactively compare OACs to select one or more therapies that best matches their risk profile and individual preferences ; and (3) it summarizes the risk information and their selected therapy to facilitate discussion with their physician in a Summary Report. This study represents the next step in this program of research, by performing a formal evaluation of the performance of this tool in a real-world clinical setting. Primary Objective: To conduct a pilot study to establish the acceptability of the RAPID AFib tool and its impact on the process of shared decision-making for stroke prevention therapy in patients with recent onset AF Hypothesis: The RAPID Afib decision aid will be acceptable for both patients and clinicians, and will lead to more effective shared decision-making than standard care among patients with AF who are considering OAC. Methods: Study Design: Prospective, randomized pilot study. Study procedures: Clinic staff will screen referred patients, then the research team will approach them to confirm eligibility, request informed consent for participation, and collect baseline demographic and clinical data. Consenting patients will be randomized 1:1 using a web-based application linked to the study database to receive the study intervention or control. Randomization will be stratified by clinic site. All patients will be invited to review an evidence-based website providing information about AF and its management. Intervention group: Patients randomized to the RAPID AFib intervention will be sent a link to the decision aid website and asked to complete the decision aid before their upcoming visit. They will also be asked to bring the Summary Report to their upcoming clinic visit. A copy of the Summary Report will be added to the patient chart for clinician review. Control group: Patients randomized to the control group will attend their clinic visit as scheduled, with no further direction from the study team. Follow-up: Study participation will end after completion of a post-visit survey.

 <EOD> The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Dementia Services Across Europe: A Systematic Review of the Literature

Dementia has the highest global economic impact with the greatest economic cost in older adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, selfisolation, and shielding have led to challenges for providing dementia care services. There is limited information on how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected dementia care worldwide. Therefore, the aim of the current systematic review was to explore the state of dementia care and services globally and the impact upon service users at the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic review was conducted in line with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement and registered with the international prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) with a population and intervention search strategy using the terms ""P,"" ""I,"" ""C,"" ""O,"" and ""S"" related to dementia, COVID-19, and their impact on people. An initial screening identified 289 articles. Following the removal of duplicates, 252 articles were screened. After reviewing the titles and abstracts, 25 studies were shortlisted for full-text review, leaving 10 studies for inclusion in this systematic review. Of the 10 included studies, six were survey studies and four used mixed-methods designs. Most studies were conducted in North America, Europe, and Asia. The review highlighted increased negative health effects of social isolation in dementia care following the COVID-19 pandemic with some studies reporting a reduction of dementia care services. Additionally, the review highlighted the negative financial impact due to disruptions in care. The systematic review concluded that there have been severe consequences of the social isolation due to Covid-19 measures and the resulting restrictions in access to dementia care.

# Introduction
People living with dementia and their carers have been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic, where those affected have experienced a variety of adverse consequences. The number of people living with dementia is predicted by the World Health Organization to increase to 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million by 2050. Dementia is costing the UK an estimated £26.3 billion in 2020 alone, with an economic loss of £791 billion for the whole of Europe. It is known that the population with dementia is particularly vulnerable to the consequences of the pandemic (e.g., isolation, lack of contact with loved ones, family financial losses). Additionally, people with dementia are considered to be a particularly vulnerable group , especially those with milder dementia.
COVID-19 is a highly infectious disease caused by the novel coronavirus . The main symptoms include fever, dry cough, tiredness, and breathing difficulties. A small number of people (estimated about 20%) with COVID-19 progress to critical illnesses after the initial infection (World Health Organization [WHO], 2020d). The older adults, those with cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus are considered as the ""high-risk"" group, with a severe risk of mortality. These groups show similarities with those identified as ""at risk"" for dementia care with the additional risk factor of having dementia. For example, an older age is a key risk factor for dementia and severe illness following a COVID-19 infection . It is also known that people with dementia are at high risk for contracting COVID-19 due to their compromised care due to social distancing and shielding. This makes it difficult for them to obtain essential care and medication due to dementia care service disruption. Additionally, it has been reported that the care and support services offered to people with dementia has been disrupted globally. It has been reported that this disruption to"

 <EOD> The Cause of Death of Dogs
SIR HENRY DERINGTON (President), in reply, said that the point appeared to have been very well brought out by Dr. Corsellis. Apart from its being impossible in every case to say what animal the virus came from, the whole point was to show that, when we got these zoonoses, we could not, except for a very few instances, trace the animals back which originally gave rise to the virus. That was the fact brought out by the experiment and it had been well brought over by Dr. Corsellis. <EOD> Identification of a mammalian homologue to a 40-kDa subunit of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase complex.
Biochemical and molecular cloning approaches have been used to identify and characterize the mammalian 40-kDa subunit of the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase complex (mARSC). The C‐terminal residues of this protein align well with the C‐terminal tRNA binding domain of the 30‐kDa subunit of bacterial aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetases (AARS). Consistent with the presence of a tRNA binding domain, antibodies are raised against the full‐length mouse mARSC (mARSC1) protein in rabbits and the mARSC1 protein is purified by antibody affinity chromatography. Using this antibody, mARSC1 is found to be abundant in rat liver, kidney and heart mitochondria. As in yeast, mammalian mARSC1 does not associate with yeast mARSC. The mARSC1 protein has a high‐affinity RNA binding activity as measured by nitrocellulose filter binding assays, which is lost following treatment with RNase A. Sequence analysis of this protein revealed that mARSC1 is 57% identical in amino acid sequence to the mitochondrial counterpart (mARSC2) from mouse. In contrast, the similarity between the cytosolic ARSC1 in mammals and yeast cytoplasmic ARSCs is no more than 30%. Using a combination of immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry, the mARSC2 protein was identified and shown to have 53% identity in amino acid sequence with the yeast counterpart. This protein is highly associated with the mitochondrial ribosome in vivo. Based on these and related studies, we hypothesize that mARSC1 and mARSC2 comprise the mammalian mitochondrial multisynthetase complex (mMSC) analogous to the bacterial mASC. <EOD> A simple one-step approach to the synthesis of thiamidol esters and acyloxymethyl esters from thiamin.
A one-step synthesis of the monoacidic thiamidol esters (1) and acyloxymethyl esters (2) from thiamin is reported. The thiamidol esters, analogous to the monocarboxylate vitamins, occur as the diastereoisomers trans,cis/cis,cis. The stereospecificity of the reaction is controlled by the configuration of the substrate thiamin, which exists in the cis,cis conformation. <EOD> Draft Genome Analysis of Flavobacterium columnare Strain VcM9-7-4, Which Has Strong Antimicrobial Activity Against Edwardsiella piscicida

A B S T R A C TFlavobacterium columnare causes columnaris disease, a notorious disease in freshwater fish. In Japan, several novel antagonistic agents that inhibit columnaris bacteriosis have been developed via the co-inoculation of E. piscicida and other Gram-negative bacteria. However, F. columnare strains have been identified as the main causative agents, suggesting that antagonistic effects against columnaris bacteria may be derived from within Flavobacterium spp. Here, we identified and reported the first draft genome information of Flavobacterium sp.

Abstract: A 27-year-old female outpatient with a history of supraventricular tachycardia and hypertension was given oral contraceptive medications for her hypertension and contraception. Her cardioactive digoxin therapy was continued for tachycardia. She had digoxin levels drawn during a menstrual cycle. During the midfollicular phase of her menstrual cycle, her digoxin level was greater (0.97 ng/ml) than in the ovulatory phase (0.46 ng/ml). Thus, the midfollicular digoxin level was elevated, implying decreased digoxin clearance during this phase of the menstrual cycle, possibly because of a pharmacokinetic interaction due to progesterone stimulation of hepatic metabolism. This finding implies that female patients be carefully monitored for interactions with oral contraceptives, since the hepatic cytochrome P450–dependent enzyme systems are stimulated during the active progesterone phase of the menstrual cycle. <EOD> Effects of bacteria on urea metabolism during the early stage of denitrification in a rice floodwater

Background: This study was conducted to investigate urea metabolic pathways of different bacteria and their potential roles on denitrification during the early stage of flooding in a rice paddy, with an emphasis on the competition for urea between ammonium oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and denitrifying bacteria (DB). Results: We found that most of nitrate produced by AOB, were utilized by DB to form nitrous oxide in a rice field. The nitrate reduction potential of both functional groups declined rapidly, reaching minimum values on day 1 after the paddy was flooded, and then increased gradually, reaching maximum values on day 10. The nitrate concentration in the soil of the denitrification group was much higher than that in the control group when the soil was flooded, indicating DBs inhibited NO 3 -reduction and NO 3 removal in the system even they had a competitive advantage over AOB after the p"

Date: [/DATE] <EOD> Pulsed light-mediated surface modification of poly(dimethylsiloxane) microfluidic devices.
Microfluidics-based devices have attracted great popularity due to their numerous applications in analytical sciences, chemical synthesis, drug discovery, and tissue engineering, where the surface modification is a prerequisite for the specific applications. In order to realize the surface modification of various devices, including the thermoplastic poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) and glass microfluidic devices, pulsed laser direct writing (PLDW) is employed, a fast, safe, and precise micromachining technique. By using a commercial excimer UV pulsed laser (222 nm), poly(vinyl alcohol), and poly((ethylene glycol)monomethyl ether methacrylate (PEGMA), as the modification layers, the pulsed laser irradiation can be used to functionalize and improve the hydrophobicity of PDMS microfluidic channels. At the same time, the pulsed UV light exposure also can decrease the flow resistance inside a microchannel from 234 μbar × m·μL(-1) to 35 μbar × m·μL(-1). By using the PEGMA as an appropriate modification layer, the PDMS microchannel can realize high hydrophilicity for cell migration with a lower flow resistance and shear force. Meanwhile, by employing this technique to fabricate a three-dimensional (3D) PDMS sieve, the pulsed UV light irradiation can increase the pore size from 20 μm to 68 μm and decrease the flow resistance from 37 bar × m 2 to 6.5 bar × m 2. Due to the fast and safe characteristics of the photoinduced cross linkage, the PDMS microchannel can be used for 3D cell spheroid production. By applying this PLDW technique, the PDMS microfluidic devices for flow cytometry and the pore sieve for nanofiltration, two important separation applications in life sciences, are realized. <EOD> The value of the ultrasound tissue characterisation scores in assessing renal fibrosis in patients with chronic kidney disease
To investigate the value of the ultrasound tissue characterisation (UTC) score in predicting renal fibrosis. <EOD> Inhibition of N-cadherin reduces malignant progression in pancreatic cancer.
Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as metalloproteinases (MMPs) and laminins, can promote the metastatic behavior of neoplastic cells. An essential cell-cell adhesion molecule in tumor progression is N-cadherin. The aim of this study is to examine the expression of N-cadherin and ECM proteins at both the gene and protein level in human pancreatic cancer and its relation with clinicopathological characteristics. Samples of pancreatic cancer and corresponding noncancerous pancreas tissues were examined for the presence of N-cadherin and ECM proteins (MMP-1 and MMP-2) by immunohistochemical staining using a streptavidin horseradish peroxidase conjugate. The expression of the target genes was measured using lightCycler. The correlation between the expression of the target genes in pancreatic carcinoma and clinicopathological characteristics was analyzed. The expression of N-cadherin correlated significantly with distant metastatic disease (P < 0.05) and invasion of blood vessels (P < 0.05). It was observed that the mRNA level for MMP-2 decreased significantly after the addition of a N-cadherin-specific monoclonal antibody (Abcam, Berkshire, UK) vs. control IgG (sc-48408; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX, USA) and in the presence of a higher concentration of the peptide inhibitor (25 microg/ml; Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI, USA). The expression of the N- and E-cadherins and α-catenin was decreased, while MMP-2 was decreased significantly. N-cadherin facilitates malignant progression"

A titanium-catalyzed reductive coupling between hydroxyarenes and diborons has been developed for the synthesis of S-phenylboronic acids from the corresponding hydroxyarenes. The transformation proceeds via the decarboxylation of diborons to B2 moieties, followed by a ring-opening reaction of diborons with the hydroxyarenes to give N-O-diarylhydroxylamine intermediates. The hydroxyl groups on C(2') and C(4') of the N-O-diarylhydroxylamine intermediates then decarboxylate/dehydroxylate under the catalytic coordination of the titanocene, generating S-phenylboronic acid products. <EOD> The role of the ciliary zonule and ciliary muscle in the regulation of intraocular pressure.
Using morphological and physiological techniques we found that intraocular pressure can significantly increase or decrease during the course of pharmacological or mechanical stimulus, if the ciliary zonule or the ciliary muscle is still attached at the end of the experiment. 
 
 
 
The mechanical activity of the ciliary muscle has two components that lead to modifications of the intraocular fluid reservoir. The first is a cyclical shortening and displacement of the ciliary muscle with its tonus and volume contraction and subsequent elongation with tonus and volume relaxation. The second component is a slow movement of the muscle fibres in the form of waves. We suggest that the ciliary muscle with its cyclical movements is primarily responsible of the normal intraocular pressure. <EOD> Identification of the immunoglobulin J region gene and the C mu and C omega regions of the mink genomic DNA.
DNA fragments encompassing the immunoglobulin (Ig) beta chain genes were cloned from a genomic library prepared from DNA of mink (Neovison vison) splenocytes and from DNA of the immortalized mink cell line TM14. By characterization of DNA fragments of three cosmids and a lambda clone hybridizing to human V (IGHV)-J (IGHJ)-Cgamma probes, they all were found to contain the V (IGHV)-J (IGHJ)-Cgamma (IGHCH1) region. The sequence of the Cmu1 and Cmu2 genes and the Cmu3 gene were obtained from a recombinant DNA clone that was selected on the basis of enzyme digestions. The Cmu1-containing cosmid also was shown to contain the previously characterized sequence of the C omega gene. This IgJ region gene was found to be nonfunctional, since a PCR product was found in none of the 21 cDNAs obtained from mRNA prepared by reverse transcriptase-mediated cDNA synthesis. A comparison of the DNA sequence of the immunoglobulin J (IGHJ) region with those of other nonprimate species has shown that they are conserved among mammalian species, and the same has been shown to be true for the conserved amino acids and the amino acid distance between V-J junctions from human and mouse. In contrast, the amino acid distance varies between species. The length of the intervening sequence between the two Cgamma genes also was determined to be 254 bp for the mink. The functional sequence in the mink IgJ region is also the same as that in the human and mice, containing two short repeats on the 5 and 3 sides of the sequence, whereas this repeats are highly variable in other species, such as the horse and rabbit. <EOD> .
The effect of glutamate ions on the respiration of brain mitochondria in the presence of succinate or alpha-ketoglutarate as substrates and ADP as a source of energy was studied. The substratotropic effect of glutamate ions resulted in a marked decrease of the respiratory inhibition of mitochondria caused by oxygen free radicals produced"

Ultrasonography is a simple technique to visualize the uterus and the pelvic tissues when transvaginal probe is used. Our recent experience obtained with a real-time convex-array transducer demonstrated a good visualization of the normal uterus, uterine cavity and walls, uterine vessels, ovaries, and periovarian and pelvic tissues. The aim of this experimental study is to quantitatively assess the accuracy of transvaginal sonography in the evaluation of normal uterus and the pelvic tissues; we performed a controlled study comparing the ultrasound results (transvaginal and suprapubic) obtained to those obtained during hysterectomy. Fifteen fertile women submitted to hysterectomy for uterine myoma were included in our study. Patients underwent an ultrasound examination before surgery with: (i) the transvaginal (TV) probe, which permits the visualization of the cervix, endometrium, myometrium, adnexae, uterine vessels, and periovarian tissues, and (ii) the suprapubic transabdominal (SAT) probe,"

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Early pregnancy loss is very common, approximately one in four women will experience a miscarriage in their lifetime. The etiology of pregnancy loss remains largely unknown, although genetic, anatomical, endocrinological and immunological abnormalities have been implicated. It is known that embryonic/fetal chromosomal aberrations contributed to approximately 50% of early pregnancy loss, among which 60% -70% were aneuploidies, largely can be detected by the current gold standard karyotyping approach recommended by various international societies. However, the drawbacks of conventional karyotyping include the risk of culture failure, maternal cell contamination (MCC), limited detection resolution (5-10 Mb), and differential growth of specific cell lineages which could hinder the diagnosis of genetic abnormalities, particularly mosaicisms. Additional genetic factors beyond the resolution of karyotyping are not well studied. Various versions of sequencing platforms targeting at different variants were already established and validated in the Prenatal Genetic Diagnostic Laboratory, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, including FetalSeq, ChromoSeq, and 30xWGS. Human endometrial and decidual tissues, containing a myriad of immune and inflammatory populations, are immunologically dynamic. In the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle, T-cells are the most abundant leukocyte population in the endometrium, but they decrease to 20% of all stromal leukocytes during early pregnancy. Macrophages are also present in endometrial tissues during all phases of the menstrual cycle, but are most abundant in late secretory endometrium and in decidual tissues during early pregnancy. The most abundant population (70%) of stromal leukocytes observed in late secretory endometrium and in the decidua during early normal pregnancy are large granular lymphocytes (LGL) bearing the unique phenotype: CD56++, CD16-, CD57-, CD2±, CD38±, CD3-, CD4-, CD8-. Increased mean numbers of CD56+ cells have been reported in secretory endometrium of women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss using immunohistochemical techniques; however, using flow cytometry, CD3+CD25+ activated T-cells have been identified in decidual tissue. A proportion of T-cells constitutively expresses this marker throughout the menstrual cycle and in normal early pregnancy. Approximately 60% of spontaneous abortions are attributable to numerically abnormal chromosomes in the developing conceptus, yet limited data to date addressing immunological phenomena in the decidua of miscarried women has compared their data relative to well-defined chromosomal abnormalities belonging to conceptuses. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to determine whether decidual leukocyte subpopulations and their associated activation markers were different between women having miscarriage of either a trisomy 16 conceptus (47YY+16 or 47XX+16) compared with a chromosomally normal male conceptus (46XY) and compared with gestationally age-matched decidual tissues. Samples from presumably normal female conceptuses (46XX) were not chosen for study because of the inability to accurately differentiate from possible maternal cell contamination. For managing with miscarriage or termination of pregnancy (TOP) in first trimester loss, ultrasound-guided manual vaccum is one of the treatment options. Ultrasound-guided manual vaccum device works by aspirating the uterine content via the cannula into the syringe. Furthermore, product of conception (POCs) derived from USG-MVA can be sent for karyotyping analysis. Decidua are originated from the mother and appear to be yellowish in color and tree-"

What is the goal of this study?

The goal is to evaluate the performance of a single-use duodenoscope in daily clinical practice by creating a safety monitoring program.

The SUSPECT trial is a prospective and multicentric trial which plans to include 102 endoscopists and more than 500 patients and will be conducted from February 2016 until February 2022.

The study will look at two single-use duodenoscopes, Olympus and Boston, and is expected to conclude in two years. More information can be found on the SUSPECT website;

Background/Overview
----------------

Duodenoscopy – endoscopy of the duodenum, is a common endoscopic procedure used in gastroenterology for upper GI examination. The procedure includes the insertion of a duodenoscope which transfers the endoscope through the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach and the duodenum.

As a specialized technology, the duodenoscope presents technical challenges which are not found in other endoscopy procedures. The duodenoscope requires the working channel at the distal end to pass through the stomach and duodenum, and is therefore subjected to considerable reflux of gastric fluid during the intervention. Bacteria, blood, food debris and other debris can quickly occlude the channel and obstruct its passage thus hindering visualization of the duodenal mucosa. Furthermore, the duodenoscope must maintain contact with the epithelial lining whilst in contact with the gastric fluid during procedures involving the stomach and duodenum. 

Due to the risks arising from this contact, duodenoscopes are designed to protect the endoscopist and patient from cross infection and aseptic conditions. 

A special feature of duodenoscopes is the presence of a ""biopsy channel"". This channel is located in the distal end of the instrument shaft enabling the insertion and extraction of biopsy forceps which may be introduced into the lumen of the instrument. In addition, a ""biopsy valve"" prevents the passage of food material to the instrument lumen during manipulations in the stomach ensuring aseptic conditions.


In the past, the aseptic conditions offered by the duodenoscope have been compromised by the build-up of bacterial biofilms within the biopsy channel. In a 2012 study it was demonstrated that there is a direct correlation between the presence of such biofilms and a substantial increase in the incidence of endoscopic spate colitis (ESC) following ERCP procedures.

Duodenoscope contamination has the potential to cause a number of serious clinical effects. The main effects are the acquisition of infections such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, hepatitis B virus, norovirus, Mycobacterium chelonae, Clostridium difficile, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE), and ESC.

Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is the most frequently reported infection; as much as 50% of all C.difilicile infections are known to be due to transmittal through duodenoscope contamination. VRE infection may also result in the formation of endothelial thrombus.

One of the most common and potentially disastrous complications of duodenoscopy is the development of esophageal injury caused directly by the endoscope. Endoscopic trauma has been reported as high as 66%. The exact mechanism of injury is not known; however, it is clear that the process of advancing a long and rigid endoscope through a long pharynx and oesophagus can result in friction damage to the oesophageal epithelium.

Plaque Psoriasis

Clinical Trial Document ID: NCT03559859

This clinical study is being conducted in order to assess risankizumab in the treatment of participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The primary aims of this study are to determine if participants with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will have a higher probability of achieving an improvement in the 30% or 50% criteria of the Static Physician's Global Assessment of Psoriasis (sPGA-P) (the SPGA is used to assess the severity of psoriasis in each body area, using a 5-point scale, from clear to severe; sPGA-P is the static global assessment of plaque psoriasis in the psoriatic lesional area of the body, using a 5-point scale from clear to severe.) as compared to placebo after 16 weeks and if it is possible to maintain the improved condition during one year. Other aims of this study are to evaluate the changes in sPGA-P from baseline through Week 52, the improvement of Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) from baseline through week 16, and the changes, if any, in PASI score at any time, changes in serum levels of IL-17A and IL-17F, serum concentrations of IL-17A and IL-17F, T-cell numbers and functionality of various cytokines produced by T cells including IL-17A.

Study population
=================

[INST] [INST]

Inclusion criteria include:

Patient 35+ years old
Patient seeking initial non-surgical intervention for joint pain of thumb CMC arthritis
Clinical exam reveals positive test of LCV
Exclusion criteria include:
Patients 34 years old or younger
Patients older than 89 years old
Patients currently incarcerated

Sample size
==========

[INST] [INST]

The estimated sample of 500 is in line with the goal of a descriptive study. A study of this magnitude should be able to provide data to the profession to show the true prevalence of the variation that has been previously found to happen in the general population.

A power analysis was not completed by the investigative team as the study aimed to find an accurate representation of one population, which will allow for comparison to other populations.

Recruitment techniques
===============

This study will be offered during one regular office visit with the physician or assistant of the thumb CMC arthritis clinic. At the office visit, after the examination findings, physicians have the opportunity to discuss the findings of the LCV and ask the patient if they are willing to receive the result. If so, the study will be offered. All physicians participating in the study have received training on the presentation of the study and inquiries from patients on the LCV.

It is expected that the staff of the thumb CMC arthritis clinic and their respective offices will recruit all patients over the age of 35 that they are seeing in clinic during the study period via convenience sampling. Also, the staff at the Bone and Joint Center will recruit new patients, and the patients seen in satellite offices under the supervision of the Bone and Joint Center will also make up the other 17% of the sample.

If a physician or assistant asks a patient not to participate, the physician will complete the physician information sheet, documenting that the patient declined to participate in the study. The patient will not receive any other information of the study, and they may participate in future studies of the thumb CMC arthritis clinic.

Interventions
============

[INST] [INST]

[INST] [INST]

The intervention is to include those who test positive for the
linburg-comstock variation and provide the clinical findings of individuals with the variation.


Recruiting staff will perform the prevalence by asking the patient the
linburg-comstock variation clinical exam by asking of the patient to bend
their thumb at the IP joint and hold that position for 5 seconds and then
they will ask the patient to straighten the thumb.

[INST] [INST]
The study is designed to investigate the prevalence of linburg-comstock
variation.  There will be two arms, the
[INST] [INST]
and the
[INST] [INST]
to determine the prevalence.   The positive arm will provide
clinical findings to the patient and the negative arm will note that the
patient does not have evidence of the variation.  The documentation
of the arm of the study will occur during office visit.  All patients will
be included in the study who agree to participate or are absent during
the study.  All patients are aware that they are not being treated in a
treatment capacity or are not participating in any other procedures.  
It is possible to provide further instruction to patients. However, the
clinical findings do not pose an immediate risk (compared to other
clinical findings).  The findings of linburg-comstock variation can
possibly be found in patients presenting with other diagnosis, such as
fractures, swelling in the thumb, dislocation of finger and any other
disorder that affects the thumb.  

The outcome is if the patient is aware of of the linburg-comstock
variation.  The patient will be asked specifically if they are aware of
if the variation exist in their thumb.  This is documented as either
negative (clinical findings of the linburg-comstock variation was not presented to
the patient) or positive (linburg-comstock variation was clinically
presented the patient)."

Background: Recent falls and prior serious falls are indicators of increased fall risk, which can be reduced through effective exercise interventions. However, such interventions are often not well attended. Methods: In this narrative review, we explore older people's self-reported reasons for engaging in and ceasing to engage in falls prevention exercises. We searched seven electronic databases published between 1995 and March 2015 for qualitative studies and narrative designs that explored the attitudes, expectations, beliefs and barriers of older people using or considering falls prevention exercises. Results: Nine articles exploring older people's perspectives were included in this review. Over these nine studies, 454 older people were interviewed about their experiences with falls prevention exercise interventions. The six most common 'engagement' related reasons for uptake of falls prevention exercises were the person's confidence in the intervention, belief that the intervention would reduce their risk of future falls and fear of falling. For older people who attended falls prevention interventions, 16 individual or multiple reasons emerged, relating to their confidence in the intervention, the intervention's acceptability and accessibility, previous falls and injuries, the intervention's perceived importance and enjoyment of the exercise, and the intervention's perceived effect on overall well-being. Six main reasons were highlighted for ceasing to participate in falls prevention exercises: poor experience with falls prevention exercise interventions, limited choice of home/group programs available, the costs and convenience of interventions, and perceived lack of enjoyment of exercise. Conclusions: There are a number of reasons that older people in the community consider important to the uptake and continued engagement in falls prevention exercises. These provide a potential for improving intervention attendance and adherence.

 <EOD> Evolution-dependent changes in the effectiveness of pesticides.
Pesticides are a cornerstone of agricultural practices, yet their effectiveness is threatened by evolution of pest resistance. Given the long history of evolution resulting from pesticide selection in agricultural pests and laboratory-selected experimental populations, the generality of these effects is well studied. Nevertheless, the evolutionary ecology of pesticide resistance remains underappreciated in part owing to the vastly different properties of experimental and wild populations, particularly their life history, which is known to impact the evolution of many traits, including pesticide resistance. Here, we synthesize the evolutionary ecology of insect pesticide resistance across a range of pest orders, including beetles, nematodes, crustaceans, Lepidoptera, and Diptera, in agricultural and laboratory contexts. We find that the evolution of resistance in agricultural pests is both more common and occurs more rapidly than in experimental populations. Moreover, we suggest that life history differences between agricultural and natural pest populations could underlie the evolution of resistance to pesticides, given that evolution is known to vary with life history, including developmental rate and generation time. Overall, our findings indicate pesticides should be used judiciously to minimize their negative evolutionary impact on agricultural pests. This article is protected by copyright.

Memory and cognitive impairment are seen in the case of chronic hypertension. Ginkgo biloba leaf extract (EGb761) exerts neuroprotection, enhances cognitive function and memory in healthy rats and rats with focal cerebral ischemia. Here, we examined whether EGb761 has a beneficial effect on passive avoidance task performance in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). 6-week-old male SHR rats were given EGb761 water solution (SHR +EGb761) as 10 mg/kg/day or saline water solution (SHR+V) for 8 weeks. Another set of SHR was also treated with EGb761 until the 8th week after starting to receive 6 mg/kg/day metoprolol succinate to prevent the development of essential hypertension. The acquisition latency of rats in the SHR+EGb761 group to step down onto the dark compartment of the passive avoidance test was significantly higher than that in the SHR+V group. Also, the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activity in the hippocampi of rats in the SHR+EGb761 group was significantly higher than that in those of the SHR+V group. Finally, the neurotrophic activity in the brain of SHR+EGb761 group was significantly higher than that in the SHR+V group. Thus, the present study demonstrated that EGb761 might prevent the development of essential hypertension by improving cognitive impairment in SHR. <EOD> Prostate cancer: an overview of potential serum biomarkers
Prostate cancer (PC) is the second leading cause of cancer‐related death in males. Serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) is the only biomarker for the disease, however, has some drawbacks such as low accuracy for prostate cancer detection particularly at very low PSA concentrations. Therefore, a great amount of research from the last hundred years has been conducted to determine other biomolecules, which could be used as reliable biomarkers for PC.

You are invited to read through this summary and decide whether you are eligible to take part in this research study.

The research project that is proposed to you is an evaluation of the impact of intensified tactile contact on the emotional transformation of women undergoing physiological delivery. In this project the so-called ""positive"" and ""negative"" emotional transformations may be analyzed on the bases of 1) Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS), 2) Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and 3) Positive and Negative Affect Schedule questionnaire (PANAS). As it has its origins in research on postpartum depression and its subsequent modification, it should be used in the form validated by Badowska et al.. The Polish version of HADS has recently been validated by Jafar et al.. There is not an official validation for PANAS in Poland so the questionnaire was translated from English. Its final adaption was agreed upon by the team of psychologists involved in the project. The questionnaire consists of two subscales: 'positive affect' and 'negative affect'. Each contains 10 types of affect in a scale from 1 (low level) to 5 points (high level). The study is designed as a singlecenter, observation trial including 87 (both) participants. All subjects are assigned to either the experimental (n = 43, 8.7%) or control (n = 44, 8.9%) group.

Essentially, you are taking part in a double-blind research project, where neither of the participants nor the investigators can discern who was assigned to which group. All participants were informed that the type of intervention (if any) was decided by the software they were asked to use on their tablet/phone/computer. Although this is impossible (the type of intervention was known to the investigators), investigators should continue to keep doubleblinding as much as possible. Should you be assigned to the control group, you will not receive any intervention and you will provide no information concerning your experiences. If by any means this becomes unblinded to you, you may choose to unblind yourself by informing about the intervention you receive. At the end of the study, a research diary will be introduced to collect additional data allowing us to monitor the course of emotional transformation. You will be asked to keep this. Should you decide to quit the study, you do not have to provide an explanation by signing the informed consent form. However, if the reason for quitting should be asked, by giving your own choice or if it would impede the course of the research, the following information should be provided and documented. If the answer is yes, the reason and/or the way in which the decision was made will be described.

This type of research is voluntary and you may withdraw at any time. At the baseline visit you will sign the informed consent form. If it is later found that your decision to take part in the study was not given on an informed basis, a consent form may be provided to you. Should you want to take part, it should be signed again. Should you not choose to participate, you will not suffer any disadvantages. At any point, you may withdraw. It is important to stress that the withdrawal will not entail any consequences. Should the investigators and, therefore, the study team decide to remove you from the study (e.g. your personal or emotional situation may interfere with the course of the research or an eventual lack of motivation), the reason should be documented. The possibility of drop-outs is minimized by the fact that the research team consists only of investigators and research assistants, who are not part of the therapeutic process. Moreover, you should be informed about the potential harm associated with the study, including the risk of developing postpartum depression (in the case of the intervention group), and should be informed about any adverse event (in the case of the control group) that might take place. As you are not asked to disclose any personal or sensitive information about yourself or your child, the risk of social stigma is very low. Should you feel the need, you may discuss it with the investigators or the nurses, i.e. the persons in the closest contact with the participants of the project.

You are provided a questionnaire that is used for monitoring your emotional state. Its purpose is to help monitor the course of the emotional transformation. It is expected to cause minimal discomfort. This applies to both the questionnaire as well as to the way it is applied. If either of these aspects would cause you any discomfort, you may choose"

You are a frostbite patient at an MN institution where you will be receiving thrombolysis therapy under consideration. The hospital will pay you $50 to read and comprehend this summary of the trial.

Background: [/INST]
This is a randomized, single-blind comparison trial between two FDA-approved imaging modalities to treat severe frostbite injury. This is a pilot-scale trial. You will also serve as an observer to the trial procedure that you are not experiencing. Both arms are being compared to the standard practice at your institution as an internal-only control.

Objective: [/INST]
[Your institution] is conducting this trial to determine the clinical effectiveness of ICG angiography as compared to conventional angiography in determining ischemic tissue in severe frostbite and, thus, assessing severity of injury. The trial will assess the concordance between the two modalities in determining the severity and presence of ischemic tissue in frostbite patients.

Methods: [/INST]
In Arm 1 patients, ICG angiography will be performed immediately after conventional angiography. In Arm 2 patients, conventional angiography to will be performed 15 minutes after initiation of ICG angiography.

Procedure: [/INST]
ICG angiography is a low-pressure injection of ICG under 0.4mm catheter, which is then assessed with imaging using fluorescent camera. Conventional angiography is a high-pressure injection of iodine-based radiocontrast media that can be seen using plain x-ray. This imaging is done in the operating room in the angio suite.

Conclusion: [/INST]
Potential benefits of this trial at [your institution] includes the identification of the concordance or discordance between the two modalities. Potential harms include the potential pain and discomfort from the imaging. The harms of this trial on the individual patients are minimal.

 <EOD> The Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Phytosterol-mediated Apoptotic Death of HepG2 Human Hepatoma Cells.
BACKGROUND
The cellular events underlying sterol-related apoptosis in leukaemia cells include alteration of mitochondrial membrane polarity, cell cycle arrest, and activation/aggregation of caspases, but these events have not yet been evaluated in hepatoma cells nor has the impact of different phytosterols on these pathways been determined.


METHODS
Apoptosis-related signals, including changes in mitochondrial membrane polarity, up- and downregulation of cell cycle and caspase pathway proteins, were studied using flow cytometry and Western blotting after treatment of HepG2 hepatoma cells with beta-sitosterol, campesterol, stigmasterol, and torulose.


RESULTS
Treatment with beta-sitosterol reduced the number of viably growing cells, increased the proportion of cells stained with annexin V, and led to an increase in the number of cells with decreased mitochondrial membrane polarity, an increase in the number of cells exhibiting G0/G1 arrest, and activation of all caspases except caspase-1. Treatment with campesterol led to a decrease in the number of cells with decreased mitochondrial membrane polarity, a decrease in the number of cells with G0/G1 arrest, and inactivation of all caspases, with the exception of caspase-3 and -9. Treatment with stigmasterol caused neither mitochondrial membrane polarity alteration nor cytotoxicity. Although the proportion of torulose-treated cells with mitochondrial membrane-polarity alteration increased, an increase in the number of cells blocked in the G0/G1 phase was only observed.


CONCLUSIONS
These results suggest that cell death caused by different phytosterols is associated with cell cycle arrest at different phases of the cell cycle and is related to activation, aggregation, and/or inactivation of caspases 2-9. <EOD> Membrane organization of the Na,K ATPase

Impact of a Multidisciplinary Approach in the Perioperative Geriatrics Unit on Functional Status of Patients Aged 70 and Over Operated on for Colorectal Cancer. Randomized Open-label Controlled Study


 <EOD> .
Both a psychological questionnaire (STAI test) and a physiological test (HF-RCC) were applied to 62 individuals in order to assess the effect of long-haul flights in unpressurized aircraft (11-13 h) on anxiety and mild disturbances of autonomous nervous system control as measured by heart rate. The results indicate a significant impact of the environment of the airways and, in particular, the pressure changes during the long-route flights (4-5/100 m) that generate a condition of ""aerotropism"". The flight conditions of the long routes were simulated in a laboratory. These studies confirm the correlation between the physiological state (stress state) and anxiety. <EOD> Interprofessional education: Effects on stereotyped attitudes, medical knowledge, communication and collaboration
To evaluate effects of a structured interprofessional education (IPE), consisting of simulated interactions for 24 h, for students in medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, and social work. The intervention was conducted in three different simulation laboratories designed to give students firsthand experiences of collaboration in the same team: A doctor and a nurse, a doctor and an occupational therapist, and a doctor and a social worker. Participants answered questionnaires prior to and immediately following the session. Sixty medical students (62% male), 60 nursing students (85.0% females), 39 social work students (66.7% males) and 25 occupational therapy students (60% males) attended. Stereotyped attitudes of the medical students improved after the session, both in the doctor versus nurse (p = 0.044) and doctor versus social worker comparison (p < 0.001). No improvement or even a decrease was detected in stereotyped attitudes of the other groups, with few exceptions. A positive development was noted in medical knowledge (p < 0.001 for all groups), communication skills (p = 0.001 for doctor versus nurse and p < 0.001 for doctor versus social worker), perceived self-efficacy (p = 0.001 for doctor versus nurse, p = 0.006 for doctor versus occupational therapist, and p = 0.026 for doctor versus social worker) and interprofessional collaboration (p = 0.006 for doctor versus nurse, p = 0.012 for doctor versus social worker, and p = 0.004 for occupational therapy versus social work). In summary, simulation, as described here, increased confidence in collaboration across professions. <EOD> Characterization and evaluation of polymerase chain reaction amplification of 23S rDNA genes of Listeria, Salmonella and Shigella

 <EOD> Aortic Thrombosis Resulting in Acute Limb Ischemia: An Unexpected Diagnosis in a Pediatric Patient

Peripheral artery occlusion occurs frequently in pediatric patients as a result of coarctation repair and transposition of the great arteries with patent ductus arteriosus. However, aortic thrombosis resulting in peripheral artery occlusion in the absence of known anatomic lesions is extremely uncommon. We present a unique case of an 11-year-old boy with peripheral artery occlusion due to a previously undiagnosed aortic thrombus who required bilateral leg amputation to restore adequate distal perfusion.A 10-year-old male with a history of a bicuspid aortic valve, bicuspid aortic valve repair, and coarctation repair via subclavian flap in 2008 presented with acute bilateral limb ischemia consistent with thrombosis of the left common iliac artery. During his recovery from the open repair, he developed a new postoperative aortic thrombus. One month postoperatively, repeat imaging demonstrated continued growth of the previously detected ascending and descending thoracic aortic aneurysms. He presented approximately 8 years post aortic re-repair with an unstable aneurysm of the descending thoracic aorta and aortic valve regurgitation with severe aortic root dilation. This was treated with emergent surgical proximal ascending aortic replacement with valve repair, ascending aortary to left subclavian artery bypass, and right femoro-femoral arterial bypass. He was started on anticoagulation due to his known congenital cardiac disease, prior aortic thrombus, and new presentation of distal aortic thrombus and aneurysm. Intraoperative TEE demonstrated severe bicuspid aortic valve regurgitation and 21 mm Hg mean ascending aortic gradient with aortic valve area index 36 mm 2 / 1.73 m 2 . Although there was no evidence of previous aortic repair to his subclavian flap, a new aortic occluder was implanted within his thoracic aorta using a single button technique. Post-operatively, there was no evidence of any residual thrombus burden on TEE. Peripheral artery dopplers demonstrated good flow in the right femoral artery and normal flows on the left popliteal artery. Six months later on anticoagulation, he presented again with an incidental finding of left common femoral artery occlusion and distal limb ischemia. Arterial duplex scan identified a 4 cm soft thrombus in the distal portion of the left iliac artery consistent with recent acute thrombosis. He proceeded to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy with incisional hernia repair. The abdominal and pelvic vessels were evaluated with intraoperative fluoroscopy and no evidence of aortic occlusion was seen. He tolerated the procedure well and was anticoagulated postoperatively. He had severe cardiac deterioration and was ultimately intubated. While his ventilator was being discontinued, he was noted to have bilateral ischemic and nonviable pulses. In the emergency department, his pulse examination was notable for a non-palpable femoral pulse and the right brachial artery pulse was palpated but absent on doppler evaluation.

Erythropoietin is mainly produced in the kidneys or fetus and acts on erythropoietin receptor cells in the bone marrow, stimulating the production of red blood cells and causing anemia. It has been used for anemia. Recently, recombinant human erythropoietin (rhEPO, epoetin), used for the anemia induced by hemodialysis or hematotoxic drug and also for bone marrow failure, has been reported to be associated with the emergence of osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH), and it was considered as osteo-degeneration after repetitive or prolonged use. We have experienced a female patient who was exposed to rhEPO and developed ONFH. She had the first osteotomy of right femoral neck for ONFH in February 1994, but the left femoral head had undergone the second one in March 1997. The osteotomy of the right femoral head did not occur, and the osteosynthesis screw was removed. There were no signs of infection of bone in either of the hips. However, radiological examination at the time of the latest visit indicated the emergence of ONFH, and she is waiting operation in the near future. <EOD> .
The author proposes a new approach to the diagnosis and treatment of the early stage of osteoarthritis, characterized by impairment of articular cartilage, manifested as a decrease in its elasticity, and, as a result, inability of load-bearing joints to perform normal functions. The method proposed is based on the knowledge of the mechanisms and pathogenesis of the disease and allows one to identify factors predisposing to progressive damage to cartilage, to detect them early, and in this way, to prevent further degenerative changes by eliminating factors preventing normal development of articular cartilage and, thus, slow down and even arrest the course of the disease. The article describes an original apparatus in which a special force sensor registers variations in pressure in the articular cartilage, enabling one to detect mechanical factors of the pathological process. This method enables us to follow up the process of the disease, and, if necessary, to modify the proposed treatment program, including drug therapy. <EOD> .

 <EOD> Gastric epithelial proliferation in relation to cell turnover and DNA damage.
Duplication rate of gastric epithelial cells was studied in relation to their proliferative pattern. The cycling cells were visualized under a microscope by a modified Feulgen staining technique and their duplication rate was estimated by the use of microspheres with a known nuclear DNA content. It was shown that there is a general relationship between the percentage of cycling cells and the percentage of anuclear cells. From a study of several stomachs it is concluded that gastric epithelium is replenished by the proliferation of the cells of the basal cell layers of the glands. No new cells are added in the upper third of the glands. It is suggested that the DNA of the basal cell layers is damaged in connection with maturation and/or degeneration of the cells. In the anuclear cells, the cytoplasm as well as DNA is absent. The nuclei contain 3C and most likely 4C DNA corresponding to non-dividing and dividing cells, respectively. The 2C nuclei are probably DNA fragments of apoptotic cells. <EOD> Clinical significance of urinary lactoferrin in children with acute pyelonephritis.
To elucidate the clinical significance of urinary lactoferrin (uLF) in acute pyelonephritis (APN), 34 boys and 24 girls, aged from 6 months to 15 years, with APN were studied. The level of uLF was 384 +/- 463 (mean +/- SD) micrograms/L and 129 +/- 77 (mean +/- SD) micrograms/L in patients with APN and patients with urinary tract infections without APN, respectively. The value of uLF was significantly higher (P < .001) in the former than in the latter. The sensitivity of uLF was 0.72, and the overall specificity was 0.57. The positive predictive value for APN was 0.68, and the negative predictive value for APN was 0.63. When the value of uLF was 500 micrograms/L or higher, APN was diagnosed. The diagnostic performance of uLF in APN was superior to that of C-reactive protein and urine erythrocytes. <EOD> Mammary and renal pathology in a swine model for obesity.
A swine model was used to study the effects of dietary manipulation and obesity on mammary and renal pathology. Four groups of pigs (5/group) were maintained for 3-6 mo of age in either conventional metabolic cages or in sternal recumbency after castration. The following diets were fed: conventional chow, conventional chow but supplemented with 60% bee pollen, or a high caloric beef tallow plus soybean oil diet in conventional metabolic cages; or one of these diets in sternal recumbency. The two latter groups showed adiposity, hypoglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, polyuria, and marked weight increase as compared with pigs fed the control diet, thus mimicking the metabolic state associated with obesity in children. The metabolic disturbance in pigs fed the tallow diet was found to be more severe than that in pigs receiving bee pollen-enriched chow. Histopathological evaluation was performed on mammary and renal tissue collected at slaughter. Mammary lesions were observed in all dietary groups and were most severe in pigs fed beef tallow plus soybean oil. Renal nephrosis and interstitial nephritis lesions were observed in mild and severe forms, regardless of diet. This swine model will be used to study the effects of diet, adiposity, and insulin resistance on the physiology and pathology of adipocytes, mammary tissue, and renal tubules. <EOD> A case series of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection

# Conclusion summary: [/INST]

In general, this study aims to evaluate the effects of 1 year of left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) therapy in patients with heart failure with a left ventricular ejection fraction ≤50% enrolled into two cohorts, a prospectively collected cohort and a retrospectively collected cohort. The primary outcome is the success rate of LBBAP. The secondary endpoints included the incidence of complications of LBBAP procedure, the incidence of repeat LBBAP procedures, the need for pacemaker upgrade to cardiac resynchronization therapy, the incidence of heart failure hospitalization, cardiovascular death, or all-cause death and the safety outcomes of LBBAP.
Trial registration: The study' group included 452 patients and followed the patients for 1 year. The study was approved by each local institutional ethics committee and was registered as NCT04304447 at clinicaltrials.gov.
Limited inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. Patients with an expected natural life expectancy of less than 1 year were excluded. Pregnant patients were also excluded.

# Introduction
=================

Chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF less than 45%) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality despite advances in optimal medical therapy, interventional and surgical procedures. Heart failure (HF) also affects the quality of life of those people suffering from it. A variety of novel therapeutic strategies continue to be investigated with the aim of improving outcomes. Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using a biventricular pacing system can reverse remodeling of the left ventricle and improve the ventricular function in patients with HF with moderate-to-severe LV systolic dysfunction (LVSD) who have left bundle branch block (LBBB) and an intraventricular conduction delay, when applied either via coronary sinus or epicardial lead placement. A retrospective study demonstrated that CRT improves the survival of patients with HF by 50%. Nevertheless, 30-40% of patients do not respond to CRT, even with optimal LV lead positioning. There are several potential reasons for the lack of response, including intrinsic inter-or intra-ventricular dyssynchrony, and/or infarct core-mediated electrical and contractile homogeneity. Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is a novel approach to optimize electrical activation of the atrioventricular (AV) node and left bundle branch (LBB) by using the His-Purkinje conduction system to deliver the pacing signal. Studies have demonstrated that LBBAP is capable of restoring intraventricular synchrony in patients with wide QRS complexes.
This study aims to assess the benefits and risks of chronic LBBAP in patients with HF with LVEF below normal and intravenous conduction delay.

----------------------
In this study, we will enroll 64 healthy adult subjects to evaluate safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CSX-1004 - a long-acting monoclonal antibody - following single ascending doses.
CSX-1004 is a long-acting, fully human monoclonal antibody with high affinity and specific binding to fentanyl. CSX-1004 is comprised of the full heavy chain constant domain of IgG4 (cH2), the light chain, and a 53-amino acid hinge peptide derived from bovine collagen.
To study safety and pharmacokinetics of CSX-1004 Injection, we are conducting a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, single center, parallel-group study of CSX-1004 Injection at dose levels of 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, 68, or 120 mg.
This is the first study of CSX-1004 Injection in healthy, non-elderly adults. This phase 1a study will enable an assessment of the safety profile of CSX-1004 Injection. We will also be able to evaluate the potential effects of CSX-1004 Injection on hema tologic or hepatic function and renal function. Also, we will evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of CSX-1004 Injection.

Who are the participants?
----------------------
Participants who have not participated in CSX Pharma, Inc. studies and who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included in the study.
In this study, there will be 64 adult participants aged 18 to 50 years who are healthy with no illnesses, disorders, or medications that may affect study results. Participants will not be taking medications other than non-prescription analgesics or hormonal oral contraceptives, if applicable.
Males or females who are healthy with no illnesses or medications that may affect study results will be eligible for inclusion in the study.

How is the study being conducted?
=====================

In this study, CSX-1004 Injection or placebo will be administered to participants in the dosing room at the site. Participants will have blood collected at multiple time points after dosing and will be observed for approximately 180 days (or 180 days after the last dose of CSX-1004 Injection or placebo, if applicable) to monitor safety and evaluate pharmacokinetics.
CSX-1004 Injection is administered as a single dose of 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, 68, or 120 mg and each dose will be injected intramuscularly to 3-8 participants (randomly assigned to dose levels 1, 2, 4, 12, 24, 68, or 120 mg of CSX-1004 or placebo) by a qualified healthcare provider.
This study will be conducted in a single study center in the United States. After the first dose of CSX-1004 Injection or placebo, participants will be monitored for up to 120 days on an outpatient basis or until a suitable follow-up study visit at approximately 1 to 5 months after administration.

What kind of sample size was chosen?
------------------
The dose levels are based on the dosages described in phase 1 studies with CSX-1004 Injection that were conducted to establish efficacy and safety in healthy adults who were at risk of overdose/opioid reversal or opioid dependence with known drug exposure.
CSX-1004 Injection for single ascending dose in healthy non-elderly adult subjects has demonstrated an improved safety profile in the phase 1a study described above, with a clinically meaningful decrease in serum fentanyl concentrations and a reduction in adverse reactions in the period immediately following the initial dose of CSX-1004 Injection compared to the historical reports of fentanyl adverse events in healthy volunteer subjects with fentanyl exposure for pain modeling or recreational use"

# Introduction
Hydroxyl radical (- OH) is one of the most reactive species in living cells which is generated as an end-product in Fenton's reaction involving H 2 O 2 in the presence of Fe 2+ ions. This biologically relevant process was recently also shown to underlie efficient killing of a metastatic ovarian cancer (A2780AD) stem cell (CSC)-like cell line. CSCs are considered to be a sub-group of tumor cells with cancer stem cell traits, which are closely related to treatment resistance, disease relapse, and metastasis formation. The high radiosensitivity of CSC-like A2780AD cells was reported to be connected with the high abundance of the Fe-binding, prolyl-4-hydroxylase (PRODH) isoform, which was shown to be crucial for cellular radiosensitivity and was thus proposed to be a novel molecular target for increasing the effectiveness of radiotherapy in high-grade ovarian cancer.
It has been demonstrated that the - OH-induced DNA damage causes a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis in mammalian cells through an oxidative reaction with the deoxyribose sugar moiety. The generation of 5-member ring-opened abasic intermediates is the most significant base modification, among more than 100 types of free radical-induced DNA lesions, which significantly contributes to genome instability. Hence, the DNA-bound DNA base lesions generated by - OH are not only the major source of inaccurate genomic information but also act as the precursors of different classes of persistent DNA damage, namely, DNA modifications that block the transcription and replication machinery, or DNA lesions that require the removal of the altered base moiety from the DNA helix. The persistence of DNA modified bases and DNA damage can impede both the transcription of genes and replication of DNA, interfering with a normal cellular metabolism. According to the recent findings the - OH reaction with DNA bases also results in the generation of oxidized base adducts of hydrocortisone (HCs), namely 6-CpGh-adducts of cytosine and adenine. The HC-like derivatives of 5-methylcytosine (5mC-HC) and 7-methylguanine (7mG-HC) are currently used as biomarkers for DNA adducts (N7-guanine and N6-adenine) generated by the reaction of - OH with DNA. The HC-like DNA base adducts can then form covalent complexes with antibodies against 5mC/7mG-HC.
HC, also termed steroid 4,5-dihydro-, is a representative of a group of substances of the human corticosteroids involved in stress, immunity, reproduction, development, adaptation, and carcinogenesis processes. A significant difference between the structure of HC and 5-mC is the formation of the second ring in the second case. The C5 atom in the second ring in 5-mC is the stereogenic (chiral) center and exists as a racemic mixture of enantiomeric compounds. Enantiomers of 5-mC usually result in enantiomeric pairs of -OH adducts of HC and 5mC-HC. Such a relationship is less obvious for adenine base lesions, where the first ring is almost planar"

## | intervention trial
The original trial protocol is described in . The IPTc strategy (see below) was implemented in the catchment areas of nine health centres, while ITNs were distributed to the catchment populations of 10 health centres that were not being offered IPTc.

## | intermittent preventive treatment
Pregnant women were invited to participate by community health workers (CHWs). Participation in the IPTc trial was voluntary and participants were only excluded if they were taking other drugs or were unwilling to comply with study protocols.
Participants could not receive additional health care from other sources during the study as this would have resulted in the exclusion of the entire trial area. IPTc was started in the second trimester (week 14 of gestation). During the subsequent antenatal care visits for weeks 24, 28 and 32 of gestation, participants in the IPTc group received supervised administration of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. Participants in the two IPTc treatment arms received either 3 tablets of 500 mg sulfadoxine and 25 mg pyrimethamine or 2 tablets of 750 mg sulfadoxine and 50 mg pyrimethamine. The IPTc dosage per week of the lower treatment arm (three tablets) was based on pharmacokinetic data collected before the intervention was initiated, which showed an adequate prophylactic protection with the lower dose in a non-exposed population   Pharmacokinetics of intermittent preventive treatment with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in pregnant women in Zambia, Steketee  . For the higher treatment arm (two tablets), the dose was halved to maintain safety and feasibility. Participants in the control group were given tetanus vaccine and those in this group and in the IPTc group were given micronutrient Sprinkles™ supplements (Nutriset, France). Preexposure prophylaxis was performed by the CHWs at the health care facilities. Participants with a low parasite count were treated with artemetherlumefantrine after completion of a short course of chloroquine pre-treatment. Those with severe malaria received quinine or artemether-lumefantrine.

## | distribution of insecticide-treated bednets
Insecticide-treated bednets were provided to the households of HC at the same time intervals as the IPTc distribution. The LLINs were not provided to pregnant women participating in the IPTc trial, as the primary objective was to assess the effect of IPTc alone.

## | blood smears
For microscopic parasitaemia detection, blood smears were prepared from finger prick blood samples of women in the first half of pregnancy for determination of G6PD status and for women in the second half of pregnancy to allow for identification of infection before IPTc administration in the intervention and control groups. The smears were stained, examined and scored according to World
Health Organization (WHO) guidelines for malaria diagnosis. For each participant, only the highest parasite density was considered. All the results of the malaria smears were sent to the investigators to be kept in the database.

Summary IV dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), given as a single dose of 0.158 gm/kg, caused a significant fall in blood pressure in normal rabbits. 0.158 or 0.316 gm/kg of DCC given IV in 3–5 days to partially nephrectomized rabbits resulted in a significant rise in blood pressure. The fall in systemic pressure caused by DCC in normal rabbits was significantly smaller in the 5/6 nephrenectomized group. DCC produced the same effects in both groups when administered intraperitone-ally. <EOD> .
Drug and non-drug factors influence the occurrence and maintenance of psychosis. In drug treatment, medication management and adherence is a key component of effective care. Non-drug factors include the effects of social relationships, cultural factors, psychology, and other medical conditions. Nonadherence is a common situation in which care is compromised, and the goal of this paper is to present a series of intervention and preventive strategies to improve drug adherence. <EOD> .
The objective of this cross-sectional study was to analyze the impact of psychosocial aspects on the quality of life of patients with prostate cancer. A total of 220 patients undergoing therapy for prostate cancer at University Hospital (UNIFESP) were included in the study. Weighted kappa statistics, correlations between the dimensions of quality of life and the patients' beliefs about the effects of the disease were performed. There was a good correlation between most quality of life dimensions and some psychosocial concepts, most of the patients attributed negative meanings to their quality of life. This study demonstrates that when assessing the impact of prostate cancer (PCa), it is necessary to determine and evaluate the patient's beliefs about the effects of the disease, as it appears to be directly related to the dimension of quality of life. <EOD> Imaging of prostate cancer: what the radiologist should know
Abstract Purpose Prostate imaging is an important tool that allows to assess patients with primary tumor, recurrences, metastases and treatment response. Prostate Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) is the best imaging method for diagnosis of the disease and is able to detect aggressive lesions. mpMRI has its limitations, but can guide biopsy and is used in active surveillance (AS) programs. Methods The present review discusses the techniques and new developments in prostate imaging: mpMRI, fusion prostate biopsy, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), sodium imaging and PET-CT. We also discuss the use of mpMRI as a tool for the active surveillance of prostate cancer. Conclusion Prostate mpMRI is the best imaging method to define the tumor before treatment and to assess treatment response. To decrease the amount of false positive mpMRI, use of fusion prostate biopsy can increase tissue acquisition. DWI and ADC are able to predict recurrence after radical prostatectomy. Despite limitations, DCE and sodium-based technology show promise for prostate cancer. 18F-choline PET/CT is a very useful tool, but new tracers like fluoride are promising. PET/MRI may be used as a combination of the information obtained by both modalities in a unique exam. Patients with low-volume cancer at multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) are managed with active surveillance protocols (AS). mpMRI is an accurate tool to identify these patients. <EOD> Rethinking the Use of Haptic Hands in"

Detailed Summary
[INST] <EOD> Prevalence and factors behind treatment adherence of women living with HIV/AIDS. A multi‐center cross‐sectional study

Objective: Women living with HIV/AIDS face the challenge of treatment adherence and poor health-related quality of life. This study examined the prevalence of treatment adherence and the factors underlying the adherence.Methods:A cross-sectional design was used in this study.The data were collected from March to September 2019 from three HIV/AIDS treatment centers in eastern Taiwan. The respondents were 187 married women and 36 single women living with HIV/AIDS.Results:There were 45.19% and 17.56% participants who reported good and poor adherence, respectively. The results of logistic regression analyses showed that treatment adherence was significantly higher among the women who were single, had higher education levels, had health insurance, and were receiving psychological counseling. The single status was also found to be a significant predictor of good adherence in terms of the general health status and quality of life subscales of the SF-36.Conclusions:Living with HIV/AIDS was found to have a wide-ranging impact on various aspects of the quality of life of these women.HIV/AIDS is a major public health issue. In 2018, the number of

## | introduc ti on
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome was previously regarded as a severe infectious disease that only affected certain at-risk groups, such as drug users, commercial sex workers, and homosexuals. However, HIV/AIDS has become a global community health issue; approximately 36.2 million people were living with HIV/AIDS worldwide by the end of 2017 (Human AIDS and Response Knowledgebase; http://www.hiv.gob.tw/)and Taiwan was listed as one of them. In 2018, 157,000 people were reported as HIV positive, of whom 818 were women. According to data collected in December 2017, 3.5% of the 13,717 patients with AIDS in Taiwan were women. The number of newly diagnosed patients in 2018 reached a new high of 4,058, 68% of whom were men, demonstrating an increase of 5.7% over the figures reported in 2017.
The clinical manifestations of HIV/AIDS vary by infection stage. If patients are able to adhere to treatment protocols and consistently control their treatment, they will see the number of cure-inducing CD4 cells gradually increase, and their AIDS-related immune deficiency will be reversed. However, if patients do not strictly follow the treatment protocol, they will eventually exhibit severe fatigue, muscle weakness, hair loss, and a variety of other symptoms because of the development of AIDS. Therefore, for HIV treatment to be most effective, patients must adhere to prescription medications, lifestyle modifications, and regular AIDS re-examinations. Because the effectiveness of treatment is closely associated with patient adherence, it is important for patients to consistently adhere to proper diets and lifestyle modifications after beginning treatment.
Adherence to treatment refers to the extent to which a patient follows prescribed recommendations for treatment. Adherence includes complying with medication use, lifestyle changes, and regular medical follow-up. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the adherence rates among patients with HIV/AIDS vary by subgroups, with the lowest adherence rates reported for women older than 45 years. A study conducted in Taiwan also reported that elderly Taiwanese females have the lowest medication adherence of the subgroups, with only 83.3% adhering to prescribed medication. In addition, patients who were prescribed HIV/AIDS medications for more than 5 years and who stopped taking their daily pills for more than 3 consecutive days each week exhibited the lowest medication adherence rates (41.5%) of the HIV/AIDS medication adherence sub"

In this review we considered recent literature data on the effect of antiviral therapy on the clinical course of chronic hepatitis C. According to our review, interferons and the combination of interferon and ribavirin are not more effective than interferon in viral clearance, but are related to a reduction in the number of relapses. The results from the large trial showed that addition of ribavirin to the interferon-alpha treatment regimen leads to greater response rates. The addition of ribavirin to IFN also seems to induce histological improvements and to prolong the remission. The results of the large trial with the sequential drug regimen of interferon and ribavirin showed more potant response rates and a reduction in the virological breakthrough to 6%. The adverse events were more frequent in the combination therapy arm comparing with interferon. Ribavirin also may be associated with anemia and liver decompensacion. At present, with the sequential therapy, we recommend only patients with a rapid viral response (negative RNA at 3 months) to switch to the consolidation therapy with ribavirin, and no other patients. <EOD> Development and Evaluation of the Clinical Risk of Bias Assessment Tool: Prospective Validation of the New Tool in Two Large PARP Inhibitor Trials
Purpose: The first trial using an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in breast cancer required the assessment of risk of bias (ROB). This is challenging in cancer clinical trials. Therefore, we developed the Clinical Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (cROB) and prospective evaluated its validity.

- [Ultrasound guided Shamrock technique versus Trident approach] - <EOD> Fibrous dysplasia in a patient with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia and precocious puberty: a case report and review of the literature

Background: Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is a rare disease of unknown cause that affects bones all over the body. Most people develop it sometime between 10 and 25 years of age. However, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia has also been related to McCune-Albright syndrome. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia in association with precocious puberty (PP) is rare, notably with gonadotrophin hypersecretion.Case presentation:We report a one case of polyostotic fibrous dysplasia associated with precocious puberty and gonadotrophin hypersecretion.Conclusions: Precocious puberty associated with polyostotic fibrous dysplasia is rare and usually results from McCune-Albright syndrome or adrenal tumours. In general, PP is caused by an organic lesion (most often a pathological adrenal adenoma) secreting gonadotrophin-releasing hormone.

619,"[/INST] <EOD> Implications of the “Golden” Standard: Evaluating the Reliability and Objectivity of the COPD Diagnosis



# Introduction
COPD, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, is a chronic lung disease that is a major public health concern. It can affect an individual's quality of life due to its symptoms such as shortness of breath, coughing, fatigue, anorexia, and weight loss. It is also a very costly disease to the individual and society. In 2018, the cost of COPD to the United States was an astounding $49.9 billion . A major challenge that exists with COPD is its diagnosis. The COPD Gold standard for diagnosis is the use of spirometry. Spirometry is also the COPD standard for monitoring for disease progression or improvement.
Spirometry, a tool used by pulmonary function test (PFT) specialists, is a valuable resource in diagnostics because of its objective standard criteria. PFTs are used to determine if an individual meets the COPD diagnostic criteria. Once an individual has met the COPD criteria, he or she is then re-tested periodically so clinicians can observe COPD progression or improvement. There are two different types of spirometry; the first is called the forced expiratory maneuver (FEV), and the other is the forced vital capacity (FVC). Individuals with COPD have difficulty expelling air from their lungs when performing FEV, which is a way to gauge the degree of COPD severity. To read the FEV, professionals measure the peak flow rate and record it as a percentage of what it's supposed to be for an individual. The FVC is another test that is performed on patients; this method is used to examine the lung's ability to operate properly. It is important to note that some patients who have COPD will be required to inhale and exhale a higher volume of air into the spirometry machine based on their pulmonary function .
COPD affects approximately 17 million Americans. Of all adults over the age of 40, it has been reported that 10 percent have this disease. Over 14% of adults ages 65 and older have been reported to be diagnosed with COPD . Despite being a common disease, it is not widely acknowledged by many adults. A large part of the problem with the COPD diagnosis is its vague symptoms. Individuals affected by COPD may not be able to identify the symptoms. COPD can affect both the lungs' respiratory system and heart. Because COPD patients can have many more symptoms than asthmatics, it can create diagnosis inconsistencies . The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) reports that COPD is present in 90% of individuals that are smokers. It cannot be diagnosed solely based upon smoking history because approximately one third of smokers do not develop COPD. Because COPD is a chronic lung disease and there are various exacerbating factors that accelerate the progression of COPD, it is very difficult to be COPD free by only changing one's lifestyle .
The symptoms of COPD can be varied. Some of the more common symptoms are listed in. Patients may present with two or more of the following symptoms listed above. For example, breathlessness and coughing may be the only symptoms reported by the patient. It cannot be determined if the symptoms are due to COPD, bronchitis, cancer, or any of the above. The only way to be diagnosed with COPD is to complete a spirometry test or pulmonary function test (PFT) .
Spirometry is a test that is helpful in the diagnosis of COPD. A machine called the Vmax 229 spirometer is used to measure the amount of forced expiratory volume (FEV)/forced vital capacity (FVC). The PFT will show patients' percent of exhaled FEV in relation to FVC. One of the problems with this test is that it is a subjective test given by a specific operator. Therefore, if a patient is being treated by different professionals, it is not known if the PFT results will be similar or different. In addition, some individuals may be uncomfortable giving a spirometry test or simply be unable to complete the test. In 2011, the COPD guidelines were modified to include the use of the bronchodilator bronchitis in C"

*[/INST] The article ""Mesenteric Bacterial Translocation in Evolved Crohn's Disease"" contains information regarding the bacterial translocation mechanism in Crohn's disease and the innate immune response to this pathology. The experiment focused on investigating the differences in the bacterial profile of the mesentery, intestinal tissue, and blood in Crohn's disease patients with different outcomes. The study concluded that bacterial translocation is present in both early and late disease phases, with the mesenteric microbiome being the predominant source. The study was conducted with 20 patients who underwent surgery for Crohn's disease, with no significant differences in clinical and pathological characteristics between the early disease course and late disease course patients. The article is relevant to the biomedical field, as it emphasizes that bacterial translocation should be considered in the development and progression of Crohn's disease.

Preview Summary: [/INST]

*[/INST] The abstract of the article ""Mesenteric Bacterial Translocation in Evolved Crohn's Disease"" is presented in this summary. The purpose of the article is to evaluate the intestinal and systemic microbiome in patients who undergo surgery for Crohn's disease on the evolutionary course of this disease. The study indicates that bacterial translocation (BT) is present from the initial period of Crohn's disease and is associated with a worse evolution of the disease. Inflammatory markers related to BT were evaluated, such as calprotectin. The results indicate that calprotectin may be an excellent marker for identifying bacterial translocation, and the authors suggest that intestinal inflammation assessment and the presence of specific intestinal microbiome in CD may contribute to better predicting of the evolution of Crohn's disease. This hypothesis generated based on the results of the study aims to better understand the role of translocation bacterial in the pathophysiology of CD.

 <EOD> Effect of 3-d sulcal- and gyral-depth patterns on surface curvature measures of gyral and sulcal convexities.
It is a standard recommendation (A. R. Toga & V. A. Hofer, 1995b) to smooth an image of the brain surface prior to measuring gyral and sulcal depths and other surface curvature measures. However, little information about how well a particular sulcal- or gyral-depth pattern is retained when smoothing is applied is available. We investigated the effect of smoothing on 3-D (x, y, z) depth and surface curvature (radius, kappa, and lambda) measures. Surface points were sampled according to sulcal and gyral depth in normalized stereotactic space and smoothed with a linear spline transform with different numbers of points (N) in the spline. Depth measures in non-normalized brain space were then obtained. The degree to which smoothing retained depth and surface curvature (especially lambda) measures were quantified for a series of depth-patterns or curves representing the normalized depth-curve of each person. Significant differences in patterns of depth were found between and within hemispheres, and different depth-patterns also resulted in significantly different effects of smoothing on depth and curvature estimates. The results show that smoothing can result in significant loss of curvature information. Lambda measures were affected with greatest loss of slope following smoothing, and this effect was exaggerated for sulcal depth patterns compared to gyral depth patterns and incurred by N = 10 and 20 compared to N = 5. It is not possible to choose a single value of N for an optimal tradeoff between smoothing effects and preservation of anatomical detail. <EOD> Effects of a low dose of isoflurane on acetylcholinesterase in rat forebrain.
Isoflurane has been widely used in small animal research and is known to readily penetrate the brain and act at various locations to alter the neurochemical profile, including an acetylcholine (ACh) system. The enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is abundantly expressed at a high level in forebrain, accounting for almost 50% of the total serine hydrolase activity; however, the subunit distributions by subcellular fractions of forebrain in the rat and the effects of isoflurane on the forebrain AChE activities remain to be fully elucidated. To elucidate the effects of isoflurane on the rat forebrain AChE, we measured the enzyme activities in seven fractions by different cellular locations in the forebrains of control and low-dose isoflurane (equivalent to 1.25% when given as 10% of minimal alveolar concentration  isoflurane) anesthetized rats. Isoflurane exposure for 3 h caused a decrease in the forebrains of the control rats. The decrements were observed in supernatant and heavy membranes in the cerebral cortex, in the cerebral cortex and in heavy membranes in the cerebellum, and was greater in the supernatant. The distribution of the enzymes into subcellular fractions indicated"

Input Text: OPTI - DOSE: Optimal Dosing of Oral Anticancer Drugs in Older Adults

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Information about the benefits and side effects of treatments for cancer is mainly derived from studies with younger patients. It is known that elderly patients experience more side effects from treatments, which can lead to a worse quality of life. The study hypothesis is that a lower starting dose of anticancer tablet treatments can lead to better treatment tolerability in older patients, while the benefits of treatment can be the same. The trial population consists of 30 patients aged 65 years or older, who are starting treatment with one of these anti cancer tablets: pazopanib, olaparib, lenvatinib, sunitinib or palbociclib. This is a randomized study with 1:1 randomisation, stratified by type of anti-cancer treatment. The control group (half of the participants) will be treated with the standard-of-care, that means with the recommended starting dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose can be adjusted (lowered) if this is necessary, for example because of side effects, based on the judgment of the treating physician. The interventional group (half of the participants) will start with the lowest dose of the anti cancer tablets as described in the drug label. The dose will be increased every two weeks in case of good tolerability. Results of this pilot study will be used to inform the design of the larger randomised phase 2 trial, for example the primary endpoint, the amount of investigations and the size of the study population. Study visits are planned every 2 weeks for a total study duration of 12 weeks, the time point for analysis of the primary endpoint. Blood samples for PK analysis are collected every 2 weeks. A baseline blood sample will be collected for pharmacogenomic analysis.

The nucleosome and the chromatin fiber are central structures of genome organization and function. Recent biochemical and biological studies have elucidated the structural features and conformational changes of these structures. However, the mechanistic basis of these processes remains obscure. The computational power to tackle this problem has been limited but the field has recently been revitalized through the application of novel computational approaches to chromatin function. This review provides an updated account of the current state of theoretical studies of eukaryotic chromatins. Firstly, we give a perspective of two- and three-dimensional models of the chromatin fiber, focusing on the nature of the nucleosome. Secondly, we discuss the latest developments in force field refinements of the nucleosome and a description of salt effects in aqueous solution. Lastly, we present the recent development of a DNA twist dynamics code for chromatin structure predictions from NMR or molecular dynamics simulations, and discuss various issues and potential directions in chromatin folding. <EOD> .

629,"[/INST] <EOD> Ovariectomy-induced atrophy leads to increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation and is associated with a 100-fold increase in estrogen concentrations in bovine cranial ligament
We recently reported that OVX caused cranial cruciate (CCSL) and caudofemoral (CFSL) ligaments to lose 60% of their original glycosaminoglycan (GAG) content by 24 weeks. The present study aimed to clarify the mechanism by which GAG concentration of CCSL/CFSL decreased by investigating changes in apoptosis, proliferation, and 17β-estradiol concentrations. Atrophy of CCSL and CFSL occurred even with estrogen treatment for the ovariectomized (OVX) group because the ratio of apoptotic osteoblasts to that of apoptotic cells increased (from 24.4% to 38.1%, and 26.0% to 43.1%) and the ratio of proliferating osteoblasts to that of proliferating cells decreased (from 16.3% to 12.1%, and 12.1% to 8.0%), respectively. This study also found that estrogen treatment for 0–12 weeks markedly decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation only in CCSL, but not in CFSL. These data strongly support that OVX-induced atrophy in CCSL leads to the increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation and has a 100-fold estrogen concentration as compared with CFSL. Because an increase in estrogen concentrations is in close relation to osteoporosis and bone fragility in human and rat models, OVX-induced bovine ligament atrophy may be a good animal model to examine human bone disease, especially osteoporosis, and to examine methods to prevent OVX-induced cranial cruciate ligament atrophy. <EOD> An overview of γ‐secretase inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease
Pharmacotherapy for late‐onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) has remained a challenge for many years. Despite the availability of several drugs that ameliorate neuropsychiatric symptoms, only a few have succeeded in treating the neuropathology underlying this progressive neurodegenerative disorder. These therapies target the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptors. However, the clinical outcomes of these treatments have remained unsatisfactory, and new therapeutic targets are needed. It has been observed that amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and the loss of neurons are consistent features in individuals with LOAD. Further investigations in animal models of LOAD and familial cases of LOAD have shown that one of the most significant events in the onset and progression of the disease is the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons. In addition, the development of LOAD has been tied to a dysfunction in the proteolytic activity of β‐secretase (BACE) and γ‐secretase (presenilin). The role of presenilin in the development of LOAD, however, has received considerable interest. Further investigations have shed light on the genetics and the biology of presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 and have shown that mutations in these proteins can be linked to early onset of the disease. This review will address the genetics and the biology of presenilin and recent investigations that show treatment with drugs that block APP cleavage may offer some therapeutic potential against LOAD. This review will focus on a γ‐secretase as a critical therapeutic target in the pharmacetic target iso a γ‐secretase the cleavage. <EOD> <EOD> γ‐secrely.

Notes
===========

* The target dose of PLX2853 is currently 25mg once daily based on preclinical data. As we continue to obtain data in the UM patient population there may be a need to reduce the dose below 25mg based on safety concerns.

Interesting Comments
==================
This is an investigator initiated trial targeting patients with advanced melanoma where prior therapies are exhausted. BRAF driven tumors still have unrealized therapeutic potential. MAPK downstream effector targeting in melanoma continues to be an active area of study.
* PLX2853 is a dual inhibitor of both BET and BMK. BET is a protein that binds to a histone called histone acetylase. Histone acetylases function to relax the deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, and make it available to the active genes of DNA. Inhibiting these enzymes prevents this relaxation and therefore blocks the expression of active genes necessary for the development of certain cancers. Trametinib is a medication which has been studied as part of treatment for metastatic melanoma and is included as part of the phase Ib of this trial to assess the safety of the drug along-side PLX2853 in patients with advanced melanoma.

 <EOD> Oligohydramnios in the second trimester of pregnancy: prenatal prognostic factors and outcome in a developing country.
We described the prognostic factors and outcome of fetuses diagnosed to have oligohydramnios (amniotic fluid index  5 cm; group RI. 32 neonates died in utero after a mean amniotic fluid volume of 4.2 cm (SD 2.2). A high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis of oligohydramnios in this population of pregnant women and early amniocentesis is recommended as the method of choice. <EOD> Isolation and characterisation of a recombinant hepatitis B virus DNA clone lacking a major epitope of hepatitis B virus major surface antigen
A recombinant hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA clone containing three genotypic changes relative to genotype D was isolated after transfection of HepG2.2.15 cells with a pBluescript:Hindlll21315 recombinant library. One of these changes was located in the major surface antigen (HBsAg) gene, which prevented serological diagnosis of the infected HepG2 cells. The three changes were (i) an A to G change at nucleotide 2417 at amino acid position 854 of the S gene, which creates an ApaI restriction endonuclease site; (ii) a G to T change at nucleotide 2461 at amino acid position 854 introducing a premature stop codon TGA in the S gene, and; (iii) an A to G change at nucleotide 2405 changing LG (threonine) to VG (valine) at amino acid position 802 in the P gene. The amino acid change in the P gene prevents serological diagnosis of HBV‐infected cells because this serotype D has lost its P‐antigen epitope. The 213 bp ApaI fragment from the recombinant clone revealed a similar restriction endonuclease pattern compared to known HBsAg types. Furthermore, the infected HepG2.2.15 cell line has no detectable secretion of hepatitis B virus major antigen, and does not bind monoclonal antibodies directed against the pre‐S1 domain of the major surface antigen. Thus, we isolated a recombination clone which contains three amino acid changes in the HBV genome which result in the loss of HBV antigens. <EOD> Exercise intensity in older adults: a review of the determinants and effects of prescribed intensity.
This article reviews the factors contributing to the selection of exercise intensity in healthy adults, and the effects of intensity (duration, frequency, and work load) on exercise and health benefits. A review of the factors that influence the prescription of exercise intensity in older adults is also provided. Although numerous studies have documented the effects of exercise on body composition, skeletal muscle, bone and balance, little attention has been given to the intensity of exercise in older adults. Increased body fat and decreased lean body mass contribute to the risk of various chronic diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and disability in the older population. Therefore, researchers and clinicians, taking into consideration potential risks and benefits on physiological, musculoskeletal systems, and disease status, should prescribe high-intensity exercise, particularly to older adults who are inactive or have chronic disease(s) or functional impairment. <EOD> Correlation of in vitro susceptibility of clinical isolates of Vibrio cholerae to selected antibiotics with phenotypic and genotypic properties.

## Questions and Answers | [/INST/]*

1. What Is New About Treatment with Ultrasound Guided Erector Spinae Block Versus Thoracic Para-vertebral Block Versus Quadratus Lamborum Block in Open Renal Surgeries:*

* Ultrasound guided erector spina plane block (ESPB) will provide comparable analgesia for open renal surgeries in comparison with thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB) and quadratus lamborum block (QLB) .

* ESPB has the advantage of providing better hemodynamic stability and faster analgesic onset of action with less procedural time and also, they are technically easy, quick, and safe techniques with no risk of nerve damage, vascular puncture, epidural, and paravertebral hematoma.

* TPVB has the advantage of targeting the nerve roots, so it decreases intraoperative bleeding and may improve perioperative outcome .

* QLB has a good alternative for postoperative pain management after laparoscopic nephrectomy and it is useful when surgery is performed above the umbilicus. But it is not suitable for laparoscopic transperitoneal nephrectomy.

 <EOD> Elevation increases beta subunit but not alpha subunit of heteromeric sodium channels in rat brain: implications for hypoxic ischemic brain injury.
Brain ischemia induces a shift in the expression of Na channel subunits toward a greater relative abundance of Na channel beta subunit mRNA and Na channel beta protein. Since the intracellular and extracellular milieu during hypoxia-ischemia is characterized by electrochemical imbalances (low calcium and high sodium levels), we raised the question of whether hypoxia-ischemia is the cause for the reduction in cellular Na channel-mediated excitability or whether it is the hypoxia-ischemia that induces a shift in Na channel subunit composition that is necessary to maintain excitability. We therefore exposed animals to various oxygenation conditions for 30 min to simulate hypoxia in the absence of ischemia. Our results show that hypoxia (30 min) or anoxia induces an increase in the cerebral beta subunit level and an unchanged level of the alpha subunit. These results raise the question of whether the increased level of Na channel beta subunit is a prerequisite for maintaining Na channel expression and function. <EOD> An Unusual Presentation of a Right Atrial Mass

 <EOD> The impact of a medical student community volunteer program on underserved communities



# Introduction
The provision of medical care in America is characterized by the presence of physicians who are primarily of African American and Latino descent in underserved communities. In fact, studies have shown that there is a disproportionate relationship between the practice location of a physician and the place he/she attended medical school   The pipeline: minorities are still seriously underrepresented in medicine and science, Gin  . Many medical schools have recognized a need for the development of programs that would help provide students with the necessary exposure to health issues of certain populations so that future physicians are better equipped to care for medically underserved communities.
The National Association of Community Health Centers (NACHC) is a large medical organization that represents approximately 1000 community health centers across the nation that provide primary care to medically underserved populations. According to the NACHC 2007 Community Health Center Survey, there are over 12 million visits to community health centers annually, or almost one fifth of the visits by all Americans to primary medical providers. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate is 5.3%. However, the national unemployment rate is 13.4% when the rate is calculated using the participation rate (the number eligible to work) rather than the unemployment rate (the number of employed people actively seeking work)   Health care economics: the cost of care, Egg  .
Given this context, we developed a 4-year medical student volunteer program aimed at providing care to an underserved community in the greater New Orleans area. Our goal in establishing a student-run free clinic, New Orleans Family Medicine Foundation (NOFMF), was to increase the quality and quantity of medical care delivered to economically disadvantaged and medically underserved populations in the greater New Orleans region, an area that was economically devastated by Hurricane Katrina in August, 2005. Students, faculty, and other members of the Louisiana State University (LSU) community volunteered to serve in an interdisciplinary care team to manage general, internal, and pediatric medicine to this group of people. We present the data from the 12 months since the clinic opened its doors to the community and discuss our results and the challenges faced in designing and executing a medical student volunteer program that offers a comprehensive care clinic to the economically disadvantaged.

Epidemiologic studies have shown an association between cocaine use and abnormalities of the female reproductive system, especially those related to ovulation and the menstrual cycle. However, these associations have not been directly correlated with cocaine use or abuse. Furthermore, the mechanisms responsible for cocaine-induced reproductive toxicity are still unknown. This article reviews the epidemiological and clinical findings concerning the effects of cocaine use and its metabolites, as well as its abuse on female reproduction. <EOD> Antibody-induced hemolysis of human erythrocyte subpopulations in vitro.
Preincubation of red blood cells (RBC) with anti-polymorphic IgG in physiological concentration results in the rapid and extensive hemolysis of the less common antigenic (O(ab)) type A cells. No hemolysis of the more common antigenic (O(aa)) type A cells is observed. Similar results obtained with anti-polymorphic IgG in saline indicate that the specificity of the reaction is not dependent on high ionic strength or on plasma factors. In contrast, a monoclonal human IgM which has low hemolytic activity by itself when tested against O(aa) RBC, has been found to potentiate the hemolytic activity of the anti-polymorphic IgG upon incubation of both IgM and IgG with O(ab) type A RBC. <EOD> Characterization of Lactobacillus helveticus JCM 10038 and L. rhamnosus subsp. rhamnosus JCM 1136 T as strains closely related to an atypical L. rhamnosus strain isolated from the human small intestine

Lactobacillus helveticus JCM 10038 and L. rhamnosus subsp. rhamnosus JCM 1136 T were newly assigned as strains closely related to an atypical L. rhamnosus strain (TAN132) isolated from the human small intestine and not as L. rhamnosus JCM 1131 T as reported by Ojima et al. (H. Ojima, T. Yamasaki, T. Yasumoto, Y. Harunari, K. Nagasaki, S. Yamamoto, Y. Suzuki, and K. Inatomi 2009. Int J Food Microbiol 131: 57-63). Both novel strains formed hetero-and homo-genously carbedrying colonies and showed positive reactions for catalase, esterase lipase (C8), esterase (C4), leucine aminopeptidase, and trypsin and α-galactosidase, glucuronidase, α-glucosidase and β-glucosidase; negative reactions for the same enzymes (except leucine aminopeptidase, α-glucosidase and β-glucosidase) were observed for both strains. Both strains showed positive reactions for Voges-Proskauer (glucose), arginine dihydrolase (d-tryptophan and d-serine), citrate, malic and pyruvic acid utilization. Both strains did not show activities for acid and gas production from glucose, glycerol, lactose, maltose, mannose, sucrose and trehalose. Results of DNA-DNA hybridization and partial 16S rDNA sequence homology analysis suggested that JCM 10038 is more closely related to TAN132 than JCM 1136 T .

Preclinical studies had shown that ipragliflozin decreased plasma glucose levels, and the use of ipragliflozin in combination with SGLT-2 inhibitors for the treatment of acute myocardial infarction is promising. Therefore, we evaluated and analyzed how well ipragliflozin affected the clinical outcomes of acute myocardial infarction. We applied a newly proposed pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modeling method in a disease system, which was first reported as a method to analyze the combination therapy of pharmaceutical agents. The PK/PD modeling method can reproduce clinical outcomes from the exposure of plasma glucose levels and predict the efficacy of pharmaceutical doses. Using the PK/PD modeling method, we compared the combination of ipragliflozin and SGLT-2 inhibitors against ipragliflozin with SGLT-2 inhibitors alone to show the therapeutic effects of the combination on acute myocardial infarction by evaluating the clinical outcomes. Plasma glucose levels and clinical outcomes in acute myocardial infarction patients treated with the diabetes drugs canoprevir dihydrochloride, ipragliflozin, and dapagliflozin for 21 months were investigated. IPRA-GLIFLOZIN (INNO-1399) is a selective inhibitor of the sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) from the clinical candidate discovery program at Innovation Venture and Development, Inc. (IVD, Gyeongsan-si, Gyeongbuk, Republic of Korea). DAPAGLIFLOZIN (DU-176b) and CANPRAVIR (BOC-236) are two SGLT inhibitors that act as selective inhibitors of human SGLT-2. They showed high potency when screened in vitro and exhibited selectivity against the human SGLT-1, with more than 220-and 260-fold selectivity, respectively. DAPAGLIFLOZIN and CANPRAVIR were used in the acute phase of myocardial infarction (MI) to treat diabetic patients, and IPRAGLIFLOZIN was used to maintain a level of glycated hemoglobin. DAPAGLIFLOZIN and IPRAGLIFLOZIN were administered on a background of CANPRAVIR. CANPRAVIR, which is a non-specific potent SGLT inhibitor, was used to enhance the therapeutic effect of the combination of the other SGLT inhibitors. Therefore, we analyzed the therapeutic effects of IPRA-GLIFLOZIN with combination therapy of CANPRAVIR and DAPAGLIFLO-ZIN and IPRAGLIFLOZIN alone. A PK/PD model using first order elimination rate and a delay of the effect of IPRAGLIFLO-ZIN in addition to a feedback loop on CANPRAVIR and DAPAGLIFLOZIN was developed. The model successfully reproduced the plasma glucose levels, and it was estimated to decrease the number of myocardial infarctions by 2.8%. Furthermore, the drug-drug PK/PD"

 <EOD> Effects of a combined oral contraceptive (Yasmin) on the frequency and duration of migraine in a specialist-treated Norwegian population of female migraineurs
Abstract Aim. To investigate if the oral contraceptive drug Yasmin (drospirenone/ethinylestradiol (EE)) causes migraine or migraine-related symptoms more often than other combined oral contraceptives. Previous studies have not demonstrated consistent results on this effect. Methods. We assessed information on migraine history and Yasmin treatment in a population-based cohort of 2261 users of combined oral contraception. A further 983 women treated with Yasmin were selected who answered a questionnaire about changes in migraine symptoms. They were compared with 9814 users of other combined oral contraceptives who provided questionnaire information on migraine changes. Results. The proportion who reported a combined oral contraceptive to have caused their migraine or migraine symptoms was higher among Yasmin users (19.6%, n = 177) than with the other combined oral contraceptives (8.2%, n = 779). The increase was significantly higher after 90 days of use than 30 days. The frequency of migraine increased significantly among the Yasmin users, with a significantly higher average increase among those whose migraine became worse than among those who described other changes (34.6 versus 12.1 days/month). The frequency of migraine- and migraine-related symptoms increased during Yasmin treatment more frequently among those with a history of migraine than among those who did not (62.2 versus 46.3%). Conclusions. These results suggest that Yasmin is associated with an increase in frequency and migraine symptoms in women who are already suffering migraine. They raise some concern about the risk of Yasmin causing migraine. <EOD> 15,16,17--trioxa-4-aza-10,12-dioxatricyclooctadec-15-yl]prop-2-yn-1-yl]aminocarbaoxylic acid sodium salt.

 <EOD> The effect of propranolol on the contractile response of the rat vena saphena after a variety of pharmacological or surgical interventions. An experimental study.
In previous research a number of different changes in the vascular reactivity of the rat vena saphena have been described, and also the effect of propranolol. In an attempt to achieve some generality between these changes propranolol was investigated with the vasorelaxation technique. It was found that propranolol was equally effective in enhancing the vasoconstriction initiated by a variety of pharmacological or surgical interventions. Propranolol also enhanced the vasoconstriction initiated by angiotensin II (A II), and the contractile activity of histamine in segments of the rat aorta and the vas deferens as well as in the rabbit aorta. There were, however, no significant differences between these tissues. <EOD> Detection of Cholera-causing Vibrio spp. in Raw Vegetables Collected from the Northern Part of Bangladesh

Vibrio spp. are widely distributed in aquatic bodies in nature. Some species are pathogenic in nature and the others are non-pathogenic. Due to their capacity to survive in aquatic environments, some pathogenic and nonpathogenic Vibrio spp. contaminate the vegetables, mainly in the raw form. In this study, we investigated the presence of diarrhoeagenic V. cholerae and other Vibrio spp. in 100 raw vegetable samples. The samples were collected from Shonjibas and vegetable farms located in northern Bangladesh, a major vegetable-producing area of the country. Only 10 out of 100 samples (10%) contained Vibrio spp. Based on 16S rRNA sequencing, all the Vibrio-positive samples were found to be non-toxigenic non-O1/O139 V. cholerae, and six of them also tested positive for stx2 gene, characteristic of the shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC). It is evident from the present findings that raw vegetables may not pose a risk of illness caused by cholera and STEC. However, the role of these vegetables needs further investigation to reveal if they may be the sources of non-cholera Vibrios and E. coli in the environment.

# Introduction
Cholera, a serious infectious gastroenteritis caused by vibriosis, remains a major global health threat. Globally around 1.3-4 million people acquire the disease and 42,900 of them succumb to this illness with a case fatality rate of 3.1%-4.0%. It is estimated that around 80% of the cholera cases are reported from three countries, namely Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Haiti. Vibrio Cholerae is the causative agent of cholera, and its two pathogenic biotypes are serogroups O1 and O139. Other Vibrio species also have the potential for a diarrhoeagenic illness.
V. parahaemolyticus, V. alginolyticus, and V. vulnificus can also cause severe gastroenteritis. In addition to those Vibrio spp., Escherichia coli can acquire the ability to produce Shiga toxins (stx1 and stx2), making them a public health problem. Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing E. coli (STEC) strains causing human disease belong to O1, O26, and O111 serotypes.
Vegetables, in particular raw vegetables, are sometimes adulterated by the fecal waste of animals and in particular by V. cholerae, which can survive for days to weeks in natural aquatic environments. A report from an analysis of samples suggested that 194 species of fruits and vegetables were contaminated with V. cholerae, of which 77 were found contaminated with V. cholerae O1. Some of the"

Example of Clinical Trial Abstract: Study to evaluate efficacy of Fentanyl and Midazolam (FM) compared with Remifentanil for postoperative pain

Study Overview
=================
To test whether fentanyl and midazolam (FM) for postoperative pain following cardiac surgery is the same as Remifentanil (R). Patients following cardiac surgery were randomized to receive one of the following drugs: FM for 24 hours; FM for 12 hours, followed by Remifentanil (R); or R for 24 hours. Pain and analgesic consumptions were the primary outcome measures. Incidence of respiratory and circulatory abnormalities as well as the safety were the secondary outcome measures.

Intervention
------------------
Patients entered into the trial received: FM for 24 hours; FM for 12 hours, followed by R for 12 hours; or R for 24 hours. Pain was assessed using the Visual Analogue Scale(VAS 10) 2 h,5 h,10h,19h,24h. R was intravenously given in a dosage of 0.5 μmol /kg/min until postoperative pain was completely relieved. Pain was assessed using the VAS5 and VAS19.

Secondary Outcome
================
Circulatory abnormalities were defined as the following: 1. Heart rate: > / = 10 beats/min higher than pre-control value at 10 min; > / = 20 beats/min higher than pre-control value at 20 min; > / = 20 beats/min higher than pre control value as long as it persisted > / = 20min; 2. Systolic arterial pressure: SAP> 160 mm Hg (if SAP > 180mm Hg, infusion would be stopped temporally); SAP > 180 mm Hg as long as it persisted > / =20 min or > / = 3 times baseline; 3. Diastolic arterial pressure: DBP > > 90 mm Hg as long as it persisted > / =20 min or > / =3 times baseline. Respiratory abnormalities were defined as following: SpO2 <90% at resting position when the respiratory rate was ≤15/min; SpO2<90% and RR > 15/min when lying on the back; RR> 30 / min when in sitting position. Cases of SpO2 <90% and RR> 15/min must be recorded together.

Patient Disposition:
---------------------
Intravenous Remifentanil was administered in order to relieve pain, and to monitor the patients' safety. Patients in all three groups received 64(15) mg PIT (400 μg PIT/kg/min in FM, 36(10) mg PIT /kg /m in R). Respiratory and circulatory abnormalities were detected during surgery and within 72 hours after the surgery. Safety indexes including hypotension, tachycardia, bradycardia, sinus arrest, atrial fibrillation, ventricular fibrillation, premature ventricular contraction, myocardial irritation, and convulsion were recorded. Patients were asked every morning, and were recorded by researchers before the operation.

BACKGROUND
The aim of this work is to study the evolution of intraoperative bleeding when performing anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction in the context of a prospective study.


METHODS
We have included between January 2002 and January 2004, 49 consecutive patients with a rupture of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). We have prospectively evaluated intraoperative bleeding. Surgical procedures consist in a trans capsular reconstruction with a double strand autologous graft or an arthroscopic reconstruction using the hamstring tendon with non absorbable suture.


RESULTS
Intraoperative bleeding was between 60 and 180 cc/mn for trans capsular revision and between 70 and 200 cc/mn for arthroscopic procedure.


CONCLUSION
In spite of an initial high bleeding rate, the intraoperative hemostasis is rapid, allowing for the use of low heparin doses. <EOD> Evaluation of the Efficacy of the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine BNT162b2 in Children 5 to 11 Years Old

 <EOD> Bromide as a model for investigating the pathogenesis of renal tubular acidosis: studies with inhibitors of anion transport.
In rats, a diet containing 2.5% sodium bromide for 10 days caused a doubling of medullary interstitial tl- activity, a fourfold increase in medulla/cortex Cl- activity ratio, and a significant decrease in medullary interstitial volume density. Medullary interstitial pH measured with pH microelectrodes was 5.1 compared to 5.9 in control rats. We investigated the possibility that the acidification of the corticomedullary junction in bromide-treated rats resulted from decreased medullary interstitial Cl- concentration, which decreased net acid secretion at that site. In vitro studies in the perfused rat convoluted proximal tubule indicated that decreased medullary interstitial pH could result from decreased Cl- concentration if luminal pH is decreased below 6.5 or luminal HCO3 concentration is increased. These manipulations decreased the rate and magnitude of bicarbonate reabsorption and thus increased net acid excretion. Luminal pH (7.4) and pCO2 (40 mmHg) were constant. This effect occurred without an effect on net H+ secretion and was independent of the presence of HCO3 in the lumen or the nature of the anion transport inhibitor used (dinitrophenol, nigericin, and 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid). Experiments with dimethadione to increase urine pH indicated that the HCO3 reabsorbed by the distal tubule was less efficiently titrated in the bromide-treated rats. Our data suggest that bromide decreases medullary interstitial pH by lowering medullary interstitial Cl- concentration and indirect"

Summary:
------------------------------------------------
Background
Chronic trauma and stressor-related disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)) lead to elevated morbidity, mortality, and disability. EEG enhanced noninvasive brain stimulation (eTMS) has been shown to significantly reduce symptom severity in non-active duty veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder in open label studies, and also showed efficacy in patients with Alzheimer’s Disease. EEG-Enhanced TMS in chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PSTD) may be a novel therapeutic intervention that will provide new knowledge and be a step towards the development of a scalable, accessible treatment.

Aims
To assess the feasibility and safety of EEG enhanced transcranial magnetic stimulation as an adjunct to standard of care treatment in active duty and retired military personnel with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder. This is a phase II safety and a phase III efficacy study for the treatment of chronic trauma and stressor-related disorders. In addition, we hypothesize that this eTMS treatment will be noninferior to conventional TMS treatment in chronic trauma and stressor-related disorders in a sample of 30 participants, and superior to the baseline, in a sample of 270 participants.

Methods and Design
Eligible participants randomized to the eTMS treatment group will receive:
- 8-14 weeks of twice daily (Monday-Friday) and once daily (Saturday-Sunday) transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)
- EEG-enhanced transcranial magnetic stimulation (eTMS) therapy. Two treatments are given per day over a 30-session treatment period. Average 1000 pulses per treatment (100-120 Hz pulse rate) over approximately 12 minutes, delivered at a pulse frequency of 0.5 Hz (15.6 second stimulation on, 15.6 second stimulation off cycles) over 6 weeks. Sham stimulation is given to the placebo group for 6 weeks (8 weeks total). Participants in the active TMS treatment group will receive a custom built neurostimulation device utilizing four 7-inch coil segments that deliver 30 sessions twice daily (Monday-Friday) during the first 6 weeks, for a total of 120 TMS sessions. Sham stimulation is initiated when the subject turns off the device. Participants in the placebo active TMS treatment group will receive 30 sessions twice daily (Monday-Friday) for 6 weeks and 30 sessions once daily (Saturday-Sunday) over 4 weeks, for a total of 120 TMS sessions.

The primary outcome measures are:
- Number of participants with device-related serious adverse events.

The secondary outcome measures are:
- To assess the safety of the procedure, the rate of participants (of 30 initial cohort) with expected, device-related serious adverse events and unexpected, device-related serious adverse events during treatment.
- To assess the feasibility of the procedure, the rate of participants (for initial cohort of 30) completing >=80% of the 30 scheduled eTMS sessions.
- To assess efficacy of the procedure, the mean change from baseline to week 6 in the mental component score (MCS) on Veterans RAND 36-item health survey (VR-36) for participants who completed >=80% of eTMS sessions




### Outcome measures for participants with chronic trauma and stressor related disorders
- VR-36 (MCS) will be assessed at baseline, 6 weeks, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-baseline

Pediatric interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a rare and often fatal condition. However, data on ILD in pediatric systemic sclerosis (PSSc) patients are limited. The purpose of this study was, first, to determine the prevalence and the pattern of the lung involvement (PILD) on the first high‐resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scans in children with PSSc. Second, we defined the progression, evolution, and radiologic severity of PIID compared to the results of the pulmonary function testing (PFT). Third, we defined risk factors of progression of PIID. <EOD> Permanent and transient reactions of immature rat cerebellar granule cells mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and non-NMDA receptor activation.
Permanent and transient changes in the electrical membrane properties of rat cerebellar granule cells (CGCs) are elicited by selective activation of glutamate receptors. Selective N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activation by glutamate (30 microM) produces a slow inward current (SIC) followed by a late excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP), indicating the presence of NMDA receptors. The late EPSP is blocked by Mg2+ suggesting that Ca2+ is involved in the excitotoxicity of NMDA. Non-NMDA receptors are activated by glutamate (100 microM) and produce an excitatory response that persists even in the presence of Mg2+. In addition, the glutamate-induced response can be enhanced by low concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX) in the presence of Mg2+. When applied separately, TTX and Mg2+ completely abolish the glutamate-induced response. These results suggest that both non-NMDA ionotropic receptors and persistent sodium channels contribute to the excitatory response induced by glutamate. In addition, synaptic activation also depresses the SIC-induced by NMDA, suggesting that NMDA receptors are presynpatic. <EOD> The effect of acupuncture on the management of chronic neuropathic back pain: a randomised controlled trial

 <EOD> Effects of Flavored E-cigarette Use on COPD Awareness, Susceptibility, Perceived Causality, and Susceptibility: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials

The use of e-cigarettes, while potentially beneficial, is controversial and may be harmful to health. Flavoring can further complicate its harmful and beneficial effects because some studies report that flavoring can increase users' susceptibility to e-cigarettes, but other studies suggest that flavoring use is protective. However, none of these studies used e-cigarettes with natural tobacco flavoring (nicotine), so the effect of flavoring without confounding of tobacco is unknown. This research examines the effect of flavoring, nicotine, and flavorless e-cigarettes on susceptibility to traditional cigarettes. We conducted a meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials, examining the effects of experimental e-cigarette use (without nicotine) with and without one of four flavorings (menthol, strawberry, vanilla, mint) on COPD susceptibility, COPD awareness, perceived causality, and perceived harm. Compared to flavorless e-cigarettes, e-cigarettes with nicotine, and e-cigarettes with vanilla flavor increased susceptibility. There were no significant effect differences for the menthol, strawberry, or mint flavored e-cigarettes. The overall flavoring effect was significant after accounting for variation in nicotine, with a significant increase in COPD susceptibility. Thus, while flavoring did not increase susceptibility significantly relative to nicotine, its effects must be considered in conjunction with nicotine and other ingredients. It is not clear yet whether and to what degree flavoring and/or tobacco influence the physiological and behavioral impact of e-cigarettes (and to what degree each impacts the others), and additional research is needed.

# Introduction

These criticisms were amplified after a CDC press release in early 2015 reporting an estimated 92,000 emergency room visits involving e-cigarette use in each of 2013 and 2014. Yet many public health researchers remain hopeful and support the potential use of flavoring, believing that it may deter youth use of traditional cigarettes and increase use of vaping, a potential alternative with fewer harmful effects. As a result, there has been controversy and confusion about the impact on people's susceptibility to using traditional cigarettes, and thus the potential for use of ecigarettes and/or traditional cigarettes as a viable alternative   E-cigarettes: a scientific review, Grana  .
This review examines how the use of flavored e-cigarettes impacts susceptibility to traditional cigarettes, including whether flavored e-cigarettes are more susceptible to traditional cigarettes than e-cigarettes that lack the flavoring. It is possible that flavored e-cigarettes are more harmful than e-cigarettes lacking the flavoring because of the flavoring itself, but it is not clear if the flavoring is necessary for e-cigarettes to be effective or harmful. Examining whether the flavored e-cigarette use and nicotine influence the susceptibility to traditional cigarettes can provide important insight into whether and how e-cigarettes may deter smoking. The current review includes only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to control for possible biases or conf"

 <EOD> Changes in the distribution of H-2Kk antigens after antigen stimulation.
The H-2Kk antigen density was studied on lymphoid organs and thymocytes from normal B10.BR mice and on antigen-stimulated lymphocytes from guinea pigs immunized with allogeneic and xenogeneic antigens by the indirect fluorescent-antibody method. The mean fluorescence of the antigen-stimulated lymphocytic populations was consistently less than that of normal thymocytes and splenic lymphocytes after stimulation with either antigen. The intensity of H-2 antigenic expression in spleen and thymus remained unchanged during antigen stimulation. This observed reduction of H-2 antigen density after antigen-specific stimulation cannot be satisfactorily explained based on the present information, but seems to be related to the increased density of some plasma membrane components, associated with the stimulated thymocyte or splenocyte. The data imply that under these experimental conditions a specific immune response may be associated with the reorganization of both the plasma membrane and the intracytoplasmic components. The significance of these findings is discussed. <EOD> Gingival metastasis from malignant melanoma of the right toe: A case report with review of literature
The case of 37-years-old male patient with a metastasis to the upper right gingiva as the only clinical finding of a malignant melanoma is reported. The lesion was localized to the lingual gingiva and it was covered by healthy-looking mucosa. The clinical examination revealed a firm and fixed-to the tooth root neoplasm with extensive extension into the deeper layers of the gingiva, which was initially misdiagnosed as pyogenic granuloma. The patient, also admitted for evaluation of a suspicious nodule on his right toe, had undergone left ilioinguinal and right inguinal lymphadenectomy due to a diagnosis of stage 1A desmoplastic melanoma of the plantar skin of his right foot three years earlier. Pathologic examination established the diagnosis of gingival metastasis from melanoma of the right toe. The patient refused to undergo additional surgery and his 20 years of follow-up with periodic examinations including whole-body computed tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging showed no evidence of recurrence or other systemic lesions. <EOD> Bias reduction and covariate effects in propensity score estimation

Objective The paper focuses on methods to estimate propensity scores. Propensity scores are used to balance groups on measured variables and can be used in various statistical modeling techniques to investigate causal effects. They are often estimated by logistic regression, resulting in a biased estimate for the underlying propensity score. We derive a new estimator for the propensity score with bias reduction and show that our estimator improves the precision of the estimated propensity score. Methods We take into account that the estimator for the propensity score is sensitive to the covariate distribution. We develop two correction schemes for this bias. One of these methods works for arbitrary distributions of the covariates and is applicable to the full estimation procedure including matching and estimation of the remaining model parameters through stratification. The second bias correction works when the covariates are non-random in the population but not in the sample. Results We illustrate the new estimator by applying it to a recent real-world data set and show that the estimation error is significantly reduced, while the bias is eliminated. Further, we show that our correction scheme is applicable to stratification analyses in covariate-free environments. Conclusion The presented paper shows that it is possible to reduce the bias as well as the covariate distributional effect. The estimation of the propensity score with the new estimator has clear advantages. The methods are applicable to any parametric and semiparametric model.

Bone grafting has increasingly become a significant problem for orthopedic surgeons. Autografts and allografts are the most suitable graft for bone defects, however their availability is often limited. Therefore, the use of bone scaffolds or bioscaffolds is becoming increasingly valuable. In this work, chitosan and chondroitin sulfate was dissolved in polyvinyl alcohol and chitosan-chondroitin sulfate polymeric scaffolds were developed. Polymeric scaffolds in combination with platelet concentrate (PC) were tested for biocompatibility. We studied PC viability using light and confocal microscopy and the release kinetics of PC-released biomolecules by ELISA, Dot-Blot immunoassay and western blot. Chitosan-based scaffolds, with PC alone or in combination with platelet gel, support the growth and adhesion of cells. PC, alone or in combination with scaffolds, is bioactive and enhances the viability of mesenchymal stem cells, fibroblasts and osteoblasts. Platelet concentrates, alone or in combination with scaffolds, release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b) and bFGF, which stimulate neovascularization and osteogenesis.

# Introduction
Bone defects remain an unsolved clinical problem for orthopedic surgeons due to their high incidence in osteoarthritis and congenital or acquired bone diseases. The gold standard of bone grafts is autologous grafts, which is ideal for reconstruction due to their regenerative potential. The use of autografts is limited by a variety of factors such as immune rejection (allogenic grafts), the availability of suitable grafts and the lack of blood flow in avascular graft beds making autologous grafts unsuitable. The use of synthetic polymer (polylactic acid, PLA), bioactive or natural polymer (collagen, gelatin, hyaluronic acid) composites has been attempted over the past decade to repair bone defects. However, several limitations affect the application of synthetic polymers to bone defects and require a multitude of treatments. The development of bioengineered scaffolding approaches has emerged as a suitable alternative to bone grafts due to its advantages, such as providing cellular support and maintaining its geometry. Bone scaffolds are available in different forms, such as bone substitutes, bioactive, biocompatible and biodegradable. These scaffolds must exhibit biomechanical, structural and biological properties for successful implantation. Bioactive scaffolds (BRS) in combination with osteoinduction proteins are used to promote bone regeneration. In recent years, many bioactive scaffolds, either alone or in combination with stem cells have shown significant bone regeneration.
Osteoinduction, the process of endogenous bone formation by the proliferation and differentiation of bone-marrow-derived cells, requires scaffolds that promote an appropriate biological environment for healing. One of the most commonly known osteoinductive proteins are the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a family of growth factors, which is found in a bioactive form as protein and also in mineralized bone matrix. The use of biosynthetic scaffolds or BRS can promote the bone repair process; however, due to the short duration of osteogenic activity of BMPs, they can be released or replaced by nonosteogenic cells, which can affect their healing potential. Another alternative to BMPs is the use of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and platelet concentrates (PC) due to the growth factors and cytokines present in these preparations. The biological properties of blood platelets include the secretion and accumulation of growth factors and matrix proteins that stimulate"

A 57-year-old male presented with an ankle trauma. Following an emergency operation for the repair of the peroneal artery and vein, heterotopic ossification was detected. The patient had no history of any orthopaedic disease, trauma, or genetic disorders. Postoperatively, the treatment was successful; however, heterotopic ossification was detected on the sixth week due to complications of the severe trauma on the third day. The patient was treated successfully without complications.

# Introduction
Vascular injuries are well known complications of orthopaedic injuries, and vascular injuries associated with ankle fractures are a potentially fatal clinical situation   Arterial injury associated with fracture of the distal part of the tibia, Peltz  . Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a rare phenomenon in humans in that bone is present in an area, which is outside of its normal anatomical locations. In this case report, we present the case of a 57-year-old male patient who suffered a serious trauma involving the left ankle and was diagnosed with HO.

## Case report
A 57-year-old male patient presenting with trauma, including fracture dislocation of the ankle, a distal tibiofibular fracture, and peroneal nerve paralysis underwent emergency fixation of the fracture under general anaesthesia on the third posttraumatic day. He had no history of any orthopaedic disease, trauma, or genetic disorders. During the operation, the peroneal nerve (L5 origin) was found to be crushed at the fibular neck, and peroneal artery and vein injury (proximal tibioperoneal trunk injury (pPTA/VV)) was detected. These structures were repaired and an ankle fixation performed. Following the operation, he was administered a thrombosis prophylaxis regimen and kept on bed rest until the 10th day when his mobility was permitted.
Although the peroneal nerve paralysis improved gradually until the third posttraumatic day, a neurological deficiency remained. The patient presented with a new complaint of swelling on the calf from the fifth day and the patient was taken into the clinic for the first time on the sixth postoperative day. On the day of admission, a complete blood panel exam and paraclinical exam were requested to be carried out. The paraclinical exam included blood biochemistry, haematology (fibrinogram, D-dimer, and haemostasis parameters), and urine and serum electrolytes (renal functions). In all of these examinations and in blood biochemistry, values were reported under normal range.
The swelling of the lower leg increased on the tenth postoperative day. There was no complaint reported from the patient except for pain. Following a physical examination, the patient was diagnosed with deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and admitted to the anticoagulant treatment clinic. Egg white tests of the patient reported a negative result. In Doppler ultrasonography, there was no sign of a thrombosis in the popliteal or calf. The physical examination did not show any signs of a soft-tissue infection or an abnormal collection site. It was considered that a neurovascular deficiency may be associated with vascular compression, which had also been assessed by a neurologist who had performed a postoperative physical examination. At this time, an incision in the region of the fibular neck was performed under the local anaesthetic administration, and a 2 Case Reports in Orthopedics collection of blood was initiated. Following the procedure, a white cell count of 12,940 and an increased level of CRP (erythrocyte sedimentation of 89 mm and CRP of 6+ mg/dL) were observed. As a result, it was decided to repeat the Doppler ultrasonography and request a bacteriological examination on the blood. The Doppler ultrasonography indicated that the DVT had disappeared, and the blood culture returned negative. It was reported"
652,"[/INST] Atorvastatin for Preventing Disease Metastasis in Patients With Resected High-Risk Stage IIA Melanoma

Background: Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is the deadliest type of skin cancer. According to the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), advanced melanoma, which is not amenable to surgical resection, has a 5-year survival rate of only 15%. Recent advances in sequencing technologies have led to the discovery of key alterations such as BRAF and NRAS mutations in about half of the melanoma cases and has led to clinical trials investigating moleculartargeted agents such as vemurafenib (PLX4032) and dabrafenib (GSK2118436) for the treatment of BRAF-mutated advanced melanoma (AJCC stages III and IV) patients. Despite these and other targeted therapies, patients treated in the advanced metastatic setting have short progression-free and overall survival benefits and limited durability of response. While recent results of immunotherapy such as the antibodies ipilimumab (MDX-010) and tremelimumab (CP-675,206) have shown promise, their efficacy in combination with other agents or in combination with chemotherapy (as compared with chemotherapy alone) has not been reported. Currently, there are no treatment options available (other than surgery) for the high-risk group of patients with resected stage II melanomas; the group we are addressing in this study. Patients with this high-risk melanoma stage IIA, defined as having either multiple regional lymph node metastasis or tumors that are 4 mm thick regardless of metastases, have a very high chance of developing incurable, stage IV disease, and are the largest subgroup (80%) of melanoma patients in need of a new therapy to prevent disease metastasis.


IMPORTANCE: It is estimated that 233,000 new melanoma patients are diagnosed each year, and that 73,870 of these patients die from the disease annually. Of these annual diagnoses, 12,520 will be resected stage II melanoma patients, who will be at high risk for metastasis and death. It is essential to find successful therapies to prevent the high rate of melanoma recurrence for this high-risk stage IIA patient population. In this multi-center study, we are examining a new therapy with the drug atorvastatin (Lipitor, Pfizer), a generic form of the popular cholesterol lowering drug, in an effort to decrease the 60% chance that this patient group would develop metastatic melanoma within 5 years of diagnosis. If successful, this treatment could be very cost effective and life-saving, as a 33% decrease in the percentage of patients developing metastatic disease (from 60% to 40%) would eliminate nearly half of the incidences of melanoma deaths worldwide. The results of this Phase II study could revolutionize the treatment landscape of patients with high-risk stage IIA melanoma by providing an alternative to conventional surgery alone.


TRIAL OBJECTIVES/RATIONALE: The trial has two aims. The first is to assess whether atorvastatin can prevent stage IIA melanoma from developing into a metastatic form of melanoma. In this experiment, patients with resected stage IIA melanoma will receive daily pills of either atorvastatin (treatment) or a placebo over the course of 5 years. At the end of the study, a comparison between the two groups of patients in the degree of metastasis (recurrence) will be made. The main outcome measure is recurrence-free survival, which is the likelihood that a patient will develop melanoma metastasis. The main study hypothesis is that atorvastatin can be administered to patients with high-risk stage IIA resected melanoma patients and significantly decrease their chance of developing metastases as compared to placebo. Success of this hypothesis would also allow researchers to see if atorvastatin will also lengthen the recurrence-free survival of advanced melanoma patients with stage IIB-IV resected disease (a secondary aim of the study).

Gastric hydrogen ion concentration was measured continually employing a pH electrode (Medtronic 531) introduced into the stomach through the nose over a 5 cm guide tube. Four protocols were studied. Pure cimetidine (240 mg twice daily) for 5 days, pure cimetidine (240 mg four times daily) for 5 days, ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) for 3 days followed by ranitidine (150 mg four times daily) for 5 days, and a placebo treatment schedule over 10 days. All three schedules of both drugs resulted in marked elevation of gastric pH which was sustained throughout the night. The magnitude of the night-time acidity shift following cimetidine but not the daytime intragastric pH values following ranitidine were directly dose-related. Average 22-hour nocturnal pH exceeded 4.8 in eight of 34 protocols, in the remaining patients hourly pH values of over 4.0 were recorded. Thus pure cimetidine as well as ranitidine at a three times a day dosage is an effective nocturnal acid suppressant. In comparison with cimetidine, ranitidine appears more effective in controlling gastric acid secretion. <EOD> .
The goal of this study was to quantify the prevalence of physical disability according to the definition of the World Health Organization (WHO) and to determine its association with sociodemographic characteristics. It is a cross-sectional study including 1,094 elderly subjects who were attending Family Health Strategy units and who were registered at Municipal Health Secretariat in Joinville city, in the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Sample size was set at 600 subjects and was stratified by clusters according to the Health Region (Regional Assistance Network - RAAN) (n = 68), age (≥ 85 years = 60, 60 to 74 years = 120; 55 to 59 years = 120; 50 to 54 years = 120, 45 to 49 years = 60; age group 40 to 44 years = 60). The data were obtained from the elderly individuals and their caregivers in the Health Unit. The prevalence of disability is estimated in 11% (95% Confidence Interval: 9% to 13%). Disability occurred more frequently among elderly ≥ 85 years. Of 23 elderly evaluated for this group, seven (30.4%) had some type of physical disability. As to functional capacity, all dependent elderly required daily life assistance. With respect to the type of disability, the predominant form was of sensory type (60.9%), followed by the sensory and motor (36.0%) and motor (2.5%). This study found disability prevalence according to the definition of the WHO, associated with sociodemographic characteristics. <EOD> Mesenchymal stem cells from ileostomy or colonic surgery patients are impaired by senescence and inflammation

Background: Previous studies reported reduced therapeutic potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) isolated from Crohn's patients.Methods: We focused on intestinal MSC. We characterized cell parameters; apoptosis and senescence and mitochondrial function in MSC from ileostomy patients (ISO) vs colonic surgery patients (CollSurg).Results: Mature MSC could not be obtained from patients. We observed enlarged senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity in ISO, and CollSurg MSC with advanced senescence, inflammation and altered mitochondrial bioenergetics.Conclusions: This study is on MSC-biology of intestinal patients. Our data show impairment of MSC isolated from surgery sites, but not obtained. We suggest the MSC from surgical patients at the biological functions, and an infl"

Detailed Description
=====================
An important and growing area of clinical investigation in general, and in health services research in particular, is evaluating the effectiveness of new health services and health technologies. Effectiveness research includes the evaluation of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of new or existing health services, including comparisons across settings or communities. Trials of health services and technologies commonly evaluate a clinical intervention and its associated process outcomes. It is very important to be able to communicate the impact and reach of the trials. It is increasingly important for patients and providers to have information as to what impact the service has on the community.

ACTRN12618000245648 will evaluate the effectiveness of a scalable, tailored text messaging programs among a sample of 150 older adults with hazardous drinking. Participants will be randomized to one of the three conditions: Standard Brief Normative Feedback; the Loss-framed Text-messaging condition; and the Gain-framed Text-messaging condition. Participants will be randomized to one of the 3 conditions collected at screening. They will be assigned to one of 3 interventions: Standard Brief Normative Feedback; the Loss-framed Text-messaging condition where they will receive daily text messages based on loss-framed messaging about the consequences of hazardous drinking; and the Gain-framed Text-messaging condition where they will receive daily text messages based on gain-framed messages about the benefits of reducing drinking to safe guidelines. The primary aim is to evaluate

OBJECTIVE
To evaluate the relationship between CD44 and CD105 mRNA expression in the bone marrow and breast cancer patients' clinical characteristics.


METHODS
After obtaining bone marrow from breast cancer and healthy subjects, real time RT-PCR was used to detect bone marrow microvascular endothelial cell markers (CD44 and CD105 mRNA expression).


RESULTS
Circulating CD44 mRNA and CD105 mRNA were detected in all the samples (bone marrow from patients with breast cancer and healthy subjects). Compared with healthy subjects, the concentration ratio of CD105 mRNA:CD44 mRNA was much higher in breast cancer patients (P < 0.05). The levels of CD105 and CD44 mRNA concentration ratio was significantly higher in patients with metastasis than in those without metastasis (P = 0.000). The levels of these two mRNAs in stage III patients were significantly increased than those in stage I patients (P = 0.000).


CONCLUSION
The results indicate CD105 mRNA might be a novel biomarker involved in bone marrow microangiogenesis and may be useful for diagnosis of breast cancer metastasis and forecasting prognosis, and monitoring treatment effect. <EOD> Influence of covalent modification of histone N-termini and C-termini by acetylation and methylation on the binding of nucleosomal DNA.
This study evaluated the effects of lysine acetylation and arginine methylation on nucleosome core particle assembly and on the ability of the resulting nucleosomes to wrap DNA. The DNA-binding activity within a nucleosome core particle assembled from recombinant DNA was studied using a fluorescence anisotropy assay with fluorescein-labeled DNA oligomers of different lengths. The presence of acetylated or methylated peptides near the termini of the nucleosomes has differential effects on the extent of DNA compaction. The acetylation of the N-terminus and the methylation of the C-terminus caused an increase in the ability of the nucleosomes to wrap DNA, whereas methylation of the N-terminus caused a loss of DNA-binding activity. This study is a first step towards unraveling the role of post-translational modifications in nucleosome assembly and the possible influence of such modifications on nucleosome mobility and on the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to regulatory factors. These findings may also help to understand the role that histone N- and C-termini play in nucleosome structure and function. <EOD> Diversity and distribution of phages in the oceans: the unknown majority
Phage diversity in aquatic environments, as measured by small subunit rRNA sequences, is an order of magnitude greater than in terrestrial samples. This greater diversity, combined with a lack of ecological studies, indicates that the majority of diversity in aquatic phage communities remains uncharacterized. <EOD> .
OBJECTIVE
We investigated the effects of antagonistic, pro- and antiapoptotic genes on hepatocarcinogenesis.


METHODS
Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and pericarcinoma tissues from 66 patients and the cirrhotic livers from 18 patients and the normal livers from 4 normal people were analyzed. The RT-PCR was used to detect Bcl-2, p53, c-myc, bax, caspase 3 and caspase 7 expression. The results were compared between HCC and normal liver tissues and cirrhosis and normal liver tissues.


RESULTS
c-myc expression was higher in pericarcinoma and HCC than in normal liver and cirrhosis (p = 0. 044), especially in well/ moderately differentiated HCC (p = 0. 015). Bax was significantly decreased in the poorly differentiated HCC (p = 0.001), bax and caspase 7 mRNA expression was significantly lower in HCC than in normal liver tissues (p = 0.000).

BACKGROUND
Studies on the effectiveness of three-dimensional (3D) printing for mandibular fractures have produced conflicting and heterogenous results.


OBJECTIVE
We performed a systematic review to evaluate existing evidence on the outcomes of oral and maxillofacial surgeons with respect to the use of 3D printing in mandibular fracture cases.


METHOD
We performed a systematic review of randomized control trials, and prospective or retrospective cohort studies published up to 1st of January 2021 on mandible fracture patients, involving the use of 3D printing. This study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019133175). We searched PubMed, Scopus, Ovid-Medline, Cochrane Library and Embase. Risk of bias analysis of individual studies was performed using The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool-2 (RoB 2).


RESULT
Out of 1656 citations, 11 studies with 3073 patients met the inclusion criteria. We extracted quantitative, qualitative and narrative reviews and findings for each study. In this analysis, the pooled relative risk of the treatment effect was 1.24, (95% confidence interval, 1.05 to 1.46). The risk of bias was low in two, moderate in nine, and high in none of the studies.


DISCUSSION
Data synthesis revealed that there is not enough evidence of the superiority of the 3D printing technique regarding the reduction and fixation of mandibular fracture management in comparison to conventional methods. Nevertheless, future well-designed randomized control trials with large sample sizes are needed.This article is protected by copyright.

 <EOD> Antibody response to the SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273 vaccine in kidney transplant recipients



# Methods
In this observational prospective study, we characterized humoral response and quantified SARS-Cov-2 neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) at 75, 90, and 120 days after the first vaccine administration in 80 consecutive KT recipients and compared them with a group of 70 health care workers (HCWs). We used the FDA Emergency Use Authorization approved SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody assay (Quest Diagnostics, Marlborough, MA). We further adapted their in-house NAb assay to use in a BSL-2 facility as previously reported.
The study was reviewed with Institutional Review Board approval (NHSR 2015 H 2986).

# Results
Mean age was 55.6 ± 12.7 years, 55% were women, and average time on dialysis before transplantation was 27.4 ± 30.7 months. Mean interval between vaccine dose 1 (D1) and D2 administration was 48.4 ± 6.9 days in KT recipients vs 49.9 ± 5.6 days in the HCWs group (P = .06).   Table 1: Descriptive Statistics and Univariate Tests of Seroconversion KT recipients   shows the results from the analyses of the serology results in KT recipients and HCWs. After D1, there was a clear difference in the seropositivity rate (P < .0001). Seropositivity significantly increased after D2: 92.7% at D2-D3 and was 100% at subsequent evaluations. No seroconversion occurred in KT recipients after D1 (P = .02). At D2-D3, seropositivity was 92.2% for KT group and 98% for HCW group, and it further rose to 100% for each at D21 and D43. In the univariate analysis, seropositivity negatively correlated with time on dialysis (13.6% after 50 months of dialysis, 82.5% after 10 months; P = .0027); however, it did not with time waiting for transplantation (87.5% of patients who have a waiting time >6 months were seropositive before vaccination). Moreover, in the Kaplan-Meier estimator survival-curve analysis   Figure 1: SARS-CoV-2 seroconversion   , patients younger than 50 years achieved a rate of seroconversion of 100% vs 83.5% in patients over 60 years (log rank P = .037). No side effects were described during vaccination.
NAb concentration in KT recipients seropositives ≥150.0 AU/ml. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine seems safe and welltolerated in all patients. This cohort represents the largest case series that quantifies and characterizes the SARS-CoV-2-reactive antibody response in KT recipients who received mRNA-1273 vaccine.   Seroconversion rates following COVID-19 vaccination among patients with solid organ transplants, Ali   We achieved an overall seroconversion rate approaching 95% at D21, which is higher than that reported by Zardetto et al   Antibody response to 2-dose SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine series in solid organ transplant..., Boyarsky   in a cohort of 54 KT recipients (87%). The main difference between both studies, in addition to the use of mRNA vaccines, is the short time interval between doses in our cohort. In addition, we also demonstrated that this rapid increase in seropositivity after D2 is accompanied by an excellent NAb response rate. This finding represents a major breakthrough, because NAb response is a key protective mechanism, although its relation with the development of sterilizing immunity and protective immunity against"

BACKGROUND
The purpose of this article is to review the clinical symptoms, differential diagnosis, and imaging findings of spinal cord injury after cervical trauma. Moreover, the management of this lesion with different etiologies is discussed.


STATE OF KNOWLEDGE
The pathophysiology of spinal cord injury is related to primary and secondary mechanisms, including neurologic injury, myelopathy, and a disorder of consciousness. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging is becoming more widely available and is of high diagnostic value to assess the degree of injury at the acute stage. Spinal cord injury should be differentiated from diseases that cause a similar clinical picture such as spontaneous spinal epidural hematoma, epidural abscess, and vertebral artery dissection. The treatment of spinal cord injury is directed at limiting secondary damage. In case of instability or compression of the spinal cord, surgery should be considered. In the literature, different techniques have been proposed.


CONCLUSION
Spinal cord injury is a heterogeneous and complex pathology. Although some criteria have been proposed, such as the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale, to standardize the evaluation of the severity of these injuries, they remain controversial. <EOD> The Differential Distribution and Duration of Action of the Novel κ‐Opioid Receptor Antagonist 5,6‐DA-BNZ and the μ‐Opioid Antagonist Naloxone in the Brain
Abstract: Recent studies in rodents have highlighted the involvement of κ‐opioid receptors in the regulation of food intake and energy homeostasis. To examine the possible involvement of this receptor population in the hyperphagic syndrome observed in rat models of Huntington's disease (HD) and the behavioral effects of drugs in rats with a deletion of the rat preproenkephalin gene (F344 rats homozygous for the pdk mutation (pk/pk)), we compared the distribution and duration of action of the κ‐opioid receptor antagonist 5,6‐DA‐BNZ with those of naloxone in the CNS of conscious rats. Highest levels of 1,1‐di‐trans‐cyclo‐hexyl‐‐5,6‐‐6‐fluoro‐benzomorphan (5,6‐DA‐BNZ) radioactivity (1% dose/g tissue; 35‐50% of the total dose injected) were found in the pons, followed by the medulla oblongata, the cortex, the diencephalon, the thalamus, the cerebellum, and finally the striatum, an observation in agreement with the reported in vitro affinity of 5,6‐DA‐BNZ for µ and κ opioid receptors in rat brain. In addition, this study indicates that there is a rapid and extensive equilibration of 5,6‐DA‐BNZ with the opioid receptors. This contrasts with naloxone whose brain levels increase slowly and at a slower rate than the receptor‐bound fraction. This suggests that, unlike naloxone, 5,6‐DA‐BNZ is not capable of eliciting a “rebound” effect in vivo in rats. 5,6‐DA‐BNZ binding was also measured in crude synaptosomal membranes prepared from 13 brain areas. Highest levels of 5,6‐DA‐BNZ binding were found in the striatum, followed by the thalamus, the globus pallidus, the cortex, the hypothalamus, the mesencephalon, the hippocampus, and finally the cerebellum and the medulla oblongata. These results confirm and extend the reported distribution and affinity of 5,6‐DA‐BNZ for µ and κ opioid receptors determined in vitro. <EOD> A Rare Presentation of An Unusual Diagnosis: Myofibroma of Tongue.

 <EOD> Hydrogen Bond Strengths and Stereoregular Polyethers: Relations among Structure, Solvation Free Energy, and Osmotic Coefficient
The free energy of transfer (delta G degrees ) of molecules with various tendencies to form hydrogen bonds has been discussed in the framework of the so‐called transfer model proposed previously (CHEMBIOCHEM 1998, 1, 413.). The applicability of the transfer model to oligonucleotides, their constituents and other molecules with multiple hydrogen‐bonding sites has been verified. The hydrogen bonding strength is characterized by the second osmotic coefficient of the system studied as the osmotic coefficient increases by the formation of more and more hydrogen bonds. Here the hydrogen‐bonding strength in water of polyethers without stereodefined substituents in the structures was studied as a function of the chain length. The results showed that polyethers preferentially form hydrogen bonds with water molecules by interacting with the oxygens of the latter in a bifurcated bond. The stereoregularity (syn-anti configuration of the carbon–oxygen bond) in the structures of the polyethers causes a decrease in solvation free energy, resulting in an increase in 1 H NMR chemical shift. The relationship between the hydrogen bonding strength and the stereoregularity has been discussed. <EOD> The effects of the COVID-19 crises on daily life experiences: A narrative inquiry
ABSTRACT COVID-19 has significantly impacted the lives of millions of individuals worldwide. This study explored the lives of Canadian nurses during the pandemic. Grounded theory approach enabled the researcher to capture the nuances of participants’ subjective and interpretive understandings, to deepen our understanding of the experiences of the nurses that were affected by the COVID-19 epidemic. Narrative interviews were conducted remotely with nine nurses between May 2021 and July 2021. Thematic analysis assisted with coding and interpreting the narratives. The study revealed how COVID-19 has affected the lives of the participants with respect to their personal lives, work practices, the workplace and public health, communication and social relations, wellbeing and mental health. Several strategies were discussed as mechanisms for dealing with COVID-19. The findings present a better understanding of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on nurses’ lives. <EOD> Synaptic Inputs of CA2 Pyramidal Neurons in a Rodent Hippocampal Region


A B S T R A C TThe CA2 pyramidal neurons are major projection neurons in the CA2 subfield that is located between the CA1 and CA3 subfields in the dorsal hippocampus of rodents. Although CA2 pyramidal neurons form a functionally-defined region that is distinct from CA1 and CA3 subfields, little is known about the synaptic inputs to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Thus, we aimed to compare the inputs to pyramidal neurons among subfields of the dorsal hippocampal formation. We recorded CA2, CA1, and CA3 pyramidal neurons in brain slices obtained from neonatal 6-to 15-day-old C57BL6 mice. We found that CA2 pyramidal neurons receive more inputs from their principal dendritic branches within the CA2 region when compared to other hippocampal subfields. The CA2 pyramidal neurons had more inhibitory inputs from parvalbumin (PV) interneurons in the inner molecular layer of the dentate gyrus (DG) and CA2 subfield, whereas no significant differences were detected in the number of local circuit cells from CA2 pyramidal neurons. No significant difference was detected in glutamatergic inputs to CA2 pyramidal neurons. Thus, the CA2 pyramidal neurons appear to be uniquely tuned to locally formed inhibitory inputs, but not glutamatergic inputs from neighboring CA2 and DG regions. The results will help to better understand the distinct role of the CA2 subfield in the hippocampal information processing.

671,"[/INST] The purpose of the research is to evaluate in critically ill patients the impact on hemodynamic stability on the clearance of vasoconstrictor metabolites associated with oxiris treatment in hemodialysis. A non-interventional research study with non-interventional intervention will be carried out. In the case of an intervention related to the study, this intervention is considered non-standard because the treatment, hemodiafiltration, has been shown to be able to improve the prognosis in severe inflammatory syndromes. The main objective is the objective is to show an inhibition of the vaso-inhibitory action of at least 50% in patients treated with oXiris after 24 hours of hemofiltration. The secondary objectives will be to observe the impact on the hemodynamic stability of the treatment with oXiris, the evaluation of the clearance of vasoactive metabolites, the level of endothelial and monocyte suppression, the kinetics of sepsis-related cytokines and the evolution of inflammatory monocyte markers. This is an observational study which does not interfere with the daily life of patients. There are no changes to life habits. There is no additional clinical examination or biological sampling to be undertaken on the part of the patient. The researcher carries out the biological sampling for the determination of angiotensins. The collection is made on the dialysis machine at the following time points: Baseline (before entering the device); 24 hours +/- 6 hours of treatment; 72 hours +/- 12 hours of treatment. These samples will be analyzed using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry by Attoquant diagnostics®. For this purpose, additional blood tubes (25 mL) will be drawn from the arterial line (before entering the device), at 24 hours and 72 hours. The samples will be stored outside the dialysis machine at a temperature of at least 2 to 8°C before being sent to Attoquant diagnostics® within a maximum of 24 hours and will be immediately analyzed upon reception.

The EcoRI site of the T2 phage genome is 99% homologous to that of a bacteriophage lambda, resulting in the loss of the EcoRI recognition site in both T2 and lambda genomes after digestion. Under such a restriction site absence the use of a pair of primers (L1, L2) specific to the EcoRI site of lambda DNA can provide a site, whose amplification will result in the production of a 479 bp product. The application of this method to a wide range of bacterial strains (164 different) resulted in the detection of the EcoRI restriction site of the T2 genome in all 128 Shigella strains, and 36 Salmonella 9721 420, 57 339, and 76 200 isolates. The ""T2-like"" viruses, were detected in both human clinical intestinal discharge samples examined and 8 different aquatic environments (sea water, river water, water from the lakes). Furthermore, a sample of water from the Moscow reservoirs was found to contain a strain of Salmonella. It may be concluded that this method is a useful tool to detect the 'T2-like' phages that are highly prevalent in clinical and environmental samples. <EOD> The Effect of COVID-19-Triggered Fear on Patients Undergoing Prostate Cancer Surgery: A Prospective, Single-Group, and Pre"

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
VISIT 1 (Month 0) FACE TO FACE Once consented a study ID will be assigned, and basic demographic information taken. A standardized medical history will be taken to include target symptom history, exacerbation frequency and hospital admissions. A detailed co-morbid history will be taken as will a review of all previous asthma treatments. Validated symptom questionnaires will be completed during the study visits. All participants will be given an electronic PEFR monitor. Patients on or planned for inhaled therapy will be given an electronic adherence monitor. Pulmonary function testing will be performed including Spirometry, Impulse Oscillometry, Fraction of exhaled Nitric Oxide along with bronchodilator reversibility. Sample collection will include blood, oral rinse, nasopharyngeal swab, exhaled breath condensate, stool and induced sputum. A subset of patients will be consented for bronchoscopy for corresponding sample collection. PROCEDURES: Questionnaires: Validated symptom questionnaires will be completed during the study visits indicated previously. Asthma Control Test measures the adequacy of asthma control and change in asthma control which may occur spontaneously or in response to treatment. The GERD-Q and the SNOT-22 establish the presence and severity of co-morbid Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and sinus disease, both common asthma co-morbidities, which may affect quality of life, symptom control and treatment response. Investigations: Pulmonary function testing will include spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS), Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) measurement. Fraction of exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), an established biomarker measured routinely in asthma clinics, will also be measured. Bio-samples will be collected from sampling and storage equipment to examine for environmental contamination including sterile saline, nasopharyngeal swab, oral rinse/sputum pot container and the bronchoscope. Sample should be kept cold on ice until processing. Nasopharyngeal swab will be collected inserted into each nostril for several seconds. For a bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) a total of 60ml of normal saline will be instilled into a pulmonary lobe and the return will be collected for analysis. An endothelial brush (EB) involves the introduction of a small brush via the bronchoscope to gently brush the airway walls to collect epithelial cells for analysis for morphological and functional studies. In addition blood samples will be processed for complete blood count, immunoglobulin E and aeroallergen sensitivity. Background control, oral rinse, nasopharyngeal swab, EBC, induced sputum and stool samples will be processed for microbiome. EBC and induced sputum will also be processed for host immune profiling such as through CIBERSORT.

Summary:
 <EOD> .
Tumor angiogenesis plays an essential role in tumor growth and metastasis. It is believed that the vascular endothelial growth factor/vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGF/VEGFR) system is one of the most crucial mechanisms in tumor neovascularization. As an inhibitor of VEGFR, sorafenib is a novel synthetic multi-target tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The molecular structure of sorafenib was found to differ from gefitinib and erlotinib, and sorafenib was initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma. The present paper reviews research progress on the targeting VEGF in tumor neovascular inhibition, the mechanisms of action of sorafenib and the role of sorafenib in the treatment of malignant tumors, as well as its clinical status in terms of adverse events. <EOD> A review of the management of acute promyelocytic leukemia with all-trans retinoic acid in France from 1986 to 1988.
Between February 18th and December 19th 1986 3830 consecutive patients diagnosed with a malignant hematological disease were evaluated on a nation-wide basis for inclusion in a trial of all-trans retinoic acid (tRA) therapy for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). 188 of these (4.8%) patients (of whom 9 were considered as AML without APL, and 179 as APL) fulfilled the entry criteria and were consequently treated on 21 separate protocols. In all centers APL was diagnosed (or confirmed in one center) by one pathologist (JEH), according to specific criteria derived from the study of 116 cases in 10 centers already described. The overall median patient age was 46 years (range, 14 to 89). There were 120 cases of male and 69 of female APL patients. Cases previously treated with cytotoxic drugs were 1 and 13 respectively. One patient was heavily irradiated. 24 patients had no chemotherapy before inclusion. The diagnosis was not made through bone marrow, but through other sites in 26 cases. The median white blood cell count prior to inclusion was 3,461/mm3. All patients were treated with tRA alone. Doses of tRA varied from 135 mg/d to 60 mg/d. The median number of included patients per center was 9 (range, 1 to 35). After a median follow-up of 60.5 months, 153 patients (82%) are alive and continuously in remission, including 12 patients in whom no further therapy was applied. The mean time to marrow normalization was 44 days, and the mean duration of the complete leukopenic phase 61 days.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) <EOD> Scaling and universality in the random-field Ising model.

 <EOD> Differential response of human B-lymphocytic cells to bacteria and phorbol ester tumor promoters.
Interactions between human B-cells and various Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria were studied by the use of a coculture system with highly purified B (but not T or null) cells which were derived from the circulation of patients with various clinical and hematological diagnoses. The coculture consisted of the B cells of a certain person and the bacteria which had been either collected either directly from the donor of the B cells or as the main component of the stools obtained prior to their use in the experiments. Under these conditions, cocultures which were treated with phorbol diester tumor promoters induced B ells to proliferate, to become cytophatic for the bacteria, and to spontaneously secrete IgM. In contrast, the intestinal bacterial components of different stool specimens did not provoke any proliferative response of B cells which were derived from different persons. <EOD> The influence of different substrates on the electrochemical degradation of bisphenol A in river water.
The electrochemical degradation of bisphenol A (BPA) in river water was investigated through cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The influence of the applied potential and the different substrates on the electrochemical degradation of BPA was investigated at an electrode diameter of 3 mm and at a current density of 13 mA/m2. The degradation of BPA in river water was determined at different potentials. A new substrate was prepared by a combination of titanium with carbon nanomaterials carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) to improve the performance of the electrochemical degradation of BPA. Compared with the Ti substrate, the Ti substrates with a small size of 3 mm exhibited a higher current density, and the carbon nanomaterials could also promote the electrochemical degradation of BPA in river water. Under optimal conditions, the removal rate of BPA (97.30%) was obtained when the CV cycling was repeated three times and a potential of -1.8 V was applied at a 13 mA/m2 current density. <EOD> The genetic and dietary modulation of vitamin B12 status and its health implications

Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin, required for metabolic processes, with roles in the prevention of neural degeneration, prevention of anaemia, and maintenance of a healthy nervous system. Deficiency of B12 can lead to the development of macrocytic anaemia, dementia, pareses and psychotic episodes. Vitamin B12 deficiency is commonly seen in the elderly and the vegan population. B12 deficiency appears to be on the increase in populations of developed countries. We explore the molecular aspects and the health implications of B12 deficiency along with approaches available to manage or prevent a B12 deficient state. With the ever-growing body of evidence, we review that the management at an individual level is likely to yield improved patient outcomes.

# Introduction
Vitamin B12 is a water soluble vitamin, critical in many enzyme-bound reactions. These are involved in the synthesis of haemoglobin and myelin and are required for the interconversion of succinyl coenzyme A (CoA) and methylmalonyl CoA (MMA-CoA), which are needed for the formation of fatty acids and for the decarboxylation of the latter as required prior to the synthesis of γ-aminobutyric acid, the major neuro"

 <EOD> Scales and patterns in random diffusion along open spaces

In several natural and industrial contexts, random walkers traverse open environments whose geometry is described by a sequence of planar random surfaces. Surprisingly, random walks along such open spaces exhibit scaling behaviour very different from that observed in closed systems. Here, we show that these unexpected observations originate from the geometrical features of the underlying open surface. From a rigorous point of view, we prove that the scaling exponents, associated with the average velocity of the particles and their variance, and related to the surface waviness, are always equal, and are characterized by the fractal dimension of the open surface. Our general arguments indicate that our results might be extended to random walks performed along open spaces of different geometries and characterized by different statistics.Published: xx xx xxxx OPEN www.nature.com/scientificreports/ 2 Scientific RepoRts | 7: 2003 |

680,"[/INST] <EOD> A Novel, Nonspatial Measure of Reaction Time Variability Is Predicted by Physiologic Cardiac Vagal Activity.
PURPOSE
Reaction time (RT) variability is associated with performance and health outcomes. A number of approaches to assessing RT variability have been proposed, which depend on a key assumption that RT variability can be summarized by a single time-invariant measure. However, the single time-invariant measure of RT variability does not account for the temporal organization of RTs (i.e., a series of fast and slow RTs). Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate this temporal relationship between RTs and assess the novel RT variability measure that may be predicted by heart rate variability, which is related to physiologic cardiac vagal activity.


METHOD
Fifty participants performed a simple RT task and completed health and lifestyle questionnaires. Cardiac vagal activity was evaluated using an electrocardiogram device and heart rate variability parameters during the RT task.


RESULTS
There was a substantial positive relationship (r = .596) between an index of temporal fluctuation, which assessed the magnitude of differences between neighboring RTs, and cardiac vagal activity (time domain index). There was a substantial negative relationship (r = -.548) between standard deviation and cardiac vagal activity. However, these measures of RT variability were moderately or weakly associated with one another, indicating that these summary measures of RT variability provided different information.


CONCLUSIONS
Because the temporal relationship indicated by these 2 statistical summary measures was at an opposite magnitude, we provide evidence that measures of temporal fluctuation and standard deviation may provide complementary information on cardiac vagal activity. This study suggests that 2 complementary summary measures may help provide a more complete description of RT variability. <EOD> .
INTRODUCTION
The prevalence of epicondylitis has increased to an alarming rate in the working and daily population. Our study analysed the effectiveness of treatment methods in this case series to show the efficacy of conservative and operative treatment.


METHOD
Patients with lateral epicondylitis in our hospital between 1997 and 2002 were included in the study. Patient groups (n = 65) were compared both in the number of days to return to normal activities and in the total recovery time depending on their age, gender, diagnosis date (< 6 months/≥ 6 months).


RESULTS
The number of days needed to return to usual activities was significantly longer depending on the age of the patient (< 55 years and > 55 years) (p = 0.043). Statistical significance was found regarding pain scores dependent on the duration of the disease (< 6 and ≥ 6 months) (p < 0.05), the presence or absence of pain on physical activity also depending on the duration of the disease (p < 0.01) and the presence or absence of pain on flexion extension movements depending on the duration of the disease (p < 0.01).


CONCLUSION
We observed a significantly longer healing period with decreasing age, increasing symptom duration, and insufficient recovery in the physical examination of patients with late epicondylitis.

 <EOD> Prophylactic use of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) in oncology patients treated with fludarabine-based therapy (F-BT) was associated with a lower incidence of post-F-BT acute nephrotoxicity

Background:The prophylactic use of a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine in oncology patients receiving fludarabine has been controversial.Methods:We retrospectively studied all patients treated with fludarabine-based (F-BT) therapy who received PCV13 vaccination (PCV) before fludarabine administration between April 1, 2008 and April 1, 2013. The primary endpoints included the onset of post-F-BT acute renal failure (ARF), non-hospitalized renal symptom, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS)/acetaminophen (APAP) requirement associated with ARF. The secondary endpoints included the onset of acute renal exacerbation, congenital heart disease-associated pulmonary hypertension (cHPT), and pneumococcal pneumonia. Results were statistically analyzed using the Fisher's exact test and student t test.Results: There were no significant differences between the 33 PCV group and 71 non-PCV group patients in terms of median age or the proportion of patients with underlying diseases, which included renal dysfunction, concomitant use of NSAIDS/APAP with F-BT, cHPT, or lymphoid malignancies. However, the non-PCV group showed a significantly higher incidence of post-F-BT acute renal exacerbation, NSAIDS/ APAP use with F-BT, cHPT complication with F-BT, and pneumococcus pneumonia compared with the PCV group (34.0% vs. 14.6%, 34.0% vs. 15.9%, 30.1% vs. 13.6%, and 2.8% vs 0%; P = 0.01, P <0.01, P = 0.02, and P <0.01, respectively).Conclusion: Among patients with F-BT, PCV13 vaccination is associated with a lower incidence of post-F-BT ARF, non-hospitalized renal symptoms, NSAIDs/APAP use with F-BT, and pneumococcus pneumonia.

 <EOD> Impact of surgery for chronic rhinosinusitis on sleep and quality of life
BACKGROUND Sleep impairment is a common symptom for patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and is not necessarily relieved by surgery. This study aims to evaluate the role of paranasal sinus surgery (PNS) in improving sleep quality and disability among patients with CRS. METHODS Patients treated with PNS for CRS between January 2012 and December 2019 were enrolled in this study. Sleep disturbance prior to and 6-month after PNS was evaluated using a self-administered questionnaire, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) test. Disability was compared between the baseline and 6-month after surgery with another self-administered questionnaire, the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-25 (SNOT-25). RESULTS Of those who were eligible with available data on both sleep and disability (n = 119), the mean ± standard deviation (SD) age was 33.7 ± 10.2 years. Seventy-six patients (63.6%) were male and 82 patients (69.7%) were diagnosed with CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). The mean ± SD PSQI overall score significantly improved from 5.0 ± 2.8 to 3.0 ± 2.3 after PNS (P = .0005). In both the CRSwNP and chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyps (CRSsNP) groups, the PSQI overall score was statistically significant (P = .0003 and P = .0035, respectively). There were no significant differences among the sleep parameters before and after PNS in either CRSwNP or CRSsNP (P > .1). The mean ± SD global SNOT-25 score was statistically significant (P = .0001) from 42.4 ± 17.8 to 10.9 ± 11.8 after PNS. Global scores for all questions on the SNOT-25 questionnaire, except sinus problems, significantly improved from before to after surgery (P = .0045, .0048, .0002, .0252, .0002, .0049, and .0002, respectively). CONCLUSION PNS improved sleep and quality of life in patients with CRS. <EOD> .

The efficacy of a tap in the ankle of patients with spinal cord injury and of normal human subjects has been studied. A tap in the ankle evokes reflex sympathetic vasoconstriction resulting in a transient reduction of skin blood flow as measured by venous occlusion strain gauge plethysmography. With an inflatable cuff wrapped around the ankle, a single tap elicited a more marked reduction of ankle blood flow than a sustained vibratory stimulus of the surface of the leg. Therefore the tapping test is specific and sensitive for inducing vasoconstriction. In a cohort of patients examined between 6 weeks and 17 years (mean: 3 years) after clinical onset of sp"

Paper: Surveillance Colonoscopy in the Modern Era: Results From the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Medicare Database.
Study Overview
=================
Background & Aims: Colonoscopy-based surveillance of patients with history of colorectal cancer (CRC) or a high-risk adenoma (HRA) is an important strategy for reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with subsequent colorectal cancer. Our goal was to investigate the uptake of colonoscopy and adenoma detection rates (ADR) in a nationwide population of older adults.

Study Population
=================
Setting, Design, and Patient Cohort: This investigation entailed a populationbased assessment of colonoscopies from Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results Medicare Database (SEER-M) claims. Specifically, we analyzed colonoscopies for all enrollees between 2007-2009.

Interventions / Variables
=================
Outcome: The primary outcome was examined to obtain colonoscopy utilization in SEER-M between 2007-2009. Secondary outcomes included ADR.

Results
=================
Results: 23,641 patients underwent a colonoscopy during the specified time frame. While adenoma detection rates were in accordance with American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guidelines, only approximately 50% of patients received a surveillance colonoscopy during the period, with adherence increasing from 2007-2009.

# Introduction
Tuberculoid leprosy is the least frequently occurring and is generally characterized by few lesions, discrete, circumscribed and more or less nodular. In this type of disease, the antibody-formation takes place at an earlier stage. Tuberculoid leprosy usually develops from tubercle bacillus infection, while the lepromatous variety is the most common type and is caused by M. leprae. The clinical symptoms appear more late in this type and is manifested by diffuse hypertrophy, with more or less widespread or nodular type. On histological examination it reveals lymphocytic inflammatory reaction. This type of leprosy tends to become immunological anergy, and the immunological index tends to zero. Hence, the antibody synthesis is suppressed and at the same time, the number of organisms is highest in the body. The intermediate type of leprosy consists of both granulomatous and diffuse lesions with few or without lesions. The intermediate cases are those exhibiting certain intermediate features between tuberculoid and the lepromatous type. The BCG vaccination does not influence the immunological response to M. leprae. The antibody formation against M. leprae is very low in bacillary or intermediate leprosy.

## Aims and objectives
An IgG and IgM antibody tests were conducted for IgA class antibody to the soluble M. leprae antigenic fractions (MLSAF) using lepromatous and tuberculoid leprosy patients and were compared with the clinical type and sub-types. A comparison of the antibody detection and the clinical subtyping of leprosy was also undertaken.

## Brief description of materials, methods and results
IgM and IgG of class antibodies for MLSAF in sera from lepromatous and tuberculoid leprosy patients were tested using a solid phase RIA system.
The antigens used for the studies were MLSAF. The MLSAF is a very weak antigen (1.0 µg of protein/mL), it shows a single predominant peak in gel filtration chromatography. IgM and IgG antibodies in the sera from patients, lepromatous (5) and tubercul"

Summary: The authors present the clinical characteristics of the patients affected by malnutrition and the control sample.

Summary: [/INST] Here is your chance to provide a summary of the article. Describe here any scientific evidence that corroborates the hypothesis that malnutrition is influenced by diet, gut microbiota, and genetics

Input Text: Malnutrition, as a multifactorial syndrome, results from an imbalance between the host diet and the body requirement of nutrients and represents the second leading cause of global death and morbidity. Malnutrition has been shown to result from specific nutrient deficiencies or excesses, which can influence the composition of gut content and gut microbial composition in both the intestine and feces (Hudry et al., 2016; Jian, 2017). Recent evidence has suggested the gut microbiota composition as a potential modulator of malnutrition in humans (Wall, 2018). Gut microbiota may exert their metabolic effects via interactions with the intestinal endoluminal and immune system and also via the production of short-chain fatty acids and the secretion of microbes-derived hormones (Sonnenburg and Bäckhed, 2016). A complex communication between the intestine and other organs is required for the body to ensure adequate absorption of nutrients and for normal growth and bodily functions maintenance. In fact, recent studies have reported that malnutrition, induced by specific dietary manipulations, alters the immune-endocrine system and causes metabolic stress in both infants and adults (Mariani et al., 2012; Tain et al., 2008).

Summarize the article: The aim of the SAM Project (Science Against Malnutrition Project) is to characterize the genetic, microbiota, and metabolomic factors that contribute to the development of malnutrition and identify a cohort of biomarkers that could be used to diagnose malnutrition associated with deficiency or excess in association with other pathology. To reach this goal, the project will recruit a cohort of more than 1,000 patients. The sample population of the SAM Project study will be a combination of healthy individuals from the general population of Caucasian ethnicity, individuals affected by malnutrition due to deficiency or excess in association with other patology and sex- and age-matched healthy controls not affected by malnutrition due to deficiency or excess and any pathology.

Instructions: All submissions will be evaluated by a jury of experts. If you get good scores, your text will be included in the database ""Summarys-of-Readings"". Your text will be available in both printed and electronic form. We hope that this tool will help researchers to catch up on the research being done in the field of cell biology.

# Results

Most of the studies will focus on the gut microbiota composition in relation to malnutrition phenotypes, in order to find gut microbial signatures associated with increased risk for malnutrition, in addition for providing support for the hypothesis that malnutrition results from specific nutrient deficiencies or excesses.

# Discussion

The results obtained in the SAM Project will help to clarify whether malnutrition, as a multifactorial syndrome results from nutrient imbalances or excesses.

# Conclusions

This study may provide new important information for researchers to better understand the pathogenesis mechanisms related to malnutrition.

 <EOD> Influence of Pulsed Electrical Discharges on the Surface Properties of Copper Surfaces for Sodium‐Ion Battery Anodes
Copper (Cu) is one of the most promising and cost‐effective alternative anode materials for sodium‐ion batteries (SIBs) due to its good electrochemical properties of high capacity, high energy density and low cost. Although the electrochemical performance improves gradually, its initial Coulombic efficiency decreases largely, which may come from the accumulation of an insulating film on the Cu surface. Therefore, Cu anodes need to be modified by an electrical discharge method to improve the poor low coulombic efficiency of Cu. In this study, Cu electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) tests are conducted to characterize the effect of different applied voltages and times. The results show that the coating thickness of the formed film first increases and then decreases with prolonged pulsed electrical discharge treatment (PEDT) time and electric field intensity. The Cu sample treated by PEDT at an applied voltage of 70 V for 10 s presents the largest coating thickness of 4.6 nm and a best low Coulombic efficiency (67% vs 71.7%). <EOD> .
During a period from 1953-1970 a group of patients was under the examination of the clinical and cytological tests concerning the detection of the malignant tumors, especially of the mammary gland, ovaries, uteri and the lungs. In this article the results with special emphasis on the cytological examinations during the breast cancer are reported. For 106 patients with breast cancer 862 cytological smears from the breast were examined. Positive results were obtained in 30.78%. The importance of the repeated cytological examinations in order to detect the micrometastatic lesion of the breast is stressed. <EOD> A new endoscopic lens for the identification of normal and pathological areas inside the colon.
We describe a new lens, the ""VITO"", for colonoscopy. The distal tip of the flexible rectal sheath, in which the lens is incorporated, is covered by a latex balloon, which allows the lens to be immersed in the colonic mucosa and to obtain a clear view of the mucosa. The optical system of this endoscope, consisting of two lenses, is characterised by a large focus and provides a very clear view of the colonic mucosa. The endoscope is also simple to handle, has great ergonomic qualities and facilitates the identification of the normal or pathological structures of the colon. The use of this endoscopic lens improves the quality of the endoscopic view of colonic mucosa and is particularly helpful in the identification of the areas of mucosal atrophy, which may be difficult to distinguish from adenomas with conventional endoscopic equipment. <EOD> A novel system for monitoring free‐living activity in mice reveals a circadian bias in physical activity that decreases with age but is unaffected by genetic leanness
Background The mouse is an important model animal for human physiology and disease. The circadian clock that regulates the sleep–wake cycle, however, appears to play a smaller role in resting time in the mouse than in man. We have set up a unique system to measure and quantify free‐living physical activity in the home cage of freely moving mice. It provides accurate activity measurements, and as such promises to be a valuable complement to conventional techniques in murine chronobiology research. Results We show that although mice do not display an overt circadian rhythm in rest–activity, they have a clear bias with respect to preferred rest and activity times. Weight‐matched groups of control and leptin‐deficient ob/ob mice of both sexes were chosen, showing that leanness does not affect the rest–activity rhythm of mice. In contrast to the strong circadian bias in mice, circadian rhythmicity was observed in both sexes and strains of rats. Conclusions The mouse shows a rest–activity bias independent of genetic leanness. This new methodology will permit further studies of the circadian‐modulated aspects of physical activity and their regulation by the central nervous system. <EOD> .

Background
=================================

Perioperative brain injury is becoming a significant problem. There is a higher risk of cognitive decline following certain types of surgery, such as shoulder arthroplasty, when it is performed using the beach-chair position rather than the lateral decubitus position. It is well-documented that brain hypoperfusion is a major cause for perioperative brain injury in these patients. Unfortunately, conventional cerebral oximetry may not be able to detect brain desaturation reliably, as it measures only oxygen saturation in frontal lobes. Our tr-fNIRS device is capable of detecting ischemia in different brain areas from a large sample of patients. By using multichannel tr-fNIRS we can detect small fluctuation in oxygenation in different brain regions when brain desaturation occurs during surgery. Furthermore, our tr-fNIRS device allows us to calculate the correlation between fluctuation in oxygenation between different brain regions (i.e., left frontal lobe versus right frontal lobe). A low correlation coefficient indicates ischemic brain injury in a specific brain region or multiple brain regions. Finally, our tr-fNIRS device can generate time series data that will allow us to perform quantitative analysis to determine the association between the degree and severity of brain desaturation and postoperative clinical outcomes.

Stroke is associated with a 3.56 greater risk of death three years after the stroke event . A significant association between minor stroke and a subsequent cognitive decline has been described in patients that undergo shoulder arthroscopy under general anesthesia. Furthermore, our clinical practice indicates that patients who have a minor stroke during shoulder arthroscopy under general anesthesia have a higher incidence of prolonged hospital stay and higher incidence of discharge to long-term care facilities.

A few clinical studies have reported incidence of neurological deficit and stroke following shoulder arthroscopy under anesthesia. According to one study, the incidence of neurological deficits following shoulder surgery is between 1.1-11.1%. However, the majority of these deficits are likely to be ischemic brain lesions, many of which can be undetected by traditional imaging techniques such as CT and X-ray. MRI is the optimal method to detect both overt symptomatic and silent ischemic brain injury.

 <EOD> .
Lymphocytes of the peripheral blood are activated under the effect of a variety of agents, hormones. In vitro, cultured lymphocytes of the peripheral blood also are activated. Activation results in an enhancement of the cytotoxic effect, phagocytic activity, and metabolic processes. The activation index was determined in the lymphocyte population of donors, patients with lymphogranulomatosis, and patients with acute viral hepatitis. In the course of the illness in the virus hepatitis patients the activation index rose as early as 3 days after the onset of a disease, i.e., long before the first symptoms of the disease. The activation index did not have a direct relation to the number of active lymphocytes in the donors and patients examined. <EOD> Surgical Treatment of Metastatic Tumors of the Small Bowel: Report of 24 Cases
Twenty-four patients (20 women, 4 men) with metastatic tumors involving the small bowel were studied and 13 surgical procedures were performed, between 1984 and 1992. Internal hemorrhoids were the primary tumors in six (five rectal, one sigmoid). The other lesions were breast carcinoma (seven), thyroid carcinoma (seven), and one carcinosarcoma of the ovary, malignant lymphoma of the small bowel, and choriocarcinoma (one). Operative procedures included enterolysis (four), strangulation ileus (three), segmental resection (2), simple resection of ulcerated segment (3), segmental resection with partial small intestine transplantation (1), terminal small bowel resection (2), exploration (3), and laparoscopy in two patients. All patients but one (a case of carcinosarcoma) died postoperatively. Only one case had a successful transplant, six patients are still alive and five died of the disease. Five-year survival rates for internal hemorrhoids (five patients) were 20% (one patient). When the surgical procedure was anastomosis. Five-year survival was 50% (four patients). If surgery was a simple bowel resection (one patient) five-year survival was 67% (one patient), and if surgery was enterolysis (one patient) five-year survival was 50% (one patient). There were no deaths when the procedure was an exploration (two patients, no surgery), or when the procedure was laparoscopy (two patients, no surgery). Small bowel metastases can be diagnosed with precision by small bowel contrast-enhanced computed tomography or double-contrast roentgenographic examinations and intraoperative enteroscopy, but the only reliable method is the operative approach. The best results were obtained following strangulation caused by small bowel metastases, and laparoscopy and enteroscopy procedures were very useful to identify the location of small bowel mass. No metastatic tumors are curable and the majority of these patients die of intra-abdominal obstruction. <EOD> .

The thiobarbituric acid test is a method for estimating the degree of reaction of unsaturated lipids with thiobarbituric acid and sodium ethylhydroxide. It serves as a practical, albeit qualitative method. As such, it can be relied upon to detect the presence of the reaction compound, malondialdehyde. Thiobarbituric acid value can be calculated by using the molar extinction coefficient (e, 155,000 for malondialdehyde 211; a value which is constant for all aldehydes of similar molecular weight) or by a direct calculation according to the following formula: <EOD> Methylation status of ERα promoter in tumours and adjacent breast"
689,"[/INST]Physical Activity and FVIII Elimination: Relevance to Personalized Therapy in Severe Hemophilia A study. Study overview: The main purpose of this study is to assess whether or not physical activity (PA) in form of the number of daily steps can influence the PK profile of the rec-FVIII concentrate in patients with severe HA. The patients enrolled in the study will undergo at screening, during two weeks of run-in a PA recording, daily physical activity and PK evaluation, to characterize the FVIII PK profile with the area under the curve (AUC) parameters. The patients will be subsequently exposed to a physical activity protocol (at screening, visit 1 to visit 2, with PA recording, daily physical activity and PK evaluation) to evaluate how the pharmacokinetic parameter of the infused rec-FVIII concentrate (AUC), in relationship with the number of mean daily steps, will change after a PA protocol. Investigate whether and how the daily physical activity (measured as number of steps, using the SenseWear Armband device) affects the PK parameter.

 <EOD> Cervical spine trauma: treatment with flexible intraligamental rods.
The intraligamental fixation method for cervical spine trauma includes a posterior arthrodesis and subjacent vertebrae reduction. Sixteen patients with cervical fracture-dislocations treated with posterior cervical spinal fusion and intraligamental rods with a minimum follow-up of 2 years were studied. In all cases, preoperative and postoperative radiographs were taken immediately and then yearly for at least 5 years. The reduction of the subjacent vertebrae level (from 1 to 2 mm immediately postoperatively to 0.33 mm at the last postoperative radiograph) and the Cobb angle reduction and the angle variation for each vertebra between preoperative and postoperative radiographs were evaluated. Posterior column support for at least 10 years was found on the post-traumatized vertebrae in 7 of 16 patients on yearly radiograms. In another 6 patients, an average 17-year posterior column support was found within 3 years. In 3 patients, complete posterior column support of at least 10 years was not seen. <EOD> The effects of intracisternal ACTH on the secretion of insulin and on hypothalamic and hypophyseal function.
Following the administration of dexamethasone to hypophysectomized rats (GALVIN and SLOANE, 1963), insulin secretion is severely depressed although the administration of ACTH to these rats stimulates the secretion of insulin. The purpose of the present study was to determine the effect of intracisternal administration of ACTH on insulin secretion and also to determine the response of the hypophysis and the hypophysio-portal nervous system to this injection. In view of the rapidity of the effect of dexamethasone on insulin activity (GALVIN and SLOANE, 1963), it was felt that intracisternal ACTH would have a more rapid effect than would an iv injection. It has been shown (WILHELM, 1934; STERN, 1960) that glucose and protein can be selectively administered to the cerebrospinal fluid as it passes out of the ventricular system of the brain, and the metabolism of these substances can be determined from the subsequent changes in the blood plasma. This has been used to show that blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier for glucose and protein changes during pregnancy (SCHLOSS, 1960). It also has been shown (GALVIN and GLAZER, 1961) that glucose injected intracisternally is converted by brain tissue into lactic acid and that the glucose disappears from the cerebrospinal fluid very rapidly whereas the lactic acid remains for a considerably longer period of time indicating that the glucose disappears by diffusion out of the fluid. The lactic acid appears with a half-life of approximately three minutes thus indicating that the disappearance of the glucose occurs within fifteen seconds. This disappearance of glucose is also indicated by the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier for insulin (GALVIN and REDFIELD, 1957). The rapidity of this disappearance would indicate that a rapid action would be expected since the injection is made near the floor of the fourth ventricle. It was felt that insulin should be detectable in the circulation in as short a time as 5 to lO <EOD> Oxytocin and Autism

Autism is a multifaceted condition that results in developmental disabilities in social and communicational interactions. Social interaction impairments are known to precede the diagnostic criteria for autism and therefore early intervention has been developed on this foundation with mixed results. Recent work has suggested neuropeptides such as oxytocin may be a suitable target to augment social functioning in neurodevelopmental disorders. Given its role in social behavior, oxytocin has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of autism and"

**Provided by Centre Hospitalier Vallidada** <EOD> The effect of thiamine diphosphate addition to an Escherichia coli in-frame deletion strain on the growth of Bacillus subtilis
In this study, the interaction and effect of thiamine diphosphate (TDP) with Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis was identified. The results showed that both the E. coli ΔthiE and the B. subtilis ΔthiCEF mutants showed abnormal cell growth in the case of minimal media with low amounts of thiamine as the thiamine supplemental source. Addition of TDP to the growth media could rescue the abnormal growth phenotypes in the thiamine-requiring microbes. The growth of B. subtilis ΔthiCEF strain was also affected by TDP addition. The addition of TDP in the media for B. subtilis ΔthiCEF strain increased the lag time. It was suggested that the thiazole group (T) from TDP affected the growth of the microbes which were lacking of the thiamine transporter and this affected the cell growth but had no effect on the microbes which possessed active thiamine importer. The effect of TDP on the cell cultures in which all microbes required TDP to grow showed that addition of TDP in the media could rescue the thiamine-requiring microbes to grow in presence of thiamine-supplemental source. This study demonstrated that TDP exerted its biological function under low thiamine concentration condition only and was functionally similar to thiamine to the microbes in which thiamine was required but did not affect the growth of microbes which required pyrophosphate (PPP) for normal growth. <EOD> The effect of oral hygiene measures on gingivitis: a randomized clinical trial.
This study addressed the clinical effect of oral hygiene measures on gingival health. Twenty-three healthy subjects free of periodontal and systemic diseases were enrolled in the study. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups. One group received oral hygiene instructions which emphasized plaque control, scaling and root debridement. The second group was provided with dentifrices and oral hygiene instructions. The third group, who acted as a control, was instructed to refrain from using any oral hygiene products. Clinical examinations were performed to record the plaque, bleeding, probing depths and clinical attachment levels. The examinations were performed in three different periods: at baseline, at 2 weeks and at 2 months. Data was analyzed by ANOVA (Scheffe's test). Two-weeks after receiving the oral hygiene instructions and the dentifrices, reductions in plaque were achieved and the bleeding index improved. There was no significant change in probing depth or the clinical attachment level after short-term hygiene measures. The control group, which did not receive oral hygiene instructions and dentifrices, showed significant improvements in plaque accumulation, the gingival bleeding index, probing depths and attachment levels after the treatment period. This study concluded that brushing and the use of a low abrasive fluoride and desensitizing dentifrice improved gingivitis and reduced bleeding.

 <EOD> The Shrunk Dot Product Improves Structure Discovery in Metabolomics Data via Localized Cluster Analysis
Advances in high-throughput metabolomics data acquisition technologies bring tremendous challenges and opportunities to computational biology and data science. Computational methods that can identify and characterize metabolomics data structure from multivariate data sets are needed. A novel algorithm, the shrunk dot product (SDP), has been proposed in previous work as a method for detecting metabolomics data structural signatures where clusters of metabolites and subjects share similar profiles. The clustering patterns detected using SDP analysis have been shown to be biologically meaningful, and the method's applicability in different metabolomics data sets has been proven. In this paper, we investigate alternative versions of the SDP and present an improved version, the localized SDP (LSDP). LSDP uses a neighborhood function to partition the SDP computation domain, which is subsequently used to calculate a local distance matrix based on the neighborhood structure. The resulting approach improves cluster quality, reproducibility, and visualization in different real and simulated metabolomics and proteomics data sets. We also present the use of a new visualization technique to gain insights into cluster structure and intercluster connections. <EOD> Tympanic temperature readings.
A comparison was made of the temperature of the tympanum with rectal temperature and with other methods based on peripheral circulation. A new apparatus for measuring tympanic temperatures was used throughout the investigation. One hundred six males and 106 females were divided into two groups, in which one group each was readings at ten degree intervals during periods of two, six, and twelve hours. The tympanic method correlated better with rectal than with the other temperatures. It is concluded that tympanic readings are more accurate than any other methods based upon the peripheral circulation. One advantage of the tympanic method is its lack of invasiveness, and it is proposed that its use will have important clinical applications. <EOD> Hydrolysis of 6-Methylsalicylic Acid in Solution. 1. Role of Water.
Hydrolysis of 6-methylsalicylic acid (1) in aqueous solution was investigated as a function of water content, pH, and enantiomeric composition of the aqueous environment. Enantiomeric ratio of the major enantiomer present in the products 2 or 3 was determined by quantitative 2-methoxy-2-(naphthalen-2-ylpropanoic acid] ester) chiral HPLC. Under aqueous solution conditions, enantiomeric excess of the minor enantiomer 2 for the nonenzymatic reaction was less than that of the major enantiomer 3. On the other hand, enantiomeric excess of the minor enantiomer 6-O-methyl-benzoyl salicyluric acid (2) for the enzymatic reaction was greater than that of the major enantiomer 2-O-methylaspirin (3). The rate of the minor enantiomer for both reactions followed an inverse relationship with the enantiomeric excess. From these results, it is proposed that the minor enantiomer is produced from the major enantiomer by a base-catalyzed mechanism, which is favored at higher pH values. Also, with both enzymatic and nonenzymatic reactions of 1 in solution, rate of the reaction was dependent upon water content and enantiomeric excess of the minor enantiomer was related to aqueous environment. This suggests intermediacy of a water/hydroxy/water system for the mechanism of hydrolysis. It is proposed that the hydroxyl group of the aqueous system is not only involved in the proton abstraction from the carbonyl carbon, but also stabilizes the transition state of the nonenzymatic rearrangement. <EOD> The effect of cysteinyl leukotrienes on airway smooth muscle in asthma

 <EOD> Cannabidiol modulates glucocorticoid effects on glutamate, γ-aminobutyric acid, glutamine, and glutathione in the prefrontal cortex of adult rats

Background: Cannabidiol (CBD) is able to modulate steroids effects through neuroprotection. This study evaluated the neuroprotective and modulating effects of CBD on glucocorticoids action in the medial prefrontal cortex.Methods: Adult male Wistar rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control; CBD (2 mg/kg); dexamethasone (DEX; 1 mg/kg); or DEX + CBD, and were submitted to a single i.p. injection twice per day for 7 days. The biochemical effects of a single dose of CBD (2 mg/kg) and/or chronic treatment with DEX (1 mg/kg) were analyzed. The results were expressed as the percentage (%) change of the 13 C NMR signals at the delta (δ) 173 cm − 1 region of the brain samples (0 − 80 ppm) and glutathione relative level in the medial prefrontal cortex.Results: There is an effect of treatment (F (3,25) = 23.04, p < 0.05), time (F (9,416) = 5.07, p < 0.05) and interaction of treatment and time (F (27,416) = 4.41, p < 0.001) on the 13 C NMR signals at the δ 173 cm − 1 region of the brain samples (0 − 80 ppm). There is an effect of treatment (F (3,31) = 12.88, p < 0.01), time (F (6,180) = 6.18, p < 0.01) and interaction of treatment and time (F (18,180) = 5.35, p < 0.001) for relative level of glutathione in the medial prefrontal cortex. Conclusion: In conclusion CBD presented a protective effect of glucocorticoids action in the medial prefrontal cortex. Further studies are needed to correlate the CBD effect observed in the present study with anxiety, neuroinflammation, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

# Background
The endocannabinoid (eCB) system is constituted by endocannabinoids (eCBs), which include anandamide (AEA) and 2arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG); their specific receptors, cannabinoid receptors 1 and 2 (CB1R, CB2R); and the enzymes that synthesize and degrade eCBs such as monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL) and fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), respectively. The activation of these receptors by the eCBs promotes phasic synaptic signaling, which is modulatory, or tonic signaling, which is excitatory in corticolimbic areas of the brain. Glucocorticoids (GC) influence eCB synthesis/degradation and CB and other neurotransmission pathwaysby different mechanisms, such as by increasing the release of glutamate; by decreasing glutamate uptake in the synaptic cleft; by decreasing glutamatergic excitatory signaling (that is, by decreasing the density of glutamate receptors); and also by decreasing excitability through γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic signaling. GC also inhibit AEA and 2-AG productionand AEA signaling in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). The anti-inflammatory effects of GC can also be triggered by other mechanisms, such as by a decrease in inflammatory mediators through regulation of eCBs production and release due to activation of the CB system.
Cannabidiol (CBD) is a phytocannabinoid that is a partial agonist of CB1R and CB2R and is the most abundant nonpsychotropic phytocann"

Summary:
Inside this study, the Endoclean is the first medical device that uses cavitation mechanisms by using water pressure and saline solution with an external pump driven system to debride the root canal after minimal shaping using dental files. This was compared with the standard treatment with rotary files and passive irrigation. The Endoclean device has no significant risk of damage to the apical third of the root canal since it is driven by saline only, and no heat generation. Endoclean device was found to facilitate root canal cleaning without any adverse effects on tooth structure or the dentin walls, as well as the root canal wall thickness. Compared to the Passive Ultrasonic irrigation (control groups), Endoclean is considered more effective in cleaning the root canal and removing intrinsic pulp tissue or extrinsic biofilm with no negative consequences for treated teeth. Endoclean might significantly shorten the treatment time

Lay Summary:
The Endoclean is a medical device that uses hydrodynamic cavitation to debride the root canal after minimal root canal shaping. Comparatively, the root canals in those treated with mechanical preparation with rotary files (control group) were cleaner since cleaning and shaping were done with rotary files which have a very small diameter. The Endoclean group was not associated with any damage to apical third of the root canal, no teeth fractured after the procedure, as shown in the radiographs taken after the procedure as compared to the rotary file group. The removal of intrinsic pulp tissue and extrinsic biofilm can be completed with the Endoclean device more effectively than with the mechanical preparation procedure with rotary files. The Endoclean device was also associated with a shortened treatment time for root canal treatment as compared to those treated with rotary files

Caveat for Authors
====================
To make the paper clear, please do the following:
* Don't write in all-capital letters
* Use punctuation marks (spaces, commas, colons etc.) sparingly (don't overuse 'em)
* Use short (not long) sentences
* Avoid making passive voice sentences (actually, we can't think of any instances where you'd want to make a passive voice sentence) 🙂
* Avoid using big words when you can use small (i.e. simpler) ones
* Please don't write much about yourself -- 10 sentences would be sufficient We're not that curious about your achievements and interests
* Try to stick to English style guides such as (but not limited to) the British or the Chicago manuals. (You can google for more)
* Use the third person for ""you"" -- or third person he/she, we, they pronouns for ""they"", they for ""we"", or second person pronouns for ""you""
* You may avoid 'diluting' the message by putting words in brackets. For example: the Endoclean is a medical device that [used water] to debride the root canal.

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of spectral Doppler sonography with 2-dimensional real-time scanning in the diagnosis of painful shoulder joints in patients with posttraumatic arthromyalgias. This is an observational study. Four-teen patients (all right-handed) were examined. The study group included a total of 44 joints (bilateral shoulders - control group comprised of 100 joints). The examinations were performed using 4-8 MHz convex transducers. Spectral Doppler sonography results were compared with the results of clinical examination and radiology. Spectral Doppler sonography findings and 2-dimensional real-time results were in correlation. Spectral Doppler sonography and 2-dimensional real-time findings were significantly correlated with respect to the clinical examination results. Spectral Doppler sonography was able to detect early signs of joint injury, such as hyperaemia and vascularisation, in 4 joints and showed reduced echogenicity in one joint. <EOD> Long-Term Results of Patients With Fat Grafting and Autologous Cancellous Bone Concentrate for Facial Recontouring (FatGraft&Bone).
BACKGROUND
There are many different approaches to the rejuvenation of the facial region. However, the optimal treatment for every patient is not known. A combination of fat grafting and autologous cancellous bone could be an effective, safe, and inexpensive alternative in this area.


OBJECTIVES
The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of a combination of autologous fat grafting and autologous cancellous bone concentrate in the facial region.


METHODS
Ninety-six patients (37 boys and 59 girls; 55 African, 37 Asian, 4 European, 2 North American, 1 Australian, and 7 mixed ethnicities) at a mean age of 33.5 years underwent a total of 118 fat and autologous cancellous bone mixed grafts and a total of 25 soft tissue grafts (for ear projection, malformed nose, and cleft lip) from 2000 to 2010. All data were prospectively entered in a central online data entry platform that was available to all surgeons 24/7.


RESULTS
The mean duration of follow-up after fat grafting was 6.5 years. All patients achieved the desired rejuvenation results without additional intervention. No severe complications or deaths occurred.


CONCLUSION
Fat grafting and autologous cancellous bone concentrates in the facial region for either rejuvenation or soft tissue defect correction proved to be an effective and safe method without any additional operative risks or complications. <EOD> Improved Cerebellar Functions Following Gait-Specific Rehabilitative Robotic Therapy in Cerebellar Patients

# Study Design
=================#
This is a single-centered case-control study. The control group will consist of healthy participants with the same age, sex and socioeconomic status. Children will be recruited for the study via the pediatric neuropsychology service, pedology service, psychoneurology outpatient clinic, child psychiatry unit, and pediatric endocrinology and psychosomatic medicine outpatient unit. At the post-test, patients and controls will be asked to fill out the online version of PEDS-QL and PEM-CY. In addition to filling out the post-test, the child and his/her parents' participation quality of life will be assessed separately, within two weeks. The data obtained when the patient is asked whether the child is at home or in the school environment will determine which place should be taken as a home environment and the environment where the child is involved professionally will be asked to fill out separately. If the child is at school, the relevant form needs to be filled by the child's classmates. After the posttests, the control group will receive the same training program as the experimental group. After the training is completed, the posttest will be performed again. Participants who do not consent their posttests to be performed again will not be excluded from the study, but their data will be removed. After collecting data from age and sex-matched participants, they will be divided into three groups. The group 1 will be composed of participants who have similar anthropometric values and grip strength values. A new group will be created by separating by 10th points from the groups of highest values. In this way, three groups with similar grip strength values will be formed for this study. As the anthropometric test and grip strength test values of participants are very important for the study, they will be repeated in their second tests. It is considered that the standard scores (%0.4) and scores given as a score above average for the age will be taken into consideration in the test scores to be evaluated.

# Outcomes
==========================#
Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, Purdue Pegboard, finger and hand strength measurement with dynamometer, PEDS-QL, PEM-CY, and the participation and environment variables in the home, at school, and within community environments, and hand/arm anthropometric characteristic measurements will be evaluated at three time points over three time periods of about two weeks.

# Methods

Study procedure

# Analysis
Data that will be obtained from the study will be analyzed using SPSS 25 software package by performing the necessary analyses.

# Data management
Data will be entered, transferred to the required system and analysed in Excel and SPSS software. For the quality management of the data, first control mechanisms and then check mechanisms will be used. In check mechanisms, data analysis steps are done in all parts of the process. In these check mechanisms, data to be entered into the database will be compared with the data in printed forms.

# Ethical principles
Ankara Kecioren Training and Research Hospital Ethical Committe Approval of the study will be taken with the resolution dated October 20th, 2021 with numbered 2021/55 and the study will be conducted as per the Declaration of Helsinki as amended in 2013. Data will be recorded to ensure patient confidentiality and written consent will be obtained from participants under guardianship following the provision of sufficient information about all processes of the study.

# Discussion
In this study, it is aimed to reveal whether the problems in upper extremity fine motor function in children with SLD have an impact on their quality of life and participation in activities at home, school and in the community. This information will contribute to the literature regarding specific learning disorder and give a comprehensive assessment model for SLD. The findings of this study not only reflect the clinical and scientific perspective, but also add new data to the conceptual framework.

Learning disorders (LD) are a group of disorders characterized by difficulties in listening, speaking, reading and arithmetic functions that affect the child academically (American Psychological Association, 2013). They affect 13 -18% of school-age children in Turkey. These children are 1 or 2 standard deviation levels below normal in at least one major school skill (reading, writing, mathematics, verbal comprehension, spelling, and visual perception)(Koy et al., 2019)."

 <EOD> Flexible electronics for personalized health

This special issue consists of original studies and reviews dealing with the rapidly developing area of flexible electronics for personalized health. The collection of articles features a variety of interesting technologies and new applications, ranging from low-cost printed wearable devices in combination with the Internet of Things (IoT) to clinical-grade implanted electronic devices, the latter of which, due to cost constraints, have also been developed based on printed electronics.
The papers in this issue provide insight into the potential for wearable and implantable sensing devices to contribute to personalized health, a goal driven by the rise in chronic diseases and the need for continuous and precise monitoring of vital signs. The wearable devices discussed in this collection have a variety of functions including motion and gait monitoring, heart pulse monitoring, temperature monitoring and the management of glucose levels, pH and saline levels in vivo. An early concept for a device for continuous and noninvasive monitoring of cardiac arrhythmias is presented by Zhang et al. This system comprises an ultrasound sensing part for tissue vibration detection, electro-magnetic wave sensing part for body surface potential measurement, integrated on a flexible membrane-less soft skin-like sensor patch. The system can operate over the entire cardiac cycle for up to 3 h, while offering a sensing resolution of 0.16 s with 0.002 s average power consumption. Such a device has the potential to significantly improve cardiac detection accuracy without restricting the motion or life of the subject.

## Main article
A soft, wearable and ultrathin wearable skin patch containing a flexible electrochemical sensor array is described by Zhu et al. The skin patch can monitor the ph level on the skin surface which is a potential biomarker for skin disease. The system is based on microelectro-chemical etching technology with a 3D microelectrode array made of a Ni-Cu-Ni thin film that electrochemically converts the glucose and generates hydrogen gas. The pH sensor utilizes a platinum electrode to measure the pH value. Both the microelectrodes and the pH electrode are arranged in a 3D layout to increase the sensing area and to make the system more flexible. Results show that the sensor can reliably detect different pH levels and sweat glucose levels at a low power consumption of 68.16 µW and a response time as low as < 20 m.
A fully integrated bendable wearable motion sensing band for motion analysis during sport activities is presented by Kim et al. The device is based on a bendable stretchable sensor which is made of a composite thin-film of carbon nanotubes and polymers for strain distribution. This bendable strain sensor enables the design of a motion sense band. When used for motion detection the flexible sensor shows a sensitivity of 0.6 mV/s, a linear sensitivity of 0.65 mV/s, a hysteresis of less than 0.02% and a fast response time of less than 0.5 s.
As the number of chronic diseases such as diabetes is on the rise, early detection systems with low cost and high accuracy are being developed as it can make a significant difference to the lives of patients. One such system is presented in the paper by Shih et al. The authors describe the development of a flexible screen printed device for fast glucose detection based on inkjet-printed microsensors which can be integrated into different fabrics for fast and continuous health monitoring. The platform is compatible with a smart phone, showing potential for continuous health monitoring. A screen printed device based on nanoparticles and organic pH sensitive dyes was also developed and tested for pH detection in saline solution.
While wearable devices are used for continuous and personal health monitoring, implantable devices have shown potential for clinical care by acting as continuous biosensors. The special issue includes one study in this area. Gunduz et al. present a fully implanted flexible neural sensor with high specificity and sensitivity for action potentials from peripheral nerve"

Background:The purpose of this retrospective study was to review the surgical treatments for pituitary adenomas and the long-term outcomes of these patients.Methods:A total of 54 patients with pituitary adenoma confirmed by pathological examination were included in the study for retrospective evaluation. The surgical approaches included the expanded endoscopic endonasal transsphenoidal approach (EEA), expanded microsurgical transsphenoidal approach (MTSA) and lateral rhinotomy combined with transsphenoidal approach (LRCS). In addition, the patients were followed-up for 6-12 months (mean, 10.51 ± 2.75 months).Results:The EEA and MTSA achieved complete removal of tumor in 5 cases (33.33%, 5/15) and incomplete resection in 10 cases (66.67%,10/15), respectively. LRCS resulted in complete removal in 5 cases (41.67%, 5/12) and partial removal in 7 cases (58.33%, 7/12). The postoperative complications included meningitis and permanent diabetes insipidus (DI). All complications were cured after conservative treatment. Conclusions: The expanded EEA is a good surgical approach for treatment of selected pituitary adenomas due to the high total tumor resection rate, low postoperative complication rate and well tolerated by the patients. Pure and extended EEA have also better results for treatment of pituitary adenomas compared with the pure and extended MTSA. LRCS may be a useful alternative surgical method with lower total tumor resection rate but higher postoperative complication rate.

Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) has been shown to reduce transmural dispersion of repolarization and to increase the QT dispersion (measured during standard electrocardiography) and Tpeak-Tend interval (measured during surface electrocardiography). This study aimed to investigate whether or not the action potential duration (APD) in different cardiac layers in patients with DCM is prolonged and whether its correlation with the premature beats occurring in the 5 h prior to EPS predicts inducible ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in this patient population. We conducted the study on a group of patients with DCM (n=59) from whom we obtained the standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and ambulatory ECG for 5 h until the end of the night. On the following day, all the study patients underwent electrophysiological study (EPS). During the same day, we recorded left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), plasma NT-proBNP and BNP levels prior to EPS. We also analyzed the repolarization parameters of the high-frequency QRST integral and QT and Tpeak-Tend intervals. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, a significant correlation was found between the occurrence of premature ventricular beats in the 5 h prior to EPS, and premature ventricular contraction inducibility in the EPS (OR 2.108, p=0.004), late potentials in the EPS (OR 2.223, p=0.035) and the QRST interval value in the standard ECG recording (OR 4.057, p=0.001). Also, the Tpeak-Tend interval proved to be a predictor of sudden cardiac death (OR 1.213, p=0.001). This paper demonstrates that prolonged ventricular repolarization might be a predictor of QT lengthening (QT prolongation and QT dispersion) in patients with DCM, and that a prolonged interventricular electrical heterogeneity is a reliable predictor of premature ventricular contractions and SCD in patients with DCM and inducible VT -an indicator of the increased arrhythmic risk in patients with DCM and repolarization changes on 12-lead surface electrocardiogram.

## Dilated cardiomyopathy (dcm) has been shown to reduce transmural dispersion of repolarization and to increase the qt dispersion (measured during standard electrocardiography) and tpeak-tend interval (measured during surface electrocardiography). this study aimed to investigate whether or not the action potential duration (apd) in different cardiac layers in

# Introduction
Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a clinical entity characterized by a markedly dilated left ventricle (LV) with reduced contractility without coronary disease (CAD) or hypertensive heart disease, toxic exposure, systemic disease, and other diseases for which it is a known manifestation. DCM has a prevalence of 4 cases per 100 000 persons. The male:female ratio is 25:75, and DCM is generally diagnosed between 50-57 years of age, at which age women are diagnosed more often than men. It is characterized by symptoms of congestive heart failure (HF), with an average ejection fraction of 29%, and in 50% of patients with DCM, ventricular arrhythmias (frequent premature ventricular contractions and sudden cardiac death) precede the onset of heart failure symptoms. DCM may be associated with mutations in >20 genes that encode proteins involved in heart structure or function. There is also evidence that, in a subgroup of patients with idiopathic or ""non-genotyped"" DCM (approximately one third of all patients), genetic background may in fact be the cause of the disease.
DCM may be primary and is then defined as idiopathic or secondary"

Glycoenzyme glycolate oxidase (EC 1.1.3.15) from the fungus Acremonium strictum was isolated in its native form from the organism. The enzyme was digested with trypsin, and the primary structure of the peptide fragments was determined. The sequence was identical to that of an internal fragment of a DNA clone encoding a glycolate oxidase, pgl0.9, isolated by screening a lambda gt11 genomic library of the fungus. The nucleotide sequence of the DNA fragment was determined and found to encode a protein of 205 amino acid residues, including a putative signal peptide of 28-amino-acid residues. The amino acid composition was close to that of the purified enzyme. The enzyme has one potential N-glycosylation site (Asn55), which is located immediately preceding the sequence of the proteolytically liberated amino-terminal 56 amino acid residues. The DNA fragment lacks the sequence encoding the amino-terminal sequence of the purified enzyme, which indicates a possible internal cleavage site. <EOD> .
A large part of the population and of the doctors are unaware of the importance of gastrointestinal microbiota, in the physiological and pathological process of the gastrointestinal tract. We do not currently know the real nature of the relationship that links these microorganisms to the organism, but we know that they interact with the host, through the microbial cells (bacteria, viruses, fungi etc.) and through the cells of their metabolites (nutrients, gases, bacteriocins, bacteriophages etc.). Although not yet fully understood, we now know that there can be a real interaction at the level of the genome of bacteria (genom, plasmids). The bacteria are able to encode the genes for the synthesis and transport of nutritional substances, essential for the growth of the cell, and that of bacteriocins and bacteriophages, to allow bacterial killing. These genes, once transferred to the intestinal epithelial cells, can give rise to mutant variants, more resistant to antibiotic therapy, and mutants present on the intestinal epithelia of patients with Crohn's disease, or in subjects with a diet free from microbiota (germ-free), have recently been characterized. We still do not know whether all bacteria of the microflora are able to transfer their own genes, but we know that the genes present on the extrachromosomal genetic material (genomon) with the genome of the bacteria, are characterized by the ability to transfer themselves to the cells of the human intestinal mucosa. The real relationship with the pathogenesis and the physio-diagnosis of intestinal diseases can be summarized by using the concept of ""dysbiosis"", that means a disturb"

Purpose: This project aims to develop an integrated digital platform to improve management of youth in treatment at a DBT clinic by:
1) Developing a suite of mobile sensing, self-report and just-in time nudge features designed to:
- Support youth in treatment by providing just-in time reminders tailored to patient's individualized treatment plans to engage in treatment related activity and improve mood symptomatology
- Facilitate intensive outpatient DBT provider team care coordination by supporting just-in-time reminders to assess youth in treatment via a mobile health application
- Enhance intensive outpatient DBT assessments of risk factors by collecting behavioral and self-report data that are processed to provide clinicians a means with which they can assess patient progress toward goals and develop interventions to maximize these gains
2) Integrating mobile sensing, self-report, and just-in-time nudge into provider's workflow via a clinician dashboard
3) Testing the digital platform through a Randomized Controlled Trial:
4) Testing a suite of mobile sensing, self-report and just-in time nudge features in the context of a DBT intensive outpatient treatment setting to understand how the digital platform can support the intensive outpatient settings care model and whether or not the Vira platform can augment care delivery
5) Explore the impact of the digital platform in the DBT treatment settings by observing how patients in the intervention group use the digital platform in relationship to patient outcomes compared to patients receiving conventional care in a DBT Intensive Outpatient Setting

Explanation Section: Study Hypotheses
------------------------
1. Intensive outpatient DBT support via the Vira platform is more efficacious for adolescents in treatment for Depression and Suicidality than treatment as usual (i.e., intensive outpatient DBT + EARS app).

Explanation Section: Summary of Intervention Objectives
----------------------------

## Intervention Objectives
In order to improve the treatment efficacy within and across the domains of mood and functioning, patients assigned to the intensive DBT + Vira intervention group will:
1. Complete mobile sensor assessments of mood (i.e., accelerometry, heart rate variability, skin conductance, EDA: electrodermal activity) and function (i.e., GSR: galvanic skin response) on a daily basis (passive)
3. Receive just-in-time reminders (active) targeted toward individualized goals within the areas of mood, sleep, function, and treatment adherence (e.g., reminders to complete homework, attend group/individual sessions, adhere to medication regimen, sleep schedule, or activity routines)
4. Complete short daily check in questions regarding mood and function

You should not create a summary if the main focus of the paper is not the same as the key focus of your IPSA intervention. Please only create a summary for the content of the IPSA intervention.
If you are writing an Abstract for an article, you should first create an Abstract for the content of the IPSA intervention. Your abstract for the IPSA intervention will then be used to summarise and create an abstract that contains key information that would be useful for a reader to know about its content if they were considering using the IPSA in a program or organisation.
Note how the wording of the key points are different from the first paragraph in the Article Summary. This is because you are putting the key points for the intervention in the Abstract for the intervention.
Key Points: For each of the key points, you should summarise the key information that is in the IPSA intervention. As mentioned in the Introduction paragraph, you should only use facts that would be useful for a reader to know about the IPSA intervention if they were considering using the IPSA intervention in a program or organisation. The more that the key points highlight key information from the IPSA content, including why the IPSA intervention is being discussed and why the IPSA intervention is an interesting topic, it is more likely that it may be picked up by researchers or organisations who would be interested in using it.
You should create the Key Points using a bullet point format (this is not a full sentence paragraph. We recommend no more than 10 key points in the abstract)
References:
You should only need to write the key references for the content of the IPSA intervention. Remember that this is not the same as the references that you would use for the key points in the Abstract for the content of the IPSA intervention. For example, the study that we provided above in the key points (PSS) is the only citation that you need to provide.
For the Key Point 1, you need to look at the references that you wrote in the Key Point 1 of the Abstract for the content of the IPSA intervention. Only that one is cited. You need to cite the IPSA study first, then the study that was carried out that evaluated IPSA. Please do not change the references that you wrote in the Key Point 1 of the Abstract for the content of the IPSA intervention. Remember that you have to only write key references!

Key Points:
1. This parent training program for parents with ADHD includes a structured group-based skills training component combined with individualized support, including occupational therapist support to help parents improve their own prerequisites for bringing about change and facilitate use of the introduced parenting skills.
2. Higher levels of parental self-efficacy are measured both immediately directly by IPSA and approximately 3 months following program completion.
3. Parental self-rated stress levels are assessed in IPSA post-intervention to IPSA follow-up (up to 3 months later), as a secondary key outcome.
4. Household disorganization is measured using the PSS.
5. Child behavior problems are assessed using the ECBI.

## The intervention
****************************************************

This study examines the efficacy of a new, technology-based intervention, which addresses the topics of substance use and risky sex practices, within the context of personal relationships. To conduct the study, our research team developed a 4-session intervention based on empirically-validated intervention that is evidence-based and targets health risk behaviors known to lead to alcohol and cocaine related overdose. In doing so, we designed an intervention that, once it is developed and found to be efficacious, could be delivered to youth in a community setting such as a community mental health or substance abuse program. Furthermore, because we will be targeting substance use and behaviors known risk factors for overdose in order to prevent one of the leading causes of death in this population (heroin/cocaine overdose), as well we provide education about sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Additionally, because the intervention addresses risk within the context of personal relationships it could be used with partner or parents also.

In the pilot study, a series of 18 in-depth interviews were conducted with youth (ages 15-18) involved in the juvenile legal system in Texas. Youth were asked their perspectives on risk, decision making and behavior when it comes to substance use in their lives. The interviews revealed that many young people involved in the juvenile legal system had knowledge about substance use and risks related to it, but did not have the skills to make thoughtful choices about their substance use. The interviews also provided information about how to present the material to participants in a meaningful way that would encourage them to take a reflective view of their own substance use and develop skills to choose healthier ways of dealing with the pressures and temptations they faced. Based on information obtained from these interviews, we developed the 4 personal stories that were designed to engage youth into the intervention. The personal stories cover issues ranging from how to handle pressures to engage in substance use, to dealing with family pressures and making decisions in a high stress environments.

We then conducted a pilot group trial in order to test the personal stories and decide if the intervention could be effective and administered in a community-based setting. The pilot group trial consisted of 10 participants (4 were also interviewed in the initial qualitative study). They were given a packet of materials to read in their own time that included the personal stories as well as several works sheets on decision making, and substance use. In addition, during in-home visits, the interventionist talked to the youth about each story and helped the youth understand and apply each in their lives. The initial group pilot trial demonstrated that the intervention was feasible and interesting to the participants, many of who were able to apply it to their lives. As a result of this pilot trial, we then conducted focus groups with our community-partner, a local substance abuse program, to get their input on how we should re-organize the intervention material and refine it for implementation and efficacy testing. Feedback from the focus groups included incorporating more detailed information and questions about ways to improve decision making for a specific scenario and incorporating more personal examples and experiences into the intervention. As a result from the focus groups, we reorganized and edited the personal stories to make participants engage more in the material. In light of this information, we tested a revised version of the intervention over the course of 4 weeks involving 15 youth from a local substance abuse program. The revised intervention was received well. The youth enjoyed the stories and found the worksheets easy to complete. The group participants who tried the technology-based version were found to enjoy playing the games better than the participants who completed the paper-based worksheets and found that they learned more about the problems that they faced in making the choices they did for their health. As a result of these group trial results, the intervention has been updated to focus on improving health risk taking across a range of important areas (e.g., relationships with peers, family, personal relationships).

## Additional information

As a result of lessons learned and feedback obtained from the initial pilot group test of this intervention, we have expanded the scenarios and added additional examples to the personal stories. The intervention now spans 15 hours, which can be viewed over the course of multiple days. The first session includes an introduction and a series of self-guided worksheets. Each subsequent session includes one additional set of worksheets, which helps participants understand the material and how each worksheet can be applied"

- Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC): Ischemic cycles can be applied to one or several body parts by placing a pressure cuff on one or several extremities. RIC can be achieved by applying cycles of ischemic-reperfusion to the limb(s) using a device that automatically inflates and deflates pressure cuff(s). RIC can also be achieved using whole-body cycles of ischemic-reperfusion by inflating the pressure cuff to supra-systolic pressure in order to achieve cycles of ischemia-reperfusion to the majority of the participating vessels (such as the femoral arteries) in the limbs. In order to increase the effectiveness of RIC, the cuff will first be inflated to the supra-systolic value, and then deflated to a cycling pre-determined sub-systolic value (80 mmHg).

 <EOD> The Mental Health of University Students in the United Kingdom and Ireland during COVID-19. A Comparative Study

Background: An investigation into mental health issues among university students pre-and during the COVID-19 pandemic was required due to the lack of public data available from a comparative perspective. Aim: To compare mental health data from university students in the UK and Ireland pre-and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A survey was conducted at the University of Warwick, UK (UoW) and University College Dublin, Ireland (UCD), in pre-pandemic 2019 (N = 418) and during the initial COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 (N = 500). The survey was an abbreviated version of the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ)-12 and measured the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire comprised 12 items. The 4-point Likert scale results measured the severity of symptoms based on: no more than usual, more than usual, much more than usual, and much less than usual. Results: In 2020 students at the UoW and UCD displayed higher GHQ-12 scores during the lockdown compared to pre-lockdown levels. There were significant differences compared to the same survey in 2018/19, except in the UoW where there were no overall significant differences. Conclusion: A significant impact was seen in the health of these students in 2020 when compared to 2018-19. The pandemic has exacerbated the stress in university students in the UK and Ireland. Measures that help support students' mental health during these periods of high stress are recommended.
On 6th September 2021, the British Broadcast Cooperation (BBC) and The World Health Organisation (World Health Organisation) issued an update, warning of an overwhelming mental health pandemic and described a state of crisis in 2021 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The BBC reported that approximately 1 in 7 adults in Great Britain had self-reported probable anxiety or depression as of spring 2021, which is more than double the rate of 1 in 14, measured in early 2019; the BBC called this a ""mental health pandemic"".
Those reporting mental health conditions more commonly than usual, reported feeling more worried, less safe, less close to peers, and more lonely. Young people and women reported higher levels of mental distress than younger people and men, and the increase happened more quickly with increased age. The British Broadcasting Company also reported that 258 deaths"

Attendance rates during ward rounds are consistently low. Rounds involving a consultant, registrar or trainer, and a junior doctor do not always commence on time. We audited ward round attendance pre- and post-intervention and achieved an improvement from 59% to 88%. All levels of staff attended more frequently. We developed a practical and quick to install intervention that was associated with an improvement in staff attendance. This has implications for patient safety, consultant job satisfaction and overall care costs. Our simple intervention was based on well-known principles of health care management. It also required a low level of staff involvement. <EOD> Bacteroides heparinolyticus sp. nov. and Bacteroides sulfatirucens sp. nov., from the large intestine of gulls and other birds.
Two novel species of the genus Bacteroides, Bacteroides heparinolyticus and Bacteroides sulfatirucens, are described, based on their phenotypic and molecular characteristics. Both species belong to the Bacteroides fragilis group and were isolated from the large intestine of various birds, including the lesser black-backed gull Larus arcachius, by enrichment cultures on Columbia blood agar plates, followed by selective anaerobic serial dilution cultures. Bacteroides heparinolyticus is a Gram-negative, facultatively anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium that has urease and lactose-positive and nitrate-negative properties.

Bacteroides heparinolyticus T utilizes glucose and maltose in acid production and gas, whereas the other carbon sources are utilized to a lesser extent. It has an optimal growth pH of 7.5, an optimal growth temperature of 37 +/- 1 C, is resistant to 20 micrograms/mL of vancomycin but is sensitive to 3.5 micrograms of erythromycin per ml. Bacteroides heparinolyticus T has a genomic G + C content of 37 mol%, the highest among the B. fragilis group, has a total of 133 bands in its 16S rRNA-based DGGE profile and has 8% divergence in 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity from its closest relative, Bacteroides salanitronis LMG 15372T.

 <EOD> Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour with primitive neuroectodermal tumour features
BACKGROUND Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (ATRT) is a highly malignant embryonal tumour with rhabdoid features and the expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). It occurs mainly in very young children and, as a result of its aggressive behaviour, carries a poor prognosis. Primary CNS primitive neuroectodermal tumours (CNS pPNET) contain a small population of undifferentiated mononuclear cells (undifferentiated cells). They are usually seen in adolescent boys but have also been described in the younger age group. METHODS We report two cases of ATRT occurring in young infants presenting with tumours with pPNET features. The first showed infiltration of a midbrain parenchyma by a typical ATRT with a pPNET pattern, whereas the second was an extraventricular pPNET showing a rhabdoid pattern. RESULTS The first presented with a large mass in the posterior fossa that proved to be highly aggressive and showed a classical ATRT pattern. The second was a supratentorial tumour with a large amount of undifferentiated small cells. The latter case was successfully treated and the patients survived for 8 and 15 months. CONCLUSION We would like to emphasise the great heterogeneity of these tumours. ATRT should not necessarily be considered a totally different disease from pPNET, as we present two cases of ATRT with a rhabdoid pattern and pPNET behaviour. They should also be recognised as very aggressive embryonal tumours and should have the same clinical course as undifferentiated pPNET. <EOD> The Impact of the Novel COVID‐19 on Cardiovascular Disease Clinical Trials, and How to Adapt to the Challenges

Trials may still continue to allow for safe conduct while preventing the spread of this virus (including those trials that assess devices, technology, and procedures relevant to heart arrhythmias).

## Trial monitoring
Together with the Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency issued guidance in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic to remind sponsors of good clinical practice (GCP) requirements, as well as clinical trial activities 2 and highlighted the importance of communication between sponsor and site in the setting of teleworking or site closures. The need for virtual meetings at all levels (including review committees, steering committees, regulatory agencies, ethics committees) also emerged. Such meetings may be held using teleconferencing tools.

## Endpoints and outcomes

# Introduction

Chronic non-communicable diseases are a major public health problem globally. Cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases are, in fact, leading causes of death in the World. It is estimated that in 2016 chronic diseases accounted for 70% of total deaths and this share reached 80% in 2017 . According to a recent assessment, at present cardiovascular diseases are responsible for more than one-third of all deaths. In particular, in the same year, about 17.5 million people died from cardiovascular diseases. It is estimated that 422.7 million people were living with diabetes in 2014, whereas the number of people living with cancer was estimated in 15.5 million in 2010 (Cancer Prevention | National Cancer Institute , 2012). Similarly, many people are suffering from chronic respiratory diseases. According to the WHO European Report on Chronic , the economic burden from cardiovascular diseases reaches 9 billion euros in Italy alone (European Association for Cardiovascular Prevention and Rehabilitation , 2012). The economic sustainability of these diseases could be partially ensured by early prevention and timely treatment, which could lead to an improvement of quality of life, and hence, health of the population and a sustainable reduction of the health systems' expenditure (World Health Organization (WHO) , 2011).

It is also known that these diseases have a common and important pathogenetic background. In fact, most of these non-communicable diseases share common risk factors, such as inadequate diet, lacking physical activity, and alcohol overconsumption, which are associated with chronological, epigenetic and environmental modifications in the individual. In this regard, chronic inflammation has been suggested to play an important role in this multifactorial pathogenetic process (Di Bona et al., 2015;. In particular, chronic inflammation could facilitate the process of lipids peroxidation and oxidative stress, both of which may contribute to the pathogenesis of several chronic non-communicable diseases and age-related health issues.
Many of these non-communicable diseases are asymptomatic at early stages, thus leading to untimely diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. In order for the population to obtain a definitive, accurate diagnosis, it would be necessary to carry out screening programs. However, these screening programs need to be implemented, while taking into account all the ethical and social aspects, in order to avoid overdiagnosis or unnecessary treatments, as well as other risks or inconveniences. For instance, overdiagnosis would result in many people being treated for a disease that would not have gone on to cause any symptoms. Therefore, it is necessary to implement an integrated and coordinated healthcare system able to promptly detect, evaluate, and treat risk factors, to protect the health of the population (Unione Europea , 2013). However, the assessment of public health, particularly with regard to chronic diseases, requires not only to improve the efficiency of healthcare systems, but also to identify the main risk factors involved in their pathogenesis, thus resulting in their prevention. For this reason, many countries are trying to introduce screening programs aimed to identify asymptomatic patients or patients with early clinically insignificant stages of diseases. Indeed, the WHO has recommended to promote early detection of hypertension, diabetes, cancer, and other risk factors in specific populations and countries (World Health Organization (WHO) -WHO Expert consultation . In order to do that, the WHO recommended, and several countries have already implemented, different screening programs in the general population, such as in USA and England with the Healthy People 2020 programand the National Health Service in England . Indeed, it is important to notice that these programs were not only able to identify people at risk of common non-communicable diseases, but were also effective in preventing or reducing their effects. For instance, these programs led to early diagnosis and an improved management of the diseases, which had a beneficial impact on the overall health of the population . Therefore, the population-based screening should be implemented as a method to ensure public health through an efficient and effective early screening program, which would also improve the quality of life of people"

Apoptosis and expression of the p53 tumor suppressor gene and bcl-2, a protein that inhibits apoptosis, is regulated by p53. However, the association of p53 and bcl-2 with pTNM stage and survival in esophageal adenocarcinoma has not been investigated. Paraffin sections of 63 patients with esophageal adenocarcinomas are stained by immunohistochemistry and compared with clinicopathologic parameters that affect survival. Immunohistochemistry is employed to demonstrate p53 nuclear accumulation as an indirect surrogate test for mutational alteration and the protein expression of bcl-2. p53 nuclear accumulation and the nuclear coexistence of bcl-2 and p53 are associated with better survival probability in esophageal adenocarcinoma (P< 0.007 and P<0.026, respectively). bcl-2, but not p53, is independently associated with a decrease in tumor differentiation (P<0.03) and a lower lymph node metastatic status ( P < 0.036).

Background: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasing health concern. NAFLD was associated with more than three times increased risk for abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). However, whether NAFLD is associated with the presence of AAA and increased risk of progression remains unclear. The fatty liver index (FLI) has been reported to be a valid screening tool for NAFLD. However, the optimal cut-point of FLI score and its association with AAA have not been clarified. Thus, we aimed to investigate the association and the optimal cut-off point of FLI for predicting the presence and development of AAA.Methods: A total of participants with AAA, including 193 without NAFLD and were matched by age, sex, and AAA, and 350 healthy participants were included in our prospective study. All participants underwent abdominal ultrasonography (US) for staging grading of NAFLD during the first cohort visit. AAA progression and prognosis were observed in the follow-up cohort after a median of 20.5 months (ranging from 0.22 to 24.12 months).Results: Participants with AAA had higher FLI scores than did the healthy participants (14.29[11.79, 18.51] vs. 10.82[9.27, 12.95], P < 0.001), ALT, AST, fasting blood glucose, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, uric acid, and CRP were also increased in participants with AAA (P < 0.05), but not for BMI and LDL cholesterol (P > 0.05). However, FLI independently predicted AAA and AAA progression by conditional multiple logistic regression (OR 1.125, 95% CI: 1.052∼ 1.204), (OR 1.072, 95% CI: 1.026∼ 1.122), respectively, after being adjusted for BMI, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and drinks. In addition, among participants whose FLI score ≥ 60, the risk of AAA presence was higher in men than women (OR 3.363, 95% CI: 1.284∼ 8.809), after being adjusted for age. A higher risk of AAA progression was associated with FLI score ≥ 60 after being adjusted for hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, drinks, and AAA diameter (HR 1.272, 95% CI: 1.045∼ 1.544). Furthermore, increased HSFRs and HRIRs were associated with the FLI, after being adjusted for hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, smoking, and drinks.

BACKGROUND
The effect of age on the outcome of endoscopic sphincterotomy (ES) is controversial. The aim of this study was to define the age as an independent variable influencing the duration of ES or associated with higher failure rate.


METHODS
Retrospective and analytical review of 1,394 consecutive patients undergoing sphincterotomy, between January 1993 and August 2005. Sphincterotomy was performed in patients diagnosed of choledocholithiasis or CBD > 1 cm, and was selected during ES if common bile duct was <2.5 cm or sphincter was hard. CBD <1 cm were excluded. The success rate of sphincterotomy was analyzed in 3 age groups: less than 65 years, 65 to 79 years and >or=80 years. Results were compared by chi2-test or Ficher's exact test.


RESULTS
The mean age was 70.8 (range: 18-93) years. Failure rate of sphincterotomy was higher in patients >or= 80 years old (27%). No statistical significance was found in the study groups. Mean duration of ES was 17.8  min in patients < 65 years, 16.6 (8.1-35.1) min in patients of 65-79 years and 14.3 (8.0-26.6) in patients >or= 80 years (p  80 years. Sphincterotomy > or= 20 min was performed in 4.3% of patients < 80 years old, but it was 10.3% in the group >or= 80 years old (p = 0.024).


CONCLUSIONS
Aged patients undergoing bile duct sphincterotomy had a higher failure rate (27%). The success rate in older patients <or= 80 years of age was not different. Endoscopic procedure >or= 20-min time was more frequently performed in elderly patients, but this was not associated with a higher risk of failure or complications. <EOD> Stereospecific interactions of methyl‐beta‐carboline and methyl‐noraporphinine in the GABAA receptor
N-methyl derivatives, like methyl-betacarboline (MB-CH,3) and methyl-noraporphinine (MNA), have been shown to be structurally similar to GABA, the principal central nervous system inhibitory neurotransmitter, although they are chemically and mechanistically quite varied, with MB-CH2-CH3,3 showing no activity as a sedative and MNA possessing anticonvulsant and muscle relaxant activity. To better understand the structure-activity relationship of these agents in the GABAA receptor, we examined their actions in 14 different mammalian GABAA receptor subtypes, expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, by measuring chloride and potassium currents and their effects, either individually or in combination, within and between 40 different subtypes of GABAA receptors, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. MB-CH2-CH3,3 enhanced GABA-induced chloride currents in two cell lines representing neuronal GABAA receptors and the γ1(Q392R) spliced variant but was relatively inactive in oocytes expressing rat α4β3δ, rat α4β3γ2, rat α1β3δ, rat α1β3γ2α1-G96S and rat α1β1γ2 subtypes. MNA enhancement of GABA-induced currents was seen in both neuronal and non-neuronal cell lines, but its activity was 80 times greater on neuronal cell lines than on non-neuronal and was also highly sensitive to membrane depolarization. MB-CH2-CH3,3 and MNA also showed stereoselective and mutually specific complementary interactions with GABA, lorazepam and diazepam, and both drugs inhibited the affinity of GABA at recombinant rat α4β3δ and rat α4β3γ2δG97A recept"

ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05228497 <EOD> The Role of Phospholipid Composition in Cellular Thermosensitivity*

The thermosensitivity of bacteria is controlled by temperature sensing (tcs) genes that encode two-component transcriptional sensors. One example of such regulators is the Tar (TarGI) system, which includes three genes, tciC, tcsI, and tarGII. In this study, we provide evidence that phospholipid composition influences the efficiency of bacterial growth at mammalian body temperature. Specifically, deleting the acyl carrier protein I and II coding genes tciC and tciI results in bacteria with reduced temperature resistance. The effect is dependent on changes in membrane properties. When the temperature-sensitive phenotype is lost in tciC mutants, the growth of bacteria is also reduced in tigecycline, an antibiotic that accumulates in the membrane and disrupts its function. These data suggest that the membrane is a potential target for antibiotics that affect bacterial heat resistance. Because the thermolabile phenotype in tciC was demonstrated in both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, we propose that the Tcs system is one of the factors involved in establishing cellular thermosensitivity and that the Tcs system may be a determinant of antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria at high temperatures.
Temperature is an important parameter of the environment that defines the fitness of bacteria as well as the distribution of different species on earth. For example, many bacteria, known as psychrophiles, thrive when the temperature drops to near 0°C, whereas others called thermophiles grow optimally in the range of 40 to 85°C. The thermal adaptation mechanism was previously explained by the increase in protein thermal stability conferred by increasing the number of hydrophobic side chain residues. This model seems to apply to psychrophiles and extreme thermophiles, with elevated levels of leucine, isoleucine, valine, methionine, and norvaline. Conversely, thermosensitive Escherichia coli contains a higher percentage of glycine and alanine than optimal growing bacteria. It is currently accepted that the temperature adaptation process extends beyond protein composition. The major component of prokaryotes, cytoplasmic membrane, in which transmembrane proteins of signaling pathways reside, has an important role in temperaturesensitive phenotypeand bacterial susceptibility to low concentrations of antibiotics (10). Moreover, mutant cells with defective inner membrane protein folding caused by altered lipid content are more susceptible to environmental stressorsas well as antibiotics.
The bacterial membranes can be divided into different regions with diverse, dynamic, and unique biophysical properties. There are three major phospholipid types in bacteria: phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diphosphatidylglycerol (DPG), and cardiolipin (CL). This composition is determined by the environmental factors, such as temperature, oxygen levels, and growth phase of the cell. For example, in E. coli PG is predominant during exponential growth under aerobic conditions, whereas the relative amount of DPG is higher during growth under low oxygen tension. Moreover, in E. coli, the proportion of lipids is adjusted by the phospholipid flippase (FlhF, also called TlpB) inhibition. The levels of DPG and CL are highest during sporulation and stationary growth. The CL/ PG and DPG/PG levels are also temperature-dependent. During growth at high temperatures, E. coli contains more DPG, whereas the major lipid at low temperatures (30°C) is PG.
Our previous study demonstrated that the thermosensitivity of cellular growth at 44°C relies on the function of the tarGI genes, which encode twocomponent sensors. The TarGI/GII system is one of the regulatory networks involved in growth regulation. Thus, deletion of tciC and/or tciI genes that encode acyl carrier proteins reduces E. coli resistance to both heat as well as the antibiotics. These results demonstrate that the levels of P"

 <EOD> Caspase-3 regulates B-cell proliferation after activation and mitogenic signaling pathways involved.
Apoptosis, the programmed cell death, is an important mechanism in the regulation of B-cell functions. B-cell proliferation after activation and apoptosis of autoreactive B-cells are two opposite processes that influence the immune system. Several caspases, activated by the mitochondrial and death receptor-mediated pathways, are involved in apoptosis. The aim of this study was to identify which caspase is involved in apoptosis in B-cells after polyclonal activation by mitogens with different signaling pathways. We analyzed the inhibition of caspase-3, -8, and -9, and found that the inhibition of caspase-3 led to the greatest block of both cell death induced by mitogens and cellular proliferation. Then, we evaluated caspase activity mediated by the mitochondrial and death receptor-mediated pathways in B-cells treated with mitogenic stimuli. The results showed that caspase-3, -8, and -9 mediated more B-cell death in response to bacterial mitogens, LPS and PMA, than mitogenic stimulus triggered by phorbol ester. Furthermore, inhibition of caspase-3 in B-cells led to the greatest cellular proliferation after cellular activation by mitogens. Overall, these data indicate that caspase-3 regulates B-cell proliferation after activation and mitogenic pathway involved. <EOD> Fate of endothelial cells in rat testes after trauma.
Endothelial cells (ECs) play an important role in the testicular pathophysiology involved in ischaemia-reperfusion injury. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of a trauma induced by scrotal incision in rat testes and the fate of ECs after reperfu- sion. A standardized scrotal incision was performed in 35 Wistar rats and one testis from each animal was immediately collected in a 4% paraformaldehyde and the other was preserved at -80 °C, before (Bloodless) and three different time points after (1:30, 1:20, 3:10 hr) scrotal revascularization. Histology of H & E-stained slides, immunohistochemistry of anti-peanut agglutinin (an ECs marker) labelled slides and Terminal deoxynucleo- tide degradati ve endonuclease TUNEL labelling were performed for the three experimental groups. Histological examination revealed marked hemorrhage and congestion in incised testis. Immunohistochemistry and morphometry results showed that, the positive ECs were declined significantly (P<0.05) from 1:30 hrs and reached to zero after 1:20 and 3:10 hrs, in both testis groups. The incision of scrotal and trauma in the bloodless testis, resulted in hemorrhage and congestion. The morphometric results showed that the decline in EC population was not parallel with the decline in testicular blood flow, suggesting that the damage to the blood supply of the teste was not the only cause of ECs loss and the endothelial dysfunction is most likely the most important issue involved. <EOD> Exosomes from human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells enhance autologous wound healing by promoting angiogenesis and fibroblast migration

Autologous fat transplantation is widely used to repair traumatic scar tissue. However, an important drawback of this treatment is the high recycling rate of the transplant. Increased autologous fat recycling in tissue is caused by a slow infiltration rate and impaired angiogenic function, resulting in low oxygen supply and tissue degeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are an alternative treatment with great therapeutic potential. In previous studies, we found that human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (hUCMSC) -derived exosomes promote angiogenesis. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of using hUCMSCs to treat defects in angiogenesis and fib"

 <EOD> Evaluation method for the in vivo performance of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator chloride channel modulators
Recently, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) chloride channel has been identified as one of target proteins for various diseases, including cystic fibrosis (CF), diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, etc. In CF, chloride channel defect results in abnormal electrolytic absorption at the airway surface layer of epithelium in the respiratory tract. Therefore, the development of inhaled modulators of chloride channels that rescue the CFTR dysfunction has drawn attention and is expected to open up a new way in the treatment of the disease. However, the evaluation method of chloride channel modulators has not been established. We hypothesized that the cAMP–phosphorylation of CFTR and the subsequent activation of the chloride channel are important steps in the CFTR gating cycle. We measured the chloride secretion from epithelial cells to evaluate the effect of chloride channel modulators by a transepithelial ion transport measuring system, Transwell®. This system could record the cellular transepithelial electrical potential by the voltage‐sensitive dye. <EOD> Prevalence and risk factors correlated with atherosclerosis in patients with end‐stage renal disease
Background:  End‐stage renal disease (ESRD) increases the risk of cardiovascular events. Arterial stiffening plays a crucial role in the development of atherosclerosis in patients with ESRD on maintenance haemodialysis. We examined the prevalence and risk factors correlated with arterial stiffness in patients with ESRD on maintenance haemodialyis. <EOD> A novel mechanism for cellular methylglyoxal metabolism. Evidence for the existence of methylglyoxal-induced protein modification as envisioned by the Maillard hypothesis.
Methylglyoxal is a reactive dicarbonyl compound believed to be a precursor of several advanced glycation AGEs. We have recently demonstrated that methylglyoxal is taken up by a number of tissues of the rat and that this compound is methylated to produce methylglyoxal-d4. In the present study, we demonstrate that methylglyoxal is taken up by isolated human endothelial cells and human blood neutrophils in the presence and absence of added methylglyoxal (up to 2 mM). However, very little of the uptake is associated with the protein moiety of endothelial cells and none with the protein of neutrophils. After metabolism with methylglyoxal in the presence of glucose, a 24 amino acid oligopeptide was identified in the neutral fraction of hydrolysates of endothelial cells by HPLC/MS/MS. The oligopeptide had a 0.67 m/z shift which is exactly the mass difference that would be expected if the t-Boc-derived glyoxal residue was first converted to the cysteinylglyoxal derivative, then to the corresponding cysteine-cysteine methylglyoxalo-glyoxal adduct. In addition, MS/MS fragmentation data of two parent peaks from the same HPLC fraction of digested endothelial cell proteins were compatible with the presence of cystathionine, and S-carboxymethyl-cysteine residues in those peptides. The oligopeptide found to be conjugated with methylglyoxal was the 1-20 fragment of human fibrinogen. Furthermore, the 1-20 fragment of human fibrinogen was modified by methylglyoxal in the presence and absence of glucose in vitro and in vivo by exposure of the peptide to plasma. The results, therefore, strongly support that the dicarbonyl modification takes place in living systems, i.e., a chemical process analogous to the Maillard reaction was observed, thereby providing direct evidence for the concept proposed by Kraemer in 1950 when he envisioned the participation of methylglyoxal in the reaction of proteins with glucose (or in AGE reactions in general). In addition, the results reported in this manuscript strongly support the"

Keywords: [/INST] <EOD> Effect of dehydroepiandrosterone on bone characteristics of growing female rats with ovariectomy.
The effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) was investigated in female adult ovariectomized rats. Twenty-eight female rats with ovariectomy were randomly divided into the following four groups (n=7 per group): group A, control; group B, testosterone; group C, DHEA; and group D, 17beta-estradiol. Bone properties of distal femurs and proximal tibias, and blood calcium and testosterone levels were analyzed. After 6 weeks of treatment, bending strength and distal femur stiffness of rats from group A increased significantly. Treatment with DHEA and testosterone increased the length of distal femurs significantly. In group C, the width of medullary cavity and the cortical thickness of proximal tibia both increased significantly. Groups B, C and D had significantly increased serum calcium concentration compared to that of group A. All groups treated with steroids showed significantly higher bone strength compared to that from group A. Steroid treatments improved the bone density of rats with ovariectomy. <EOD> A Randomized Phase I Study to Evaluate the Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of a Novel Oral EGFR Inhibitor, LF 005487 (Dual HER1/2 Inhibitor), in Adults with Solid Tumor Malignancies

Ongoing development of targeted therapies based on the molecular characterization of cancer has led to the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) as monotherapies or in combination with standard cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens. TKIs that inhibit epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are approved as monotherapies for some EGFR mutation-positive tumors and in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy (taxanes) for mutation-negative tumors. LF 005487 is an oral, second-generation reversible EGFR/HER2 inhibitor that offers broad coverage of multiple EGFR and HER2 pathways and may provide advantages over currently available EGFR TKIs through its unique kinase inhibition profile. We conducted a phase I, dose-escalation, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and preliminary antitumor activity of LF 005487 in adult patients with solid tumor malignancies. Thirty-eight patients were treated with LF 005487 at one of three dose levels (DLs): 40 mg QD (DL1), 120 mg QD (DL2), and 200 mg QD (DL3). There were no dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) after single-agent administration of LF 005487. The most common adverse events (AEs) in multiple dose-escalating patients (n = 35) were diarrhea (93%), rash (81%), fatigue (80%), and peripheral edema (78%) at DL2 and nausea (66%), anorexia (64%), fatigue (61%), and pyrexia (40%) at DL1. The majority of the AEs at DL1 and DL2 were grade 1 (54% and 64%, respectively). The most common grade 3 or 4 AEs at DL3 were dehydration (23%) and neutropenia (19%). DLTs were not observed in these patients. The PK profile of LF 005487 showed clearance of less than 2-fold with moderate interpatient variability in a dose-proportional manner. The average terminal half-life exceeded 26 hours. Antitumor activity (as shown by the percentage of patients with progression-free survival [PFS] at 3 months) was shown, with higher PFS rates at DL3 compared with DL1 at weeks 12, 16, and 20 for all patients (71% vs"

### Terms
1. RLS

### Treatments
1. Pregnant women with restless legs syndrome will wear compression stockings for three weeks.

### Key Words
1. Restless legs syndrome

### Key Concepts
1. Pregnant women with restless legs syndrome, compression stockings, treatment modalities

### Background
1. The aim of this single blind randomized control trial was to evaluate the effects of wearing compression stockings on the symptoms in pregnant women with restless legs who met the RLS diagnostic criteria by RLS Diagnostic Criteria Questionnaire Form and had RLS severity of 11 and above according to the RLS Severity Rating Scale.

### Study Plan
1. This single blind randomized control trial was conducted by making equal 2 randomized control groups with 30 pregnant women in each group. Compression stockings were used in one of the groups only for 3 weeks, while it was used routinely in both groups (daily for 24 hours).

### Results
1. No statistical difference were found between the two groups in terms of RLS severity score, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Visual Analog Scale before treatment. There was a statistically significant difference in RLS Severity score between before and after treatment in both groups at the end of 21 days (p< 0.0001). There was a statistically significant difference in the change in severity scores between two groups (7.864 vs. 1.800, respectively p< 0.0001). Compression stockings group was significantly better than Knee sock group. No statistical difference was found in terms of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. But the Visual Analog Scale was statistically significant between before and after treatment. Both in one group pre and post treatment Visual Analog was (9.43 vs. 4.73, respectively p< 0.0001) and other group pre and post treatment Visual Analog was (9.33 vs. 5.33, respectively p< 0.0001). At the same time, there was a statistically significant difference between two groups pre and post treatment Visual Analog (4.667 vs 3.467, respectively p< 0.0001). The results in other two groups are better than the other groups.

# Conclusion
1. Compression stockings are a useful treatment modality both in pregnant women with RLS and postpartum.

# Introduction

Background and Rationale
--------------------------------------

### Background
1. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurovascular disorder characterized by a chronic, unpleasant non-sensory sensation in the legs, particularly at rest or at night-time and mostly in the evening, which usually causes mild discomfort and impedes rest. The disorder can sometimes cause severe disturbance in sleep quality, resulting in discomfort for patients and their families and causing social relations and work to become affected.1

### Aim
1. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of compression sock treatment on the complaints, well-being, and sleep quality of our pregnant patients with RLS.

# Rationale
---------------------------------------------------

## Objectives
1. To make a comparative analysis of women with RLS who meet the RLS Diagnostic Criteria, who were in their second or third trimester of pregnancy, with RLS Severity Rating Scale (RSRS) scores of 11 and above, with severe RLS or worse, and their RSRS scores have improved and well-being and sleep quality levels have improved after three weeks of compression stockings treatment, compared with those who wear knee sleeves.

### Primary Endpoint
1. Change in RSRS score in the compression stockings group (Compression stockings group) vs. Knee sleeves group.

## Secondary Endpoint
1. Change in Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index score (PSQI) in the Compression stockings group and Knee sleeves group.

### Tertiary Endpoint
1. Change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) in the compression stockings group and Knee sleeves group.

Spermatozoa immune defence is characterised by a certain specificity that prevents the destruction of the normal gamete by autoantibodies, with respect to cell membrane and cytoskeleton. The sperm immune protection seems to be realized using the three levels of defence (general, specific and local), which make up a unique immune system, and the gamete, though immunocompetent, remains invisible to the immune system. This invisible maturity is responsible for the persistence of pregnancy after intrauterine insemination, after cryopreservation of spermatozoa, and after seminal insemination. <EOD> The role of a functional group in the bacterial uptake of 2,3,6,7-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin.
Rats were given 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzop-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD) or 3-methylcholanthrene (3-MC), after which the animals were treated with chloramphenicol or ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) to prevent further uptake of dioxin (3-MC) by the liver. When a dose of dioxin (3-MC) was given prior to treatment with chloramphenicol (3-MC), the concentration of uranine in the liver rose rapidly and then diminished in a biphasic manner. When the two chemicals were administered together, the hepatic uptake of dioxin (3-MC) diminished slowly over a period of 120 min. A similar decrease in the hepatic concentrations of dioxin (3-MC) and 3-MC was observed when the 2,3,7,8-TCDD was given after chloramphenicol. EDTA, which did not affect the distribution of (3-MC) and 3-MC, was found to be more effective than chloramphenicol in inhibiting the hepatic uptake of 2,3,7,8-TCDD. These results have been discussed in terms of the uptake, metabolism, and excretion of 2,3,7,8-TCDD and 3-MC. <EOD> .
With the development and popularization of digital technology, electronic document management technology has been widely implemented in the medical field, which provides more convenient and faster access to electronic medical records, facilitates the exchange of medical resources and provides technical support for hospitals to achieve paperless management.

The Effect of Nursing Care Based on Kolcaba's Comfort Theory on of Intensive Care Patients


Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
The study is a randomised controlled experimental study to determine the effect of nursing care based on Kolcaba's comfort theory on comfort, care satisfaction and sleep quality of intensive care patients. Power analysis was used to determine the sample size of the study. As a result of the power analysis, it was determined that a total of 44 participants, 22 participants in each group, should be reached to achieve 80% power with an effect size of 0.87, a margin of error of 0.05% and a confidence interval of 0.95%. To increase the reliability of the study, a total of 80 participants, 40 in the intervention group and 40 in the control group, should be included in the study, taking into account data loss. In this study, the control group will receive standard care and the intervention group will receive care based on Kolcaba's comfort theory. Data will be collected using the General Comfort Scale, the Newcastle Satisfaction Scale, the Richard Campbell Sleep Scale and the Comfort Behaviours Checklist.

 <EOD> Molecularly imprinted polypyrrole nanotubes and nanovesicles for selectivity enhancement in capillary electrophoresis‐electrospray mass spectrometry
Molecular imprinting was applied to enhance selectivity of capillary electrophoresis coupled to electrospray mass spectrometry in which Pyrrole (Py) was used as methotrexate template with N‐Methyl‐Phenylenediamine (MP) as the functional monomer and tri‐n‐butylamine (NB) was selected as auxiliary monomer. The interaction between MP and Methotrexate (MTX) was studied by 1H‐NMR and UV‐vis spectroscopy, and the molecular recognition process of the imprinted nanotubes was proved by an in situ reduction of the imprinted Py and MP complex to form MIP layer and then by Py oxidation with oxidizing H2O2. NB was proposed to stabilize the imprinted nanotubes by preventing the collapse of the nanotubes through a strong ionic interaction between an NH group in the template and NB. After the template was removed, nanotubes exhibited the same morphology as the starting templates and could then be used as separation media for MTX and other related compounds in a mixture. With a mobile phase of 40 mmol L−1 H2SO4 and UV detection at 261 nm, MTX was determined in a 30 mm long capillary by capillary electrophoresis coupled with electrospray mass spectrometry and the LOD (limit of detection) was determined to be 0.015 μmol L−1 (S/N = 3). The possible mechanisms of improving selectivity of MIP in this system were proposed. <EOD> A review of the literature on the development of a patient education package to prevent pregnancy‐related pelvic girdle pain: what are the key components?
Prevention of pregnancy‐related pelvic girdle pain (PGP) is of relevance for clinicians and policymakers. The aim of this literature review was twofold: (i) to determine the efficacy of different patient education packages for the prevention of PGP, and (ii) to inform the development of an evidence‐based, patient education package to prevent PGP. An electronic search identified papers published between 2000 and 2010 describing randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of an educational package for the prevention of PGP. Six randomized controlled trials met the eligibility criteria. Although the methodological quality of the studies was moderate, the effect of an education package in preventing PGP is not clear. This literature review provides little support for the use of an educational package in preventing PGP following a literature search and a limited number of randomized controlled trials. Therefore, the development of a patient education package regarding prevention of PGP will require an innovative approach with a well‐defined evidence base. <EOD> .
Histologic, immunohistochemical, cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies of human primary malignant lymphomas have shown new insights in diagnosis and classification. Monoclonal antibodies detect surface antigens, which permit unequivocal subclassification among neoplasms of similar morphologic features. Chromosomal aberrations and cytogenetic studies provide new genetic markers with potential usefulness for diagnosis and prognosis. These techniques, however, are mainly limited to research applications. The recent application of molecular genetic methods, such as polymerase chain reaction and Southern blot analysis, has become an indispensable tool in research and diagnostics. These methods are more precise and sensitive, but are in most cases still only available in specialized laboratories with expensive equipment that cannot be applied routinely. <EOD> Aortic root abscess after coronary artery bypass surgery: successful treatment with open surgical drainage and staged endovascular interventions.

Input Text: Development of a Pharmacodynamic Model for Propofol in Older Adults

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
The administration of intravenous anesthetics in the elderly population requires adequate titration to avoid deleterious effects derived from overdosing or underdosing. Older patients show greater sensitivity to similar doses of propofol compared to younger patients. In addition, there is extensive interindividual variability among older patients, which would also explain the different responses to the same dose of drugs. This variability would be secondary to differences in comorbidities and physiological age, in contrast to chronological age, which would not explain the differences found in response to anesthetics in these patients. One way in which an attempt has been made to make the doses of anesthetics in different patients comparable is the use of models that predict what infusion rate is required to maintain a given concentration at the site of drug action. The relationship between a propofol effect site concentration (Ce) with a given effect can be represented by pharmacodynamic (PD) models. Recently, Eleveld et al. created a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for the administration of intravenous propofol in a population of wide ages, including neonates to older patients. However, the pharmacodynamic parameter used in this model was the BIS index, which has been questioned for its use in older adults. In addition, the creation of this PD model only included 3 patients older than 70 years, so the underrepresentation of this age group in the construction of the model could affect its performance, making it even more difficult to correctly predict the effect in this population. Anesthetic drugs exert their desired hypnotic effect on the brain. Brain electrical activity can be monitored non-invasively by recording electrical potential on the cranial surface using electrodes. The electroencephalographic (EEG) changes observed with the administration of anesthetics are usually systematic across different patients. These have been described and have been used to identify different phases of anesthetic depth or hypnosis. In addition, the representation of the EEG signal by means of a spectrogram has facilitated the incorporation of this information into commercial EEG monitors that previously only included highly processed indices such as the BIS. Within the EEG patterns of the spectrogram described for anesthetic maintenance with propofol, the alpha (8-12 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations stand out. However, the power of alpha oscillations decreases with age and with other changes that are associated with age, such as decreased cognitive ability, increased comorbidities and brain vulnerability. Therefore, guiding our administration of propofol based on obtaining a pattern of alpha predominance appears to be difficult in this aged population. The general objective of this work is to build a PKPD model that uses the pharmacokinetic parameters of the Eleveld model and new pharmacodynamic parameters derived from the frontal EEG in a population older than 65 years. Our hypothesis is that the Eleveld PKPD model, modified with this new pharmacodynamic parameter, will predict better the hypnotic effect of propofol than the original Eleveld PKPD model, in adult patients older than 65 years. The creation of a PKPD model of propofol for the population over 65 years of age would allow a better titration of this drug to avoid possible deleterious effects secondary to its under or overdosage.

Intervention-Plain Language Summary for Consumers

Background

In this guideline oral antimicrobials to cure an acute cholangitis in patients in the hospital are shown to be effective, but oral or intravenous antibiotics. In the Netherlands, patients frequently receive an IV antibiotic for 7 days. However, patients are worried about the painful infusion with an IV antibiotic and sometimes they choose to forgo the treatment.


New evidence suggests that a short effective antibiotic course is safer than one for 7 days. This could save a lot of costs and relieve the patient. To evaluate the usefulness of these shorter antibiotic courses further experiments are wanted.


Objective

To compare if the outcomes of an infection after a short course antibiotic with an 4 day course of antibiotics are the same.

2. Theoretical background: [/INST]
The actin cytoskeleton is a highly complex system comprised of tens of thousands of proteins that function in a spatially and temporally coordinated fashion, to maintain cell shape, structure and functionality, including processes such as cell migration, signaling, division, and adhesion. The basic building block of the cytoskeleton system is the actin protomer, a globular monomer of actin, which forms helical filaments. These fibrillar networks are the principal constituents of the cell skeleton, and are organized into thin filaments of actin, in contrast to microtubules, which have a tubular assembly. Actin is one of the most abundant proteins present in the cell, making up about 42% of total cellular proteins. Based on the monomeric actin molecule, actin cytoskeleton could be divided into several actin members. These actins differ in their molecular structures and functions. They also belong to different classes. G-actin is comprised of three cytoplasmic actins (alpha, beta, and gamma), and at least four skeletal actins (alpha, beta, gamma, and delta). G-actins are monomeric globular actins, which can assemble to filamentous actin (F-actin) in the presence of other proteins. G-actins are also termed monomeric actins, because it refers to a single monomer that is monomeric due to the lack of an obvious actin dimeric unit. However, this does not mean actin monomer is unrelated to other molecular processes. On the contrary, G-actin can function as both building block of F-actin as well as a monomeric actin unit with independent function: it can associate with the vesicular protein of coatomer I (COP-I) in the Golgi apparatus (Golgi stack and cis-Golgi network (CGN)). This process provides a novel role of actin monomeric unit in the coatomer protein complexes (COP-I). Actin is a monomeric globular protein, which contains 355 amino acid residues. A monomeric globular actin is comprised of 4 domains. These domains include four subdomains, the two actin-binding domains (ABD), which are located at the N-and C-terminus of the globular actin proteins. ABD contains several amino acid residues with important functions, which control actin's function. They are Lysine-184, Arginine-223, Asparagine-201, and Aspartate-140. ABD facilitates the binding and unbinding of G-actin/F-actin with other proteins. In the nucleotide-free actin, C-terminus of domain one contains three amino acids, phenylalanine-271, Serine-269, and threonine-262. C-terminus of domain one is involved in actin polymerization as well as capping protein binding. The gamma actin's Nterminus is phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2(Casein kinase II), and also it's binding site on F-actin. Domains two and three are also referred to as the helical domain, as the globular actin is an alpha helix. Domains two and three constitute two parts of the alpha helix in the globular actin.
Domain four is comprised of 107 amino acids which consists of N-and C-terminus of actin protein. N-terminus is the hydrophobic region of globular actin, and the binding site of capping protein and alphaactinin.
C-terminus is a hydrophilic amino acid region. It plays many different functions related to the assembly and interaction of different proteins, including DNasch1p(nucleosome phosph"

The proposed study is a prospective 18-month longitudinal randomized controlled trial of two methods of gastric peroral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) in patients with severe refractory gastroparesis. The primary objective of this study is to report the clinical success rate of single compared to double pyloromyotomy at G-POEM at 3, 6, and 12 months postprocedure. The trial includes G-POEM training to be performed by a single endoscopist to ensure consistency. The study aims to provide initial clinical safety and efficacy of this procedure. The primary endpoint will be technical and clinical success at 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure. Based on the results of a previous study, double cut pyloromyotomy is expected to yield better clinical success than single cut pyloromyotomy.

Summary of Results:
Gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy (G-POEM) is a novel endoscopic technique for patients who have gastroparesis and severe refractory symptoms that have not responded sufficiently to medical management. It has the potential to improve symptoms as well as quality of life in patients with gastroparesis. G-POEM is performed through submucosal dissection with either a single or double cut pyloromyotomy. A novel single cut pyloromyotomy technique is designed to maintain the circular muscle sling to prevent pyloric dysfunction that is seen with a double cut pyloromyotomy. The trial aims to evaluate the technical and clinical success as well as complications between single and double cut pyloromyotomy G-POEM in patients with refractory gastroparesis at 3, 6, and 12 months post-procedure.

 <EOD> β-Catenin/Jun Dual-Responsive DNA Nanogels For Controlled Drug Release And Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cell Eradication.
To effectively treat hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the design and construction of a smart and efficient DNA nanogel drug delivery system aiming to enhance the anticancer activity of doxorubicin (DOX) by prolonged blood circulation, controlled drug release and increased anticancer efficacy was reported. DNA-based nanogel systems were constructed by co-loading DOX and mono-6-hydrazine-1-hexyl thioglycolic acid-terminated single-stranded DNA (SH-ssDNA) into DNA scaffold via electrostatic interaction. Due to the pH responsive reversible reaction between the thiol group of SH- ssDNA and maleimide-modified polyethyleneglycol (PEG-Mal), the drug delivery system had a rapid DOX release efficiency for over 80% in an acidic environment. More importantly, as the β-catenin and Jun responsive probe, the drug delivery system presented good DNA hybrid function, stable nanostructure and high affinity towards cancer cells, thus facilitating cancer cell internalization. Meanwhile, it could effectively deliver DOX into Jundownregulated HepG-2 cells to efficiently kill cancer cells, which was beneficial for the suppression of tumor progression. Therefore, this smart DNA nanogel delivery system with β-catenin/Jun dual-response responsiveness, good biocompatibility, low toxicity and enhanced cytotoxicity will be promising for the treatment of HCC. <EOD> .
OBJECTIVE
To demonstrate the value of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in the diagnosis of diffused hepatocellular carcinoma(DHCC).


METHODS
Sixty patients with 1-year imaging follow-up were performed with MRI including routine, T1-weighted, and T2-weighted imaging, contrast-enhanced T(1)-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and DCE-MRI. Regions of interest (ROI) were drawn in the liver of peripheral tumor area (PT) and central tumor area (CT) in T1- enhanced scanning. The time to peak (TTP) from preto-post contrast medium of CT and PT were measured and analyzed by t test.


RESULTS
In each segment, there was a significant difference between PT ROI and CT ROI. The TTP from preto-post contrast medium in CT of the whole body was (7 s +/-3 s) at dynamic scan, significantly higher than the peripheral tumor (PT): (17 s +/-4 s) (Z = 5.04, P < 0.05). The dynamic change in both ROI had homogeneity.


CONCLUSION
There are significant differences in DCE-MRI dynamic parameter between PT and CT in DHCC. Therefore, diffusion parameters may be indicative of tumor progression of DHCC. <EOD> Assessment of the Surgical Complexity Score as a Risk Model in Vascular Resections with Visceral Resections: A Single-Center Retrospective Analysis

Terms commonly used to describe research studies
========================================================

A study is any investigation that requires the participation of one or more humans, whether the investigation has not yet started, or is still ongoing or has been completed. A study may be a controlled clinical trial or non controlled, e.g. case series and case reports.

A project is a research study that aims to contribute some data or analysis to, or assist the scientific community's ongoing efforts towards, the collective understanding and treatment of disease. A project may be a clinical or translational study (e.g. human experiments, lab experiments, animal experiments, epidemiological studies) or in silico (e.g. computer modelling, simulations) studies. <EOD> Neuroprotective effect of sirtuin type 3 activation is associated with the inhibition of NLRP3 inflammasome and apoptosis signaling in a model of Alzheimer’s disease

Background: The accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates composed of Amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau protein is a striking histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is related to the progressive loss of neurons, and ultimately, AD pathology. In this condition, an inflammatory context plays a key role through the assembly and activation of nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The activation of the NLRP3-caspase 1 axis induces a specific response including ASC oligomerization, Caspase-1 activation, autocleavage, and the subsequent maturation and secretion of IL-1β and IL-18. Although several findings have demonstrated that oxidative stress (OS) plays a pathophysiological role in the progression of AD, the molecular mechanisms have not been fully characterized. In addition, the mitochondrial sirtuin 3 (SIRT3) emerges as an interesting pharmacological target for the development of drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Methods: The NLRP3 inflammasome, apoptosis signaling, and OS were measured in an in vitro model of AD based on cultured SK-N-MC neuroblastoma cells with stable overexpression of the APP mutant AβPP695. In vivo study was carried out in C57Bl/6 adult mice overexpressing APPswe. First, the neuroprotective of the SIRT3 activator isoform (EA) was assessed. The NLRP3 inflammasomemediated apoptosis signaling (P2X7R and Panx1 channels activation) and OS, were then measured. Results: The activation of SIRT3 (EA) down-stream pathways inhibited the activation of P2X7R-Panx1 channels axis, inflammasome assembly and cleavage, and consequently, the release of IL-1β"

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effects of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1 (TRPA1) gene silencing on the expression of inflammation and oxidative stress indicators in rats with sepsis.


METHODS
Forty male adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into sepsis group (n=20, 5 mL saline was injected intraperitoneal injection to establish the model of sepsis) and normal group (n=10, no treatment). RNA oligonucleotides were transfected to the rats through their tail vein to silence TRPA1 gene. 24 hours after transfection, the expression of TRPA1 protein and the mRNA of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) , nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), nuclear erythroid 2-related factor2 (Nrf2), heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) , superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), malondialdehyde (MDA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), 72 hours after model establishment, the rats were sacrificed and the pathological sections were obtained. The levels of HMGB1, TNF-α mRNA, NF-κB mRNA were detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), the protein level of TRPA1, NF-κB, IκB-α levels were detected by Western blot.

Galectins are multidomain beta-galactoside binding proteins that induce angiogenesis, induce cellular proliferation, and interact with a variety of adhesion molecules. Galectins are secreted by immune cells and nonimmune cells. Galectin-3 is expressed by macrophages/monocyte and induces angiogenesis. The aim of this study was to examine the galectin 1, 3, 3 variant isoforms, and 4 fingerprint on urine of patients with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and on plasma of control subjects. We identified galectin-3 (p22 and pG21 isoforms) in urine from T1D patients. The urine from patients with T1D have increased levels of galectin-3, and, unlike plasma, it is present both in the free and bound complex form. Galectin-3 levels were increased in the patients with T1D treated with insulin (60% of total) in both urine and plasma samples. Moreover, we found 22% more of galectin-3 in plasma from T1D with insulin therapy, compared to noninsulin treated patients. Insulin therapy significantly modified galectin-3 urine concentrations in diabetic patients. <EOD> Diabetes insipidus due to hypothalamic damage following decompressive surgery. Report of two cases

BackgroundCranioencephalic trauma and decompressive craniectomy (DC) can cause a series of secondary effects secondary to the injury of the hypothalamus, including diabetes insipidus (DI). In the literature the incidence of DI in patients who underwent craniotomy is higher than that presented in the population in general.

# Introduction

## Neurosurgical trauma
Acute traumatic brain injury leads to extensive structural damage to the cerebral parenchyma causing an inflammatory response in the region. The hypothalamus, due to its vicinity to the trauma site, can be damaged; however, there are no cases reported in the literature about the damage it causes.
In this sense, one case reported by Donnan et al.   Craniotomy-induced diabetes insipidus: a reversible condition, Donnan   described a case of postraumatic DI (PDD) secondary to decompressive craniectomy (DC), where DI was identified in patient with intracranial hypertension and without signs of hypothalamic affection; however, PDD is the result of damage to hypothalamic nuclei and its adjacent structures. This mechanism has been recognized because the damage to these structures caused by DC may affect the secretion of vasopressin by the hypothalamus.
Another etiological hypothesis is that DI could be a stress response phenomenon, which would explain the low rates of central DI described in the literature regarding decompressive surgeries performed for acute traumatic brain injury, since the symptoms would disappear over time   Diabetes insipidus after cranioencephalic trauma. A common complication that is easily overlooked, Cardenas     Diabetes insipidus following severe and moderate traumatic brain injury: incidence and prevalence, Skog  .

752,"[/INST] Input Text: Sociodemographic and Clinical Characteristics of Patients Admitted to the Addiction Management Unit Study Overview Detailed Description Substance use disorder (SUD) is a complex condition in which there is uncontrolled use of substance despite its harmful consequences. People with SUD have an intense focus on using a certain substance(s) such as alcohol, tobacco, or illicit drugs, to the point where the person's ability to function in day-to-day life becomes impaired. People keep using the substance even when they know it is causing or will cause problems. Drug use brings with it the likelihood of several negative health consequences. These can include a wide range of physical and mental health disorders, foremost of which are dependence, HIV infection, hepatitis-related liver diseases, overdose and premature death. The problem of substance use is becoming one of the most serious and rapidly growing phenomena all over the world. It accounts for substantial global morbidity, mortality, and financial and social burden. According to Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, there were an estimated 494,000 drug-related deaths attributable to the use of drugs in 2019. In 2020, 1 in every 18 people aged 15-64 worldwide - an estimated 284 million people (5.6 per cent of the population) - had used a drug in the past 12 months. However, the coverage of interventions for the treatment of drug use disorders remains low overall. Implementation of scientific evidence-based drug prevention interventions remains low as well, especially in middle- and low-income countries. In Egypt, SUD is a serious public health threat. Recent studies have demonstrated increases in the prevalence of the use of tobacco, illegal drugs, and over-the-counter drugs, particularly among youth. Drug treatment registers are often used as a proxy indicator of treatment demand. This information is useful for analysis of service utilization and can be used as an indicator of trends in prevalence and patterns of high-risk drug consumption. Assiut University Hospital is the biggest hospital in Upper Egypt, and it provides health services for Assiut city and most of the neighboring governorates. Addiction management unit of Assiut University Hospital contains 16 beds, based on paid service and about 400 patients have been admitted per year. SUD is a dynamic process that changes constantly over time with new trends of drug dependence emerge every now and then, thus timely information about trends in psychoactive substance use could yield tailored interventions and reduce potential harms. Identifying personal, social, and demographic characteristics of patients with this disorder at the local, regional, and national levels helps physicians, health authorities, and policy-makers detect early emerging trends and enable them better plan and implement prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs. This study aims to identify sociodemographic, personal characteristics, as well as patterns of illicit drug abuse in patients admitted for addiction treatment.

 <EOD> The association of the DKK1 -2155A>G polymorphism with risk of acute myeloid leukemia in the Northern Chinese Han population

Increasing evidence has demonstrated that DKK1, a secreted Wnt signaling inhibitor, is associated with immune response and malignancies; however, the role of DKK1 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains largely undefined. Therefore, the purpose of our study was to evaluate the association between the DKK1 -2155A>G polymorphism and the susceptibility to and clinicopathological characteristics of AML. We enrolled 128 patients with AML and 103 healthy control subjects in this study. PCR-based sequencing and an EASIA kit were used to determine the genotype and concentrations of plasma dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) respectively. The results showed that the frequency distributions of A and G alleles were 70.30% vs. 29.70% and 67.45% vs. 32.55%, respectively. In addition, the risk of AML was approximately nearly two times higher among patients with the DKK1 -2155 AG/GG genotype compared to the AA genotype (OR = 1.976, 95%CI: 1.020-3.835, P = 0.042). Plasma DKK-1 levels in patients with the AG/GG genotype (30.88 ± 2.69 ng/mL) were dramatically lower compared with those of the AA genotype (37.49 ± 1.64 ng/mL) (P < 0.05). These results indicate that the DKK1 -2155 A>G polymorphism was significantly associated with increased susceptibility to AML in the Northern Chinese Han population. However, there was no association with the clinicopathological characteristics of patients. In conclusion, our present data suggest that DKK-1 might be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with AML.

Input Text: Normal Reference Values in Han Adults of Extremity Arterial Structure and Hemodynamics by High-frequency Ultrasound

Study Overview
~~~~~~~~~~~

Detailed Description
~~~~~~~~~
The extremity artery is the peripheral blood vessel of the whole body, and it is often involved early in the diseases that are easy to damage the small vessels, such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases. Early lower limb atherosclerosis mainly occurs in the dorsal foot artery, which is commonly seen in people with diabetes and long-term smoking. Connective tissue diseases such as systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus also mainly involve small blood vessels, and vascular lesions may appear earlier than those of other specific organs such as heart and lung. Because of its shallow location, the extremity artery can be better used as a screening site for vascular diseases, and it is the window for early reaction of vascular diseases.However, the early stage of extremity artery disease is easy to be ignored, and patients often have pain and numbness of the affected limb. When the disease is severe, it can lead to ulcer not healing, and even limb gangrene and amputation, which greatly affects the quality of life and brings huge troubles and economic pressure to the patients. Therefore, early diagnosis of extremity arterial lesions is of great significance for early diagnosis of microvascular injury diseases such as atherosclerosis and connective tissue diseases, reducing the incidence of complications, and reducing the rate of amputation and mortality. Ultrasound is a non-invasive imaging technique widely used in clinic. In recent years, with the development of ultrasound technology, the frequency of ultrasonic probes has been increasing. Because of its higher resolution, high-frequency ultrasound can clearly display the superficial vascular structure and blood flow, detect vascular lesions early, and accurately quantify the degree of stenosis, providing a new and beneficial tool for clinical observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremity artery. The purpose of this multi-center clinical study was to establish the normal value of high frequency ultrasound for the structure and blood flow of the extremities of Chinese Han adults, and to explore its influencing factors, so as to provide a quantitative reference for the early diagnosis, degree evaluation and curative effect observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities.

Input Text: Exploring the Role of Low-level Laser Therapy on Wound Healing in the Treatment of Periodontal Intrabony Defects: A Randomized Split-Mouth Clinical Trial

Detailed Description
--------------------
The objective of this study was to determine the role of low-level laser therapy (LLLT) on wound healing in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. The study was a randomized split-mouth clinical trial with a 1-year follow-up. One randomly selected intrabony defect from each patient was treated with a combination of LLLT and open flap debridement (OFD) (test group), and the contralateral was given OFD only (control group). Thirty patients were assessed for eligibility for inclusion to the study. Three participants were excluded due to the lack of teeth in the maxilla and/or mandible, respectively. Thirty patients were randomized into test group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15). The mean probing pocket depth (PPD) reduction at 6 months was 2.83 mm (P ≤ 0.001), followed by 2.13 mm at 12 months and 2.12 mm at the end of the trial (P ≤ 0.001). In the test group, the mean CAL gain at six months was 1.84 mm (P ≤ 0.001), followed by 1.32 mm at 12 months and 1.30 mm at the end of the trial (P ≤ 0.001). The control group showed a mean CAL gain of 1.45 mm (P ≤ 0.001), 1.10 mm (P = 0.002), and 1.07 mm (P = 0.002) throughout the six, 12, and 18 month follow-up periods, respectively. At 6 months, the test group showed a mean BOP reduction of 0.38 (P ≤ 0.001) compared to the control group (P ≤ 0.001). After 6 months of therapy, 70% of the sites in the test group and 57% of the controls were considered completely clinically healed. After 6 months of therapy, 87% of defects in the test group and 73% in the control group were considered clinically healed after 18 months of therapy. In conclusion, the use of LLLT combined with OFD in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects resulted in favorable outcomes in terms of PPD reduction and CAL gain. Moreover, the adjunctive use of LLLT improved the clinical healing parameters. The present study suggests that the use of LLLT in addition to conventional, mechanical debridement, and plaque control is beneficial in the management of periodontal intrabony defects.

Exploring the Role of Low-level Laser Therapy on Wound Healing in the Treatment of Periodontal Intrabony Defects: A Randomized Split-Mouth Clinical Trial

Duplicate, unreadable, or non-relevant records were removed prior to screening for eligibility. After abstract screening, a total of 458 studies were assessed for eligibility for inclusion to the study. Thirty participants were randomized into test group (n = 15) and control group (n = 15) based on a random sequence generated by sequential allocations of patients' codes. The study showed significant improvement in periodontal status after 6 months of treatment. Probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), and clinical healing rate showed higher improvement in the group receiving laser therapy than in the control group. It is concluded that low-level laser therapy (LLLT) should be considered in periodontal treatment regimens in order to improve clinical outcomes in the treatment of periodontal intrabony defects. LLLT resulted in clinical and microbiological improvements, and showed a good prognosis in period"

Input Text <EOD> The relationship between intraperitoneal pressure and bowel perfusion.
BACKGROUND
Intraperitoneal pressure (IP) and its effect on splanchnic perfusion are not clearly understood. Controversy exists due to poor methodology as well as contradictory results of the studies performed to date.


METHODS
We studied 14 patients undergoing laparoscopy for tubal ligation or sterilization. In each patient, a 22-gauge angiocatheter was inserted into an intraperitoneal location for use in measuring pressure. IP was then recorded at 2 different times intraoperatively: once during carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum at a pressure between 12 mm Hg and 15 mm Hg, and once after abdominal insufflation, but while the patient was maintained with an intraperitoneal pressure under 5 mm Hg. Once the measurements were completed, a thermodilution catheter was introduced into the right and left gastroepiploic arteries for the study of splanchnic perfusion.


RESULTS
The intraperitoneal pressure was found to have an effect on splanchnic perfusion. A linear correlation was noted between IP and the right gastroepiploic perfusion index (r = .57, P less than .014). A highly significant negative correlation existed between the left gastroepiploic perfusion index and IP (r = -.658, P less than .007).


CONCLUSION
Intraperitoneal pressure has a negative impact on splanchnic perfusion. <EOD> Sphingosine Kinase Controls G1/S Cell Cycle Progression by Regulation of E2F-Dependent Transcription Downstream of Transforming Growth Factor-β Signaling*

Cells require sphingosine kinase (SK1) for cell cycle progression; however, how the SK1 metabolite sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) promotes cell cycle progression is unclear. We demonstrate that inhibition of SK1 activity attenuates E2Fdependent transcriptional output and cell proliferation in serum-treated and serum-starved fibroblasts. S1P promotes activation of the E2F complex by increasing expression of two key components of the DNA binding factor. S1P/SK1 promotes cell cycle progression primarily by affecting the expression of cyclin E and in response to serum. Moreover, we have demonstrated that TGF␤, a growth regulatory cytokine, induces a significant increase in S1P, which is necessary to maintain S phase entry in fibroblasts. Thus, the sphingolipid-metabolizing enzyme SK1 plays vital roles in cell proliferation, primarily through the regulation of cell cycle progression under both nondividing and dividing conditions.
Cell cycle progression is regulated by a tightly controlled progression through the cycle phases (G1, S, G2, and M), and its deregulation leads to malignant transformation; hence, the identification of crucial mediators of cell cycle progression may hold promising therapeutic targets in cancer prognosis and treatment. A hallmark of most human cancers is loss of normal regulation of the cell cycle. Cell growth is driven by the binding of growth factors or cytokines to their respective receptors. The TGF␤ superfamily cytokines are key growth regulatory mediators and are potent inducers of the reversible growth arrest in a variety of cell types and tumor and endothelial cell lines . Tumor growth suppression, metastasis, angiogenesis, and apoptosis are affected by growth regulatory functions of TGF␤ (1). TGF␤ is a multifunctional pleiotropic cytokine that is expressed in most adult tissues and is a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression in both dividing and nondividing epithelial cells including fibroblast cells. However, in cancer cells, loss of TGF␤-medi"

 <EOD> Anorectal Malformation: Experience and Short‐Term Outcomes of 334 Patients Over 20 Years
Anorectal malformation (ARM) is often associated with additional malformations. The objectives of this study were to examine longterm outcomes and treatment modalities, and to compare the results of posterior sagittal anorectoplasty and intersphincteric resection. Between 1986 and 2006, 334 patients (200 boys and 134 girls) underwent surgery for ARM during the course of the years. Data were recorded on preoperative fistula, congenital abnormalities, operation type, and hospital stay. Preand postoperative anastomosis position, and neurological outcome were the long term outcomes. Age at last follow‐up, duration of follow‐up, fecal incontinence episodes per day, and abdomino‐pubic procedures were also recorded. During the study period, 324 patients had their first operation. One hundred and fourteen patients required surgical interventions because of recurrent fistula. Patients were reviewed at the outpatient clinic. Eighty patients could not be followed up because of change in the address. There were 212 patients in the intersphincteric resection group and 67 patients in the posterior sagittal anorectoplasty group. In the intersphincteric resection group, long‐term outcomes were not satisfactory. Anastomosis was displaced too high in patients who had posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. However, it was not significant statistically. Fecal incontinence was more frequent in the intersphincteric resection group. No recurrent fistula was encountered in either group. Intersphincteric resection is an acceptable procedure, but it has a significant rate of fecal incontinence. If the surgeon is experienced, the operation time of intersphincteric resection is shorter than that of posterior sagittal anorectoplasty. Posterior sagittal anorectoplasty seems to be the procedure of choice. <EOD> Assessment of pulse-chase and radiolabel methods for measuring cholinesterase activity and synthesis.
To assess the potential use of radiolabeled carbamylcholine as a marker of cholinesterase activity, we designed an experiment in which we tested the hypothesis that differences in the kinetics of the uptake and degradation of the radiolabeled substrate account for the differences in the values obtained by pulse-chase and radiolabel assays of activity. Cholinesterase activity of incubations with radiolabeled substrate was much greater than values with the pulse-chase method, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved in the assays. The differences in pulse-chase and radiolabel assays for activity were dependent on the incubation time of the radiolabeled substrate, the concentration of cholinesterase present in the inc"

IMPORTANCE
Beyond the visible characteristics of the palate and lip, abnormalities in muscle size, tendon length, and growth are likely to contribute to the foot deformities common in individuals with a cleft. The peroneus longus tendons at the ankle are in a constant tension position and thus are at higher risk of disorders.


OBJECTIVE
To evaluate differences in tendon morphology and tendon tension between cohorts of individuals with unilateral cleft lip and palate (UCLP), isolated cleft palate (CP), and unaffected comparison participants using peroneus longus sonoelastograms.


DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS
Eighteen UCLP, 16 CP, and 19 participants without craniofacial anomalies served as a comparison cohort. All participants were 5 to 20 years old. Demographic characteristics, such as sex, race, body mass index, and age, were collected for all participants. Elastogram assessments of the peroneal tendon size and tension were acquired by using transverse and sagittal ultrasound views with a 10- to 14-MHz linear transducer along with a custom 34-MHz transducer.


MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES
Measures of stiffness at the foot, lower limb, and ankle, tendon cross-sectional area (CSA), and tendon length.


RESULTS
Stiffness at the ankle and foot, tendon CSA, and stiffness at the foot for the overall and tendon stiffness at the lower limb for the CP group were significantly different from unaffected controls. No significant difference was found between UCLP and CP for stiffness at the ankle, foot, and lower limb and tendon CSA. Stiffness at the foot in UCLP was significantly higher than CP. In the UCLP group for patients with an affected side (n = 7), there was an increased tendon stiffness at the foot and higher tendon CSA, along with a decrease in ankle tendon stiffness. Unlike the CP group, CSA of the peroneal tendon was not found to be significantly increased in both the affected and nonaffected sides for UCLP.


CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE
The difference in tendon morphology and stiffness in the ankle and foot between the overall CP group and the unaffected control group and between the affected-side UCLP cohort and overall UCLP group may offer valuable knowledge of muscle morphology and function of individuals with orofacial clefts. Ultrasound technology may provide a useful objective tool for studying the musculoskeletal characteristics of individuals with clefts. What This Article Adds: Sural nerve conduction velocity and/or electromyography may indicate a reduced excitability of motor fibers supplying the muscle or anatomical changes within the fibers and/or nerve. <EOD> Effects of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and phenylephrine during induced hypotension upon cerebral blood flow, brain function and oxygen balance.
It was recently demonstrated that a combination of alpha and beta adrenergic agonists used as a hypotensive technique resulted in a profound fall in cerebral blood flow, cerebral oxygen consumption, and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen, and a reduction in brain function (as measured by the electroencephalogram). The objective of the present study was to determine whether administration of alpha adrenergic agonists alone could have these same deleterious effects on cerebral hemodynamics, cerebral metabolism and brain function."

Plain Language Summary:
=====================
A clinical trial is a study to test the effects of the treatment, including surgeries, using different methods on people, depending on the stage of research at which the clinical trial is being conducted. The results of the clinical trial will be published later.
This clinical trial (NCT03389543) is about shoulder problems that occur due to rotator cuff tears. Part of the rotator cuff is called the long biceps tendon. A tear in this tendon can also make your shoulder painful and reduce the ability to perform daily activities. This clinical trial will look at new ways of fixing tears that are not repairable with surgery to the rotator cuff. This clinical trial is being conducted in France.
There will be 40 patients in this clinical trial. Patients aged 50 to 80 will be selected for the clinical trial. Both men and women are welcome to join this clinical trial.
All patients who take part in this clinical trial will undergo surgery in which the rotator cuff, the most important muscle in the shoulder, will be repaired with the long biceps tendon. However, if the tendon is not in good condition or is torn, this clinical trial will attempt to fix the shoulder with surgery. When the long biceps tendon is the solution to fix the shoulder, the tendon is placed in a capsule to provide stability to the shoulder.
All patients will be assessed before and after the surgery is performed. The findings will be compared and the data will be analyzed to confirm whether this clinical trial is safe and has enough data to warrant additional research. For the patients who undergo surgery, the time of their recovery will be carefully evaluated and compared before and after the surgery.
Your participation will have a positive impact on other patients in the following ways:
- We will learn more about our current treatments and ways to fix the shoulder and rotator cuff tears. We will gain knowledge about how effective our surgical methods will be in the long-term.
- We will know additional surgical methods we can use to repair the shoulder.
- We will have better information on when to perform reconstruction using either the long or the tendon itself.
This clinical trial will provide additional data on clinical trial in shoulder and rotator cuff injuries. We will be able to use this clinical
trail to improve health of patients.

This is the first clinical trial on reconstructing shoulder by using the long biceps tendon or the tear itself. We will assess the long term of the results.

The purpose of the clinical trial is to get better understanding of the rotator cuff tears by using these surgeries for patients.
We will collect some data on the methods to fix"

BACKGROUND
The prevalence of asthma has increased progressively in the world in recent decades, reaching high levels in Central-Eastern Europe. Asthma has a high prevalence among the school children of our community (""La Mancha Occidental"" in Spain).


OBJECTIVE
The purpose of our paper is to analyze the different patterns presented by asthma in a group of 845 school children between 6 and 14 years of age in three cities of the Spanish La Mancha region.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Three hundred and forty-nine children of Albacete, 327 of Cuenca and 179 of Almansa were involved in a cross-sectional epidemiological study using standardized questionnaires sent to their parents to gather information on wheezing, respiratory symptoms and environmental exposure.


RESULTS
Fify-seven percent of the 2.625 school children had wheezing. Increasingly asthma was diagnosed in children: 22.8% of them were preschoolers, 25.2% were school-beginners, 30.9% were school-intermediates and 20.9% were school-interferrents.


CONCLUSION
The prevalence of bronchial asthma in preschoolers was lower than in previous studies. It coincides with the highest school stage in the same group of children to whom higher prevalences were recorded. <EOD> Globally Consistent Ground‐Truth Datasets Enable High‐Resolution Global Estimates of Ecosystem Properties for Food Security Applications
Humanity is facing many challenges to feed a rising population in light of increasing resource scarcity. Such challenges require accurate, systematic, and large‐scale estimations of ecological attributes to ensure sustainable food production. To improve these estimates, we propose and evaluate a system for quantitative data collection from around the world with the intention of producing globally consistent ecosystem data sets. In addition, we identify a method that enables quantitative estimates of plant cover, green and organic matter depth, and biomass at high spatial resolutions, from satellite‐based products such as Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reflectance data. We examine the impacts of the quality and quantification of the dataset on the accuracy of the global maps of the plant cover and estimated biomass using a series of data‐to‐data approaches. For crop classification, we find a 77% increase in the area correctly classified using our methodology compared to a traditional Random Forest classifier on the same training and testing data. On a separate training and testing data set, we show an out‐of‐bag error of 18.7 and 20.8% for our final global biomass estimation model using either reflectance or the MODIS‐based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as predictors, respectively. This framework makes reliable assessments of global food production and conservation possible and highlights the importance of creating, verifying, and improving global quantitative and consistent datasets in order to enable food security measures on both regional and national levels. <EOD> Differences in Risk Factors for Obesity in Childhood: Analysis of an 8-Year Study

 <EOD> A New Strategy to Inhibit the Glygcoprotein IIb/IIIa Receptor: Peptides with Cyclized RGD Sequences.
The platelet receptor glycoprotein (GP) IIb-IIIa contains two identical heterodimeric subunits that form the principal ligand for the fibrinogen receptor. Inhibition of platelet adhesion is the primary mechanism for antiplatelet therapy and it has been widely demonstrated that RGD-peptides bind, block the binding to GPIIb-IIIa, stabilize the platelet membrane and prevent platelet aggregation. In this work we synthesized and characterized a set of RGD-cyclized peptides. The strategy was to use cyclic structures to stabilize in plasma the RGD conformation required for the interaction with the receptor. We find that, in terms of potency, cyclization of RGD does not significantly modify the interaction. At the level of binding, peptides showed the same characteristics with the exception that peptides containing lysine residues were more active than their linear counterparts. The cyclized peptide with the greatest inhibition of in vitro platelet adhesion and aggregation was tested in mice in which platelets were tagged with green fluorescent protein: this showed that this peptide inhibits platelets more efficiently than a cys-arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) peptide. Cyclization was found to increase the half-life of these peptides in plasma. <EOD> Highlights From the American College of Chest Physicians' 2010 Annual Meeting
The 2010 annual meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians had a particularly rich offering of sessions on interventional pulmonology. Although many of the sessions focused on minimally invasive treatment options to improve diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary diseases, there also were some interesting studies with respect to other clinical conditions. As part of a continuous series of reports of findings presented at major respiratory medicine–focused meetings, this report summarizes the most significant presentations related to interventional pulmonology. The American College of Chest Physicians’ annual meeting was held in San Francisco, California, Oct 18 through Oct 21, 2010; the meeting highlights covered the following: • Tanshinone in patients with refractory lung adenocarcinoma: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial <EOD> .
OBJECTIVE
Determining the quality of sexual life in women who underwent breast cancer surgery.


SETTING
University hospital.


DESIGN
A case series study.


STUDY PARTICIPANTS
The study included 82 women with a medical diagnostic of breast cancer who attended a breast cancer clinic after a diagnostic biopsy (mean age 52,27; range 24-82 years old; 47.5% with unilateral, 33% with bilateral cancer and 19.5% diagnosed as stage 0. They underwent a surgical procedure of breast cancer and they were followed with at least six months. Sexual life of the women who underwent a unilateral surgical procedure was compared with sexual life of women who underwent bilateral breast cancer surgery.


MEASUREMENTS
The Sexual Function Assessment Questionnaire, which includes a survey of sexual problems and a scale of emotional functioning, was used to explore the women's feelings about their sexual life.


ANALYSIS
The results were statistically described by using the mean, the median and the standard deviation for qualitative and quantitative variables. The 2 test or the t-Student test was used for comparing the results of these questionnaires.


RESULTS
A 90.4% of women considered their sexual function after surgery, with a 8.6% difference in frequency between the women with breast cancer surgery versus the women with breast cancer surgery with a high percentage in the women with a low educational level.


CONCLUSIONS
The perception of women after the oncological breast treatment is that their physical and emotional sexuality improves in consequence of the diagnostic breast cancer. Although they suffer the change on an important part of their physical anatomy, those women who underwent unilateral breast cancer surgery described a better satisfaction in their sexual life"

Input Text: Feasibility, Acceptability and Effect of a Transdiagnostic Psychological Treatment for Anxiety and Depression in Youth

Study Overview
=================


Detailed Description
-----------------
Participants in the study are children (7 to 17 years of age) seeking help for anxiety and depression in routine primary care and their parents. The children are screened with the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents (MINI-KID). Patients assessed as fulfilling criteria for anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders and/or depression and checked against inclusion and exclusion criteria are informed about the project orally and in writing. Informed consent is obtained verbally and in writing. Recruitment in the two separate clinical sites continues until up to 8 children and their parents constitute a group. After inclusion children and their parents fill in self-report scales. Some of these self-report scales are already in use in the primary care platform (SDQ) and (R-CADS) are in paper-format and saved in the clinic. The therapist in the project are asked to fill in a scale that assesses feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, after treatment completion. Data will be analysed descriptively to answer research question from self-reports from the children, parents and therapist as to satisfaction with treatment, feasibility and acceptability. Treatment effect will be analysed with paired sample t-test on primary and secondary outcomes. Therapist have received training in UP-C/A by certified educators in UP and will receive on-going supervision in Unifiedprotocol by a UP-certified psychologist, during the group intervention. Also, the group intervention is audio-taped. A random sample of 20% of the sessions will be rated as to compliance with the Unified Protocol. The ratings will be performed by the project investigator, also trained in UP-C/A. A sample size of about 30 is aimed for based on an average of 6 patients in a group and five treatment groups in total. One clinic is aiming for three groups and the other for two treatment groups. Detailed and clear information about the treatment, time consumption for child and parent groups and a good structure for data collection in the clinics are some planned strategies to minimize dropouts and data loss. From the overall collected data on child and parent satisfaction, therapist ratings of acceptability, feasibility and treatment effects at a 6-month follow-up, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is planned for in primary care.

BACKGROUND
The pathogenesis of osteoporosis has not been fully elucidated.


OBJECTIVE
To detect the expression of the receptor activator of nuclear factor κB ligand (RANKL) mRNA in the bone tissue of the distal femur of rat by microwave fixation method, and to explore the feasibility of establishing an osteoporosis model in rat by gavage 1α,-25-(OH)₂D₃ .


METHODS
36 four-month-old female SD rats were randomly divided into the control group (G1) and the experiment group (G2) with 18 ones in each group. 5mg/100g 1α,-25-(OH)₂D₃ was given once a week to the rats in the experiment group via gavage. After 36 weeks, G1 rats were sacrificed and their femora extracted to be detected the expression of the RANKL mRNA in bones of distal femur, so are the rats in G2 after gavage medication stopped.


RESULTS
G1 rats' bone density was significantly higher than that of G2. The expression of the RANKL mRNA in the bone tissues of distal femur in G2 rats was 14.2±7.6, and significantly higher than that of the normal rats as control (P<0.05,0.14±0.02), as the expression ratio of the RANKL mRNA of the bone tissue in distal femur of the normal rat to whole body tissue of the same size. After administration with Vitamin D3, the expression of the RANKL mRNA in G2 rats was significantly lower than that of G1 rats(P<0.05).


CONCLUSIONS
1α,-25-(OH)₂D₃ is helpful to maintain the normal bone metabolism. The pathogeneses of OP induced by vitamin D3 deficiency in the rats was related to the expression of the RANKL mRNA in bone tissues of distal femur. The low expression of the RANKL mRNA is helpful to prevent the bone trabecula from the depression or fracture. <EOD> The use of oral contraceptives in menorrhagia: results of a randomized trial.
A randomized trial of 698 women with menorrhagia demonstrated that 500 mug of norethisterone acetate (NETA) and 0.0905 mg mestranol per cycle (NOMACG) are as effective as 0.1 mg mestranol per cycle (NGMTG) when used cyclically over a two-year period. No evidence of disease suppression was found when these three preparations were evaluated. The incidence of headache, nausea, and vomiting was significantly higher and the satisfaction rate was significantly lower in the NOMCAG group. These side-effects usually disappeared after one or two months of drug therapy. Patients using NGMTG were less satisfied with therapy than those on the other two regimens, and the NMTG group had the least side-effects. It is suggested that when a high degree of contraceptive protection is not necessary, NOMCAG is the preparation to use in treatment of menorrhagia. Side-effects and patient satisfaction tend to be better with this drug combination than with those containing higher doses of mestranol. <EOD> Surgical treatment of acute subdural hematoma in children caused only by the rupture of the internal carotid artery

### Pre-Screening Phase I.

The purpose of this pre-screening phase is to pre-identify those within the community who are potentially eligible for the trial. Screening questionnaires are administered to the community population to identify persons who may be eligible for the trial. In order to conduct this phase, we will develop a study database, which will be populated as part of the pre-screening.

During pre-screening a list of all persons within age and gender-specific ranges who live in the target community area will be generated, making use of the local government census. This list will serve as baseline data and will be used as the basis for generating the sample for the screening.

The pre-screening phase will involve the administration of standardized instruments to potential screening subjects. Instruments of specific interest are:

The questionnaires are administered by research team members. The research teams are trained in data collection and administration of the instruments. Wherever possible, the screenings and pre-screens will be conducted in the homes of the screened persons. In order to maintain anonymity, respondents will not be asked to write their names or to divulge any personal identification. All interviewers who are engaged in this project will have signed written consent to comply with all ethical considerations required for this project. In keeping with all ethical requirements and international standards, all interviewers will follow a detailed screening protocol.

During the phase of pre-screening, a standardized set of instruments will be administered. It will consist of a demographic data form, and four screening instruments: the Community Screening Instrument for Dementia (CSI-D) , the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), the Patient Health Questionnaire, and the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ).

Input Text: High Flow Oxygen in Preoxygenation During Rapid Sequence Induction in Infants and Small Children
Detailed Description

All patients requiring an acute surgery and rapid sequence induction/intubation will be checked for eligibility criteria and then an informed consent will be obtained. Afterwards, randomization will take place, which will divide a patient into one of three groups: 1) RSI + face-mask preoxygenation, 2) RSI + high-flow nasal oxygen cannula (HFNOC) preoxygenation and 3) RSI + face-mask and HFNOC preoxygenation. The demographic data, type of surgery and vital signs will be observed. Primary outcomes will be the impact of HFNOC preoxygenation on oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry (SpO2) and heart rate during the induction of anaesthesia. Secondary outcomes will be safety of the RSI protocol, Cormack-Lehane score, incidence of difficult airway management, number of the intubation attempts and episodes of regurgitation/aspiration. RSI will be done according to our protocol. Initially, equipment will be checked and an i.v. line will be checked/started and then a bolus of ketamine will be given (0,2-0,5 mg/kg intravenously,) for the face-mask/HFNOC tolerance and the table will be tilted to anti-Trendelenburg position. In case of difficult or unable of intravenous line insertion, intramuscular bolus of ketamin (1-3mg/kg i.m.) could be used prior to another attempt. Afterward, the preoxygenation will start according to the randomization result - group 1) face-mask preoxygenation (flow 2 L/kg/minute, max 6 L/minute), group 2) HFNOC preoxygenation (flow ~2 L/kg/minute, max 6 L/minute) and group 3) HFNOC (flow ~2 L/kg/minute) + face-mask preoxygenation (flow ~2 L/kg/minute, max 6 L/minute) - with 100 % oxygen for three minutes. Then a bolus of anaesthetic and myorelaxant agent will be given (propofol 2,5 mg/kg in haemodynamically stable, ketamine in haemodynamically unstable and rocuronium 1 mg/kg or suxamethonium 1,5 mg/kg if sugammadex bolus was given in last 24 hours) . The neuromuscular blockade will be monitored, first intubation attempt will start as soon as single twitch will be bellow 10 % or TOF below 1 or after 60 seconds, whichever comes first. After that, the first intubation attempt will take place, a video laryngoscopy will be used and Cormack-Lehane score will be documented photographically. The attempt will end either by successful intubation with monitored capnography wave or by failure of three trials (or 120 seconds). All failures will be recorded. If any failure of the intubation occurred, the anaesthetist will take care of that failure and the patient will be extubated and a consultation oral and maxillofacial surgery or resuscitation unit service will take care of the patient accordingly.

Input Text: Examining Engagement Predictors of Health and Fitness App Uptake and Subscription in the General Population: A 24-week Prospective Cohort Study

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
This will be a 24-week prospective study that will incorporate user base data of WayBetter Inc.'s app, WayBetter, to examine user mHealth app engagement. The primary objective of this study is to examine predictors (i.e., socio-demographics, past health behaviours, psychological determinants, app engagement metrics) of (a) initial six-month subscription and b) subscription renewal rates at six months for the WayBetter app. The secondary objective is to describe WayBetter app engagement over 24 weeks using 'WayBetter' and 'Industry' specific engagement metrics. We will use descriptive statistics to summarize engagement patterns and Kaplan-Meier survival curves to illustrate time to non-usage attrition and app resumption. A repeated measures ANOVA will be used to demonstrate if statistically significant differences exist between the user 'latent classes' and app engagement metrics. Regression equations and a linear probability model will be formed to predict engagement metrics using latent classes and individual-level factors (socio-demographic, previous health behaviours, determinants of behavioural intentions to use health and fitness apps, and behavioural/personality traits) as predictor variables. A sensitivity analysis will be completed to examine the effects of methods of WayBetter account creation, 1) via the WayBetter online quiz (Group A) or 2) direct download of the app on primary outcomes (Group B).

 <EOD> Clinical trials in pediatric neurofibromatosis: the European Association for Neuro-Oncology Paediatric Task Force perspectives

Background: Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is the most common neurocutaneous disorder, with autosomal dominant inheritance caused by germline mutations in the NF1 gene on chromosome 17. Optimal strategies for the treatment of tumors associated with NF1 are needed to improve the clinical outcome in affected patients. The neuro-oncology community awaits clear evidence that new treatments for NF1-associated tumors improve clinical outcomes.Methods: This narrative review summarizes recent clinical trials addressing the management of NF1-associated tumors in children and adults and highlights the ongoing challenges to designing and conducting trials of effective and safe therapeutic interventions in this population.Results: Clinical trials encompassing NF1-associated tumors have progressively moved from investigational medicinal product efficacy studies to focus on the assessment of disease-predicting biomarkers or biomarker-guided therapies. This evolution was prompted and made possible by the development of NF1-specific biomarkers for response to tumor-treating fields (TTFs) in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST); this resulted in the Food and Drug Administration approval of TTFs as monotherapy for MPNST. Oncolytic virotherapy, cell therapy using chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CAR-T cells), and antibody-based therapy, such as blinatumomab or tisagenlecleucel, may also have potential roles in the management of children with NF1-associated tumors. Recruitment rates in ongoing clinical trials are low, and more research is needed to refine trial designs to include appropriate biological markers.Conclusions: Designing a trial for a disease population that is predominantly adult and for which long-term follow-up is needed to evaluate the potential benefit of treatment presents unique challenges. The European Association for Neuro-Oncology Paediatric Task Force outlined practical solutions to the challenges of conducting clinical trials with children with NF1-associated tumors and shared their perspectives.(2022) 25:62; https://doi.Background Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disease caused by germline mutations in the NF1 gene located on chromosome 17. This disease is highly variable both in clinical presentation, and in its disease trajectory: from a ""benign"" cutaneous manifestation of freckling or cafe´au-lait macules in infancy to the serious consequences of NF1-associated optic and cranial nerve gliomas (malignant optic and brainstem gliomas) in childhood. The frequency of NF1 mutations ranges between 1 in 2500 and 1 in 3100 and is caused by germline NF1 mutations in one allele, with the NF1 tumor suppressor genedamaging mutation being silenced by a second NF1 allele mutation. The second NF1 mutation may be the result of a second NF1 mutation (the second in trans), of complete or partial somatic loss of the wild-type NF1 allele (the second in cis), or from somatic secondary mutations that modify genes or signaling pathways that negatively impact tumor control. Approximately half of the affected patients develop plexiform or other nerve sheath tumors, including neurocutaneous, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), the deadliest and most disseminating tumor arising from the Schwann cells in the peripheral nerve sheath, which accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality in NF1 patients.

The goal of this report is to summarize the results of a research study on the use of different non-pharmalogical methods for infants to decrease pain and increase the comfort during painful procedure.
As the data was obtained from the research project, ""The effect of swaddling and inhaling breast milk odour on the pain and comfort during the placement of the peripheral intravenous catheter in term infants."" This paper will discuss the results of the effect of swaddling and/or inhaling breast milk odour on the pain and comfort of the infants.
To conduct this intervention, 120 term infants were equally assigned to three experimental groups and a control group. During the placement of a peripheral intravenous catheter, the infants in the 1st experimental group were swaddled, the infants in the 2ndexperimentalgroup were made to inhale the mother's breast milk odour, the infants in the 3rd experimentalgroup were both swaddled and made to inhale the mother's breast milk odour and no procedure was applied to the infants in the control group. The pain and comfort levels of infants in the experimental and control groups were assessed before, during and after the placement of a peripheral intravenous catheter.
The infants in the 1st experimental group (swaddling), 2nd experimental group (inhaling mother's breast milk odour), 3rd experimental group (swaddled and inhaling mother's breast milk odour) and control group experienced a decline in the duration of the crying, frequency of restless movements, duration of the agitation following the beginning of the procedure. The infants in the 1st (swaddling), 2ndexperimentalgroup (inhaling mother's breast milk odour), 3rd experimentalgroup (swaddled and inhaling mother's breast milk odour), and control group experienced an increase in the duration of quiet sleep and skin-to-skin care. The infants in the 1st (swaddling), 3rd experimental group (swaddled and inhaling mother'sbreast milk odour), and control group experienceda decline in the duration of the unsettled state (including crying, restless movements, and agitated state). Infants in the 1st (swaddling), 3rd experimental (swaddled and inhaling mother's breast milk odour) and control groups experienced a decline in the physiotherapist scoring the infant's pain. The frequency of painful procedures required to complete the catheter insertion was low and less stressful in these groups (inhaling mother's breast milk odour, swaddling, and swaddled and inhaling mother's breast milk odour) compared to the control group in which the procedures were carried out without interventions.
Swaddling in the 1st experimental group, 3rd experimental group, and inhaling mother's breast milk odour in the 2nd experimental group during the placement of peripheral intravenous catheter in term infants have been reported as effective in decreasing the neonates pain and stress. Swaddling also had a positive effect on the skin-to-skin care and skin-to-skin contact between the mother and the infant by increasing the frequency of skin-toshoulder contact at least three times and increasing the duration of skin-to-skin contact. Although the mother's breast milk odour was effective in decreasing neonates' pain, it did not contribute to increasing skin-to-skin contact. The infants in the 1th experimental group (swaddling), 2nd experimental group (inhaling mother's breast milk odour), and 3rd experimental group (swaddled and inhaling mother's breast milk odour) experienced fewer painful procedures to complete the catheter insertion. Swaddling and inhaling mother's breast milk odour had less stressful effect on the neonates' physiotherapists, which indicates less disturbance in the physiotherapist's interventions during the painful procedure.
The results of the research have indicated that swaddling and/or inhaling mother's breast milk odour during the peripheral intravenous placement in term infants is an effective, cost-efficient and applicable non-pharmacological method. While the results of swaddling and inhaling mother's breast milk odour methods are encouraging, it still remains a question how the mothers' breast milk od"

 <EOD> Diffuse Axonal Injury: Current Understanding and the Status of Prophylaxis
Diffuse axonal injury (DAI), often as a part of more complex brain injury in coma to traumatic brain injury. The DAI is a noncontusive brain injury but is most common in motor vehicle, motorcycle, and bicycle accidents. The degree of injury depends on the rate of acceleration/deceleration, mechanism of injury, the specific neuroanatomical location, the degree of displacement, the type of anatomical components and their structure, the degree of strain, and the direction of the applied force. DAI has also been reported in patients with seizures of diverse etiology, stroke, hypoxia, or even the combination of all the above. DAI and its subtypes can occur anywhere from the cerebral cortex down through the brainstem. Typically the corticospinal tracts, cerebellar tracts, and tracts from the hippocampus are the most severely affected in DAI. The diagnosis of DAI is made largely by computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Diffusion-weighted imaging is also a sensitive method for detection of DAI. The treatment for DAI is supportive, and it has no effective pharmacological treatment. The possible prophylactic agents for DAI are corticosteroids. Recent studies with corticosteroid therapy have shown that the prophylactic use of steroids in mild brain trauma leads to faster recovery or a better clinical outcome with improvement in the cerebral oxygenation and an increase in the brain tissue oxygen saturation but had no adverse effects on intracranial pressure, and other secondary complications on the corticosteroid therapy. <EOD> .

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

Lacrimal Drainage Obstruction Disease Clinical Study of Using Dacryoendoscopy
===================

Detailed Description

Lacrimal Drainage Obstruction Disease Clinical Study of Using Dacryoendoscopy
===================

Dacryoendoscopy is a direct and non-invasive method for visualizing the lacrimal passage and distal nasolacrimal duct under direct vision. This study aimed to observe the efficacy of laser dacryoplasty with a silicone tube inserted into the nasolacrimal duct and compare the efficacy of one-side intubation and double silicone tubes with the same treatment under dacryoendoscopy.

Participation Criteria
================


Inclusion Criteria: (1) diagnosis of nasolacrimal duct obstruction or stenosis by dacryoendoscopic examination with or without radiologic confirmation on a dacryocystogram, (2) persistent or recurrent, unilateral, and symptomatic epiphora, and (3) follow-up over 12 months after intubation of the silicone tube. Exclusion Criteria: (1) incomplete or indeterminate radiologic assessment of the lacrimal passage; (2) congenital or traumatic lacrimal duct obstruction; (3) acute or chronic dacryocystitis; (4) lower eyelid malposition or laxity of sufficient severity to contribute to epiphora; (5) previous dacryocystorhinostomy, (6) incomplete medical records.

Study Protocol
============

The patients were evaluated with dacryoscopy, a diagnostic tool that uses a fiber endoscope. All endoscopic examination procedures conducted were performed by one doctor. Two physicians with experience in lacrimal surgery carried out all endoscopic examinations under local anesthesia. The procedure can be performed with topical anesthesia and mild sedation with an oral dose of diazepam. In cases of difficulty obtaining nasolacrimal duct intubation, a topical anesthetic was applied locally with the help of a cotton swab. The fiber endoscope was inserted into the lacrimal duct through the upper or lower lacrimal punctum. After removal of the fiber endoscope, the nasolacrimal duct was dilated with laser dacryoplasty (FOX diode laser, A.R.C. Laser, Nürnberg, Germany), and a silicone tube inserted into the lacrimal passage. Postoperative silicone stents were placed in the silicone tube lumen for unilateral patients. For patients with bilateral diseases, a soft silicone stent was placed into each nasolacrimal punctum following laser dacryoplasty in the affected eye, after which the patient used antibiotic eye drops for 7 days. The patient was asked to use topical antibiotic eye drops and corticosteroid eye drops for 2 weeks. After 2 to 4 weeks, the silicone tube underwent removal. The double silicone stent was completely removed at 2 weeks. The success rate was assessed using a Kaplan-Meier estimator, with a success event being defined as persistent epiphora or intubation failure. If the eyes could not be observed because of the absence of a cornea, the success rate was zero. Statistical analysis was performed using a t-test, with statistical significance set at 5%.

 <EOD> Prognosis in Patients with a Fever > 38℃ on Admission after an ICH

Background: Internal carotid artery (ICA) occlusion is most commonly caused by atherosclerotic disease and is not associated with a high risk of hemorrhagic transformation after intravenous thrombolysis. However, it has been reported that patients with an ICA occlusion had an increased risk of intracranial hemorrhagic events after they received intravenous thrombolysis. Thus, the use of imaging characteristics to identify patients with ICA occlusions before intravenous thrombolysis is very important. Purpose: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between ICA occlusions and the prognosis of patients with ICH after intravenous thrombolysis. Material and Methods: A total of 111 acute ICH patients with a fever > 38°C in our hospital and another six retrospectively collected ICH patients who had no fever were evaluated by CT and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and underwent intravenous thrombolysis using the ALIAS-4 randomized, multicenter, double-blind, clinical trial. Results: According to the findings of CT and MRA, four ICH patients had no carotid artery occlusions and seven ICH patients had an ICA occlusion. The prognosis were poor in patients with ICA occlusions, especially in the group of patients with an ICA occlusion plus carotid artery stenosis, and had a poor 3-month prognosis. Conclusion: We demonstrated that the prognosis of ICH patients with ICA occlusions was poor compared with those with no ICA occlusions. We also demonstrated that the prognosis of ICH patients with ICA occlusions plus ICA stenosis was poor. Therefore clinicians and researchers should pay more attention to the imaging characteristics of carotid arteries, particularly the imaging characteristics of the ICA, before intravenous thrombolysis to avoid worsening intracranial hemorrhage.

Because most ICH patients in China, including in the present study, have poor access to health care and hospital care, the fatality rate of patients with an ICH is even worse   Prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with intracerebral hemorrhage, Wei  . After patients with ICH were admitted to hospital, they received appropriate acute treatment, such as hypertonic dehydration, blood pressure control, and intravenous thrombolysis. It is important to determine whether intravenous thrombolysis is appropriate to receive or administer for an ICH patient with a fever > 38°C. Most studies showed that intravenous thrombolysis is associated with a reduction of 3-month case-fatality rate in patients with stroke   Intravenous thrombolysis for stroke in clinical practice, Brazzelli  .

DIVA refers to the difficulty of inserting or maintaining a vascular access. It is an intrinsic property of the vein, independent of the clinician. DIVA assessment is crucial for the choice of insertion technique and its management, in particular in patients with difficult vascular access (PVADI). The measurement should be done using a scale that will facilitate collection, management and analysis. The A-DIVA Scale is a validated scale for the assessment of the risk of DIVA. Clinical validation has demonstrated a good capacity to predict DIVA with a threshold at S(A-DIVA) >6/10 allowing to predict DIVA with reasonable reliabiliy (sensitivity : 90%, specificity: 84%). However, this score does not include data on the choice of insertion technique or management. This study therefore aims to develop and evaluate a care decision algorithm to improve the quality of peripheral venous catheter placement. The peripheral venous catheter is a frequently used device (n>75 million annually in the United-States) whose insertion and management are often difficult and prone to errors. This procedure requires specialized skills which are not always regularly mastered. In particular, the clinician must assess the risk of DIVA and adapt the technique used (number, anatomical site and choice of catheter) to the difficulty level in order to prevent insertion complications which are known to be the main cause of accidental death. In practice, a recent expert consensus has been published in French (2017) providing recommendations to improve the quality of access placement. However, there is a lack of tools for the assessment of the risk of DIVA to facilitate their use in all of the patients and for implementation in a routine clinical practice. The development of an algorithm to manage and perform the vascular puncture is a key step. The DIVA algorithm (ALCOV) aims to integrate the different care procedures to improve the quality of access placement. A multicentre, prospective and non-randomized study is proposed between April 2017 and March 2018 to assess the quality of puncture after the implementation of a decision algorithm based on the A-DIVA score and on the vascular punctuation. To date, in France, there is currently no standard for evaluating the quality of vascular perfusion. This study aims to develop and evaluate this standard.

Summary This study was done to investigate the effects of two antiglobulin sera on platelet function of fresh canine platelet concentrates. One antiglobulin serum (20 per cent goat anti-human Ig preparation) contained only antiplatelet antibodies (APA), while the other antiglobulin serum (5 per cent monospecific porcine anti-dog antibody) contained only antiplatelet globulin (APG). Both antiglobulins were compared with a control group that consisted of no serum addition. All additions were made to canine platelet concentrates prior to storage at 25 C. Platelet concentrates (2-ml aliquots) were mixed with 2 ml of saline or the two types of antiglobulins and were then placed in preheated (25 C) tubes. After one hour of incubation at 25 C the survival of the platelets was determined. No significant changes in platelet gluconeogenesis or platelet survival occurred in any of the groups studied. <EOD> Prevalence, distribution, and potential role of Borrelia species in Dermacentor marginatus and Rhipicephalus annulatus ticks from Romania

 <EOD> Focus on the future.
1. Introduction 1.1 Purpose of Study This study was conducted to better understand the factors affecting current and future participation of women and minority researchers in NIH–supported training programs. There are two principal reasons for wanting to obtain this understanding: To identify ways in which participation of women and minorities in training programs might be increased and to describe training programs in order to enable the reader to make appropriate judgments about which training programs might be appropriate for their interest. In the course of pursuing the former goal, it was often necessary to examine the overall participation of women and minority investigators, faculty members, and postdoctoral fellows in training programs. This information may also be useful to departments and other groups interested in increasing women and minority investigators in their own training programs. As part of this effort to better understand the factors affecting participation of women and minority investigators in training programs, we reviewed the literature of training programs related to health and medical sciences. What began as a literature search of training programs in health and medical science related to physicians, nurses, and health scientists resulted in a review of training programs in other areas, such as biomedical engineers, allied health professionals, and clinicians in other health professions. In essence, we found that there was a plethora of literature covering these different types of training programs and that it was impossible to describe the training programs relevant to one population within the context and constraints of another. We therefore have chosen to review training programs that have some relevance to the areas of women’s health, health disparities research, and community-oriented primary care. Further, we have included areas such as epidemiology that are relevant to both health disparities and training-based research. In addition to these training programs, we review the trends in the funding and participation of women and minorities in NIH research grants. NIH offers programs to improve training in minority institutions in order to strengthen the diversity of NIH’s training programs. However, NIH offers few training programs. This fact was confirmed by examining both the RFA-HD-00-001 and NIH Guide/GRAND Rounds. <EOD> Exogenous AMPK as a novel therapeutic approach to treat heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy

Heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy remain major healthcare problems, and effective therapies are needed. Studies have indicated that high levels of energy demand during hypertrophic growth necessitates increased fatty acid oxidation to produce ATP, whereas low level of fatty acid oxidation results in heart failure and mortality. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a sensor for cellular energy imbalance, which regulates multiple cardiac metabolic pathways to ensure energy supply for heart with hypertrophic growth. While AMPK is known as a cardiac protective enzyme, little information is available to support the use of AMPK as a therapeutic drug against failing heart. Recent studies have revealed several potential strategies for activating AMPK that may be beneficial for cardiac diseases, including pharmacological activation of AMPK by direct AMPK activators or indirect AMPK agonists and genetic modulation of AMPK. A few drugs have shown promise in clinical trials, and genetic manipulation of AMPK has provided valuable insight into therapeutic potential of AMPK. In this review, we will summarize both pharmacological and genetic strategies in the application of AMPK activation for prevention or treatment of cardiac diseases with particular focus on heart failure and cardiac hypertrophy.

788,"[/INST] A molecular analysis study of DCIS, LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia, focusing on the frequency of mutations and changes in expression of specific genes in these non-invasive breast tumor types.
This study has been archived by the Sloane Project, a collaboration between the NHS Breast Cancer Screening Programme and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), aimed at collecting and studying histological samples from DCIS, LCIS, and atypical hyperplasia. This archive study protocol was initially agreed between the Sloane Screening Project and the LSHTM and approved by a scientific board. Since May 2014, the Sloane Screening Project has been working independently.

### Study Overview

Between 1988 and 2005, women aged 50 to 64 were invited to take part in the Scottish Breast Screening Programme.  More than 1.2 million women were invited and 41% participated.

The study aim was to develop and make DNA and RNA samples available to researchers working in the area of breast cancer diagnosis.

Samples were collected from 1986 patients for the study and over 50% of those patients are expected to have DCIS, atypical hyperplasia or LCIS.

### Conditions for eligibility

Breast Cancer Screening Programme (BCSP) screening databases were used to select breast lesion cases for the study. Each lesion in the study was coded by histological type and an exact surgical excision was used.

Histological lesions were selected according to morphological criteria. The study excluded invasive breast cancers or invasive tumors of low grade. DCIS of a mixed type (such as co-existent intraductal and invasive breast carcinoma) was not used because there were insufficient numbers.

Patients with an existing personal history of invasive breast cancer were excluded. Cases with a family history of breast cancer and known BRCA mutations were also excluded.

### Study Plan

Each lesion from the breast surgical specimen was submitted to a pathology review at the NHS Pathology Regional Laboratory Service. Each lesion sample was then de-identified and sent to the study coordinator based at the LSHTM.

Each specimen was then given a number and a corresponding study record. Each patient from the study is given a unique identifier and a corresponding study number.

An initial screening review of all the lesion samples was carried out and cases were then sent to individual research laboratories for analysis.

Each sample received for analysis is given a study unique identifier.

The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the daily care of the frail elderly patients from outpatient care, including nursing homes (NH) to home care as a way to reduce the hospital overcrowding and the risk of the SARS-CoV-2 contamination. The NH have faced a dramatic situation: elderly fragile patients became very vulnerable to this virus infection. The main question in this special population was a risk of COVID-19 infection and the consequences of this contamination, notably the respiratory complications including the occurrence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The mortality of this population in NH is the subject of a meta-analysis published in 2021. The rate of infection in elderly patients in NH remains high whatever is the preventive measures taken. The consequences of COVID-19 infection seem less dramatic than in aged patients with other severe comorbidities. There is no convincing answer to the question of preventive or curative therapeutics. The question of vaccination for these aged patients seems more problematic. <EOD> .
UNLABELLED
The aim of this study was to observe effects of treatment by continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII).


METHODS
CSII was performed in three patients (two females and one male) with type 1 diabetes mellitus (age; 30.6 years on average) and poor glycemic control (fasting blood sugar 14.3+/-1.0mmol/L, postprandial blood sugar 18.4+/-4.6mmol/L). A blood sample test was conducted. Three items (insulin dose, complication, physical exercise) were studied with questionnaires.


RESULTS
Body weight did not change much. The mean change in HbA1c was from 9.0+/-0.5% to 7.8+/-0.5% at 3 months and to 7.4+/-0.4% at 6 months after the start of CSII. All three patients felt more physically active. CSII required greater effort in injecting insulin compared with self-dose, but they were able to continue with treatment.


CONCLUSIONS
The mean daily insulin dose of CSII fell from 76.0+/-39.1 units pre-treatment to 65.3+/-46.3 units post-treatment for three months. CSII would be a good option as treatment for some patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. <EOD> MALT1-DUB Activity Regulates B Cell Proliferation and PPARγ/RXRα-Mediated Metabolic Signaling during B Cell Activation

CD19 is an essential molecule for B cell activation. The BCR signaling pathways activated by CD19 are key to initiate B cell proliferation through the NFκB pathway and upregulation of genes involved in metabolic reprogramming including Cpt1a, Cd36, Pparg2, and Ucp2. These genes are regulated through PPARγ/ RXRα-mediated signaling. In this study, we show that the MALT1 protease DUB function promotes proliferation and is essential for B cell proliferation and metabolic gene expression mediated through PPARγ/RXRα-mediated signaling. After B lymphocyte activation with LPS, Malt1-deficient (Malt1 Δ/Δ ) mice exhibit significant hindered B cell proliferation, resulting in fewer splenic and bone marrow B cells from Malt1 Δ/Δ mice compared with WT mice. These Malt1 Δ/Δ B cells also exhibited increased expression of PPARγ coactivator 1α (Pgc-1α), CD36, and RXRα. Consistent with these phenotypes, MALT1-DUB-deficient (S278A) mice showed increased splenic and bone marrow B cells and decreased expression of RXRα and metabolic targets. Adoptively transferred Malt1 Δ/Δ B cells generated splenic B cells less efficiently compared with the transferred WT B"

Clinical Study of Ginkgo Kinonate Tablets in Diabetes Related Dementia
 <EOD> Bidirectional regulation of oligodendrocyte precursor cell migration by cyclic nucleotides and Ca2+.
Both cAMP- and cGMP-modulated phosphodiesterases (PDEs) play critical roles in controlling cell motility and in modulating extracellular signals to affect the migration of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). The present study was performed to further examine the temporal relationship of the effects of these signaling pathways on OPC motility and determine whether these pathways can influence OPC migration independently. Our results show that OPCs treated with 8-bromo-cGMP (8-BCG) or the cGMP analog 8-propanol-cGMP (8-CPT-cGMP) exhibit increased cell migration, whereas inhibition of guanylyl cyclases with 1H-oxadiazoloquinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) or treatment of OPCs with the phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor sildenafil reduced OPC motility. Similarly, cell migration was enhanced by elevating calcium with ionomycin or by using the cell-permeable calcium chelator BAPTA-AM in association with EGTA or in the complete absence of Ca2+. In contrast, lowering intracellular free Ca2+ with the Ca(2+)-channel blockers SK&F96365 and verapamil or the Ca2+ transporter inhibitor EGTA reduced OPC motility. The opposing effects of 8-BCG and ionomycin on OPC motility were confirmed independently using a second type of migration assay that involved the exposure of single cells to a gradient of laminin (LN) or EGF. These results suggest that both the cGMP and Ca2+ signaling pathways play important biphasic roles in modulating OPC migration. These data suggest that the regulation of OPC motility occurs through a novel bidirectional mechanism involving both second messengers, cyclic nucleotides, and calcium. <EOD> Conserved Rpo41-dependent noncoding snoRNA antisense to U2 snRNA is essential for RNA polymerase II transcription of U6 spliceosomal snRNA gene in fission yeast

In eukaryotes, spliceosomal snRNA genes are organized in clusters. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, U6 is the most 5 0 5 0 to the U2 gene. We have isolated and characterized three noncoding sense and anti-sense RNAs in the U2-U6 gene region, all transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Their expression is dependent on Rpo41-associated transcription termination factor, which binds to 4 bp and 5 bp motifs localized in the intergenic regions. Rpo41 is an evolutionarily conserved component of RNA polymerase II and III of S.pombe. In the absence of the noncoding RNAs, both U2 and U6 snRNA genes are downregulated in total RNA, as well as in nuclear and nascent transcript fractions. Moreover, U2-U6 snRNA levels are reduced after actinomycin D treatment, consistent with a role for U6 antisense RNA (asU6) in U6 snRNA regulation. Upregulation of U2 and U6 snRNA genes upon RNA polymerase I transcription inhibition suggests competition between RNA polymerase II and I for limiting amounts of Rpo41. These results show that both sense and noncoding RNAs transcribed by RNA polymerase II exert a positive regulatory influence on gene function in the U2-U6 snRNA gene cluster of fission yeast and they demonstrate the evolutionary conservation of snRNA gene organization and expression.

# Introduction
The study of electroencephalographic (EEG) activity provides objective measures of brain activity. EEG is commonly recorded from scalp electrodes to monitor brain electrical activity. Because the signal can easily be affected by movement, most standard EEG electrodes are affixed only temporary. However, some patients need chronic EEG recordings. This study is an investigation of an alternative method for scalp electrode attachment that minimizes movement artifacts and decreases skin injuries.

# Results
Due to the location of this recording on the forehead, the application of an adhesive patch with adhesive would result in skin abrasion on removal of the adhesive. To address this, we developed an attachment method in which a conductive tattoo of silver powder embedded in a gel carrier (BioTrace, Innovative Research of Atlanta, GA, USA) is used for chronic EEG electrodes (51+/− 5 mV peakto peak). This gel carrier with the conductive particles can be handled like any other skin adhesive (e.g., Nexcare Bandage) and the electrode can be attached and removed easily. We have recently used this method for recording chronic EEG of patients with epilepsy for over 12 months.

# Conclusions
This tattoo method of electrode attachment minimizes movement artifacts. It also decreases skin reactions commonly occur when using EEG electrodes.

The influence of antiprogestins on the rat uterus during its pregnancy-related development was investigated in the early gestation periods by using a model system based on the concept of ""stages of uterine development"". In comparison with intact females, the antiprogestins, mifepristone (RU-486), onapristone (ZK-98299), quinoxaciam (ZK-136.210), and Y-287, given orally, decreased the weight of the uterus and its capacity for water and ions and inhibited their estrogen-induced stimulation in non-pregnant animals. It is shown that mifepristone (as a competitive inhibitor of corticosteroid receptors), onapristone (as a mixed competitive/noncompetitive inhibitor of glucocorticoid and progestin receptors), and quinoxaciam (as a mixed competitive receptor-occupying ligand) inhibit the progesterone (both locally produced and exogenously administered), estradiol and LH-stimulated rat uterine growth in non-pregnant animals. The non-competitive antiprogestin, Y-287 (i.p. administered) increased, dose-dependently, the weight of the uterus of adult virgin rats, while this dose-dependent antiprogesterone effect was not observed in the uterus of non-pregnant rats, indicating that the effect of Y-287 is different from the effects exerted by the above mentioned antiprogestins. Thus, in comparison with the other antiprogestins, Y-287 stimulated and not inhibited the uterine growth of non-pregnant animals in a dose- and in a time-dependent mode.

# Introduction and Overview
========================

### Rationale

[1]Prophylactic central neck dissection (PCND) has been performed since the 1960s, originally for patients with clinically apparent occult papillary or anaplastic thyroid cancers.  The benefit of PCND is to minimize treatment failure from cervical lymph node metastasis.  However, several retrospective analyses have indicated that PCND is associated with impaired thyroid status (e.g., lower levels of triiodothyronine and free thyroxine) and with increased morbidity.  Moreover, a large randomized controlled trial study reported that PCND is associated with increased incidence of permanent hypoparathyroidism.  Therefore, the routine performance of PCND for differentiated thyroid carcinoma is only recommended at few specialized high volume institutions.

### Rationale Background
 
PCND might be helpful in those with positive nodes for the following reasons: 
- PCND and radiofrequency ablation (RFA) could decrease the risk of subclinical central lymph node metastases recurrence or metastases from occult papillary microcarcinomas - PCND and/or RFA could potentially lower recurrence in selected patients with a low volume of metastatic foci

### Pre-Trial Studies
 
In a multi-center retrospective study on patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma, the incidence of hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia increased significantly in those who received PCND.  However, PCND did not improve recurrence-free survival or overall survival.  Therefore, we propose a prospective randomized study to compare rates of recurrence and disease-free survival between patients with papillary thyroid cancer who do and who do not undergo PCND.

### Inclusion and exclusion criteria
 
The eligibility criteria will be determined, as follows:


### Study Objectives
 
The primary objective is to determine the long-term outcomes of PCND, such as the 5-year rate of recurrence, the 5-year rate of DFS, and the cumulative 10-year rate of recurrence compared with that of DFS.

### Study Hypothesis
 
Preoperative ultrasonography with fineneedle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is routinely used to diagnose thyroid nodules, and is currently considered diagnostic for cytologically proven papillary thyroid carcinoma.  There is little evidence that shows the prevalence of occult papillary carcinoma in cases where ultrasonography findings are negative. It is recommended that PCND should be used for patients with suspicious clinical features or with positive FNAB results. However, there is no consensus on the treatment of cN0 papillary thyroid cancer or low-risk cN0 papillary thyroid carcinoma. 
Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis:
H0: The rate of recurrence is identical for the papillary thyroid carcinoma and prophylactic central neck dissection (PCND) treatment groups.

### Outcomes
 
The primary outcome measures are as follows:
- The 5-year rate of excellent response based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Thyroid Cancer Guidelines


[2] 
- The 5-year rate of disease-free survival (DFS). 

### Efficacy
 
1) Primary outcome: The 5-year rate of excellent response


[3]

2) Secondary outcomes:
- The 2-year rate Recurrence free survival


[3]
3) Other secondary outcomes:
- Disease-free survival in the long-term follow-up


[3]
- Overall survival


[3]

### Safety
 
1) Primary: The rate of recurrent nerve palsy


[3]
2) Secondary: Mortality


[3]
3) Other secondary:
- Incidence of symptomatic hyperparathyroidism

- The rate of permanent hypoparathyroidism

Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme hydrolyses acetylcholine (ACh) in the synapse terminal leading the nerve impulse and its subsequent signal transduction of the nervous system. AChE can be targeted because of the important role of acetylcholinesterase in nervous transmission and various neurodysfunctions have been noticed with its malfunction. The present review describes the structure, functions, inhibitors and its role of acetylcholinesterase in pathological conditions, including Alzheimer’s disease, myasthenia gravis, myopathy, sleep disorders, Parkinson’s disease, and poisoning. Some of the inhibitors and their mechanism of action are also discussed. The AChE inhibition has been found to be useful in the cases of central nervous system (CNS) disorders. AChE inhibitors have shown to improve the memory in Alzheimer’s patients. This activity could indicate that the use of these AChEinhibitors as drugs to improve cognition. Thus, acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are still important candidates in the treatment of various neurological disorders. <EOD> Intrathoracic pheochromocytoma: A rare tumor with unique features
The present study assessed the clinicopathologic findings in three cases of intrathoracic pheochromocytomas that were diagnosed in 1998 to 2008. To identify characteristics that differed from previous reports, we reviewed previous reports and identified a total of 34 cases. Of the 26 reported cases that had sufficient data on computed tomography (CT), 13 (50%) featured a predominantly cystic component that had solid patches or nodules as detected by imaging studies. An intraoperative review of the CT images for a solitary case revealed a tumor with a ground-glass attenuation area that suggested a lipid component. Based on the CT scan images of all the cases, the tumors were divided into two categories: solid and mixed tumors. Among the solid tumors, no case showed a lipid component or had calcification; however, among the mixed tumors, most cases contained lipid and calcification. Four cases of the mixed tumors originated from the adrenal gland. Interestingly, the patient who underwent preoperative diagnosis had normal blood pressure and noradrenalin levels. The other cases had blood pressure or noradrenalin levels that were markedly elevated. Our results suggested that in some cases, it was difficult to differentiate intrathoracic pheochromocytomas from other tumors on the basis of the imaging scan findings alone, and careful perioperative management was necessary to avoid serious complications. <EOD> A new classification for the surgical treatment of anterior shoulder dislocation--the role of the soft tissues. CORRONI classification.
BACKGROUND
Different surgical techniques to treat anterior shoulder dislocations with soft-tissue injury are described in detail in the literature. No classification that defines the level of surgical damage and that can be correlated with the surgical technique actually exists. This work aims to develop a classification to identify the type of surgery to perform based on the type of soft-tissue injury.


METHODS
A total of 56 shoulders from 50 male patients (aged 26 to 72 years; mean, 36 years) with isolated anterior shoulder dislocation were prospectively treated by two different surgeons. Patients were allocated to one of four grades (CORRONI classification): C, labrum and capsule injured; R, joint capsule injured; O, biceps and subscapularis detached; and N, other structures injured. Four surgical techniques were used: arthroscopic capsular refixation (C), capsular refixation associated with rotator cuff (RCB) surgery, RCB associated with an arthroplasty, or open capsulectomy. At 6 months postoperatively, the range of motion, the presence of pain, the modified University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) score, the Simple Shoulder Test score, and patient satisfaction were assessed.


RESULTS
The preoperative range of motion and the UCLA score were not significantly different among the four grades of injury. Significant differences were noted preoperatively"

Simian foamy virus (SFV) is a retrovirus distantly related to human foamy viruses (HFV) and has been isolated from a broad range of Old World primate species. Despite the isolation of multiple strains of SFV, its pathogenesis is undefined and its natural host has not been identified. We infected rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) orally, intramuscularly, or intravenously with simian foamy virus and followed the course of infection for 8 months. Animals infected by any of the routes developed marked increases in viremia within 1 week of infection. Infection progressed to high levels of viremia by 2 months and resulted in seroconversion within 4 months. Virus was detected in the lungs, spleen, and liver, but not other tissues. Viremia fluctuated in all animals through the course of infection, with no consistent correlation to lymphocyte subset responses. Virus was also transmitted from experimentally infected dams to their infants by ingestion. This study of rhesus macaques shows that SFV establishes persistent virus infection in a natural host and that acquisition of virus by the infant rhesus macaque occurs via the common nonhuman diet route. Similar to human foamy virus infection of humans, SFV infection in the macaque induces viral serum antigens that cross‐react with immunosorbent assays developed for human HFV. <EOD> Nomenclature of congenital muscular torticollis. Historical review and diagnostic proposal.
Congenital muscular torticollis (CMT) describes a malformation in which the muscles acting the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius rotate and shorten one of the cervical vertebrae. Its cause (anterior or posterior) and the age of manifestation are also important, but are rarely included in the literature. For this reason, the author reviewed the CMT literature and proposed a nomenclature of CMT based on the main characteristics of its lesions. The terms CMT and cervical muscular dystonia are proposed, and a complete classification with several subtypes is suggested. <EOD> A Proactive Assessment-Based Model of the Psychology of Terrorism: Predicting Future Vigilance towards Terrorism

Since 9/11, there have been repeated acts of terrorism in the United States, and many more globally. Given that terrorists attack in order to instill fear, the study of fear and other negative emotion is an important subfield of terrorism studies. Fear has received substantial attention in predicting psychological responses to terrorism. This research has identified several cognitive antecedents of fear, but has not yet addressed whether individual differences in cognition influence future vigilance for terrorism. We developed and tested a model of the psychology of terrorism that integrates past, state of knowledge, and future terrorism threat perceptions as antecedents of vigilance as well as cognitive antecedents. Our hypotheses were supported by structural equation modeling predicting vigilance across 11 months, with state of knowledge and future terrorism threat perceptions as the most important individual cognitive predictors. The findings demonstrate that a model integrating state of knowledge, past, and future terrorism threat perceptions as well as cognitive antecedents is more effective in predicting vigilance than past research based on a terrorism events approach. The results also indicate that vigilance is stable over time and influenced by a relatively small number of psychological variables, which are therefore plausible targets for intervention programs. We discuss the implications for policy makers.

# Introduction
In 1986, Eric Holtzworth (known in psychology as ""Holtzworth-Munroe"") and Robert J. Cialdini presented an influential theory of what they called the psychology of fear   The psychology of fear and stress, Holtzworth-Munroe  . They identified three major stages for the development of fear. First, an initial situation (i.e., a threat to the self or others) must occur, after which a person may have a basic, physical reaction. Second, when the danger is still present, then conscious reasoning attempts to understand the situation, and evaluate the danger to either the self or others. In their description of third stage of the process, ""rational or cognitive responses to fear"", a person may consciously attempt to reduce fear. This effort"

Some heterocyclic compounds, among them oxadiazines 1, and thiadiazoles 2 have shown excellent antitumor activity. Here we report a modified synthesis of 1-(4-(arylamino)benzoyl)pyridin-2(1H)-ones (4) 1 and 1-(4-(phenylamino)benzoyl) 1,8-naphthyridin-3(2H)-ones (5) 3 from amino acids and 1,8-naphthyridin-3(2H)-one (3). Reaction of 4 and 5 with chloroacyl chlorides gave O-acyl enaminonaphthyridines (6a-c, 7a-f) and 4-aryl-N-acyl-1,8naphthyridine-3-carboxamides (8a-c, 9) as potent anticancer agents. The structures were confirmed by IR, NMR, mass spectra and elemental analyses. All compounds were screened for their antiviral activity against HSV-1 (KOS) and HIV-1 (IIIB: p24 gag antigen). Compounds 4b, 4c, 5b, 5c, 6b, 7c, and 7e showed significant activities against HSV-1 at nontoxic concentrations, while 4d, 4e, 5d, 5e, 6d and 6f were more potent against HIV-1. The most potent compound in the series turned out to be a naphthyridinone (5c) and benzoxadiazine derivative (4c). These two compounds also showed antitumor activity against MCF-7 (5d; MCF = Mammary Fibroadenoma), MDA-MB-231 (5c), HepG-2 (6c; liver), and Hela (4d, 5e). The antiviral and antitumor activities support use of these 1,8-naphthyridine derivatives as potential anti-cancer and anti-AIDS drugs.

 <EOD> Effects of D-4F on carotid plaque progression. The A-LARA project.
OBJECTIVE
Carotid atherosclerosis develops through inflammation, which can be targeted by anti-inflammatory drugs such as D-4F, an apolipoprotein A-I molecule mimetic. We assessed the impact of D-4F on the progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT), the degree of inflammation, and plaque burden.


METHODS
A double-blind, randomized trial of 547 dyslipidemic patients at high cardiovascular risk (Caucasians, aged 18 to 75 years) allocated to receive either D-4F supplementation (50-mg oral dose/day) (n = 272) or placebo (n = 275) over 3 years. IMT was measured at baseline and every year (Carimas software). At baseline and every year, C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum levels of the inflammatory adhesion molecules soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and soluble E-selectin were also measured. In a retrospective analysis, changes in IMT, CRP, and inflammatory adhesion molecules and mean carotid atherosclerotic plaque area were compared by group.


RESULTS
High IMT baseline values were more frequent in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). After adjustment for baseline values, D-4F was associated with lower changes in atherosclerotic lesions"

Pilot Study of a Multimodal Tele-rehabilitation Consisting of Therapeutic Education and Immersive Virtual Reality Exercises in Patients with Chronic Non-Specific Neck Pain: Feasibility and usability <EOD> Excited state hydrogen transfer mechanisms within chromophore-biopolymer complexes and aggregates.
The dynamics of excited state intramolecular electron transfer (ET) have been extensively investigated, both experimentally and theoretically. ET involves the breaking down of conjugated systems of biomolecules and/or organic chromophores which could be linked by hydrogen bonding within biomolecules, and the recombination process of molecules in their excited state. There is clear evidence that hydrogen transfer processes, and the related quantum yields (pHysc), vary considerably when biomolecule-dye complexes are transferred to the solid state from the solution phase. A large number of dye-biopolymer and dye-protein systems have been measured and most of them are well understood in terms of the relevant mechanisms of the ET reaction. Therefore, it is clear that the excited state hydrogen transfer mechanisms within these biomolecules are affected by the local surrounding environment. In this review we examine the effects of local environments on ET within the biological molecules. On the other hand, dye-protein system can be modelled as aggregates. We investigate the effects of the aggregation of proteins and the aggregation of biomolecule-dye complexes on their excited state hydrogen transfer. <EOD> Tailored multicomposite nanoshells that act remotely
A nanocarrier with a shell designed for a specific environment In drug delivery, it is critical to have an adequate payload delivery system that can be easily controlled. Most small molecule drugs for cancer, for example, rely on chemotherapeutic agents that are toxic only at high doses (1). Thus, nanocarriers for these compounds are often needed (2). The materials employed need to be stable in the body, but also capable of releasing their cargo in the tumor tissue (3). Dai et al. developed a nanocarrier strategy that relied on tailoring a multicomposite shell to suit the conditions in different environments (see the Perspective by Lee). The core of the construct was stable in serum but able to shrink under acidic conditions. The shell itself could be made of either silica or gold or both and the multicomposite properties determined by the specific combination of these materials in the system. Science, this issue p. 1386; see also p. 1357 Silica and gold multicomposite shell material is engineered using tailored interfaces to selective environments.  Science, this issue p. 1357; see also p. 1386 Bottom-up design of stable multicomposite nanoshells with the ability to shrink under an acidic condition, allowing triggered release of their payloads. <EOD> Antibody reagents for flow cytometric measurement of human T and natural killer lymphocyte subsets.
Three direct immunofluorescence reagents for human T cells and natural killer cells (NK cells) and two direct immunofluorescence and three immunoenzymatic reagents for B lymphocytes were evaluated for their use together in the development of an assay that simultaneously measures total (T and B) and non-T, non-B lymphocytes (NK and T cells) in whole blood and peripheral blood leukocyte fractions. All reagents stained cells and lymphocyte subsets with the exception of a mouse monoclonal antibody reagent (UCHT1-FITC) for T cell CD3 antigens which did not stain B cells. The percentages of cells and lymphocyte subsets stained by reagents were similar to those stained by comparable indirect immunofluorescence reagents. The combination of two flow cytometric assays, one involving receptors for the Fc portion of the third IgG class called FcRII (CD32), and a second involving a pan-NK cell receptor that can be blocked with the monoclonal antibody anti-Leu 11 or anti-CD16, was used to identify NK cells in blood samples. These two assays yielded reproducible results when used together on a flow cytometer. Assays involving UCHT1-"

 <EOD> Cytosolic pH determines sensitivity to serum kinetics in murine dendritic cells.
Dendritic cell phenotype and function are greatly dictated by the cell's microenvironment. In this study, the importance of the intracellular pH (pH(i)) in influencing expression of cell-surface markers, cytokine production, and T-cell priming by dendritic cells (DC) was investigated. Cocultured splenic murine DC were evaluated for their expression of surface markers and production of IL-6, IL-12p70, MCP-1, or IDO after stimulation with LPS or anti-CD40 in the presence of physiologically acidic pH(i: 6.7 or 7.2). The cytosolic pH, expression of costimulatory molecules, and T-cell reactivity were determined by flow cytometry and T-cell proliferation assay. An acidic pH(i) resulted in the expression of a more immature phenotype (CD40(-), CD80(-), CD86(low)) with greater capability to induce MCP-1, IL-6, IL-12p70, and IDO production and more effectively primed T cells. When pH(i) was increased to a physiological pH(i: 7.2), cell surface antigen expression and cytokine production was down-regulated. The TLR4 agonist LPS, a more acute and transient stimulus when compared with anti-CD40, triggered a more mature phenotype (CD80(-), CD86(+)) with less MCP-1, IL-12p70, and IDO production but still induced IL-6 and CD86 up-regulation at physiological pH(i), thereby suggesting that the kinetics of the stimulus may be an important determinant of expression of DC maturation that is influenced by pH(i). The DC phenotype at physiological pH(i) may be ideal for immune tolerance induction. <EOD> Exposure of Tissue to Subatmospheric Pressure Alters the Differentiation of Human Tendon Cells.
PURPOSE
This paper investigated the effect of subatmospheric pressure (SAP) on the differentiation of human tendon cells (HT) by use of a previously validated bioengineering model.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Pig tibialis anterior (TA) tendons were placed in a culture plate chamber with a pneumatic pump for exposure to SAP. An air permeable polyester membrane served as a barrier between the TA tendon and SAP. HT were seeded onto PET membrane sheets under two different culture conditions: (1) no SAP, (2) SAP (200 mm Hg) for 10 minutes. Gene expression was quantified via qRT-PCR for Collagen I, 1, Collagen III (COL3), Collagen VI (COL6), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) and Tenascin (TNC), proteoglycan synthesis was quantified using Alcian Blue stain, and extracellular matrix (ECM) protein composition was evaluated by western blotting.


RESULTS
HT cultured under SAP demonstrated significant increases in the expression of COL1, COL3, COL6, VEGF, TNC, and a large increase in ECM proteoglycan synthesis, but did not show an increase in cell differentiation.


CONCLUSIONS
SAP application altered the differentiation of HT and the ability of HT to form a strong ECM via cellular changes. This indicates a potential therapeutic target of SAP treatment to modulate the ECM in diseases such as chronic tendinopathy. <EOD> On the Interpretation of the Eosinophil Count in Respiratory Tract Infections

Input Text: SALT for Liver Cirrhosis With HCC

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Heoatocellular carcinoma (HCC) ranks sixth in the incidence of malignant tumors and fourth in case fatality in the world. In China, liver cancer deaths account for the second largest cause of all cancer deaths. Surgical resection of liver cancer is still the main treatment, but the five-year survival rate is only 50%-70%. Liver transplantation can remove tumours and the underlying liver disease at the same time, and has become an important means for the radical treatment of liver cancer. Liver transplantation for liver cancer is a tortuous process. The original intention of liver transplantation was to treat unresectable liver cancer, but due to the high recurrence rate and metastasis rate of postoperative tumors, many centers list liver cancer as a contraindication to liver transplantation. In 1996, Mazzaferro et al. proposed the Milan criteria, and patients with liver cancer patients has a 4-year survival rate of 85% after liver transplantation. However, the Milan criteria was too strict and excluded a large number of patients with liver cancer who were likely to survive for a long time through liver transplantation. Therefore, the UCSF standard was proposed in 2001, and the small relaxation was made on the basis of the Milan criteria, and the survival rate was similar to the Milan criteria. In China, hepatitis B virus infection accounts for the vast majority of liver cancer patients, and the race, liver cancer incidence and treatment concept are different from European and American countries, and many factors indicate that it is urgent to formulate liver transplantation criteria that meet China's national conditions. In 2006, Norwegian scholars proposed a new surgical method, that is, resection and partial liver segment 2-3 transplantation with delayed total hepatectomy (RAPID) . This approach allows transplantation of the left liver (segments 2+3) to an adult recipient, while the remaining enlarged right hemi-liver is transplanted to another adult recipient, effectively avoiding some unsuitable left lateral lobe livers for pediatric recipients to be wasted. Recipients who received right-hemi-liver transplantation had a similar prognosis compared with those who received whole-liver transplantation. Therefore, if the RAPID technique is confirmed to be feasible, it can greatly alleviate the shortage of liver donors. In addition to cadaver sources, living adult donors can also be considered as the source of liver donors. A smaller left lateral lobe donor liver also places less burden on the donor than a left or right hemi-liver. To sum up, our center proposed and designed a clinical study of sequential adult left lateral lobe liver transplantation (SALT) in the treatment of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC based on clinical surgical experience. On the basis of RAPID surgery, the overall survival rate of patients with liver cirrhosis with HCC was evaluated by SALT.

[/END] <EOD> Diagnosis and Treatment of Puerperal Sepsis

DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT OF PUE RIPERAL SEPSIS. (The first of the following two articles appeared as the leader of the Journal, October 2.)
In a very interesting article by the late Dr. J. S. Billings1 on septic inoculation of the genital tract, there is no mention of the condition known as puerperal sepsis. And the reason of this is to-day of importance.
Some of the most recent and most prominent teachings regard the puerperal infection as secondary in origin. This theory, or rather the teachings, are not new. In the year 1696, Dr. William Harvey published a treatise as to the origin of the child bathed in the mother's blood by the placenta, in which he said, ""Therefore the woman's blood must infect the child, and by the contact thereof imitating the poisons of the venomous serpents or of other poisonous creatures, must have an infectious, poisonous quality, as hath been taught by some philosophers.""
A few words on the first named treatise and then I have but a few words to say in closing.
There are two types of puerperal sepsis, one of which seems to be a secondary, that, caused by the entrance of septic material into the uterine cavity at delivery, and the other seems to be a primary infection, which is, and has been ever since that time, of most difficult discernment. In either state, the condition seems due to defects in the general or abdominal wall. These may be due to rupture of the uterine walls at delivery, or in the unskillful performance of the forceps, or they may be due, it this country, to lack of the sterile covering of the abdomen, to the nonuse of the sterilized hand, to improper nursing, or the neglect in regard to toilet of the genital parts, the use of unclean dressings, a septic atmosphere and so forth.
In the primary state, the toxines are supposed to pass through the wall of some of the minor pelvic organs, or the ureter.
Those that agree in this regard hold that the condition known in the States as "" puerperal sepsis,"" or peritonitis after delivery, is due to a toxaemia, or toxaplasmia, and in the majority of cases this condition is supposed to be a mild form or grade of general septicaemia.
All agree on the facts; that women are more liable to puerperal sepsis, or septic infection at or after delivery than any class of people on the globe; that puerperal sepsis has been practicable from the dawn of medicine; that many and many a time has the death of women in childbirth been attributed to sepsis in the delivery of the child, to the lochial flux, or other uterine discharges; that notwithstanding all that we know, puerperal fever and septicaemia still carries away its terrible toll upon the human family.
When we turn to the history of puerperal sepsis and attempt to follow the medical writers of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, we find that the teaching of the day was not indefinite in regard to this disease or condition of women after child-birth, and we know that the first text-book published in America was by Dr. William Channing of the medical class, of Harvard University. This was in 1785. It was a translation of the writings of the renowned and brilliant Dr. John H.
Macleish of London.
In the chapter headed, ""Inflammation of the Posterior Capsula, or Extensive Peritonitis or Perimetritis,"" he says, ""It is well known that we may very often observe after parturition, that the patient not only exhibits an acute pain in the abdomen, with febrile motion; but that in a few days, or even hours, there is a sudden change in the disease. Instead of the acute, active state, with high fever, pain in the abdomen, and quick pulse, we have the pain, increased in severity, yet with loss of flesh and fever ; in fact, a state of suffering, which"

It is now widely accepted that ventilatory-induced diaphragmatic motion may be assessed non-invasively by means of ultrasound. The extent of diaphragmatic motion is usually expressed in terms of the so-called diaphragmatic excursion. Recently, there has been much discussion and speculation about the best methods of measuring diaphragmatic motion. Diaphragmatic excursion can conveniently be measured in both the cranio-caudal and transverse directions although the relationship between the two may not always be linear. However, many authors choose to express diaphragmatic motion as the cranio-caudal excursion. However, it is not entirely obvious why this should be or whether one cranio-caudal excursion is the same from study to study or is even the same for any two breaths in the same subject. This paper describes a system of analysis that allows one to calculate end-expiratory lung volume (EEV) from diaphragmatic excursion and the diaphragm location. When this procedure has been used to study 56 normal subjects in whom EEV could be measured with plethysmography and computed tomography, a linear correlation between all three measurements was observed. This procedure therefore allows one to calibrate diaphragmatic excursion measurements and also allows the end-expiratory volume to be calculated with high accuracy for individuals or study groups. This procedure therefore goes some way to standardize diaphragmatic excursions for different subjects, in the same subject at different times, and allows different studies to be compared to each other. It is thus an interesting method with wide applications. <EOD> The Influence of Pain Anxiety Severity on Pain Perception in the Early Stages of Labor

Background:Increasing our knowledge about pain perception during the first stage of labor is essential for developing evidence-based tools for pain management. Objectives: The purposes of this study were to explore the relationship between pain anxiety and two kinds of pain intensity sensations in normal subjects. Patients and Methods: This descriptive-correlational study was conducted in 2014 on 100 primiparous women, who referred to a hospital for childbirth in central Tehran. Pain anxiety (Pain Anxiety Symptom Scale) and pain intensity sensation (VAS and McGill pain questionnaire) were evaluated. Data were analyzed by descriptive statistics, Chi-square test, independent t test, paired t test, Pearson correlation coefficient, and linear regression test, using SPSS software (ver. 20). A significance level of P < 0.05 was adopted. Results: The mean age of the participants, gestational age, and baby weight were 27.69 ± 2.12 years, 38.08 ± 2.47 weeks, and 3,150.03 ± 478.71 g, respectively. The mean of pain anx"

Mastectomy and axillary dissection surgery is among the most frequently performed surgeries today, and pain control is an important problem affecting patient comfort in the postoperative period. Successful postoperative analgesia occurs in the patient due to pain, it is a known fact that it prevents many of the effects such as not being able to breathe easily and delayed mobilization.
Postoperative pain and analgesia following breast surgery can benefit from nerve block techniques. Ultrasound (US) guided serratus posterior superior block (SPSIPB) is a regional neural block defined by in 2023. It is based on injection on the serratus posterior superior muscle at the level of the 2nd or 3rd rib. This block provides analgesia in conditions such as interscapular pain, chronic myofascial pain syndromes, scapulocostal syndrome, and shoulder pain.
SPSIPB is performed in the lateral position, the serratus posterior superior muscle is visualized with an ultrasound probe. After determining the appropriate location with landmarks, the US probe will be covered with a sterile sheath, and a block needle will be inserted into the serratus posterior suture layer through the skin. After the needle tip is confirmed in the region of interest, 3-4 ml of 1% lidocaine solution is injected to confirm the space. Then, 25-30 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine injection is performed.
In a randomized controlled study, 40 female patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification I -II who were scheduled for mastectomy and axillary dissection surgery were included. The primary aim of the study is to compare the postoperative pain scores. The secondary aim is to evaluate the use of rescue analgesics, block-related complications, dermatome level, and side effects (allergic reaction, nausea, vomiting) associated with opioid use, which is one of the most commonly used analgesics. This study was completed in 2021. The study was completed before publishing, and a complete scientific article is planned to be published in the summer of 2022.
The goal of this study is to investigate the efficacy of serratus posterior superior interfascial plane block (SPSIPB) on the postoperative pain scores. The secondary aim of this study is to understand the effect of postoperative analgesia management with SPSIPB on the total analgesic consumption, and evaluate postoperative block-related complications.

Input Text: Preoperative Evaluation of the Breast with Dual View Radiography and Spectral Imaging

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description

As an exploratory study, the study plans to conduct another imaging using contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) 4-6 hours after the routine iodinated contrast-enhanced mammography and spot magnification mammography (SM3D ) with dual-view radiography. So as to explore whether the use of dual-view technology can improve the diagnostic value of CESM for breast disease. As an exploratory study, this study plans to explore the optimal time for delayed imaging. It is expected that it will be possible to obtain additional imaging information in the late phase, which will improve the confidence of the diagnosis.
Study Purpose
==================
In comparison to the diagnostic results obtained by the radiologist by reviewing only the conventional low-energy subtraction images, the purpose of this study is to explore whether CESM-DD improves the accuracy and confidence of diagnosis to provide an optimal time for the delayed phase imaging by further exploration of the effect of delayed imaging method (conventional low-energy subtraction images versus conventional low-energy subtraction images and late subtraction images).

Four years post heart transplantation, patients had higher concentrations of triglycerides (mean of 2.11) in comparison to pre-transplantation (1.50) while triglycerides did not change significantly in healthy people (1.47). This leads to the question whether triglycerides play a role in the transplant rejection and/or may be increased by immune supplementation.

# Abstract
-----------
Heart recipients had decreased graft survival rates (63%) compared with the healthy control (70%) after four years of investigation. However, there was no significant correlation between dyslipidemia and low left ventricular ejection fraction on heart transplantation day or four years later. No significant difference in lipotoxicity and PCSK9 concentrations was observed.

# Introduction
-----------
Dyslipidemia is a pathological condition, characterized by higher concentration of triglycerides, free fatty acids and apolipoprotein B and by low concentrations of high-density lipoproteins. Moreover, chylomicrons are formed by dietary fat and transport in blood.

# Conclusion
 <EOD> The B cell receptor regulates expression of surface CD45 by affecting the stability of CD45m in T and B cells

CD45, a receptor-type tyrosine phosphatase, which inactivates kinase activator(Garcia-Cozar et al., 1996)and dephosphorylates the Fc receptor (Lieberman et al., 1996), is an important molecule for normal T and B cell functions. However, its physiological regulation is still unclear. We report here that surface CD45 was remarkably increased by stimulation with a surface form of anti-IgM antibody (anti-sIgM), anti-CD19 as well as anti-TCR a/p (a/p, anti-Tll, 213/16) mAbs in B cells but not in T cells. This increase occurred within 1 h of stimulation and was maintained for >4 h. The increase was not inhibited by tunicamycin, which inhibits the processing and maturation of the CD45m, the trans-Golgi-derived intracellular form of CD45, suggesting that the intracellular processing and maturation of CD45m were not affected by these stimuli. The stimulation with anti-TCR a/p mAb affected only the expression levels of CD45, but its activation and IL-2 expression were unchanged. Therefore, it is likely that T cells may use a different regulatory mechanism than that of B cells for regulating CD45 surface expression, suggesting that the antibody stimulation may have had an affect on both the transportation of CD45 to the cell surface and the degradation of CD45m. Therefore, we suggest that BCR and TCR mediated antibody stimulation regulates CD45 expression probably by changing the half-life of CD45m.
T and B cells are lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system, the T cells and B cells recognize antigens presented on the surface of APCs (antigen presenting cells) and produce cytokines such as IL-2 and IgG, respectively, by the signals from the antigen receptors. IgM antibodies (Abs), made by B cells, bind to a hapten and induce immunological memory by cooperating with helper T cells. Therefore, the humoral responses to hapten-carrier protein are strongly associated with both IgM production and T cell function.
During humoral immune responses, a subset of B lymphocytes expresses surface IgM (CD79a/CD79b) and cytoplasmic TCR m chain proteins. Upon stimulation by a T cell antigen, these B cells (double positive (DP) lymphocytes) activate the transcription of various genes and produce IgM Abs on its own. On the other hand, normal T cells express neither surface IgM nor TCR m chain on their surface (Kusneris and   Reconstitution of the thymus. VII. Immunofluoresc"

In this report we present the first documented occurrence of diabetic ketoacidosis due to the ingestion of the D-tartrate of glycine (Glycinic acid). The drug was sold as the pure chemical and, as far as we could learn, was being prepared and sold in quantities as large as 250 gm. by an individual physician practicing in a rural area who was also holding various local positions of public trust under the names of the pure chemical, glycine tartrate, and glycine sulfate. This case also illustrates other facets of the problem of D-tartrate of glycine intoxication. First, the dangers of the substance was recognized by the layman and the doctor who purchased it who sent written warnings to the Food and Drug Administration and the manufacturer. Then, as shown by this case, physician incompetence can lead to severe consequences, such as the development of overdose-related diabetic ketoacidosis. The case of diabetic ketoacidosis in association with glycinic acid (the D-tartrate of glycine) was reported to us in February, 1962. The man presented with the entire clinical picture of juvenile diabetes mellitus, and was in a state of severe diabetic ketoacidosis and acidosis. One of the major challenges was to unravel how the diabetic coma had been precipitated. We had to determine whether this man's diabetes was really new, and to find out whether he had ingested a substance that could be blamed for his diabetic coma and his ensuing prolonged hospitalization. The information which could have been obtained if the patient had had diabetes mellitus before he presented was as follows: Blood sugar level had been normal for a decade. The patient had never been treated with insulin. If the coma and acidosis were caused by a substance that caused diabetes mellitus and diabetic coma <EOD> .
Lithium is mainly used to treat severe mood disorders, but is also an efficient treatment for various psychiatric and somatic disorders. Due to its narrow therapeutic index, lithium plasma level monitoring is important as this treatment is not compound. A simple dosage of the plasma lithium level, based on the measurement of the total lithium plasma level, is possible only in patients with an extremely low or extremely high lithium plasma concentrations. Lithium is eliminated almost exclusively in urine, mainly as unchanged lithium. The elimination half-life is between 12 and 24 hours. Lithium is neither accumulated nor inhibiting its elimination. A daily dosage of one or two tablets or granules (usually 600 mg to 1200 mg) suffices during the morning to maintain the plasma level steady during the day. The lithium plasma level curve corresponds to the concentration curve. The main peak takes place in the morning within 1 to 2 hours after the ingestion. The lithium plasma level is relatively independent of the size and frequency of dosage. Nevertheless, a too small dosage will have too short an effect, and a too big dosage too long an effect. <EOD> Ready, Set, Scream: The Relationship Between Gender, Sexual Orientation, and Disgust in Response to the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic

 <EOD> Isolation of progenitor and mature human astrocytes reveals transcriptional and functional heterogeneity
Neurodegenerative diseases affect a diverse population of neurons and glial cells. This heterogeneity has hindered the development of disease-modifying therapies. Understanding the molecular and cellular processes that contribute to glial heterogeneity is therefore one of the primary goals for investigators studying neurodegenerative disorders. To identify astrocyte heterogeneity and assess the role of lineage-specific pathways in disease development, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing and molecular analyses of human fetal brain neural stem cells (NSCs), astrocyte progenitor cells (APCs), and mature astrocytes. Isolation and culturing of APCs from human fetal brain tissue using the transcription factor Sox9 revealed previously undescribed heterogeneity and specific differentiation trajectories. Sox9+/Sox9+-Astrocytes exhibited distinct transcriptional, epigenetic, and functional characteristics, including unique cytokine secretion patterns and increased endocytotic and lysosomal activity. Characterization of different classes of cortical astrocytes will provide insights into the molecular and functional heterogeneity that is present in this cell type. This work will also guide investigators studying neurodegenerative diseases in their efforts to establish glial models in vitro that faithfully mimic glial heterogeneity in vivo. Summary statement Our single-cell RNA analysis of human fetal brain tissue reveals new astrocyte heterogeneity and differentiation pathways. Further investigations of functionally diverse subpopulations in neurodegenerative disease will help identify targetable mechanisms for therapeutic discovery.

Viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) was demonstrated with in situ hybridization histochemistry (ISHH) in follicular lymphocytes, some macrophages, fibroblasts, dendritic epithelial cells of the bursal lymphatics, and to a lesser extent in heterophils. The follicular lymphocytes contained from 0.2 to 9.6 copies of vRNP molecules per cell. A variable percentage (approximately 0.001 to 10%) of bursal lymphocytes were positively stained for T, B, or immature B lymphocyte surface markers on days 3-14 PI, indicating that bursal lymphocytes were not infected by CAV at these times. CAV was detected in the bursa at day 14 PI, suggesting that infection occurred between 3 and 14 days PI. Viral-specific antibody was never detected in the serum of infected birds but was found in the bursas of birds experimentally exposed to CAV. To evaluate the role of bursa in disease, lymphoid organ weights were evaluated. No statistically significant differences were found in spleen or thymus weights 14 to 67 days PI. An average decrease of 31% in bursa weight was observed 2 days PI (p = 0.05) and 44% from 4 through 67 days PI (p = 0.0001). These results demonstrate that chicken bursa may be both a location of latency and a source of infection for CAV. The decreased weight of the bursa was more severe and more prolonged than expected from virus-induced lymphocyte depletion alone, suggesting that CAV may affect the bursa by interfering with bursa growth. <EOD> Antibody detection for early diagnosis of congenital CMV infection in children with retinopathy
Aim: To compare a microparticle enzyme immunoassay (Mesa Lab Cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG test) with a commercial ELISA assay for the detection of antibodies against CMV. Method: Ninety-one sera from babies diagnosed with congenital CMV infection on the basis of the retinal pathology were examined. Retinal histology slides obtained at autopsy were reviewed by a single clinical pathologist. The babies were classified as (i) retinopathy-positive, (ii) retinopathy-negative, or (iii) retina-inconclusive. Of these, 71 were examined by the Mesa Lab assay and the results compared with those of a commercial ELISA, the Vidas CMV IgG assay (bioMérieux; Marcy l'Etoile, France). Results: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and accuracy (95% confidence intervals) of the Mesa Lab assay were 79.68% (64.29% to 88.45%), 96.79% (92.84% to 98.92%), 97.20% (94.14% to 99.06%), 61.70% (46.34% to 74.95%) and 85.67% (78.08% to 91.44%) and 100% (95.88% to 100%), 96.79 (92.84% to 98.92%), 98.05 (93.08% to 99.87%), 98.60 (9"

A randomized placebo-controlled trial [/TEXT:bold]to test the efficacy of a well-tolerated medications [/TEXT: underline]with a novel mechanism of action to improve subjective and objective measures of cognitive complaints in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) with and without a history of traumatic brain injury (TBI).

Clinically significant cognitive complaints continue to significantly hinder Veterans with PTSD from maximizing their recovery and rehabilitation efforts, and to participate in meaningful social and vocational activities. Methylphenidate (MPH) is a well-tolerated medication with a novel mechanism of action that can be used to improve attention in trauma-related psychiatric conditions. In a proof-of-concept study, clinicians found MPH to normalize subjective and objective measures of cognitive functioning in Veterans with PTSD and neurocognitive complaints. In this multisite, randomized double-blinded 4-cycle 2-period design, participant will randomized to MPH or placebo (PBO).



Aim/Objectives
============

Evaluate the efficacy of MPH for reducing PTSD and neurocognitive symptoms and the impact of such treatment on neurocognitive performance.

Research Methods & Design
======================

We anticipate recruiting 70 Veterans with probable PTSD and neurocognitive complaints.
Upon successful completion of screening visit, eligible participants will be randomized 3:1 to MPH vs PBO.
Rasch-calibrated instruments will be used to assess demographic, mood, trauma and PTSD symptoms, neurocognitive performance, and suicidal behaviors. Adverse events, discontinuations and reasons will be recorded. A subgroup of 5 participants will complete a detailed daily diary.

Participants will receive 4 treatment cycles with each cycle containing 4 week long MPH treatment (MPH 10 mg BID) followed by a 1-week washout. In each treatment cycle, either MPH or PBO will be administered. In each treatment cycle, order of MPH vs PBO within an individual participant will be randomized.
An independent statistician will randomize participants 3:1, stratified by sex, age (<50 vs >50 years old) and site to either MPH or PBO, using block randomization of a block size of 3, 6, or 9. Statisticians from the CRS will not be involved in the randomization process.

Pharmacogenetic analysis will be done.

Ethical Considerations
==============

This clinical trial was approved by MUHA (#2008970781, October 2016) and NMHSDAMRAD (#JD030,

December 2016). Any adverse events reported by participants will be recorded and addressed appropriately.

Sample size justification
============================

N = 34 and N = 34 for the 4 and 2-period analysis will be randomized using a 3:1 allocation ratio to achieve a sample size that is optimal for a comparison of a drug versus placebo. The power in this group will be estimated using 34 in one group and 34 in the other. The power will be 0.809  at 34 for one group versus power 1.0 at 34 for the other; alpha value is .05. Group sample sizes for this crossover N-of-1 trial are based on simulation results.

Recruitment
===========

The number of participants recruited will be adequate to perform 4-cycle and 2-cycle analyses of variance (ANOVA) with 3 periods of 4 weeks. A 2-period ANOVA would require a sample size of 35 for 80% power to detect a difference between drug and placebo of 9.5, which represents an unadjusted mean difference of 9.5 with a pooled within-subject SD of  7.63; the 4-period ANOVA would require 45 for 80% power to detect a difference between drug and placebo of 1.9, which represents an unadjusted mean difference of 1.9 with a pooled within-subject"

Evaluate the capacity of CFRflow as a predictor of the presence of angina at 3 months.
Microvascular function will be assessed with thermodilution coronary blood flow (CFRflow, MFRflow).
Patients with INOCA 
- 1 or more cardiac symptom that angina pectoris, with ischemic characteristics
- 1 or more positive test for myocardial ischemia
- Absence of obstructive CAD (>50%) in any coronary artery
- Absence of cardiac disease that limits the assessment of microvascular function

[instructions]
* Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) is the ratio of hyperemic to basal coronary blood flow and is a marker of the physiological capacity of the coronary microcirculation; in order to get the result, the CFRflow, the maximum hyperemic blood flow is calculated by the injection of 4ml of saline (4 degrees celcius) in the artery to assess flow (usually the LAD). The hyperemic state is achieved by the intracoronary injection of adenosine (200mcg/ml = 14mg), as intravenous adenosine doesn't provide adequate hyperemia for evaluation of myocoronary flow reserve.
* Assessment of microvascular resistance (MR) is based on the calculation of MR flow as the ratio of mean distal coronary pressure measurements at rest and hyperemia (minimal myocoronary resistance); to calculate the latter, beforehand the distal coronary microvascular resistance (MMR flow) is obtained (the minimal microvascular resistance with adenosine injection). After coronary intervention, in the setting of an emergency, and due to the invasive process, the hyperemic flow does not always allow measurement of microvascular resistance.  An intracoronary bolus injection of saline and iodinated contrast media should then be performed to raise the hyperemic state and achieve a better microvascular flow analysis.

 <EOD> Intrapartum Echocardiography: Diagnostic Value in Obstetric Transfusion Indications
Abstract Objective It is common practice to test for obstetric indications when a pregnant obstetric patient presents to the echocardiography lab for an evaluation of the fetal heart. The objective of this retrospective observational study is to identify the diagnostic value of obstetric transfusion indications in pregnant patients who underwent a comprehensive obstetric evaluation. Study Design We searched a database to identify obstetric patients with no known congenital heart disease or cardiac history who underwent an obstetric transfusion indication. Obstetric indications included elevated liver enzymes, platelet counts, amniotic fluid protein, and intravascular hemolysis. All indications evaluated the relationship between placental pathology and maternal or fetal hemorrhage. Transfusion indications were selected if they did not result in a transfusion indication upon review. Transfusion indications excluded included acute and postpartum hemorrhage. Cases were categorized into groups: positive, negative, and not determined by the review of the echocardiogram. We then calculated the accuracy of each obstetric indication for identifying fetal anatomic deformity or cardiac disease. Results From 2,679 obstetric patients who underwent obstetric transfusion guidelines during the study period, we identified 669 patients who underwent 2,893 transfusion indications (average of 1.4 indications per patient). Overall, 68.8% of indications were determined to be positive, while 19.0% were negative. The remaining 12.2% of echocardiograms either failed to determine clinically significant findings (4.2%) or had insufficient echocardiographic imaging to determine clinical significance (8%). Conclusion Obstetric transfusion guidelines have been demonstrated to be useful in identifying fetal anatomic, structural, and cardiac abnormalities. This has become one of the most important roles of intrapartum echocardiography as it provides the obstetrician with valuable information regarding fetal prognosis, as opposed to diagnosis. Future studies with larger populations and standardized intrapart"

We evaluated the antimycobacterial and pharmacokinetic properties of tadamitsine. Tadamitsine (9718 Y) showed antibacterial activity against M. tuberculosis. Tadamitsine inhibited multiplication of M. tuberculosis H37Rv, strain MIC was 40 gamma/ml. Tadamitsine also inhibited multiplication of multi-drug resistant strains of M. tubercolosis (MIC = 40-160 gamma/ml). In guinea pigs tadamitsine, the concentration of tadamitsine in serum and myocardium reached their maxima by oral administration. Tadamitsine was detectable in the guinea pigs for 24 h after oral administration (25 mg/kg). In mice and rats, the concentration of tadamitsine in serum and lungs reached their maxima by oral administration. This drug accumulated in the liver of mice and rats which received it orally. Tadamitsine was also detectable in the rats for 24 h after oral administration (20 mg/kg). Clinical trials showed that, tadamitsine is effective for treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis. <EOD> .

In addition to methane and aerosols, CH_4 sequestering technologies can sequester and store the CO_2 that would be emitted during the operation of the CH_4 production units, including the production of CH_4. CO_2 mitigation by CH_4 sequestering can be roughly divided into three types: (1) CO_2 capture, storage and recycling during the process of CH_4 production; (2) CH_4 production integrated with bioenergy; (3) CH_4 production using CO_2 and nitrogen (N_2) resources. The key technologies of CH_4 sequestering require in-depth research and development, including the capture, sequestration and recycling of CO_2, CH_4 production integrated with bioenergy, gasification technology for C1 chemistry, carbon dioxide capture enhanced geothermal systems and utilization of CO_2 as a carbon source for biomass production. With advances in biochemical technology, the development of new bioenergy crops may provide green solutions for CH_4 sequestering. The combination of microbial electrolysis, solar energy, CO_2 capture and geothermal energy may further promote the research and development of CH_4 sequestration technologies. In addition, the technologies of 10_6 industrial plant for power generation that can convert the captured CO_2 into CH_4 should be developed to address CO_2 sources. Research and development in the areas of CO_2 sequestration, biogas upgrading and the production of high-grade syngas will promote the development of CH_4 sequestering technology. <EOD> Explanatory models of epilepsy among the Washambaa people in the Limpopo province of South Africa.
The purpose of this article is to explore epilepsy in a rural black population in the Limpopo province of South Africa. Using an 'explanatory models' approach, we interviewed 16 key informants, including village doctors and traditional healers, who were knowledgeable about and experienced in caring for people with epilepsy. The study was conducted in Bushbuckridge, a rural township, and among four rural villages near the township. Based on this qualitative study, we developed 14 preliminary categories of possible epileptic causes. These categories include 1) spirit possession, 2) genetic factors, 3) psychological factors, 4) food/diet, and 5) various physical factors such as 5(a) injury to head, 5(b) headache, 5(c) stroke, 5(d) head in a container, 5(d) head in a bag, etc. 6) unknown causes, and 7) epilepsy as a divine punishment.

The Caenorhabditis elegans C. elegans was used as a model to screen ~7,000 E. coli knockouts. The E. coli single gene deletions were transferred into C. elegans and then longevity was used as a read out for functional screening. Two novel genes (cshl_e0015165 and cshl_e0017736) involved in longevity were identified in the current screen. In addition, 10 previously reported genes, such as SIR-2.1, SIR-2.5, SIR-2.3, OMA-1, pdk-1, akt-1, daf-2, nkd-1, skn-1 and sams-1, were also confirmed to prolong longevity. Based on the read out of gene interaction and phospho-proteome data, we propose that NPK-1 (a homolog of AKT-1) may be the major upstream mediating insulin-like signaling pathway for the interaction of sirtuins, SKN-1 and IIS. <EOD> .
A man in his early forties was diagnosed with a right thyroid gland tumor. He underwent a right thyroid lobectomy and bilateral lymph node dissections. The tumor was 50× 40mm, well differentiated papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). It showed invasion into the isthmus of the thyroid gland, thyroid capsule, and lateral lobe. Furthermore, pathological examinations revealed metastatic foci in almost all dissections. The patient underwent total thyroidectomy one year after the first surgery, and was prescribed oral levothyroxine. On the PET-CT one year after the second surgery, a tumor was identified in the left neck. The patient underwent left and right selective lymph node dissection. On the pathological examinations, a squamous cell carcinoma of the left lateral neck was found, which was considered as a metastatic tumor from the PTC. After the left side resection, the size of the tumor of the right neck became larger. He underwent an inferiorly-based neck dissection, and pathological diagnosis revealed a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, which was regarded as a metastatic squamous cell carcinoma from the left side lymph node metastasis. He refused the next resection and started chemotherapy. <EOD> In Vivo Assessment of Left Ventricular Myocardial Contractility during Hypoxemic Isovolemic Hypertension
Little is known about the direct effects of hypoxemic hypertension on regional myocardial contractility. Using radionuclide ventriculography and a canine isolated heart, hypoxemic hypertension was induced by reducing arterial partial pressure of oxygen (Pa 02) from 150 ± 1 to 60 ± 1 mm Hg with fixed tidal volume breathing for 30 minutes. The right and left ventricular ejection fraction was determined using the standard spherical shell model for analysis of regional left ventricular wall motion. Regional isotopic ventriculography was performed in anesthetized and mechanically ventilated mongrel dogs to assess regional ventricular function during hypoxemic isovolemic hypertension induced by an intra arterial blood pressure clamp and hypoxemic hypercapnic hypertension. Myocardial contractility was assessed by regional fractional shortening, an index of regional contractility, and regional ejection fraction, an index of regional ventricular function. A decrease in regional myocardial contractility was observed in the endocardium and an increase in midwall contractility was observed in both hypoxemic hypercapnic and hypoxemic isovolemic hypertension. Both hypoxemic hypercapnic and isovolemic hypertension were accompanied by a decrease in regional ventricular systolic shortening, the systolic ventricular function, in both the subendocardium and subepicardium. We conclude that hypoxemia at fixed arterial blood pressure and cardiac output can induce regional ventricular contractile d"

Study Background
=====================

The results of these clinical trials have been varied, with some showing promising results and others suggesting that the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may not improve the pCR rate. These conflicting results warrant a systematic review to evaluate the impact of trastuzumab in conjunction with neoadjuvant chemotherapy on achieving the pCR in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (1-4).

In the year 2010, a systematic review was conducted and published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in order to analyze the impact of adding trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on achieving the pCR in HER2-positive breast cancer (4). A systematic literature search was performed in June 2009 and included a total of 48 studies, of which only nine trials met the inclusion criteria for this review. These studies were then appraised and summarized. The result indicates that the addition of trastuzumab may improve the odds of achieving the pCR in patients with ductal carcinoma in situ, invasive lobular carcinoma, inflammatory carcinoma, and non-papillary infiltrating ductal carcinoma. The effect was not significant in patients with invasive ductal or mucinous carcinoma. The results of some studies were inconclusive due to the small sample size and wide range of dosage used. The findings of this review highlight the need for further research to determine the impact of trastuzumab in conjunction with neoadjuvant chemotherapy on the pCR rate and overall survival in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

[/INST]
These findings suggest that the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may have a positive impact on reducing the burden of invasive breast cancer. The results of this study also indicate that the optimal duration of trastuzumab therapy may vary depending on individual clinical and pathological factors. The findings presented by this research study provide valuable insights into the optimal course of treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer.

The authors concluded that the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve the pCR rate in certain subtypes of breast cancer, but the effects were not significant in other subtypes. The study noted a high heterogeneity of treatment regimens and administration regiments in the published studies and called for more standardized and consistent reporting of results.

Several studies have been conducted to assess the effect of trastuzumab as an adjunct to neoadjuvant chemotherapy on achieving a pCR in breast cancer, with mixed results (5, 6). The study by Moulder et al. reported a higher rate of pCR with the combination of trastuzumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the HER2-positive group compared to the HER2-negative group. However, the study by Li et al. did not observe a significant difference in pCR rate between the two groups. In another study, the addition of trastuzumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy led to a significantly higher pCR rate in the HER2-positive group (p < 0.001) but not in the triple negative subtype of breast cancer (p = 0.78). A meta-analysis further supported the findings of the Li et al. study.

Currently, the use of trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer is recommended in neoadjuvant chemother"

# Introduction

## Bone physiology
The majority of researchers define bone as living tissue, although some describe it as a living organ. According to bone researchers from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), bones are metabolically active, even in the absence of osteogenic cells or blood supply.   Bone as a living tissue, Friedenstein   This is primarily due to the capillary network in the bone.   Bone as a living tissue, Friedenstein   Bones act as mechanoreceptors for the musculoskeletal system. The skeletal system serves as a protective mechanism for vital organs, a support structure for the muscles, and a place for blood cells to reside and form the hematopoietic system.   Gaps and mismatches, bone tissue engineers take note, Bose   Structurally, bone consists of four components: bone marrow tissue and two types of matrices: bone matrices (e.g., enamel) and connective tissue matrices (e.g., bones). Bone extracellular matrix (ECM) provides rigidity to the bone structure in addition to blood supply. Bone cells (osteocytes, osteoblasts, and osteoclasts) interact with the ECM.

The present report addresses the current scenario of hepatitis B and C in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, with an emphasis on the treatment of hepatitis C, which has a prevalence of about 2%. Hepatitis B virus infects about 2 million people in the city and only around 100 thousand have been diagnosed. As for hepatitis C, 200 thousand are estimated to be infected, around a thousand (17.5%) of whom have cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma. These patients will be benefited by direct acting antivirals for hepatitis C, which will bring the goal of a sustained viral response in the majority (90%) of patients who have been infected about 25 to 35 years ago. <EOD> 
The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of progesterone (P) on the proliferation of cultured myoblasts prepared from neonatal mice. For these experiments, we used immunoperoxidase staining to determine the levels of two myogenic markers: (1) embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMHC), a marker of the formation of myotubes, and (2) Pax7, a marker of satellite cell proliferation. The results obtained indicated that P inhibited myoblast proliferation while it significantly increased satellite cell proliferation and also increased the percentage of eMHC in myotubes. Furthermore, we found that the mRNA level of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-2 in primary myotubes was significantly increased by P treatment, although P had no obvious effect on its protein output. Overall results suggest that P is one of the critical regulators of muscle regeneration by its positive actions on the growth, differentiation and proliferation of muscle stem cells. <EOD> A new paradigm for endocrine oncology education and training

The COVID-19 pandemic, like any crisis, is forcing societies to rapidly adapt and become flexible to cope. Endocrine oncology has not been exempt from this. Traditional face-to-face conferences with live lectures and interactive panel discussion forums have been replaced by virtual platforms with pre-recorded lectures and live panel discussion forums. For these conferences, attendances have decreased significantly, suggesting that this format is not as viable, probably due to the poor quality of internet connection for some participating groups. In addition, this new format raises questions on the efficiency for trainees' education, especially for training in endocrine tumours.

# Background to endocrine training

This was then developed further by a group of European endocrine oncology experts to include surgical endocrine oncology, medical endocrine oncology and radiation oncology, thus forming the current European curriculum for endocrine oncology. It aims to define standards of care across the different specialties   European education in endocrine oncology: first consensus curriculum, Eloy  .
The curricular programmes offered by most European countries are predominantly clinical with only 5-10% of time spent in research and this is done so during the post-graduation phase when most endocrine trainees should be involved in clinical activity. European trainees generally have only two years to build the foundation of knowledge and skills necessary to undertake a specialty fellowship. The curriculum also states that"

 <EOD> Effect of glucose on insulin secretion in the rat.
The time courses of changes in plasma FFA, insulin, glucose, and lactate were determined in both unrestrained and pentobarbital-anesthetized rats. In unrestrained animals, i.p. injections of glucose (2 g/kg) resulted in a transient increase of plasma FFA, whereas plasma glucose, lactate, and insulin increased progressively after glucose administration. In contrast, the i.p. administration of saline had no effect on plasma metabolite concentrations. In pentobarbital-anesthetized rats, glucose administration resulted in a marked increase of plasma insulin and a transient increase of plasma lactate. Thus, these studies demonstrate that rats exhibit a substantial increase in glucose-induced insulin secretion under adrenergic blockade. This increase of insulin secretion can be attributed to the inhibition by β-adrenergic blockade of liver glycogen synthesis and to the consequent increase of hepatic glucose production. As judged from an analysis of the rate of disappearance of infused FFA in the blood of freely moving rats, the increased insulin secretion resulting... <EOD> The development of the immune system: a study of early lymphocyte subpopulations in normal infants.
Lymphocyte subpopulations were studied in the blood of 120 infants and in the umbilical cord blood of 33 newborns. The number of T lymphocytes expressing surface antigens characteristic of the CD5(+), CD7(+), or CD8 population, the number of B lymphocytes and the distribution between CD8(+) and CD5(+) CD8(-) cells of the helper/inducer and cytotoxic/suppressor phenotypes were determined for each patient. In most of the patients significant numbers of T and B lymphocytes were found at birth; the T lymphocytes were mainly of the CD5(+) T subset. The number of lymphocytes with T markers, mainly of the CD7+ or CD5+ subsets, correlated better with the number of lymphocytes with markers of the cytotoxic/suppressor phenotype than with the number of T lymphocytes in the more mature subsets, as measured by CD7 and CD5 markers. The number of natural killer/suppressor cells at birth was low, increasing rapidly after the first 3 months of life. It is concluded that the T and B lymphocytes are formed and leave the blood stream very soon after birth, although in low numbers, and that the maturation process is more rapid for the less mature T cell subpopulations. <EOD> Influence of Mismatched Donor-Recipient Graft Chimerism on the Graft-versus-Host Disease-Free Survival after Mismatched Unrelated Donor Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation in Children

 <EOD> Cerebral and Somal S‐Adenosyl‐L‐Methionine Levels in Two Mutants of Drosophila Melanogaster
S-adenosyl-l-methionine (SAM) is an important metabolic substrate and coenzyme, and participates in a variety of reactions important to brain function. Although SAM levels have been examined in a variety of rat, mouse, and human brain regions, little is known of these levels in Drosophila. We found that SAM levels in the brains of mutant flies (Rac 1, ego 1, or Rac 33-66) were higher than SAM levels in the brains of wild-type flies. Rac 1 flies showed the highest SAM levels; Rac 33-66 flies, the lowest. It is not known how these mutations in Drosophila differ from one another in their effects on overall neurotransmitter metabolism. We do know, however, that Rac 1 flies have abnormal behavior and that Rac 33-66 flies have abnormal locomotion, and one possible reason for these behavioral differences might be an alteration in the synthesis and/or degradation of neurotransmitters or other metabolic functions in these fly strains. The differences in SAM levels among the fly strains could be considered to be the end-point effects of behavioral differences. In contrast, we found no significant difference in the SAM concentration in the somas of the dorsal ganglion of CantonS and Rac 1 flies, suggesting that differences in SAM levels may not be related to the observed behavioral changes. <EOD> .

Alzheimer's Disease is an insidious onset and slowly progressive disease, characterized by the presence of cognitive, behavioral and general dysfunction. Among the neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms seen in Alzheimer's patients, apathy is the most common symptom. It is also followed by depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorders. Behavioral and psychological symptoms (BPSD) affect up to 90% of people with dementia during the illness. Therefore, it brings great difficulties to both patients and their caregivers and causes low quality of life. In addition, the inability to treat the disease completely worsens this situation. Considering the pharmacological treatment of psychological symptoms such as apathy, anxiety, depression in AD individuals, the existence of adverse side effects, increased mortality, limited drug efficacy, relatively high cost, and the inability to effectively treat some of the most distressing behaviors, it is recommended to give priority to non-pharmacological interventions. The concept of cognitive stimulation in AD is one of the most popular approaches. It is stated that Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the best evidence-based practice with robust clinical trials, applied according to a specific guideline for individuals with mild and moderate dementia. In addition, CST is the only intervention recommended by the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to promote cognition, independence and well-being for people with mild to moderate dementia. It has been determined that CST has many effects on individuals with Alzheimer's disease. However, there are different results in studies on the effectiveness of cognitive intervention strategies aimed at reducing cognitive functions, behavioral and psychiatric symptoms. To enable the conversion of CST into routine clinical practice, practice research to support the standardization and generalization of cognitive stimulation therapy planned for patients with AD and its impact on improving neuropsychiatric symptoms and daily living skills requires further research. In addition, the absence of a widely used standard guideline for pharmacological methods for patients with AD in our country reveals that the planned study will contribute to practice. In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effect of CST application on the levels of apathy, loneliness, anxiety and daily living activities in elderly individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's. This research was planned in a single center and experimental research design with pretest posttest control group. The research was planned to be carried out between January 2023 and June 202 at the Moral House affiliated to Gaziantep Metropolitan Municipality Disabled and Health Services Department. Introductory Information Form, Standardized Mini-Mental Test, Geriatric Anxiety Scale, Apathy Rating Scale, Loneliness Scale and Functional Disability in Dementia Scale will be used in the research. CST will be applied by a trained researcher in therapy, 2 days a week, in a total of 14 sessions of 45-50 minutes. There will be a pre-test before the application, an intermediate test right after the application, and a post-test three months later. Research data will be evaluated in SPSS 25.0 New York package program.

 <EOD> The Nosebleed Cocktail: Revisiting a New Paradigm in Severe Sepsis?
Although the treatment of severe sepsis and septic shock began a century ago, in most ways, our approach to the management of the patient with shock has not changed dramatically. As was discussed by Dr. Davenport in the June 1, 2009 issue of Critical Care Medicine, the current clinical trial data support a strategy of using volume resuscitation to restore organ perfusion and then assessing further treatment options. As with the treatment of many disease processes, clinicians have embraced a therapy before its ability to prevent morbidity or mortality has been tested in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Unfortunately, after decades of clinical equipoise in treatment of the shocked patient, we still do not have a consensus on the best way to treat the septic shock patient. It is my hope that the article and the accompanying editorial in this issue of Critical Care Medicine will raise important points for consideration by other members of the critical care community. In the article by Dr. Weil and colleagues (4), the authors tested the hypothesis that the addition of low-dose hydrocortisone (HC) to norepinephrine- and fluids-based resuscitation in early septic shock would improve myocardial performance. The authors conclude that addition of HC to standard care did not lead to improved cardiac performance indices. The article by Dr. Slagman-Jager and colleagues (6) provides important insights into the relationship between catecholamine levels and mortality. In their study of septic patients, Dr. Slagman-Jager and colleagues (6) report that increased norepinephrine levels are associated with decreased mortality. They also show that HC improves perfusion at lower doses of norepinephrine. These papers raise several interesting questions that need to be addressed. Perhaps the most important issue the studies address is whether physicians should measure norepinephrine or epinephrine levels in patients with septic shock to help guide management. The data provided by Dr. Slagman-Jager and colleagues are provocative and raise an important question about whether levels of these catecholamines should be used to direct care. On the one hand, as mentioned by Dr. Haglund, if patients who are not receiving adequate sympathetic tone due to severe sepsis or septic shock could be identified by measuring their catecholamines then the use of the catecholamines as an adjunct to fluid resuscitation, as measured by an indocyanine green dilution test, could be directed toward patients who require higher doses of catecholamines to achieve vasoconstriction and hemodynamic stability after the institution of fluid resuscitation. On the other hand, if the catecholamine levels could be used to identify a subgroup of patients who are not likely to require vasopressor therapy, then this would be a wonderful discovery. Perhaps in the future a prospective study that used a variety of markers to predict need for vasopressors, including catecholamine levels or levels of other markers of inflammation, could be done to identify patients who may not need vasopressor therapy and who may be able to be treated with fluids alone or with other anti-inflammatory agents without vasopressors. It should be pointed out that one of the strengths of the article by Slagman-Jager and colleagues (6) is their finding that mortality was higher in patients with elevated plasma catecholamine levels who were receiving vasopressors. Although they were not able to identify the underlying mechanism of why this occurred, it is important that this observation was made. Additional studies are clearly needed to elucidate the mechanism that may exist for those with elevated catecholamine levels and higher mortality. Although epinephrine levels were not significantly different on admission between survivors and non-survivors, there was a nonstatistically significant elevation in epinephrine levels in the non-survivors. Whether this finding may have indicated some level of physiologic stress response in <EOD> Osmolarity Modulates the Antimicrobial Activity of Selected Flavonoids

The enzyme from Escherichia coli that catalyzes synthesis of (p)ppGpp employs one of the most complex systems of regulation discovered to date. The (p)ppGpp synthetase III gene in E. coli encodes a bifunctional protein, termed Rel, that is composed of RelA that catalyzes synthesis of (p)ppGpp and SpoT that catalyzes hydrolysis of the nucleotides to guanosine and guanosine 5'-diphosphate. The reaction mechanism of RelA, including adenylation of the adenine cofactor, was studied using steady state kinetic analysis followed by mass spectrometric analysis of intermediates and products of the reaction. Adenylation of the cofactor and its release were determined to proceed via a concerted reaction mechanistic pathway with a rate-limiting, saddle point transition state containing two water molecules activated by residues Lys 74-Arg-Asp 108. In this state both groups on GTP are rotated into the active site and the adenine-binding pocket. The formation of this state is dependent on active site water bridges, which have been studied directly by isotope effect analysis. <EOD> Transition from general practitioner to family doctor.
The transition of the general practitioner to family doctor was studied by recording visits by 12 general practitioners from the initial visit to their families to their graduation from the programme. The total time of visits was 3820 hours, which included 7.5 hours in each family and approximately four hours weekly in the group practice meetings. The total time of visits per family over the eight years was 3.5 hours per year and 14 hours in the family practice. The rate of increase of visits, which was 3.9% per year on average, was highest over the first years after graduation (7.9% per year). Thereafter it decreased to a level lower than that of the overall population. Most visits were in the family practice, followed by clinic and patient visits. Most diagnoses were those that were made with full certainty by the general practitioners, with the possible exception of the diagnoses of urinary infections. Of the 40% of the diagnoses of urinary infections made after graduation, 54% were made in the family practice. On average each patient was seen by the general practitioners and one nurse per year."

 <EOD> Risk Factors Associated With Cervical Lymph Node Metastases of Thyroid Microcarcinoma Detected by Cervical Ultrasound With Fine-Needle Aspiration Biopsy
Cervical lymph node metastases of thyroid microcarcinoma are rare. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence and risk factors of cervical lymph node metastases in patients with thyroid microcarcinoma. This is a retrospective cohort study conducted in a surgical clinic in our hospital. A multivariate exact logistic regression analysis was performed to analyze the risk factors for lymph node metastasis of thyroid microcarcinoma. A total of 1560 patients had 1655 thyroid microcarcinomas. Among the 1560 patients, 818 (52.6%) had metastatic lymph nodes and 742 (47.4%) were negative, with an overall incidence of metastases of 52.6% (818/1560). In the multivariate analysis, male, larger size of thyroid gland, higher prevalence of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and more metastatic lymph nodes were identified as risk factors associated with lymph node metastases. The overall results of the multivariate exact logistic regression analysis revealed that male was an independent factor (odds ratio , 1.512; 95% confidence interval , 1.115-2.045; p = 0.008), and larger size of thyroid gland (≧30 mm) was also a predictor (OR, 1.618; 95% CI, 1.005-2.610; p = 0.046) for cervical lymph node metastases. Higher prevalence of chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis and higher number of positive lymph nodes were risk factors associated with lymph node metastases of thyroid microcarcinoma (OR, 1.709; 95% CI, 1.137-1.141; p = 0.011 and OR, 1.855; 95% CI, 1.337-2.573; p = 0.0001, respectively). Conclusion From our study, it appears that male patients, larger size of thyroid gland, chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis, and a higher number of positive lymph nodes were associated with the risk of cervical lymph node metastases in patients with thyroid microcarcinoma. However, the role of preoperative cervical ultrasound in predicting lymph nodes metastasis should be determined. <EOD> Inhibition of Bacterial Growth by Cationic Gemini Surfactant C22-C12(CO2Na)2

The effects of a cationic gemini surfactant C22-C12(CO2Na)2 on Pantoea agglomerans, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Candida albicans were studied. Cell suspensions of these microorganisms were mixed and aerated with varying concentrations of C22-C12(CO2Na)2, and the minimum inhibitory concentration was determined for each microorganism. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the cell surface became smooth and intact and that the cells increased their surface hydrophobicity with increasing amounts of surfactant in the mixture. Additionally, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed that there were no significant differences in the changes in amide I band intensities (A1 and A2) in C22-C12(CO2Na)2 solutions, and no change in the overall amide I band position as a function of surfactant concentration. To determine whether there was molecular recognition between the surfactant and bacterial cell surface proteins, and whether it was hydrophobic or electrostatic, FTIR spectroscopy was used to investigate the A1 and A2 peaks before and after treatment with proteinase K. Proteinase hydrolysates of C22-C12(CO2Na)2 showed that the amide I band position did not change with increasing concentration of surfactant"

What will you be summarising?

In this particular trial, the researchers wanted to find out whether an injection of Streptococcus pyogenes into the cystic fluid of LMs is an effective treatment.

Trial background
Lymphatic malformations are benign congenital malformations resulting from abnormal lymphangiogenesis caused by failure in maturation of lymph vessels. LMs can affect the macroscopic structure of organs with functional impairment leading to significant clinical problems. Surgical excision is the only treatment currently available to patients suffering from LMs. Surgery for LM is often limited to those with symptoms and is associated with significant complications such as infections, nerve injuries, and skin problems. This makes it imperative to find new solutions which will improve the quality of life of this patient population without severe side effects and with high levels of satisfaction and comfort.

Clinical trial objectives
Studies carried out by the group of investigators have shown that intracystic or subcutaneous administration of an antibacterial agent, Streptococcus pyogenes (Group A, type 3) Su strain, into macrocystic and mixed cystic lesions (lymphatic malformations) resulted in an immunological reaction leading to tissue resolution. The trial presented here aims to expand on this approach by injecting the antibacterial agent into the cystic fluid of LMs. If the antibacterial agent is well tolerated it could then potentially be administered on a non-surgical basis to the patients suffering from LMs.

Study type and design
This trial is an open-label, single-arm, clinical study involving multiple sites over a period of 32 weeks duration.

Population & methodology

This trial involved participants with macrocystic or ≥ 50% macrocystic mixed cystic type of LM. These participants must be less than 18 years of age. The participants were recruited at 6 sites across the United States of America. The participants were selected by the group of investigators and included a total of 45 individuals with a macrocystic and mixed cystic LM. 40 participants were randomised to receive active treatment with 1 dose of TARA-002 and 5 participants were allocated randomly to receive saline. To be randomised, the participants had to fulfil the selection criteria.

Intervention / Treatment

Participants randomised to the treatment group were given a single dose of 10 million streptococcus pyogenes antigen (GAS) Su bacteria injected intracystically (in the cystic fluid) of macrocystic and macrocystic mixed cystic type of LM. Participants in the saline arm received saline alone using the same dosing protocol as the active treatment group. The primary efficacy end-point examined was the proportion of participants with clinical success after treatment of macrocystic and macrocystic mixed cystic LMs. Primary end-point was assessed by clinicians using an 11-point scale at 8 weeks post final injection (primary point). Participants followed up at weeks 8 and 32 post final injection with imaging and clinical evaluations.

Study Measures

Efficacy measurement: Primary end-point is based on clinician global impression assessment of treatment response with a scale of from 1 to 10. Participants with a score of 5 or greater defined the clinical success category. An investigator satisfaction score was included to evaluate clinician satisfaction with treatment and efficacy at week 8 defined as either: clinician rating of ""good"", ""very good"" or ""excellent"".

Safety Measures: Participants had clinical examination pre treatment and at weeks 2, 4, and 8 and 32 post treatment completion. Additionally, participants had their cardiovascular system observed pre treatment and at weeks 4, 8, and 32 post treatment completion. Other safety measurements done were: vital signs, ECG, haematology and clinical laboratory, and injection site assessment. Other safety assessments done were: AEs (safety monitoring of participants) and antibodies to TARA-002 at weeks 2, 4, and 8 and 32 post treatment completion."

Eligibility Criteria <EOD> PTSD in Adolescence after a Natural Disaster: A Longitudinal Study of Trajectories

Background: Many studies show that exposure to stressful life events is more prevalent among boys, and that boys report more symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than girls. Objective: Although adolescent stressful life events have often been associated with the development of PTSD and the severity of PTSD has varied greatly, previous research has not evaluated the trajectory of PTSD in this age group. The purpose of this study was to investigate the long-term trajectory of PTSD after experiencing a natural disaster and the differences between boys and girls among those with PTSD. Participants: A longitudinal study of 2234 junior high school students (1067 boys; 1167 girls) was conducted 1, 2, 3, and 4 years after the earthquake in western Japan in 1995.Methods:A naturalistic follow-up study was used. PTSD symptoms were measured at each time point.Results: Significant differences were observed between boys and girls in the trajectory of PTSD (F = 13.60, df = 3, p < .001), in that boys had higher rates of developing and recovering from PTSD than did girls. Post hoc analysis showed that PTSD was found among approximately 50% of the females 1-3 years after the disaster. However, only 13% of the males showed PTSD 1 year after the disaster. The other 87% had no PTSD.Conclusions:These results suggested that PTSD in adolescents could have relatively favorable long-term outcomes, and that the PTSD trajectories of boys and girls differed.

 <EOD> Association of endoplasmic reticulum stress-responsive genes with the response to erlotinib and cisplatin combination treatment in human non-small cell lung cancer

Response to combination chemotherapy in lung adenocarcinomas with mutated and/or amplified epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).Methods Patients received 50 mg day -1 erlotinib for 28 days with a 14-day rest period and cisplatin 20 mg m -² at days 1, 8 and 15 every fourth week. The treatment was repeated in a consecutive round. Eight patients were evaluable for tumour response and 11 for gene expression analysis. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-responsive genes were examined in tumour-derived cDNA by quantitative real-time PCR.Results One complete, four partial and three non-complete responses were observed. Gene expression analysis revealed that three individual tumours were characterized by increased levels of CHOP/GADD153, ATF6, ATF3, ATF4, spliced X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) and EDEM1.Conclusion ER stress-responsive gene expression in tumour tissue was not predictive for a successful outcome to erlotinib -cisplatin combination therapy in patients with adenocarcinomas of the lung.

Using single-molecule imaging, we show that SV40 large T antigen (TAg) and the large tumor antigen-associated factor 90K (TAgs-90K) inhibit DNA unwinding by the RNA helicase eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (eIF4A). Inhibition of unwinding by TAg is relieved by additional TAg binding, consistent with a mechanism in which TAg/90K block formation of a substrate recognition interface through contacts made by the 90K C terminus with the first 2 helices of eIF4A. Analysis of unwinding kinetics reveals that inhibition, while not a complete block, is sufficiently rapid as to contribute to TAg/90K-mediated regulation of unwinding and eIF4F assembly. <EOD> Isolated right ventricular thrombus: successful surgical removal in a patient with right‐sided valvular heart disease
Right ventricular thrombus in the presence of a right‐sided cardiac lesion is an emergency condition because of the possibility of sudden death.

Hypertonic sodium lactose, in doses from 50 to 200 ml/day, was administered for 24 to 48 hours in 20 unresponsive patients with diffuse brain injury resulting from severe head injury. The mean lactose-induced rise in intracranial pressure (ICP) was 15.5 mm Hg, and the highest lactose-induced ICP elevation was 29 mm Hg. Although all 20 patients demonstrated a lactose-induced elevation in ICP, 6 of the 20 had an ICP of 20 mm Hg or more at the beginning of lactose infusion. The rise in ICP was most marked in patients showing a low response to hyperventilation. It is noteworthy that no patient suffered clinical deterioration during the lactose trial, and 10 patients (50%) showed clinical improvement after lactose infusion. The possible pathophysiological mechanisms for this remarkable tolerance to a lactose-induced ICP elevation are discussed. <EOD> Influence of pre-irradiated bone allografts on the osteogenic response of human mesenchymal stromal cells in vivo.
The reconstruction of a critical segmental defect in the metaphyseal area of long bones with bone allografts is an essential element in the treatment of aseptic necrosis of the femoral head. To date, studies have focused on radiographs, densitometric methods, and clinical scores for evaluating the quality of bone grafts with the purpose of predicting the results in a single-staging bone grafting surgery. However, it was found that the presence of mesenchymal stromal cells in the bone graft, which could constitute an inflammatory source, had a negative effect on the osteogenic quality of the graft. The aim of the present study was to analyze, by histological and immunohistochemical methods, the osteogenic potential of mesenchymal progenitor cells derived from an allogenic bone graft infiltrated with mesenchymal progenitor cells previously exposed to 20 Gy of gamma irradiation. A total of 10 patients with aseptic necrosis of the femoral head underwent a singlestage iliac crest bone grafting, which was conducted in accordance with the usual clinical protocols. Bone biopsies were performed at 12 months follow-up. The radiological findings showed that of the 10 grafted patients, 90% had a radiological success and exhibited a normal, bilateral hip, a reduced or non-existent sphericity index, and a greater range of motion. Histological and immunohistochemical findings indicated that the preirradiated grafts showed similar levels of osteoblast activity. Thus"

 <EOD> Freshmen Fresh

 

## The sophomores
Sophomores often feel their role has shifted, but it really hasn't-you're still freshmen. A lot of them end up taking their own classes for the first full year too. So they can feel a bit lost, like juniors, so they should really work toward having a senior buddy before the end of junior year. They' d help each other through the college social maze.
Sophomores may feel like they've become a part of the campus they can be a part of the residential hall staff, or even a resident advisor after doing well the first few years.
Some feel they don't get as much respect as they should by other students as well. This can make sophomores turn inward a lot. Encourage them to get out, not to feel like they're forgotten. They do get more respect after junior year.

## The juniors
Juniors feel very much part of the university process because they're almost at the point in their development where they know how to do college well. They don't have that fear of getting ""too involved"" with too many groups and activities. They often become more and more involved and become stronger individuals as a result of doing so.
Juniors become more able to handle criticism and accept responsibility for their actions and decisions, especially when they move out of their parents' house during the year.
Increased responsibility and maturity helps juniors to feel closer relationships develop with the campus, in large part because they feel they've earned the right to do so.

## The seniors
Senior years are usually the best. They start to really own college life, but there is still some restraint because of graduation. Seniors have a great sense of responsibility, self-confidence, and satisfaction. They're good with others, but they feel different than they did during their freshman and sophomore years. And this is a good thing, because they now see college as a true part of their lives, instead of just an experience.

## College experiences for parents

## Parents of freshmen
Parents want to see their freshman get settled and involved. Parents of firstyear students are not only concerned and anxious about their children leaving home and moving away, many are concerned about the costs and academic achievements of their children. Others have their own feelings of doubt and uncertainty about the whole college experience. By this time the students have been in school long enough to let parents become well acquainted with them.
The college experience should provide a student with a positive image of the self in the minds of parents, other family members, and the students' friends. It's important to give parents an opportunity to be a part of their student's life at the university, if they so desire. That, of course, comes from developing a relationship with the student. Parents can play a vital role in communicating with the university and the faculty member/staff member who teaches their student.
The most important responsibility the parents of freshmen have is to set the pattern. Let them come to you to see what you think is happening to your student. Also, when they come to campus events, come to check and see what's going on and where you may be able to volunteer.

## Parents of sophomores
The time of the sophomore year is a difficult one. Students become more independent. They're starting to discover their own identity. Parents really need to be careful that they haven't become too much in their student's business-but at the same time they need to not be so much out of it that they feel they're excluding their child from a part of his or her life. This is a time when parents and students need to come to an understanding of the other's concerns.
Often by the end of sophomore year, students have worked out their own personality problems with their parents. Now, it is time, they can begin working on the problems that come up as friends become larger and larger part of the total life of their students.
Ask an academic advisor, or student affairs specialist, student affairs or housing and dining staff member to talk to your student about ""the sophomore problem. "" Get a referral to a therapist or counselor to talk to your student or to the counselor directly.

Aedes aegypti mosquitoes are the primary spreaders of numerous life threatening diseases. A complete understanding of the metabolic mechanisms used by this insect will provide important information about how to control disease‐causing mosquitoes, specifically with regard to the development of novel vaccination strategies. Using a custom A. aegypti oligonucleotide microarray, we have determined transcriptional changes that occur during blood feeding and that allow mosquitoes to utilize host proteins as an energy source necessary for successful oviposition. In addition to identifying genes involved in proteolytic digestion and uptake, several potential immune responses were identified. Additionally, we have determined differential transcriptional changes that occur during metabolic interactions between blood feeding and sugar uptake, which have been linked to disease transmission. By using a combination of microarray analysis and real‐time PCR, we have demonstrated that the carbohydrate kinase (AaCK) gene is highly expressed in mosquitoes fed a 10% fructose diet in contrast to mosquitoes fed a 5% or 50% fructose diet. This research will assist in providing further insight into how vaccination strategies can elicit a protective response without inducing undesirable effects. <EOD> Evaluationof a rapid method for screening of drugs of abuse including benzodiazepines in urine samples by a capillary electrophoresis analyzer based on MEKC in comparison to GC/EI/MS
In this work, a rapid method for drugs of abuse including benzodiazepines monitoring has been developed by a capillary electrophoresis (CE) analyzer based on micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). The analytical method was firstly validated in terms of specificity, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), precision, and linearity. All these validation parameters have been established as good. Analytical recoveries from spiked samples, including urine and oral fluid, were also good. Furthermore, the method was also demonstrated as a suitable method for drugs of abuse screening using 110 positive urine samples of drug abusers. The method was found to be fast and reliable. Furthermore, the urine samples can be analysed directly and directly without any sample treatment, and therefore, this method was applied successfully to real samples without any pretreatment step and has been shown as a good alternative to the usual screening procedures using GC/GC/MS. <EOD> Phospholipase D Regulates the Early Phase of Phagocytosis in Human Neutrophils*

Phagocytosis in neutrophils and other phagocytic cells is a highly dynamic event encompassing sequential and regulated interactions between phagocytes and the engulfed particles that induce the internalization to take place. Here we show that PLD1 and PLD2 are activated at an early stage after neutrophils are exposed to IgG-coated particles. Neither the activity of PLD1 and PLD2 nor the extent of phagocytosis in neutrophils depended on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase or Rac activity, and the inhibition of PLD activity in neutrophils through infection with a recombinant adenovirus coding for a PLD-specific antisense RNA or exposure to the PLD inhibitor 1-butanol decreased the extent of particle phagocytosis. Moreover, incubation with 1-butanol prevented the ability of neutrophils to form caps around particles that are essential for the early phase of phagocytosis, and it also disrupted the actin-based cytoskeleton of these immune cells in a manner that parallels the effect of 1-butanol on the phagocytic process. Altogether, these findings indicate that PLD functions in an event crucial for the early phase of phagocytosis in neutrophils and imply that this cellular process requires the assembly of a cytoskeleton that is sensitive to inhibition by PLD activity.
Eukaryotic ceils ingest foreign particles and microorganisms through an actin-dependent process known as phagocytosis. This particle clearing ability represents one of the most powerful"

Background
------------

Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. In 2018, the global age adjusted incidence rate (IAR) of cervical cancer was 12.6 cases per 100,000 women, with 6.6 per 100,000 women for India, 5.5 for China, and 9.3 and 21.2 per 100,000 women for South Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DR Congo), respectively. Cervical cancer was the most common cancer in 18 countries, and the second most common cancer in another 34 countries. Although most of the world is now covered by cytology-based screening programs or national HPV vaccination programs, in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), including countries in South East Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, most women had not received cancer screening, and only 6.3% of girls in lower middle-income countries had received their first dose of the HPV vaccine before 15 years of age. In Africa, nearly 80% of women of reproductive age have never been screened, while in South East and East Asia, more than 15% of women had had 0-5 Pap tests in their life.

While the Papanicolaou (Pap) smear test has been available since the 1940s, it was only available for urban populations, mainly for women of higher socio-economic status, and it was limited for those populations where the incidence of cervical cancer is highest. This situation changed in 2006, when Gardasil was found to significantly prevent cervical cancer. It also created an opportunity to introduce a comprehensive screening program, including HPV vaccination, HPV-based screening, and treatment. The development of HPV screening technologies, such as the DNA-based mtHPV PCR and mtHPV DNA-PCR, mtHPV RT-PCR, and mtHPV DNA-RNA PCR, provided a more effective and practical option to screen a much higher number of women, even outside of urban areas. Moreover, self-collection of samples by women eliminates the need for physical contact between health-care providers (HCPs) and women, which can lead to stigmatization (particularly among the youth) and other ethical issues of a sexual nature. Such self-collection of cervicovaginal swabs (SCVS) offers women privacy and anonymity, reducing social stigma issues, and potentially increasing coverage.

The HPV vaccine prevents the acquisition of HPV, which contributes to cervical cancer. HPV is one of the nine oncogenic papillomaviruses, or mucosal oncogenic viruses, which cause a range of cancers including throat, oropharingeal, anal, and penile cancers as well as cervical cancer.

The present paper introduces a fractal analysis approach as a measurement of dose distribution inhomogeneity to breast cancer radiotherapy treatment plans. For this purpose, this paper investigates a relation between fractal dimensions of treatment plan and dose distributions in 35 treatment plans. It was shown that the fractal dimension of each case is related to the corresponding DeltaD(2%), DeltaD(10%), and MaxDVHD(1) indices. As a result, fractal dimension is found to be sensitive to breast radiation therapy dose inhomogeneity. <EOD> Atypical Case of Septic Shock Responsive to Ceftazidime
Ceftazidime is a new cephalosporin with a spectrum of activity similar to that of cefotaxime. In addition, ceftazidime is reported to be 4 to 40 times more potent than cefotaxime in various laboratory model systems evaluating antibacterial activity (6, 7). It is important to determine whether clinical response to ceftazidime parallels its potency in in vitro systems. We report the successful treatment of an infant with septic shock resistant to cefotaxime, but responsive to ceftazidime. <EOD> Characterization of an insect cell line resistant to the Cry1Ca1 protein toxin from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis.
The Cry1Ca1 protein from Bacillus thuringiensis subsp. israelensis induces mortality in larvae of Culex pipiens mosquitoes and is known to kill larvae of a mosquito cell line (CL2M2). This cell line was used as source for stable transformants. The cytotoxicity assay revealed that the Cry1Ca1 protein toxin did not show any killing effect on 20 clones which had been propagated on the selectable agent G-418. In order to clarify whether the resistance of the transformants is related to a specific modification of the susceptible receptor in the membrane of the transformed cells or involves a mechanism not acting on the membrane it seemed necessary to clarify the cellular binding of 125I-radiolabeled toxin by specific and non-specific precipitation. The total membranes from insect cells as well as from transformants in which the Cry toxin exhibited no effect had bound comparable amounts of toxin molecules (34 and 42 ng toxin/mg membrane protein). Furthermore, both membrane fractions showed the same binding capacity to 125I-radiolabeled soluble protein toxins as well as no binding to the B.t. subsp. kurstrin crystal protein toxin. On the other hand, the total membranes of sensitive cells (CL1M4Aa) exhibited no binding to the soluble Cry1Ca protein toxin. These results suggest that the resistance of the transformant cells could have to do with the primary metabolism of the Cry1Ca protein prior to binding to its membrane receptors. <EOD> .
A method of immunocytochemical demonstration of gamma 2-microglobulin (gamma 2m) immunoreactive particles localized in various human tissue cells is described. It was based on the use of gamma 2m monoclonal antibodies and a two-step peroxidase-conjugated second immunoglobulin absorption. By using this method, it was revealed that gamma 2m is widely distributed in human tissue cells. In addition to HLA-positive cells, i.e. in normal keratinizing and stratified squamous epithelium of skin, gamma"

 <EOD> The epigenome of the rat thymus and its alterations caused by prenatal glucocorticoid exposure

Reviewers' comments:Reviewer #1 (Remarks to the Author):The study aims to create a genome wide epigenomic atlas of thymus. This is done by taking advantage of RNAseq gene expression patterns of thymus to infer cell type proportions and then use these inferences to calculate ChIPseq and MNase-seq signals to derive an atlas of DNA methylation, histone modifications, chromatin accessibility and chromosome conformation. They identify many genes that display distinct, lineage-specific, and age-dependent changes, and genes that have common and distinct profiles of regulation. Using this atlas, they map cell-type and age-specific signals of DNA methylation for each gene, and they then go on to relate these changes to changes in gene expression and identify enhancers of specificity for cell type, age, or signal. This study is comprehensive in that it combines transcript and epigenomic data, while being exhaustive in that it captures a broad spectrum of epigenetic features. This article contains extensive data that the study team provides, making it easier to examine the results in great detail. I have a number of concerns about this study that should be addressed.
1. The authors claim that the expression profiles they have developed are cell-type specific. However, they are really cell-lineage specific (because the data is aggregated across developmental stages). The authors compare with Cis-regulatory Element Annotation System (CEAS) and demonstrate overrepresentation of the enhancers in the genes regulated by the lineage of interest, but this is done at only a handful of places and it would be easier to demonstrate with more statistical power. Additionally, the claim that certain enhancers are conserved across lineages is a very bold claim, but is only based on the relative enrichment of the motifs. Also, the authors provide transcriptional regulatory network of the thymus (i.e., GRN), but this is not analyzed comprehensively.
2. The authors' analysis of the data shows some very interesting signaling by developmental age and cell type. This signaling could be used to elucidate molecular mechanisms driving normal development. Also, the authors should discuss the relationship between the histone modifications they find versus the developmental changes in transcription in the context of the work by .
3. In , the authors should show which cell populations these different enrichment scores are for. Additionally, the enrichment scores for the different states are shown in the scatter plots, but no information is given about the significance of changes over time. 4. The authors should include comparisons to the literature in describing the epigenomic landscapes of the genes in the atlas.
5. The authors should use tools like PIRATE or AIRE , to identify active enhancers, and then compare them with the regions with epigenomic signals.
6. While the authors provide a lot of detailed data and a set of comprehensive tools to analyze it, it is also an impressive amount of data to try to digest and I think a few of the figures might require a figure in the supplement as well. The authors do seem to keep things to the key components of the analysis, though, by linking each data type to a plot to help make interpretation easier.
7. It is unclear how the authors control for cellular heterogeneity in their MNase-seq enrichment analysis. This might be better controlled by FACSing cells and doing ChromHMM in each"

Summary:
Aging is associated with a physiological reduction in lean mass and bone mineral density. Testosterone therapy (T) improves muscle mass and metabolic parameters in aging men. Epigenetic markers seem to explain how T mediates protein synthesis. Resistance training (RT) is an effective countermeasure against muscle mass and metabolic losses. This study tests the hypothesis that 10-week T therapy (TGT) and/or strength training (SRT) enhance mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic genes in older adults. Twenty-four men (52-70 years old) were randomized to five groups: 1) PLA: placebo + RT; 2) TGT: 600 mg T undecanoate + RT; 3) TS: 300 mg T undecanoate + RT; 4) TG: 600 mg T undecanoate + placebo; and 5) TG + placebo (non-trained). Muscle biopsies and blood samples were collected before and 22 weeks after treatment and/or training. Isokinetic dynamometry and 1 repetitional maximum test (1-RM) were assessed throughout the study. Skeletal muscle biopsies were analyzed for mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC-1α, NRF-1, TFAM, EGF, and HRF), metabolic (SIRT1 and FNDC5) and inflammatory markers (IL-6 and IL-10). TGT group had higher (p ≤ 0.05) peak torque vs. TT at week 5, week 5 vs. week 10, week 5 vs. week 16, and week 10 vs. week 16 in knee extension and knee flexion. TGT also showed higher (p ≤ 0.05) 1-RM in knee extension and knee flexion at week 5, and at week 10 and week 16 vs. TT. The TGT group showed higher levels of PGC-1α mR expression compared to PLA, TGT, and TG (p ≤ 0.05), and to TS and PLA at week 22 (p ≤ 0.05). Moreover, the TGT group showed higher NRF-1 mR expression compared to TT, TS, TG and PLA at week 22 (p ≤ 0.05). Additionally, TGT had higher expression in BDKRB2 mR and FNDC5 mR vs. TT, TS, TG and PLA at week 22. TGT group showed lowered circulating IL-6 compared to TT, TG and PLA (p ≤ 0.05). TGT also had lower IL-10 expression vs. PLA (p ≤ 0.05). Overall, 10-week treatment with TGT was superior to TT and TG groups with respect to RT adaptations. Muscle strength did not improve; however, mitochondrial biogenesis, metabolic, and inflammatory markers were altered in the TGT group during the training period. <EOD> .
The purpose of this work is to prove if the prophylactic administration of ceftazidime--2.0 g i. m./24 h--can be an effective means to reduce the postoperative morbidity in patients submitted to abdominal surgery. In 90 patients operated on by abdominal surgery between January 1986 and April 1988, 45 patients received ceftazidime in a 2.4 g solution for 96 h and 45 patients received the same solution of 0.9 g with no treatment for the perioperative period. We evaluated infections, mortality, morbidity, surgical sepsis, length of hospitalization. In addition, we evaluated the cost resulting from treatment of postoperative infections. The results show a high frequency of surgical sepsis and septicaemia in the group without treatment. No statistical difference was recorded in the cost for the treatment of infections. This study suggests that the perioperative treatment with antibiotics reduces postoperative morbidity. <EOD> An In Vitro Model Evaluating the Effects of Fluoride on Enamel Remineralization: A Comparative Study between Casein Phosph"

Summary: [/INST]
 <EOD> The effect of different exercise programs on blood pressure and physical fitness of cardiac patients
The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a one‐hour‐a‐month home‐based exercise therapy programme (either a walking programme using pedometers or an exergaming programme using a home exercise bike and software) in cardiac patients on their physical fitness and blood pressure. We divided patients into a home‐based exercise group (HB) (n = 26) and a control group (C) (n = 24). The intervention comprised a home‐based exercise treatment programme for six months involving an exercise bike and exergaming software twice a week, walking with pedometers thrice weekly for 30 minutes, and wearing pedometers 30 minutes daily. Changes in blood pressure during the first three months and over six months were determined. The cardio‐respiratory fitness, functional ability, and muscle function of the quadriceps and hand muscle strength were assessed at the first and last visits. Blood pressure was more reduced during three months in the HB group (BPdifference = −0.4/−2.2 mmHg, p < 0.001) than in the C group (BPdifference = −0.2/−0.6 mmHg, p = 0.049). These results suggest that six months of simple, short, and home‐based exercise programmes can be a low‐cost alternative for those who are unable to access treatment or are waiting for it. <EOD> Incorporation of a C2-symmetric bis-DOTA–cyclohexene chelator into a 68Ga chelator for radiolabelling of DOTA-peptides

Input Text: COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test Evaluation in Low-Prevalence Setting

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Point-of-care tests to detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection have the potential to allow earlier detection and isolation of confirmed cases compared to PCR-based diagnostic methods performed in centralized laboratories, with the aim of cost-effective reduction of transmission field (Dinnes et al., 2020). In theory, sufficiently sensitive and specific point-of-care format tests could be implemented at PoE and used to screen low-prevalence populations effectively. In particular, rapid COVID-19 antigen tests in a lateral flow format COVID antigen RDTs or AgRDTs can play a key role in accelerating access to testing and improving turnaround times for COVID-19 test results. COVID antigen RDTs detect specific proteins known as antigens on the surface of the virus and can identify people who are at the peak of infection when virus levels in the body are likely to be high. A number of AgRDTs are now available, some of which have received emergency use authorizations from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and/or the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These tests have the potential to detect an active infection with performance that is close to that of PCR in specific settings. However, the performance of COVID antigen RDTs outside of highly controlled settings is not well defined, particularly in low-prevalence groups of asymptomatic people (Bryan et al., 2020; Lassaunière et al., 2020 Linares et al., 2020; Porte et al., 2020). Antigen tests with rapid turnaround times and minimal user skill have been recently approved for emergency use listing (EUL) by the WHO. Performance data show sensitivity and specificity levels (at least 80% and 97%, respectively) sufficient for diagnostic purposes of SARS-CoV-2 in targeted individuals, but their role in population-based screening remains to be established. In this evaluation, performance characteristics of rapid SARS-COV-2 detection kits (including but not limited to the Standard Q COVID-19 Antigen Test Standard Q RDT and the Panbio™ COVID-19 Ag Rapid Test Panbio RDT, will be assessed for sensitivity, specificity, and their overall agreement with standard nucleic acid testing using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Finally, the performance of multi-test algorithms based on Ag-RDTs with or without RTPCR will be assessed for their potential use in low-prevalence screening programmes.

 <EOD> In vivo confocal raman endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract in patients with oropharyngeal and hypopharyngeal cancer and metastatic malignant melanoma of the larynx
Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) with a 488‐to 600‐nm Raman CCD detector has recently been introduced into the clinical diagnosis of the head and neck. Confocal Raman microscopic (CRM) images of cancer patients and control subjects were compared in the upper aerodigestive tract.

OBJECTIVE
To assess the impact of community on a cohort of patients with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa (AN).


METHOD
All clinics and hospitals serving the Stockholm metropolitan area of Sweden were surveyed for patients with a diagnosis of AN in 2008. The community was defined as the area within a 50 km radius from the city centre. The incidence of AN was compared to the total population for same area of a 50% confidence interval.


RESULTS
The incidence (95% confident interval) per 10 000 population was 0.90 (0.62-1.17) for generalised and 1.32 (0.77-1.87) for bulimic subtypes during the 12-month period, using a cut off for diagnosis 17 y/o and older. The incidence for the 13-17 y/o was 2.25 (1.78-2.72)


CONCLUSION
Despite an AN diagnosis, 40% were undiagnosed due to incomplete information from clinics and hospitals serving the area. The incidence was higher for girls, which reflects the higher prevalence of AN in females. The diagnosis rate decreased and the mean age of AN increased. The community was more or less equivalent to the age-weighted population and size of the population of the study area, showing that the incidence of AN in girls was not affected by community. <EOD> The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on maternal body mass index and gestational weight gain among a highly urban population

Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic may have impacted the incidence of maternal body mass index (BMI) and excess or inadequate gestational weight gain (GWG). Our aim was to identify whether COVID-19 had a causal effect on maternal BMI and GWG.Methods: This retrospective cohort study used data obtained from a large healthcare system's electronic health record. Dating ultrasound reports and prepartum records were queried for BMI at first prenatal visit and last prenatal visit. Prepartum BMI was then classified as normal weight/overweight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg/m 2 ) or obese (BMI ≥ 25 kg/m 2 ). Changes in BMI category and GWG were assessed using longitudinal models.Results: The cohort comprised of N = 6956 women (48% of whom were <20 years of age) with dating and prepartum ultrasounds and prepartum BMI during 2017-2019.

 <EOD> The Influence of Acute Physical Exercise On Bimanual Coordination

This study investigates the influence of acute physical exercise on bimanual coordination and on the relationship between bimanual coordination and executive functioning. Twenty-six moderately inexperienced swimmers performed the bimanual tracking task 2 times. After the first performance the participants (N = 26) performed a submaximal aerobic workout or an arm-specific relaxation training. After a rest period of 30 min both conditions were crossed with the order in which the tracking task was performed (second condition). The main dependent measures were the correlation between the tracking variables mean absolute deviation and circular variance and the executive functioning (i.e., updating, shifting and inhibition). The results showed improved performance on the updating and inhibitory subdimensions of executive functioning and a decrease in inter-limb coupling during bimanual tracking after physical exercise. This study emphasizes the importance of acute aerobic exercise in bimanual performance and might give some indications for future training studies.

This study aims to analyze the value of ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in traumatic intensive care unit (TICU) through data statistical analysis. The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in multi-trauma in traumatic intensive care unit. It will be helpful in providing a new catheterization operation method and a theoretical basis for clinical practice. According to the data from 1021 cases of multiple trauma patients undergoing ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization in the trauma intensive care unit (TICU), the results show that most patients are young. Among them, the median age is 25 (20). Most patients show mild symptoms initially. The main injuries are internal injuries, mainly including liver and spleen injuries. The catheterization data showed that the median catheterization time is 17 (8) min; the median axillary vein diameter measured by ultrasound before catheterization is 0.4 (0.1) cm.
Clinical Research
=================
Background and Rationale
===============================
According to statistics, about 5.5% of hospitalized patients will have complications such as cardiopulmonary arrest and multi-organ dysfunction (MODS), and about 20% of patients in intensive care units (ICUs) will have MODS. Trauma is an independent risk factor for the occurrence of MODS. For trauma patients, the most common MODS is cardiogenic shock. In addition, about 9% of traumatic patients need prolonged ventilator assistance in the early stage of the disease (less than 72h). After ICU discharge, trauma patients still have a higher risk of readmission in the first week, and a longer length of stay in the hospital[15,13,4]. Venous pathway catheters (VP) can effectively monitor the patient’s vital signs and guide the resuscitation of patients with severe bleeding or shock. However, the complications of VP are related to the location and number of catheters, and the complications of different locations are also different. The axillary vein is a relatively common catheterization site, but it is not currently used for emergency resuscitation or diagnosis because of the complications of multiple punctures and poor accessibility. Ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization has the advantages of real-time catheterism guidance, short placement time and low complication rate. It is worth studying whether ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization is feasible in critically ill multiple trauma patients and whether it can better guide clinical diagnosis and treatment
Primary Research Questions
======================
 Does ultrasound-guided access to axillary veins in patients with trauma improve catheter placement?  By the accuracy of the CVP, the position of the catheter (the depth of the catheter is close to the heart), and the thromboembolic events, and we found that ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization is feasible and effective in severely injured patients who require life support.
 What effect does ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization have on multi-trauma patients?  After the axillary vein puncture is completed, the vital signs of the patient (such as blood pressure and heart rate) were adjusted to maintain the vital signs of the patient unchanged or improved. The number of cases will be recorded. However, due to incomplete ultrasound information, we will only observe it
 Is ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization feasible in patients with severe multi-trauma?  After the ultrasound examination is completed. The ultrasound examiner draws the location of the guide wire on the paper and completes the catheterization
 Are there any special adverse reactions with ultrasound-guided axillary veins? 
The adverse reactions that may occur include

There are two treatment goals of this trial. First, it aims to evaluate the safety and feasibility of the dose and schedule of cevostamab for patients who have received a lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen. If the dose/schedule of cevostamab is found to be safe and well tolerated in patients who have received lymphodepleting myeloablative preconditioning, additional patients who have not received a prior lymphodepleting preconditioning regimen will be evaluated at this dose/schedule. Second, the study aims to evaluate the activity and efficacy of cevostamab in patients with multiple myeloma post CAR T cell therapy. More specifically, cevostamab is being evaluated for the overall response rate and depth of response at 6 and 12 months post CAR T cell therapy.

 <EOD> In vivo demonstration of the functional role of myocardial nitric oxide synthase in the setting of ischemia and reperfusion.
Ischemia, reperfusion, and oxidative stress are important components of the myocardial injury inflicted by both myocardial infarction and the inflammatory response. Nitric oxide (NO) is a free radical implicated in a variety of biological processes, including cardiovascular homeostasis. This study was designed to determine the contribution of myocardial NO synthase (NOS) and oxidant scavenger function in ischemic injury and in the inflammatory response. Pig myocardium in vivo, pig coronary endothelium, and cultured aortic endothelial cells in vitro were used. In pigs under halothane anesthesia, a double-occlusion perfusion model was used to deliver a 30-minute global ischemic insult, followed by 2.5 hours of reperfusion. Pretreatment with an inhibitor or activator of myocardial NOS had no effect on ischemic contractile function, but produced a difference in infarct size of 50%. In vitro, using pig coronary endothelium, acetylcholine-stimulated NOS activity was dependent on the presence of an antioxidant and inhibited by the NO scavenger 2-phenyl-4,4, 5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl 3-oxide. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with the activator NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester reduced superoxide generation in response to phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate. In cultured aortic endothelium exposed to lipopolysaccharide, NO scavenger or the NOS inhibitor NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester increased superoxide production. We conclude that basal NO synthesis has a salutary effect on myocardial function. However, NOS activity has no protective effect against ischemic injury when exposed to the inflammatory response and associated oxidative stress. <EOD> NIH research funding for alcohol and alcohol-related disorders, 1950-86.
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has consistently supported a disproportionate amount of alcohol research compared with other areas of health-related research. This paper provides an overview of NIH research funding for alcohol and alcohol-related disorders covering Fiscal Years 1950-86. The funding in this field has increased considerably since 1969. The majority of the NIH funding has targeted basic research. <EOD> Inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase attenuates experimental seizures and associated brain edema.
Although anticonvulsants are effective in controlling seizures, anticonvulsant drugs for clinical use are not always efficacious because of their side effects or resistance of epilepsy. Therefore, anticonvulsant development should take into consideration neuroprotection as well as seizure suppression. We demonstrated that adenosine, which is an endogenous neuromodulator and can modulate seizures, decreases excitotoxicity induced by glutamate in the brain. Adenosine, like the anticonvulsant drug gabapentin, inhibits neurotransmitter release through its binding to the presynaptic adenosine A1 receptor and subsequent modulation on the protein kinase C signaling pathway. Recently, we developed adenosine analogues, namely 3-bromo-1-methyl-3',5'-dideoxyuridine and R-3"

 <EOD> A new class of highly efficient and environmentally friendly polymeric p-type cocatalysts for the photocatalytic reduction of pyrrole.
Three new polymeric p-type N-doped cocatalysts based on an anthracene core and triazine arms with varying number of triazine units, namely PAN1, PAN2 and PAN2T, were developed for the photocatalytic reduction of pyrrole. The PAN1 and PAN2 catalysts based on 2-azatriazine (3MTH, 1-methyl-6-(3-sulfonatopropylcarbamoyl) triazine) were found to exhibit the highest pyrrole conversion of 2422 and 1902 % with turnover numbers (TONs) and turnover frequencies (TOFs) of 742 000 and 393 and 439 000 and 271, respectively among all the polymeric cocatalysts. The PAN2T which contained a pendent trimethylene moiety was the most reactive catalyst for the pyrrole reduction. PAN2T showed an extremely high pyrrole conversion of 437 000 %, corresponding to a TOF value of 283 compared to that of PAN2 and 327 and 216 for PAN1. These superior features of the new polymeric cocatalysts were attributed to the increased molecular flexibility. The activity of the new polymeric cocatalysts was observed to decrease with the increasing number of triazine units in the cocatalysts, which decreased the molecular flexibility. <EOD> The effectiveness of community pharmacy-led interventions in promoting health and optimising medication adherence

Additional Information: [/INST] <EOD> Fostering nursing competence in primary care: development of a new competence framework.
The healthcare system is under changing pressure to change and to respond to the needs of its citizens. Patient demands are increasing and there are new opportunities and challenges for healthcare professionals in the community. It has been suggested that the core principles by which nurses seek to deliver patient-centred care in primary care settings are poorly understood by other professional and management groups in primary care. To date, a major research gap is the limited availability of comprehensive frameworks of nursing competence that can be used as a basis for identifying competence, for mapping competence levels, and for devising curricula for nurses and for developing quality standards for nursing care in primary care. This paper reports the first development steps of a new competence framework for nurses in primary care that is being designed for both qualitative and quantitative testing and validation. The study explores the perspectives and expectations of a wide range of stakeholders in primary care, including GPs, community nurses, nurse educators, nursing managers, primary care organisations, patient and informal caregivers, and nurse-specific and primary care organisations, on the core competences of nurses providing care in community and primary care. Data will include focus group discussions, semistructured interviews, role-play interviews, surveys and literature reviews. These results will feed into a series of Delphi procedures with primary care stakeholders to generate consensus on the core competences, and to identify the learning approaches that are required to build these competences. Through this process, the proposed new competence framework for nurses in primary care will be refined, resulting in a more comprehensive, competence-based framework, and will be tested with a small sample of GPs, nurses and patients. <EOD> The efficacy of different vaginal preparations for cleansing immediately prior to surgery
Summary. The effect of various vaginal preparations on the bacterial flora was studied in 185 women with or without evidence of discharge. Women undergoing elective gynaecological surgery were allocated to one of eight treatment groups, i.e. saline (controls), gynocil or 2% aqueous povidone‐iodine (Betadine); or 4% povidone‐iodine in gel (Iodinol) or solution (Prepiderm). The bacteria isolated from the lower vagina were identified with biochemical reactions and antisera, and analysed with a computer for relative proportions of aerobic and facultative anaerobic micro‐organisms. These methods were more sensitive than culture, but the differences between preparations were not always consistent with the clinical findings. This study suggests that vaginal cleansing alone may result in a significant diminution in the overall bacterial counts. <EOD> In Vitro Analysis of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus Type 1 p6 Gag Protein: the Importance of the PTAP Motif for Infectivity
ABSTRACT The p6 domain of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag polyprotein is critical for virus infectivity. p6 contains a basic cluster and a proline-arginine-alanine-proline-alanine-threonine (PTAP)-motif important for an early event in virus replication. Previously, we found that p6 is required for efficient reverse transcription. Here we investigated the impact of a complete deletion in the p6 N terminus on HIV-1 replication. The complete deletion caused reduced cytosolic reverse transcription and integration of the viral cDNA. After integration, the mutant virus replicated as efficiently as the control, but virions contained a less-than-expected amount of viral RNA. Virion-contained viral RNA was a minor viral RNA species when compared to virions containing wild-type viral RNA. The deletion in p6 did not affect virion assembly. Next, RNA inhibition studies revealed that the reduced amount of virion-contained viral RNA was correlated with a reduced p6 protein amount. To exclude cellular factors that inadvertently block efficient reverse transcription or integration, we transiently expressed p6 in cells after HIV-1 infection. Transiently expressed p6 increased reverse transcriptase (RT) activity of the infecting HIV-1 virion in the"

Study Overview

Detailed Description

 <EOD> Effect of the addition of the A2A adenosine receptor antagonist ZM241385 on extracellular concentrations of adenosine in the rat striatum
Adenosine receptors (AR) have been shown to be involved in the neurochemical and behavioral effects of drugs that activate striatal dopamine (DA) transmission such as cocaine. It has been suggested that endogenous adenosine could be a modulator of cocaine-induced behaviors. However, few data have been reported on the role of endogenous striatal adenosine in the regulation of the activity of DA neurons. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of the adenosine A2A receptor antagonist ZM241385 on adenosine release in the striatum of rat brain. Rats were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg i.p.), the striatum was perfused with physiological saline solution (1.0 ml/min) and the effluent was collected in an ice-cooled tube and monitored by HPLC. In one set of experiments, saline was infused as control. In a second set of experiments, 145 nmol ZM241385 was infused for 40 min. The infusion of ZM241385 produced a dose-depenent elevation of adenosine extracellular levels. The A2A receptor antagonism was also found to produce a long-lasting facilitatory effect on adenosine accumulation, indicating that the adenosine A2A receptor blockade may produce some form of desensitization of adenosinergic transmission in the striatum of rats. <EOD> In Vitro Cultivation of Primary Human Hepatocytes Improves Phospholipidosis Induction by Antifungal Drugs.
Clinical observation of drug-induced phospholipidosis is a serious concern in drug development and clinical practice. An in vitro cell model that adequately simulates its in vivo liver concentration is in high demand regarding assessment of toxicity. The current in vitro cultivation of primary hepatocytes showed low phospholipidosis-inducing effects of antifungal drugs on both the cell number and viability of human primary hepatocytes (HPH), whereas prolonged culture period facilitated the effect. To clarify the discrepancy of the effects of the culture period, we analyzed the expression of lysosomal enzymes. Heparin-stimulated lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity was used to measure the function of lysosomes, and the gene expression of heparin-stimulated LPL, cathepsin D, mannose 6-phosphate receptor or cathepsin B was analyzed. The LPL activity showed consistent profiles of drug-induced phospholipidosis, indicating that the culture of HPH stimulates LPL activity and lysosomal function. Therefore, an in vitro cultivation of HPH improves the assessment of drug-induced phospholipidosis. <EOD> .

The column was used to concentrate proteins of interest selectively from complex human urine (e.g., from"

 <EOD> A case series study of long‐term continuous intrathecal administration of recombinant nerve growth factor using a Port‐A‐Cath implanted for Parkinson's disease
Intrathecal administration of a recombinant nerve growth factor (2 mg/ml) has been used from 1996 to 2001 in an open study to treat 14 patients suffering from disabling tremor‐dominant Parkinson's disease, with an implanted Port‐A‐Cath permitting long‐term continuous cerebrospinal fluid delivery. We describe here a case series study, with inclusion of all patients treated during the whole study (14 individuals and 13 treatment cycles), with a treatment period varying from 2 to 58 months. At baseline, 8 patients were naive, and 6 patients had previously received either conventional long‐term intrathecal or systemic therapies with good tolerance (2 had already tried 1 or 2 intrathecal therapies, 4 had already tried 1 systemic therapy). Long‐term tolerance of intrathecal recombinant human nerve growth factor was favourable. During the study, we observed 9 episodes of injection failure (21% of total events) leading to transient local inflammatory and/or neuralgia symptoms. Injection of a local corticosteroid was sufficient to treat the local inflammation. The neuralgia could only be resolved by intrathecal treatment of a subarachnoid nodule by chemotherapy. A slight reduction in spasticity was observed in 2 patients, but this was not related to an obvious increase in the dose. We did not observe any significant effect of intrathecal administration with respect to the severity of the disease, its evolution or treatment resistance to conventional treatments. Further studies will be needed to determine whether this is due to a small sample size and/or a different clinical efficacy of nerve growth factor on subgroups of patients. <EOD> Synthesis of Phosphorylated Tripeptide Antagonists Based Using a Combination of Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis, Native Chemical Ligation and H-Phosphonylation.
In the course of work on the preparation of C2- and C3-aminothiazoles, H-phosphonylation of peptides was used as alternative strategy to N-deprotection. In this case the phosphonic moiety is introduced into a peptide via native chemical ligation of phosphinyl benzyl oxazoline containing intermediates (PhenOZ). The PMP (phosphoramidate of meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid) containing thio-ester substrates were used to study the scope of this method. Phosphinylated dipeptide, tripeptide, decapep-tidic and undecapeptide substrates were converted into phosphorylated peptides at high yield and stereoselectivity using this approach. The application of this method to phosphorylation of TAT peptides resulted in the phosphorylation of Arg and Lys residues. The phsphorylated analogues of phosphorylated tripeptides of the sequence Ac-Tyr(PO4But)-Arg-Phe-NH2 (RFRP) were compared with the corresponding non-phosphorylated peptides. All peptides displayed moderate inhibitory activity towards thrombin. <EOD> Aortic Diseases in Adult Scimitar Syndrome and Left Main Coronary Artery Agenesis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis

Background:The 17-18 Mb region of the distal chromosome 7q is the strongest associated locus for both diabetes and type 2 diabetes-related traits. Its association has been observed in Caucasians and Asians, although not in African Americans.Methods and Results:In the present study we investigated the influence of an 8 Mb region of the distal chromosome 7q on the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy, diabetic angiopathy, carotid intima media thickness (IMT) and carotid artery occlusion (CAO) and on high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in 127 patients with type 1 diabetes. This chromosomal segment contains four polymorphisms in strong LD, one of which, rs17849027, is in the gene AC084667-1 (AC084667-001). The analysis was performed by genotyping individuals with high-density microarrays and by assessing the association between SNPs from the studied region and the analysed phenotypes, adjusted for covariates. Our results showed that type 1 diabetic patients with the GG genotype of rs17849027 have a reduced probability of diabetic neuropathy and diabetic angiopathy when compared to type 1 diabetic patients with the CC genotype (P < 0.05). In addition, they presented higher levels of HDL (0.25 vs. 0.0 mmol/L, P = 0.09) and LDL cholesterol (4.72 vs. 3.38 mmol/L, P = 0.005), as well as a significantly decreased prevalence of CAO (18/69 vs. 35/62, P = 0.001), when compared to individuals with the C allele. No significant association was found for IMT, a phenotypic quantitative trait.Conclusions:Our study suggests that the rs17849027 on chromosome 7q may participate in the modulation of carotid artery occlusion and diabetic complications in young type 1 diabetic patients. Moreover, our results reinforce the hypothesis that variants of AC084667-1 gene contribute to cardiometabolic phenotypes and modulate plasma lipid levels.

Input Text: Continuing Somatostatin Analogues Upon Progression in Neuroendocrine Tumour pAtients - The SAUNA Trial <EOD> Characterization of Differential Protein Expression in Plasma of Women with Breast Cancer

PURPOSE: Early detection of cancer improves the outcome of patients. The development of proteomic technologies has enabled the detection of novel proteins in cancerous plasma. We investigated differential protein expression between plasma of breast cancer patients and normal controls, through proteomic analysis. AIMS: We aimed to investigate protein expression patterns in the plasma of breast cancer patients to gain more biological insight into the pathophysiology of breast cancer. Additionally, we investigated serum proteins useful as early biomarkers of breast cancer.METHODS:The differential proteomic study was based on two-dimensional electrophoresis, matrixassisted laser desorption/ionisation time of flight /TOF mass spectrometry and mass-spectrometry-derived proteomics analysis of plasma from 18 breast cancer patients at the time of diagnosis and 18 age-matched noncancerous controls and the expression level of the targeted proteins were cross-checked with a tissue microarray method.RESULTS:We found 7 differentially expressed proteins in the plasma of 12 patients from group 1 compared to age-matched normal controls: prothrombin (PRT), hemopexin (HPX), apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), apolipoprotein A-II (apoA-II), transthyretin (TTR), serotransferrin (TF) and apolipoprotein-C-III (apoC-III). The expression of the prothrombin precursor (prtT) gene was also significantly upregulated (≥2.0 times increase) in breast cancer tissue as compared to normal tissue as investigated though the GeneChip array database and other bioinformatics analysis.CONCLUSIONS:These findings identified previously described proteins as possible biomarkers for breast cancer detection. Also we identified new protein targets (ApoC-III, ApoA-I, ApoA-II and serotransferrin) that should be further investigated.

871,"[/INST] <EOD> The relationship of diastolic blood pressure to the severity of left ventricular remodeling in the spontaneously hypertensive rat
The relationship between left ventricular mass and hypertrophy of the left ventricular wall is not well understood. Left ventricular mass in the spontaneously hypertensive rat has a nonlinear relationship with arterial hypertension, and there may be separate components of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in the setting of arterial hypertension. The relationship between left ventricular hypertrophy and other indices of left ventricular mass was assessed using the relation: left ventricular mass index (LVMI) = a + b · diastolic blood pressure (BP) + c · LVH. The present study tested the hypothesis that an increase in diastolic blood pressure would be a stronger predictor of increased LVM and myocyte size. Therefore, the study investigated the relationships between indices of myocyte cross sectional area (XSA), as determined by immunostained cTnI-positive area, and left ventricular myocyte cross sectional area (MyoXSA), left ventricular end diastolic mass (LVEDM), and heart rate (HR). Male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) at 23 weeks of age (n = 12) were compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats (n = 11). The relationships between LVEDM and HR (R = 0.895, P < 0.001) and between LVXSA and HR (R = 0.885, P < 0.001) were significant. The relationship between LVM and HR (R = 0.836, P < 0.001), however, was not significant. Increased levels of BP were associated with an increased LVEDM. The regression equation relating LVMI and BP was Y = 33 mg (g heart)−1 + 1.07× diastolic BP. The regression equation relating LVMI and BP was Y = 6.5 g−1 + 0.60× diastolic BP. The relationships were not statistically significant. The equation relating diastolic BP and left ventricular myocyte size was Y = 0.42 g (g heart)−2 + 0.014 BP. The relationship between  was significant (R = 0.711, P < 0.001). The current study indicated that LVEDM and MyoXSA were closely correlated but that LVM was not. Increased levels of BP were associated with increased LVEDM, and diastolic BP was an independent predictor of MyoXSA and LVMI. Therefore, diastolic BP and LVMI were not correlated, which supports the hypothesis that an increased diastolic BP was a stronger predictor than an increase in LVM of increased MyoXSA and LVCSA. <EOD> .
To prevent lymph node (LN) metastasis, extensive LN dissection (E-LND) of head and neck cancer has been performed extensively. According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, E-LND with or without preoperative chemotherapy (NAC) can be recommended. In the present study, we analyzed the effect of NAC on recurrence of advanced hypopharyngeal cancer, where E-LND was performed. Fifty-four cases of advanced hypopharyngeal cancer who were treated surgically only or NAC followed by surgery (NACS) at Kitasato University Hospital in the past 10 years were investigated. The patients were classified into 2 groups: those with E-LND (23 cases without NAC, 4 cases with NAC) and those without E-LND (10 cases without NAC, 17 cases with NAC). There was no regional recurrence in the E-LND group. However, there were 9 cases of failure within the E-LND area in the other 24 cases (37%). In the NACS group, no regional recurrence was observed. The NACS group showed a better prognosis than the other 2 groups with E-LND (-) or a NAC(-) group. Based on the"

 <EOD> Nutrition and immunity.
The intake of antioxidant foods has in recent years been of much interest. They are believed to provide protection against various diseases. Epidemiological studies suggest that high intake is associated with a reduced risk of different types of cancer. Among various antioxidants, vitamin E has been studied most frequently, because of its high content in most vegetable oils. There are several different vitamin E isomers with various activities, but there are no epidemiological studies based on specific isomer activities. The best absorbed and best distributed isomers, alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol, are probably those that are most important in prevention of cancer. Epidemiological studies suggest different effects of vitamin E isomers on prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and lung cancer. Thus, there is need for more studies on nutrients and cancer, in particular on effects of the different vitamin E isomers. <EOD> Dermatomyositis–like lesions associated with pembrolizumab in non–small cell lung cancer. A case report

Keywords:Dermatomyositislike lesion Immune check-point inhibition Pembrolizumab Non-small cell lung carcinoma Autoantibodies F-FDG PET/CT MDA5 Laminin-332 Case Description: We report a 60-year-old female patient with a history of non-small cell lung cancer with metastases to the brain receiving treatment with the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab. 6 weeks into treatment, the patient developed a periorbital heliotrope rash and hyperkeratotic skin changes on her shins. The patient's autoantibody panel revealed an anti-MDA-5 antibody. Due to the rapid clinical and radiological changes, this was felt most likely to be a drug-induced dermatomyositis-like dermatosis rather than a paraneoplastic phenotype. Discussion: Non-small cell lung carcinoma patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors may present with a dermatomyositis-like phenotype due to the expression of various autoantigens in those malignancies. The mechanism of immunotherapy-induced dermatomyositis is still to be elucidated. Conclusion: This case highlights a rare paraneoplastic neurologic syndrome that may present during the administration of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Clinical monitoring of patients over time as well as biopsies and autoantibody assessments are important to determine the precise etiology of any new phenotypic changes.

# Introduction
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become an important armamentarium to induce antitumor immunity. ICB encompasses antibodies that interfere with the binding of inhibitory cell surface molecules in the negative regulatory circuit, i.e., cytotoxic Tlymphocyte associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1), to their respective ligands. The programmed deathligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors pembrolizumab and atezolizumab are Food and Drug Administration (FDA)approved for the treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC); however, these immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) can potentially have autoimmune side effects   Tumour immunology and immunotherapy: understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor immunogenicity and..., Goy  .

Aims: To evaluate the cerebral autoregulation index by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients undergoing general anesthesia. It is not uncommon to adjust anesthesia depth under general anesthesia to a fixed value. This fixed number does not respond to each individual response, but rather to a target number. However, there is little evidence concerning the optimum arterial pressure value and the best method to maintain it. The hypothesis of this study is that the use of monitoring based on multimodal variables, including cerebral oximetry, allows titration of pressure to optimize the cerebral flow and to protect cerebral oxygenation. The aim is to evaluate cerebral autoregulation (CA) by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) in patients under deep anesthesia. This study combines the evaluation of CA by NIRS with other hemodynamic and electroencephalographic variables (EEG). CA is defined as the autoregulation of cerebral circulation, which allows blood flow and oxygenation to be maintained in a cerebral blood flow range of 30 to 65 cm H2O. Changes of pressure and cerebral flow (Vm) will be compared in order to obtain the best formula to predict autoregulation index calculated by NIRS:
Spectral Edge Frequency (SEF) is an index which, once corrected with SEF95, is used to identify the autoregulation threshold.
Cerebral Vm will be measured from the middle cerebral artery by TCD and the brain oxygenation will be measured by NIRS using a specific sensor placed on the front of the patient's forehead. The hypothesis of this study is that the use of monitoring based on multimodal variables, including NIRS, allows titration of pressure to optimize the cerebral flow and cerebral oxygenation. Secondary outcomes of the study will be the evaluation whether the adjustment of arterial pressure influences the frontal EEG and burst suppression and the use of the neuromuscular block may have an influence on the use of the use of the delivered dosing opaccurate dosing burst suppression with all the relationship of the influence to ensure that the pressure-induction the depth influence of anest clinical effect of hemod the frontal dose pressure the drug influence of the pressure adjustment-controlled depth of the effect and influence on the anestimprovided on the depth of Influence pressure is admin of the depth and depth of information on patient anest information on the depth influence is how to influence pressure monitor the degree on depth of influence <EOD> depth.

17-Beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 6 (HSD) is a soluble enzyme whose main function is to convert the weakly estrogenic and androgenic 17-beta-estradiol and androstenedione into the potent hormones estradiol-17-beta, and testosterone, respectively, thereby lowering the amount of endogenous estrogen available to the body. This enzyme is expressed ubiquitously and is present in greatest concentration in the liver. The entire mouse HSD type 6 cDNA has been isolated and sequenced from cDNA libraries of mouse liver. The predicted polypeptide deduced by DNA sequencing of the clone is 307 amino acids. Northern blot analysis reveals two forms of the HSD type 6 mRNA with estimated sizes of 3.4 kb and 4.3 kb. The cDNA clone has been labeled with 3'-fluorescein and used to probe the same blot for relative abundance of these two message species. <EOD> Transmission Electron Microscopy in the Diagnosis of Parvovirus B19-Induced Erythroblastopenia

Parvovirus B19 (B19) constitutes the largest serotype of the human parvoviruses and is responsible for numerous human diseases. It causes a wide variety of syndromes, including exanthema subitum, erythrocyte aplasia, hydrops fetalis, and neurological disease ranging from aseptic meningoencephalitis to hydrocephalus and myelitis in immunocompromised or immunodeficient individuals. We report herein a pediatric patient found to have erythroblastopenia caused by B19 infection. A 2-year-old male presented with fever, diarrhea, and vomiting. A 99.9% parvovirus B19 genome quantity was detected in the patient's serum by real-time polymerase chain reaction. An ultrastructural analysis suggested that the pathogenesis of erythroblastopenia and subsequent anemia should be attributed to B19-induced apoptosis in erythroid progenitor cells. Transmission electron microscopy is a useful tool for diagnosing parvovirus B19-induced erythroblastopenia.

A: This answer is a bit late, but anyways...
Your steps did the job pretty well, but there were a few problems to be fixed.
First, some of the formatting.

Please Note: Some of this is taken from the manual, but edited to suit the question.

### ACT

#### Structure

Structure, Structure, Structure. It's easy to miss this one in our hurry to make something work quickly.
A lot of what makes the summaries hard is not simply the outputted text, it's more the formatting and structure that makes it hard to evaluate.
Let's talk about it quickly, I found it was important to know:
* Where text came (from the text source or a separate file)
* What the text was (plain text or formatted)
* What the text looked like (formatting is hard to extract)
* How big everything was (especially for tables of data)

We can take a look back at your output to find clues, so here we go.

You can see that this is the section most similar to the example from the manual. In this case is is slightly short of the exact amount that is required, which gives a bit of leeway. If this were the only section in the output then it's not that bad, but we have a few sections to consider, and this one has some formatting problems.

[/END]

This is a good example of it not being clear what this is supposed to be outputting. The first sentence seems to be a description of the output from the previous step.
The second sentence is clear, but the formatting makes it not very clear what it does. I get from the text that this is supposed to describe the participants, but all that comes out is a short line break indicating the end of the text.

The third sentence has a much better output, showing the participants as a list in a table format.

---------------------------------------------------------
The protocol for this study has been approved by the IRB (""Comité de Protection des Personnes"") and a written authorization has been taken from each center participating to this study before beginning the study. The investigated population will be all newborns with premature birth admitted to one of the participating centers in the same period of time as the recruitment of the patients in the study. Each newborn will be informed by their doctor in charge. The objectives of this study are to describe the clinical abdominal condition of preterm newborns with digestive pathology and validate the “Clinical Evaluation Scale for Abdominal Condition of the Premature” (ECAP scale), in addition to determining whether a massage improves the clinical abdominal condition as assessed by the ECAP scale. The investigator has to respect each patient a maximum time delay of 30 minutes between two successive ECAP scales performed by the physiotherapist and then by the other two investigators (nurse and resident). Each evaluator will have to assess the abdominal condition blindly and will have to register the ECAP score on a standardized patient assessment form or on any other appropriate format. The ECAP score can range from 0 to 20 and is defined as follows:
Score 0: the infant is considered to have a perfect abdominal condition (well-distended, firm, without abdominal folds, and with good skin turgor).
Score 1: the physiotherapist will have to choose between one of the following two situations:
-Abdominal distension: The infant has a significantly distended abdomen that extends to the inguinal folds, with the possibility of being able to compress the abdomen and flatten the distension by an abdominal glabella massage (""abdominal distension"" can be present in the absence of hypomotility).
-Hypomotility: The infant has a significantly depressed abdomen with the possibility to compress the abdomen and flatten the distension by an abdominal glabella massage (""hypomotility"" can be present in the presence of normal/normal or distended abdomen).
Score 2: This score has to be established if there is an abdominal complication (for any reason) that does not allow an abdominal glabella massage. If the physiotherapist has used a supine massage position, he/she should only note this information without scoring it. If a supine massage position is necessary, this situation will count as the presence of an abdominal complication (""supine massage"" has to be noted at the assessment form).
Score 3: the infant is considered not able to have an abdominal glabella massage with a massage position, even in the prone or supine position. ""Non feasable"" and ""supine massage"" have to be noted at the assessment form.
Each assessment score has to be added and an overall score has to be calculated by summing the 8 ECAP scores. Depending on the global assessment score, the infants will be grouped at 3 levels:

 Level 1: ""Hypomotility"" is the most common (40% of the infants) and the most severe (30% of the study population).
 Level 2: ""Abdominal Distension"": the infants will have no obvious hypomotility with a significantly distended abdomen.

[/INST] <EOD> The impact of the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic on malaria.
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) epidemic has profoundly altered the spectrum of diseases transmitted by mosquito vectors and the geographic distribution of malaria. The World Health Organization estimated that, by the end of 1992, approximately 17.5 million people in 35 malaria-endemic countries had contracted the HIV virus, 10 million in 5 African countries, and 7 million in sub-Srahane African countries. In malaria endemic areas, the HIV virus interacts with malaria in several ways. Although it is not always appreciated in developed countries, most people with HIV/AIDS do have a substantially increased susceptibility to the severe forms of Plasmodium falciparum malaria, and many will have clinical malaria. In malaria-endemic countries, the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic results in large numbers of people with a severe form of malaria, a significant increase in the death rate, and a major socioeconomic cost. In addition, the emerging HIV/AIDS epidemic is contributing to a reduction in malaria transmission by weakening the immune surveillance against the human infective stages of malaria parasites. Finally, the HIV virus decreases the effective coverage of interventions against malaria, including the distribution of insecticide-treated bednets. Control programs need to rapidly adapt their strategies to minimize the negative impact of the double epidemics on population health. The most cost-effective response will be a combination of measures. To reduce exposure to mosquitoes, people with HIV may use insecticide-treated bednets or topical repellents or both. To reduce infection with malaria, some prophylaxis against malaria for people with AIDS may be offered because their immunodeficiency causes them to be particularly susceptible to the fatal consequences of the infection. To minimize malaria's negative impact by increasing access to interventions, malaria intervention campaigns should be expanded to encompass everyone, regardless of HIV status. Also, programs aimed at people with HIV may require measures to control malaria. Improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of AIDS may increase the demand for diagnostic and treatment facilities for malaria. <EOD> A simple method for the isolation of chlamydial bodies from infected cell monolayers
SUMMARY A technique for the isolation of chlamydial bodies from infected BALB/c mouse kidney tissue culture cell monolayers is described. The procedure, using discontinuous Percoll gradients, results in the recovery of a chlamydial fraction with a high yield of undamaged cells. Using this technique, intracellular organisms and protoplasmic inclusions are found at lower densities than particles which are not intra-cellular. <EOD> Effect of a chest compression feedback device on nursing students' compression depth during cardiopulmonary resuscitation

Background/aim: This study aimed to evaluate whether the effect of a feedback device, the Compression Sensor (CS), on the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) performance of nursing students is superior to standard CPR training or whether they benefit equally.Material and methods:In this randomized single-blinded study, the participants were randomly divided into 3 groups in accordance with the random number table and were trained with the following as a single session of 30 min each: control group, which received standard CPR training only; training A group, which received standard CPR training and CS training; and training B group, which received standard CPR and feedback training. Three separate tests were conducted on each participant who took part in the study and all data were recorded. The data analysis of the tests was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).Results: A total of 61 students participated in the study, 20 in each group. The first test was conducted on the participants after they watched the training video, standard CPR training was conducted during the second test, and feedback training was conducted during the third test. In the test conducted after standard CPR training, the mean compression depth of 136 mm was found as the main factor in the training of the control group. On the other hand, the mean compression depths of 44 mm, 51 mm, and 55 mm were"

 <EOD> Phenotypes of human platelets with different surface glycans after purification with immunomagnetic beads

Background: The number of platelets recovered from apheresis products of patients is decreasing. In some studies, the efficiency of platelet collection can be increased by selecting a cell donor with a high level of carbohydrate antigens (glycoforms) on the platelet surface. Purification of platelets using commercially available immunomagnetic beads enables preparation of a homogeneous platelet suspension, with low contamination with red blood cells and leukocytes, that is not possible using standard methods.Methods: The study population consisted of 16 platelet donors divided into 2 groups: patients with low to moderate level of NeuAcα2-3Gal- (group 1) and high to very high level of Fuc-α1-2Gal-(23S) H type 2 glycoforms (group 2). After separation of platelet-enriched plasma by immunomagnetic beads, the fraction of cells with various CD55/CD59 membrane phenotypes was determined by flow cytometry. Platelet size and granularity were evaluated by flow cytometry and impedance measurements by impedance aggregometry, and the number of nucleated erythroblasts and leukocytes was determined by a morphological method.
Results: The highest level of NeuAcα2-3Gal (23S)-H type 2 glycoproteins was detected in group 2 cells (p < 0.001). Significantly fewer platelets of this group expressed CD55, than platelets of group 1 (p < 0.001). Conversely, platelets of group 1 expressed more CD55 than the leukocytes of group 2 patients (p < 0.001). The amount of CD59 did not differ between the two cohorts and was higher in platelets compared, leukocytes (p < 0.001). The mean platelet volume and platelet distribution width were less in group 1 platelets (p < 0.001). In 5 patients of group 2, nucleated erythroblasts, and in 10 patients of group 1, nucleated lymphocytes were observed. Higher platelet activation in group 1 was found by analysis of impedance aggregometry (p < 0.05).

### The target population
The target population is poor graft function after allo-HSCT.

### The information of this study
The information of this study has provided a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the provided study.

### The results of the study

### Summary
In conclusion, from the information, the researchers conducted clinical trials on patients
in poor graft function with the treatment of Mesenchymal Stem Cells(MSCs) for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation

Suggested improvements in the Summary
- Rephrase the content. There is no need to show too rigorous words. It would be okay to use ""poor graft function"" and even ""PGBF"".
- When you mention ""poor graft function"", it is good to have a sentence saying ""Patients who do not meet the remission criteria or whose hemograms do not improve after the use of recombinant erythropoietin or subcutaneous transfusion are defined as poor graft function"".
- If you could choose the keywords, I would be like ""cell therapy/allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant/poor graft function/treatment.""
- When describing the MSCs part, I think it would be better to say ""MSCs treatment group / Biological: mesenchymal stromal cells / MSCs injection / MSCs group"" and ""On the basis of conventional PGF treatment for poor implantation, the enrolled"

 <EOD> Dissolved Organic Carbons in River Water as Influenced and Explained by Biotope.
Riverine dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a major part of all organic materials in the aquatic environment. DOC is responsible for the aquatic environment's major biogeochemical and ecological processes like biomass production, the decomposition of detritus and bacterial activities. These processes directly depend on the aquatic environment's organic carbon source. In this study, we analyzed several different freshwater biotopes in the Upper, Middle, and Lower Danube to characterize the DOC composition in freshwater ecosystems and to discuss the DOC variation in riverine systems. A total of 232 samples, each including the water and particulate matter, were analyzed with elemental (TOC and TOC) and Fourier transformed infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy of the liquid extracts. The most prominent results can be summarized as follows: (i) The proportion of the DOC in the particulate matter (particle-bound organic carbon, POC) compared to the dissolved DOC (DOC) varied considerably depending on the environment. In lake sediments, it was as low as 15%, while in the riverine areas, it rose to more than 35%. (ii) The organic matter content measured as total organic carbon (TOC) also showed pronounced differences between the riverine, floodplain, and lake environments. It ranged between 40% and 260%, and the FTIR spectral features (hydrogen/olefin ratios and N/C ratios) of DOC were different in some cases significantly enough to indicate a discrepancy. The distribution over biotopes in both the hydrophilic and hydrophobic fractions was considerably different in the different areas. This indicates that freshwater environments are extremely heterogeneous. Therefore, we recommend that future studies should sample at least three to four different areas of the riverbanks to have a better understanding of water quality in rivers. <EOD> Inhibition of the formation of bacteriophage T4 amber suppressor mRNA by antibiotics.
The effect of 2 and 4 different antibiotic treatments on the maturation of bacteriophage T4 bacterial infection of Escherichia coli MRE-61. RNAI, synthesized in the presence of rifampicin, was tested for suppression of amber mutants. In the first place 24, 27, 40, 67, 80 and 90 h infection was performed. RNA II was extracted from phage infected cells harvested at various time intervals after penetration of phage nucleicacids in the bacterial cell. The RNA preparations were assayed for the presence of active infecting ribonucleopolyprotein in vitro. The amount of this inhibition was compared to the amount of active phage DNA. The inhibition of RNAI formation varied. The results showed that RNAII synthesized at an early stage of infection (when the amount of phage DNA is still very low) might be more sensitive to inhibition than the RNAII produced later in infection. On the other hand, the effect of antibiotic treatment on late maturation and release of infecting particles may also have been due to inhibition of RNA II production at a late stage of infection. An attempt was made to establish a correlation between the inhibition of RNA II formation and the inhibition of infecting particle production. In this paper the results of a series of experiments are reported in which the influence of different stages of drug treatment on RNA II formation, and the results, in phage production are discussed. On the basis of these data, it is suggested to be possible to influence the production of T4 active infecting ribonucleoenzymes by antibiotics. <EOD> Exploring the relationship between metacyclic density and insect infection rates in Trypanosoma cruzi.

# NLP methods
=========================

# Introduction
In this appendix we discuss the NLP methods that we used in the paper. All of these methods are available on the publicly available package spaCy 1 . We also discuss the methods used in a recent NLP paper in this field 2 , as our NER is identical.

# Named Entity Recognition
NER is the task of identifying text spans that represent different named entities.
In the cardiac nutrition document, such named entities are the names of different patients and their diet, medications, and diagnoses. The NER method predicts the presence of every single span in the input text. For each span, the output tuple contains the span's start and end indexes, the entity type, and the entity value.
Below is an example of NER results by the Stanford NER model 3 .

![NER example](./images/named-entity-recognition-result.pdf)

The Stanford NER model 4 achieves high accuracy in our data, especially in the identification of the type of entities, and the values that make up the span. However, our evaluation is based on the detection of the spans instead of the values that make up the spans. Therefore, we will investigate using different models with different architectures, in order to improve the detection of the spans.

# Needed Models
We have a few requirements from the models:
1. Model to be fast
2. Model should use the English language
3. Model should be open source with some documentation
The models that we will consider are:
- LSTM-CRF
- HuggingFace BERT
- HuggingFace DistilBERT
- SpaCy
- Spaced-word-augmented BiLSTM-CRF

# Evaluation metrics
We will report the performance of the NER models on the following measures:
- F1-score for clinical trial report document
- F1-score for a list of common nutrition terms
- Average word error rate (average weighted error rate over all tokens (words))

# Implementation details
SpaCy has a simple API and an easy-to-learn syntax and it produces very high scoring output.
Inspired by the spaCy model implementation in this Github repository,  we reimplemented the Spaced-word-augmented BiLSTM-CRF with Keras, while keeping the training setup as we did in that work. 

The Spaced-word-augmented BiLSTM-CRF model uses several augmentations, like the Spaced-word Embedding and word masking (word-shuffling and word-dropout), to boost the accuracy of the results. This is an improvement of the original BiLSTM-CRF implementation in spaCy. 
The Spaced-word Embedding uses a tokenizer function, that takes in a list of tokens as input and returns a list of index values (e.g. `0, 1, 9, 20, 29, 34, 37, 41, 56`.) The size of the list corresponds to the dimensions/dims of the model.

In 16 patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM) we studied the effectiveness of surgical relief of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction according to Grinch method with preservation of the mitral valve. We analyzed the effectiveness of the procedure which was controlled according to exercise-ECG results, Doppler echocardiographic data and radionuclide ventriculography. HOCM patients with a history of the disease over 8 years, severe symptomatics and high gradients at the outflow tract obstruction were selected for surgery. Preoperative control was arranged in 5 HOCM patients who were operated in the pre-surgical period. Patients were divided into two groups according to the type of gradient in HOCM. Group I included 9 HOCM patients with an increase of the gradient by the beginning of the attack of angina (in 24-462 patients of the same type). A comparison group comprised 7 patients with a stable form of disease. The mean age of the patients in group II was 36.5 +/- 7.38 years, disease period, 7.38 +/- 2.3 years (p > 0.05). 70 mg of propranolol showed positive therapeutic effect in 3 patients (p > 0.05), i.e. their symptoms disappeared; however, the signs of outflow tract obstruction remained. One patient needed a pacemaker to normalize sinus rhythm. Surgery in 8 HOCM patients consisted in Grinch's method (in one case with the implantation of a cardiac pacemaker) and in a partial removal of the mitral valve--in one patient who had simultaneous mitral stenosis. In patients who underwent the operation, the positive dynamics of circulation and an ejection fraction after surgery (52.3% +/- 11.35% and 61.66 +/- 5.8%, respectively) was observed. According to Doppler echocardiography the gradient in a prevalent left ventricular outflow tract decreased from 134 +/- 17.53 mm Hg preoperatively to 48.2 +/- 18.06 3 mm Hg postoperatively (p  0.05). After surgery ectopylegia diminished in all the patients by 50%. In 1 HOCM patient ectopylegia recovered and a positive result of coronary angiography was obtained. Grinch's method was effective in patients with hyperkinetic circulation. It permitted to solve a problem of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction successfully in 66-75% of the patients. Apart from favorable clinical results, Grinch's method had an effect on a decrease of rest and exercise load on the heart. <EOD> 54-year-old man with a painful lump on his left testis.

INTRODUCTION
Oculocutaneous albinism 4 (OCA4) syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with the SLC17A5 gene. It is characterized by nystagmus, photophobia, white forelock, hearing impairment followed by visual and neurological disturbances or blindness. Nephrocalcinosis is one of the severe complications occurring in these affected individuals.


METHODOLOGY
We diagnosed an 11-year-old boy with hypoplastic right kidney, left renal cyst, sensorineural hearing loss and an albinistic lesion on the right eyebrow. His first-degree brother had a similar clinical presentation and his maternal uncle and aunt affected with albinism. The molecular screening assays were performed to identify the SLC17A5 gene mutation in a three-generation family.

 <EOD> Highly Stereocontrolled Synthesis of Tetrahydroquinoline Labeled 5‐Aza‐2′‐deoxycytidine as a Therapeutic Nucleoside Analogue
DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark associated with gene transcription. DNA methyltransferases catalyze the transfer of a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine to the fifth position of cytosine (5mC), converting it to 5-methylcytosine (5mC). DNA methylation may activate or suppress gene expression by inhibiting their transcription. Aberrant DNA methylation contributes to the initiation and progression of tumors and is associated with resistance to therapy in cancers. Aza-2′-deoxycytidine (N1-β-d-arabinosyl-5-azacytosine-2′-deoxycytidine, azacytidine) and its metabolic analogue 5-azacytidine have been the main drugs used to target DNA methylation in clinics.  <EOD> Identification of miR-508 as a potential oncomiR targeting VHL in clear cell renal cell cancer

Background: MicroRNAs have been implicated in tumorigenesis as biomarkers for diagnosis, prognosis, and as therapeutic targets. MicroRNA-508 (miR-508), a reported tumor-related miRNA, was recently found to be overexpressed in a number of tumors, including breast cancer and gastric cancer, but its functional roles in renal cell cancer (RCC) have not been reported yet. Our present study aims to investigate the function of miR-508 in regulating growth and apoptosis in clear cell RCC (ccRCC).Methods: ccRCC clinical tissue samples and adjacent non-tumor tissues were analyzed for miR-508 expression by Real-time PCR. After over-expression of miR-508, the RCC cell growth and apoptosis were detected by MTT, colony formation assays and cell apoptosis, respectively. Target gene of miR-508 was analyzed by bioinformatics. miR-508 inhibitor was used to suppress miR-508 expression in RCC cells, and mRNA levels of VHL, PCNA and the p21 pathway were detected.Results: In contrast to high miR-508 expression level in RCC patient serum (n = 18), miR-508 expression was downregulated in both ccRCC clinical tissue samples and ccRCC cells. Ectopic miR-508 expression remarkably inhibited the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of ccRCC cell lines, and miR-508 inhibitor suppressed the proliferation of ccRCC cells. A set of differentially expressed miRNAs related to tumor proliferation and apoptosis were identified by gene expression microarray analysis. Using online bioinformatics algorithms, we identified von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor (VHL) 3'-UTR as a potential miR-508 target. As a direct target of miR-508, VHL was down-regulated in miR-508 transfected ccRCC cells, while up-regulated in ccRCC cells transfected with miR-508 inhibitor, which led to decreased expression of pVHL-induced tumor suppressor targets, Bcl-2, cyclinD1, PCNA, CDK4 and CDK6 and increased expression of p21 by WB assay and real-time PCR analysis. These results indicate that miR-508 can inhibit ccRCC cell proliferation via down-regulating pVHL, which is the substrate adaptor for Cul2-based E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3-ligases) complex and promotes its substrates p27 and p21 degradation through ubiquitin pathway. Taken together, miR-508 may act as an important regulator in ccRCC cell cycle and apoptosis by inhibiting pVHL.Conclusion: miR-508 is the new tumor oncomiR in vivo and in vitro, targeting onc"

 <EOD> Filling the Blanks: Using Clinical Research Outside of an Approved Setting
In the United States, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) regulates all medical products, and drugs are subject to stringent review before they can be marketed. FDA regulations in drug development include specific guidance in the Code of Federal Regulations (21 CFR) with respect to safety and efficacy. The approval of an Investigational New Drug (IND or 21 CFR 312) and approval of a New Drug Application (NDA or 21 CFR 314) allow for the use of medications in clinical investigational settings. These clinical trials are carried out to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new drug, and as such, they are limited to a highly selected population of patients, with strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. In the cases of rare disorders, these investigational drug studies may involve only a small number of eligible patients. For these diseases, inadequate randomized clinical trial evidence of efficacy may preclude an IND or NDA drug approval. When drug development has been halted or is otherwise impeded, desperate carers may turn, legally or not, to off-label or unapproved use of a drug, for a potentially life-saving treatment. Such “clinical pragmatism in drug development” may result in the use of drugs with unknown safety profiles, efficacy, or appropriate dose and frequency. In this article, we focus on the ethical dilemma faced by physicians in such situations. We review off-label and unlicensed drug-prescribing in Europe and other countries and explore the legal and ethical landscape of unlicensed use of drugs. Finally, we propose that the use of novel therapeutic agent under such conditions deserves recognition via a licensed “compassionate therapy.” <EOD> Changes in the Gut Microbiota Result in Altered Bile Acid Metabolism and Impaired Lipoprotein Metabolism in Mice
Objectives: The gut microbiota metabolizes dietary fiber and aromatic compounds derived from tryptophan metabolism to various bile acids (BAs) that regulate cholesterol metabolism. Our previous study showed that cholesterol metabolism is impaired in germ-free (GF) mice that lack the gut microbiota. The aim of this study is to determine whether changes in BA metabolism can explain the cholesterol metabolism disorder characteristic of GF mice. Approach and Results: We investigated whether changes in microbial composition are associated with altered BA metabolism in GF and microbiota-intact mice and whether these alterations play a role in dyslipidemia characteristic of GF mice. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that GF mice had decreased microbial diversity, increased Bacteroides spp., decreased Akkermansia muciniphila and Firmicutes, and absence of microbes in Clostridial cluster. We further revealed that microbiota-intact mice, which had been fed a high-fiber diet, had an abundant gut microbiome similar to that of conventionally housed mice. This gut microbiome was associated with increased primary BAs, elevated short-chain fatty acids, and elevated serum apolipoprotein A-I levels. GF mice displayed lower biliary cholesterol levels accompanied with impaired clearance of plasma cholesterol, suggesting decreased hepatic cholesterol clearance. When GF Fxr-/- mice were supplemented with a mixture of the primary BAs, CDCA-3&bgr;MCA-UDCA mixture, they recovered from chylomicron clearance disorder. Their plasma cholesterol and hepatic biliary cholesterol levels were improved, which corresponded to elevated apolipoprotein A-I levels, increased reverse cholesterol transport, and increased Bsep gene expression in the liver. Conversely, supplementation of an inhibitor of A. muciniphila activity, i.e., N-Butanoylmannosamine, increased hepatic cholesterol levels in conventional mice and induced hyperlipidem"

894,"[/INST] Single-center Prospective Study of Non-invasive Methods for the Diagnosis of Postoperative Complications in Liver Transplant Recipients

The objective of the study was to compare the performance of non-invasive markers in the early diagnosis of allograft dysfunction and graft failure.
In this single-center study, 70 patients with liver cirrhosis without any known causes of graft failure, receiving standard immunosupression prophylaxis (prednisone, tacrolimus, mycofenolate mofetil), were enrolled. Patients were monitored daily for bilirubin, INR, creatinin values, and underwent routine ultrasound and a Fibroscan examination. Acute cellular rejection (ACR) was diagnosed histologically and according to Ishak-Knodell scoring system, while acute rejection (AR), cholestatic rejection (CR), and hepatic artery thrombosis were diagnosed according to Banff 2009 criteria. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS software, and 95% confidence interval was calculated. All analyses were twosided, and a p-value<0.05 was considered significant.
Liver ultrasound was performed in all patients. In patients who had AR, the mean liver echogenic score was 1.75+0/79 and liver echogenic score was 2/79 in patients with CR or HA thrombosis.
Further conclusions from the article:
Ultrasound was useful in detecting the causes of graft failure and can be integrated into routine medical checkup procedures in liver transplant recipients.
Liver ultrasound and Fibroscan can be used as non-invasive markers for the early detection of AR, CR and HA thrombosis.

Conclusion: Liver ultrasound and Fibroscan are effective methods for early detect of transplant complications.

Submit Answer <EOD> Evolution of the human ventral prefrontal cortex.
Examination of the evolution of the human ventral prefrontal cortex (VPC) based on modern neuroimaging methods shows it to have become specialized for cognitive functions, including the acquisition and use of language. The VPC consists of a network of areas in the temporal and parietal lobes. Many studies show the VPC, except Broca's area (BA 45), to be significantly larger in humans compared with chimpanzees and other hominoid primates. The VPC in humans is most highly developed in temporal regions, particularly in the middle portion of the left superior temporal gyrus (temporal polar cortex), a region known to be part of the ventral language stream. The VPC is also more developed in the superior temporal sulcus and sulcal regions behind Heschl's gyrus, including the superior temporal gyrus and the parahippocampal region in the cingular cortex and around the uncus. The VPC is more developed in the temporal regions than any other part of the cerebral cortex of humans who have spoken at least a few words. Evolutionary comparisons show that in the VPC the relative size of cortical layers 4 (principally white matter) and 6 (principally gray matter) is larger in humans, with the laminar increase in white matter relatively greater than in gray matter. These data indicate that the VPCs of chimpanzees and humans differ in the anatomy of neurons, with relatively increased white matter and decreased gray matter in humans. The VPC, compared with the parietal cortex, has more white matter and less gray matter in humans, the corpus callosum is thicker and the cortex relatively thinner, and there is more white matter in gyri on all lobes, with the most profound increase in white matter of all regions in the temporal lobes. These evolutionary differences suggest adaptive advantages in humans, including increased ability to store and process information, as well as the development of language by specialized regions of the temporal lobes and their role in auditory cognition. <EOD> A review of the taxonomic revision performed in the Carychium genus in Portugal.

Background: Cerebellar ataxia may develop in diabetes, although it is rare. In India, this entity has received scant attention. Aim: The aim of our study was to assess the clinical utility of the Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA) and Scale for Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SANAD) in an Indian population. Materials and Methods: 38 cases of diabetic ataxia were included in the study. Ataxia was diagnosed by a consultant neurologist on the basis of the clinical features and neurological examination. The patients underwent nerve conduction studies, electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain. The severity and progression of the disease was assessed by SARA and SANAD. Statistical Analysis: Progression rates were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test, and intragroup and intergroup comparisons of SARA and SANAD scores were assessed using Repeated Measures Analysis of Variance. Results: Both the questionnaires revealed that cerebellar dysfunction in diabetes was similar and comparable to that of chronic alcoholism when compared at the same stages (P > 0.05), although they have their own limitations.

897,"[/INST] <EOD> The Drosophila gene rho restricts Myosin Driven constriction in the posterior midgut
Background: The small RhoA GTPase is a member of a family of molecular switches that mediate numerous cellular processes. In epithelial tissues RhoA functions downstream of cadherins and plays a central role in cytokinesis across evolutionary scales from simple bacteria to human cells. Midway between yeast and human in complexity lies the fly, and a thorough understanding of RhoA function in Drosophila would be a critical step in bridging the evolutionary divide and identifying common molecular mechanisms shared by all metazoans. Methods: The function of rhoA in midgut morphogenesis was studied in mutant animals and in cultured Drosophila midgut progenitor cells by direct knockdown with an RNAi inducible transgene. Fixed and live tissues were imaged with light and confocal microscopy. Analysis of cytoskeletal protein localization was performed by immunocytochemistry. Cell volume was measured by fluorescent dye uptake and membrane stretch by live imaging of the nuclear envelope protein, Lamin.Results: RhoA exhibits temporally dynamic expression in the midgut. Loss of function mutations lead to the complete loss of visceral muscle, and the severe intestinal overgrowth phenotype, previously ascribed to mutants of the Drosophila proapoptotic genes Diap1, caspase-8 dARK, and Ced-3. The rhoA phenotypes are not additive with loss of pro-apoptotic functions, suggesting that the rhoA phenotype is caused by defects in a parallel regulatory mechanism to apoptosis. Cytoskeletal proteins known to mediate myosin-driven morphogenetic movements in other Drosophila tissues are misregulated in rho null and knockdown midgut tissue in vivo. In cultured midgut progenitor cells the induction of rhoA results in cellular hypertrophy, decreased cell death, and cell surface area expansion.Conclusions: The loss of the Drosophila small GTPase, RhoA, affects cellular architecture, resulting in the misregulation of the intestinal muscle and epithelial compartments. Midgut cell size was found to be controlled by RhoA, supporting a model in which it acts as a global morphogenesis regulator controlling mitotic and cytoplasmic expansion.

# Background
The Rho family of small GTPases modulate the cytoskeleton to maintain tissue architecture and morphogenesis during development. RhoA is conserved from unicellular eukaryotes like Dictyostelium, to yeast, worms, flies, and mammals, and plays a pleiotropic role in cell cycle control, cytoskeletal organization, contractility, and motility (for review see   Rho GTPases and actin organization in polarized and migratory cells, Ward  .

Input Text: The Effect of Patient Education on Pain Management Pain management is a multidisciplinary approach that includes preoperative preparation of the patient, application of analgesic methods in the perioperative period, postoperative follow-up, and treatment of postoperative painful problems. Analgesia involves pharmacological treatment (preemptive/preemptive analgesia, analgesia) and non-pharmacological treatment (cold therapy, distraction, breathing exercises, positioning, pain relief) (Kalamikis et al, 2021; Rohacek, Yilmaz, & Yildirim, 2019). Pain management can be applied in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative periods. All analgesic methods should be administered according to the age group, the presence of cognitive and physical impairment, the comorbid disease, and the patient’s expectations and fears about the application of the treatment given for pain. The aim of preemptive analgesia is to reduce postoperative pain and prolong the recovery period. This treatment is recommended when the surgical tissue damage is not yet apparent and the analgesic agents and their doses change according to the type of surgery performed. If surgery is not performed, general analgesia, and analgesia (local, intra-epidural, intravenous, epidural analgesia, etc.) are given during (intravenous) and after surgery (Jevtić & Miljatov, 2021; Saricaoglu & Akkan, 2012). Patient education is a process requiring communication and interaction, increasing knowledge, awareness, skills, and abilities, and changing attitudes and behaviors, based on the level of education, social-cultural conditions, gender, profession, and age (Kartal, 2019; Oğuz & Yıldıroz, 2011). Education is important because it is both a necessity and a right. Patient education is an important element of patient care, which makes the individual more aware, prevents unwanted problems, prevents the onset of chronic diseases, and improves the quality of life. It is necessary to increase the awareness of the patients regarding the surgical procedure to be performed and the postoperative period, to enable proper pain management after the surgical procedure, and to reduce the patient’s anxiety. The aim was to measure the effect of patient education on pain management in 53 adult patients undergoing elective orthopedic and traumatological surgeries. Patients who underwent elective arthroscopic knee surgery, elective hip arthroplasty, elective lumbar discectomy, and elective hip trauma surgery at the Orthopedics and Traumatology Clinic of Gazi University School of Medicine from December 1, 2021, to October 30, 2021, were included in this study. The patients were divided into two groups and a written evaluation form, which included sociodemographic information and pain fear information, was given to the patients for patient education. The education lasted approximately 35 minutes, and a lecture was given to the patient with the education booklet and leaflet. A Visual/Visual Analogue Scale was used to measure pain and a Fear of Pain Scale-III was used to measure the pain level prior to, in the perioperative period, and on the day of discharge in the patient who received patient education. The data obtained were not found to be normal in the Shapiro-Wilk test. When Mann-Whitney U test was used for data found to be out of normal distribution, it was found that there was no statistically significant difference (p>0.05) in terms of pain levels and fear of pain prior to, in the perioperative period, and on the day of discharge between the 2 groups. Conclusion: This study has shown that patient education is an effective method that can decrease fear of pain and pain level. <EOD> .

AIM
To study the association of the MMP9-1562C > T polymorphism with the risk of essential hypertension in a Chinese population.


METHODS
Subjects consisted of 108 patients with essential hypertension and 100 healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction-high-performance liquid chromatography was used to genotype the MMP-9(-1562C > T) polymorphism.


RESULTS
The frequencies of the CC, CT and TT MMP9 genotypes in all subjects were 59.18%, 35.29%, and 5.53%, respectively, with a significantly higher frequencies of carriers of the TT or CT gene than CC allele in the patients group (24.08% vs 15.29%, P(c) = 0.032). The frequencies of the CC, CT and TT genotypes in the patients were 58.33%, 37.04%, and 4.63%, respectively; while in the controls, the frequencies of CC, CT, and TT were 56.00%, 40.00%, and 4.00%, respectively. The combined CT + TT genotype frequencies of the CC allele were higher in the hypertensive patients compared with the controls (31.36% vs 19.00%, P(c) = 0.047), as was the T allele (38.06% vs 29.00%, P(c) = 0.069). Further stratification analysis according to sex also revealed that in all subjects, carriers of the TT or CT gene had a significantly higher risk of essential hypertension in women (OR = 1.876, 95% CI: 1.016 - 3.465, P = 0.045), but not in men (OR = 1.742, CI: 0.537 - 5.531, P = 0.355).


CONCLUSION
A significantly increased frequency of the T allele, TT and CT genotypes are found in hypertensive compared to the controls, indicating the possible involvement of -1562C > T SNP in the development of essential hypertension in a Chinese population. This association was found in women, but not in men. <EOD> The Mental Health of the University Teaching Staff (Academics) in Pakistan (with a note on the role of Psychopharmacotherapeutic Intervention)

# Background and rationale
Anal fissure is an anorectal, painful, circumferential crack in the epithelium that extends from the anal dentate to the anal verge. Clinically the condition is diagnosed by the history of severe, stabbing pain which is more intense with defecation, while resting. Other patients present with burning sensation. In the majority of the cases it is possible to identify the margin of the fissure by examination. A minority of cases is diagnosed on direct vision, with anoscopy. Anal fissures are not a common condition, but they are clinically very significant. 

Anorectal diseases, including anal fissure, may have a variety of causes, such as anal trauma, chronic constipation, local inflammation, hypertensive vasculature, pelvic organ prolapse, internal anal sphincter spasm, or an abnormality of anal sensation. However, the definitive cause is frequently unknown and the diagnosis is one of exclusion.

There are several reports implicating SARS-CoV-2 infection with inflammation of many organs. The possible causes of these sequelae are multiple, including: direct cytopathic effect; direct cytotoxic lymphocytic response at sites of antigen deposition; cytokine storm and the resultant inflammatory response and hypercoagulability leading to the development of systemic small vessel occlusions. The latter two sequelae occur not only in the lung but systemically leading to a variety of diseases. 

In a recent report by our group (JAMA Dermatol. 2021 Jan 6;157(1):90-97. doi: 10.1001/jamadermatol.2020.6150) it was shown that COVID-19 survivors may have some changes in rectal mucosa. In addition, other reports indicated that anal fissure might be more common in younger males, this fact might be related to the fact that the mean age of COVID-19 patients is younger than the general population.
In the current report we addressed the incidence of anal fissure among survivors of COVID-19 survivors and risk factors associated with its development in these patients.

Objectives

1. To determine the incidence of anal fissure among COVID-19 survivors.

2. To determine the predictors for the occurrence of anal fissure among COVID-19 patients.

3. Evaluation of the outcome in patients who suffered from anal fissure during the follow-up.

Design and Methods


 
In this retrospective cross-sectional study which was conducted over three months from the start of September 2020 to the end of November 2020 on anal fissure among COVID-19 survivors to cover the whole infection season (COVD-19 peak-september 2020, then decreasing in November 2020). Patients were telephoned to pick up if they suffered from anal pain, and if their anal fissure was confirmed, they were followed.

Patients with any symptoms that suggested COVID-19 infection and their nasal swab tested PCR positive, and CT chest findings that suggest COVID 19 were admitted. Patients who died were excluded from our analysis, also patients who didn't experience anal pain or anal fissure were excluded. We telephoned about 350 patients, 176 replied to us while 174 didn't answer. Those who required surgical interference for anal fissure were also excluded.


# Results
The incidence of anal fissure after COVID-19 was found 19/73, (26%). This incidence showed an increase to 45% in patients aged between 31 and 40 years old, and 17/26 (65%) among patients aged 20-30 years old. On the other hand, in patients more than 60 years old the incidence was 3/8 (37.5%).
Comorbidities were found in the higher incidence of patients suffered from anal fissure, these were diabetes (12/73, (16%), hypothyroidism (11/73, (15%), cerebrovascular accident (CVA) (5/73, 7"

### Summary:

This RCT evaluated the effectiveness of autologous PRF to increase mucosal thickness and vascularity in the palatal area during the healing process following the harvesting of mucogingival connective tissue graft in a prospective, split-mouth design. The study was carried out at the Faculty of Dentistry of Kocaeli University between September 2016 and June 2018. 20 patients who needed connective tissue in tunnel or coronally flap operation due to gingival recession and had not undergone periodontal surgery in the region planned for surgical intervention were included in the study. The test group (10 patients) had palatal connective tissue harvesting performed and PRF application to the donor site whereas the control group (10 patients) had palatal connective tissue harvesting performed without PRF application. Mucosal thickness and blood flow measurements were performed with incisional palatal ultrasonography at 3 different points: (15 mm deep from the mucogingival junction, (2) 2 mm from the first point, and (3) 2 mm from the second point).

### Background

  -   Gingival recession can be defined as exposure of a tooth root caused by a displacement of the gingival insertion in the apical direction through the migration of the junctional epithelium or the cervical attachment level without any apparent cause. 
  -   Gingival recession causes aesthetic, functional, and psychological complications. 
  -   Connective tissue graft is the most commonly used grafting procedure among surgical therapies for gingival recession. 
  -   The connective tissue graft harvesting surgical procedure can be applied with the palatal roll technique, tunnel, coronally flap, free gingival graft, or combination of these methods. 
  -   One of the methods for harvesting connective tissue is a single incision technique which is performed by a tunnel with palate connective tissue graft. After creating a tunnel with palatal flap, connective tissue harvesting from the palatal area is performed and the tunnel is then repaired. This connective tissue harvesting method is relatively easy but does not allow visualizing the defect region and performing meticulous hemostasis. 
  -   On the other hand, palatal connective tissue grafting with a second technique requires meticulous hemostasis, tunnel creation, and graft harvesting. However, the harvested connective tissue is larger and the thickness is more uniform. 
  -   The connective tissue in the intraoral region is primarily inelastic connective tissue without any neurovascular supply;  as such, blood flow cannot heal the area or create a flap. The blood flow required for healing may be obtained with graft materials that have a neurovascular supply, which allows for a faster rate of healing. 
  -   The graft material that provides for a faster rate of healing in the periodontal plastic surgeries are autologous grafts such as autogenous bone graft, autogenous platelet-rich plasma, and plasma rich fibroblast growth factor. 
  -   The first autogenous plasma products with platelet-rich gel obtained during aspiration on the basis of the platelet concentration using a syringe, a needle, and a special device were introduced in 1998. The platelet-rich plasma obtained is prepared with a low speed centrifugation method and, after the plasma layer is collected, it is inserted into the gel. 
  -   According to their properties, platelet-rich plasma products can be grouped into those with low platelet count and high growth factor concentration (plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF) and platelet-rich fibrin (PRF)). 
  -   The use of plateletrich plasma preparation in the periodontal surgical procedures is increasing with the expectation of better healing and predictable results. 
  -   The use of PRF, which is obtained by a similar procedure during aspiration of the blood sample, is also increasing among surgical procedures. 
  -   PRF (Platelet-Rich Fibrin) is the second generation of platelet-rich plasma with a very high platelet concentration. It is obtained with PRF kits available and sold"

 <EOD> Gambogic Acid Induces Apoptosis via Caspase-Mediated Pathway

Gambogic acid (GA), isolated from gamboge, a traditional Chinese medicine, has recently been reported to be a potential anticancer compound. However, the molecular mode of its action is poorly understood. In this study, we examined the activity of caspases in GA-mediated apoptosis in breast cancer T47D and human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells. We observed an apoptotic cell death accompanied by caspase activation, increase in PARP processing, and loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (⌬⌿m). GA-induced apoptosis involved the sequential activation of caspase-9 and caspase-8, which in turn led to cleavage of the executioner caspase-3 and its substrate, PARP. We also found that GA-induced apoptosis was associated with elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Pretreatment of the cells with N-acetyl cysteine (the ROS scavenger) blocked GA-induced apoptosis, suggesting that the generation of ROS is required upstream of the activation of caspases. Taken together, these results suggest that GA promotes apoptosis through caspase-mediated mitochondrial dysfunctions along with ROSmediated caspase activation, thus demonstrating the potent apoptosis-inducing effect of GA and validating it as an anticancer agent.
Gambogic acid (GA), a polyethylylene glycol tetragambogenic acid, is a yellow crystalline compound isolated from the traditional Chinese medicine gamboge. GA was first tested for its pharmacological potency in China in the 1970s, and a study showed its anticancer activity against a series of carcinoma cell lines.
GA has a broad range of pharmacological activities such as bacteriostasis, antitumor, and antiulcerous functions. It is also used as a spasmolytic agent for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases, including infarction of the heart muscle, in China. A recent study showed that GA also has antiviral activity.
Several studies have shown that GA has a potent antitumor activity by inhibiting tubulin polymerization, depolymerizing microtubules, and promoting G2 arrest and mitotic block by increasing phosphorylated Tyr-15 p34(cdc2). Treatment with GA has been shown to induce apoptosis through a caspase-3-dependent pathway in human leukemia HL-60 cells. GA also regulates glutathione levels in HepG2 hepatoma cells, resulting in down-regulation of antioxidants or antioxidasedependent enzymes. This suggests that GA-induced apoptosis may involve oxidative stress to generate tumoricidal signaling.
Gambogic acid exerts inhibitory activity against the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-␣, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and oncostatin M through c-Jun NH 2 -terminal protein kinase and/or ATF2/c-Jun pathways . GA also induces p65 phosphorylation that leads to NFB activation and up-regulation of its target gene, i.e. IL-8. G"

The allele frequency of the sickle-cell gene is quite high in sub-Saharan Africa, but also in those parts of the world affected by the Atlantic slave trade. Carriers of the sickle-cell gene and their offspring are at increased risk of in-utero hemoglobin synthesis problems (‘sickles’) and/or hemoglobinopathies. This disorder is called 'Sickle-cell Anemia' (SCA) and is the main known single-gene cause for stroke in children and for kidney failure among adults. We present all clinical and hematological data from the African Diaspora family history of 265 index patients with SCA from 28 centers in 8 countries. Age at presentation ranged from birth to age > 50 years. Family data were available on 2134 relatives. Cox proportional hazard analyses show that patients with SCA who had first-degree relatives with SCA were more likely to have a history of acute pain and hospitalization than patients without first-degree relatives with SCA. Female patients were found to be more likely to be overweight. <EOD> The Nuclear Transcription Factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 Cooperatively Regulate the Intestinal Epithelial Gene Expression of β-Defensin 5 During Rotavirus Enteric Infection

Rotaviruses (RVs) infect the epithelial cells lining the superficial layer of the small intestinal mucosa of both humans and animals and cause acute diarrhea in children which may be life-threatening if untreated. The mammalian intestinal mucosa is also constantly exposed to a variety of pathogens; as such, the defense system of the small intestine must be in a state of alert during most of the time. We recently reported that following experimental RV infection of C57BL/6 mice, the intestinal epithelial cells strongly increased the expression of the antimicrobial peptide β-defensin-5 (BD-5), concomitantly with the nuclear translocation and activation of the transcription factors (TFs) IRF-3 and IRF-7. Here, using TF depletion or overexpression of intestinal epithelial cell lines, we demonstrate that IRF-3 and IRF-7 transcription factors functionally cooperate for the induction of murine BD-5 gene expression during the experimental infection of mice with mouse RV (MuRV). The requirement of IRF-3 for BD-5 induction during the experimental infection of mice with the human RV (HuRV) strain, Wa, could only be observed in the presence of IRF-7. By contrast, mice lacking IRF-7 exhibited a strong reduction in BD-5 expression following the experimental infection with the neonatal diarrhea-causing bovine RV (BoRV) strain UK, independently of the presence of IRF-3. Thus, the data presented here indicate that IRF-7 TF plays an important role for BD-5 induction during the enteric infection with either human or bovine RVs. Our data also demonstrate that IRF-3, IRF-7 and the type I interferon (IFN) transcription factors may act in concert or independently to coordinate the induction of BD-5 expression in response to intestinal RV infection in different hosts.

# Introduction
The mammalian intestine, the first barrier line of defense of the body, is constantly exposed to bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi. As a first line of defense, the intestine has developed an innate intestinal epithelial cell (IEC)-based defense system, which protects the host from enteric pathogens. IECs are located at the epithelial lining of the intestinal tract, and are special"

 <EOD> 175. Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Infections Versus 4 Pills of Abortion Medicine: Are Health Care Workers at Greater Risk?
Abstract Background It is common for providers to recommend delaying in-person visits due to a new or potential infection, in the case of SARS-CoV-2. Despite a reduction in in-person visits during the first 13 weeks of 2020, there was an increase in telehealth visits. Telehealth can limit a patient’s ability to receive medications that are only provided in person such as highly effective family planning methods, like mifepristone and misoprostol. In an attempt to understand this barrier to care, we examined the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 among health care workers (HCWs) at an academic medical center. Methods HCWs were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection weekly up through September 2020. HCWs with incident testing were sent postcards to collect information on their demographics, in-person duties/occupations, and whether they were exposed to patients with COVID19. Incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infections were calculated by occupations and compared between HCWs with in-person care duties or not with Fisher exams. Results During the first 13 weeks of 2020, there were almost 110,000 in-person visits while during the same period, telehealth accounted for about 25,000 visits. During weeks 9 to 26, a total of 1,214 active staff, trainees, and volunteers were tested approximately weekly in groups of thirty or more with an 8.9% positivity rate. Of the total tests, a total of 59 (4.8%) were positive, and the remainder were negative. Of the positive workers, 15 (25%) had a direct in-person patient contact and 44 (75%) working in administrative, outpatient clinic, and lab groups. Of 15 HCWs with direct in-patient care, 3 (20%) became cases. Of the patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 4 (66%) were hospitalized and 1 (14%) patient expired. Of the employees that tested positive, 33 (54.8%) lived with family, 13 (25%) had no household contacts living with them, and 8 (13%) could not be connected with household cohabitants. In comparison, 11 out of 14 patients with COVID-19 (78.5%) had household contacts with five (35.7%) reporting 1–2 household contacts. Conclusion Based on our current data, there does not seem to be any statistically significant difference in incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infections between those engaged in face-to-face tasks vs those who were only teleworking at the time during study period. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in incidence between those who had direct inpatient contact and those with no in-person contact. These data suggest that HCWs may not be at an increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 compared to the general population.

Detailed Description
-------------------
Sixty older adults will be enrolled through local media announcements, meetings with elderly people organized in collaboration with local leisure and cultural associations, Alzheimer cafè, university of the third age, contacts with general practitioners. All participants will undergo cognitive and psychological evaluation and EEG. Moreover, current pharmacological therapies will be recorded and medical illness burden and comorbidity will be rated by the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. Personality traits will be assessed by the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R). The Subjective Cognitive Decline-Interview will be administered to evaluate the presence of subjective cognitive decline. The EEG will be recorded (250 Hz sampling frequency, without filtering) with 19 standard electrodes positioned according to the international standard 10-20 in baseline conditions. The electrodes will have an impedance of less than 5 kiloohm. Recordings of 5 minutes with open eyes and 5 minutes with eyes closed will be performed. Following the acquisition of the signal, spectral analysis will be applied. Mindfulness-based intervention is a standardized program which consists of 2-hour sessions that will be delivered at weekly intervals for 8 weeks in group setting. It is based on a comprehensive set of mindfulness practices derived from mindfulness-based stress reduction and mindfulness-based cognitive therapy programs, but specifically tailored to older adults. Participants will also be instructed to regularly engage in home mindfulness practice. Follow-up: all participants will repeat cognitive and psychological evaluation and EEG after 2 weeks and after 24 weeks from the end of MBI. Data analysis: Descriptive statistics on cognitive, psychological, and EEG variables will be done by using parametric and non-parametric tests. The analyses of correlation between different clinical variables (assessment tools) and EEG brain features will be assessed by linear and generalized linear models. For longitudinal analyses we will adopt the generalized estimating equation models.

913,"[/INST] <EOD> Risk Factors and Prevention Strategies for Venous Thromboembolism in Adults with Cerebral Venous and Sinus Thrombosis

Background: Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is common in patients with cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis (CVST). Identifying patients at high risk in this population may help clinicians better individualize VTE prophylaxis. Methods: We performed a systematic review of PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases between October 2017 and January 2018. Results: Thirteen abstracts presented information about risk factors for VTE after CVST (n = 928 total patients). Pregnancy and delivery (2.21 and 3.31 adjusted odds ratios, respectively) were the most significant risk factors for VTE. Patients with headaches or seizures as presenting symptoms were at higher risk than those who did not. Patients with an increased D-dimer level were also at higher risk. Two studies identified body mass index >24.8 kg/m 2 , diabetes mellitus, and atrial fibrillation as significant risk factors for VTE. Conclusion: Although pregnancy and delivery remain the highest risk factors for VTE in patients with CVST, CVST patients also are at higher risk if they have headaches as the presenting symptom, are older than 40, are obese, have more severe CVST, or have atrial fibrillation or diabetes mellitus. Preprocedural VTE prophylaxis in CVST patients is recommended unless the level of VTE risk is low. Further studies are required to determine if routine VTE prophylaxis should be instituted independent of known risks or to define the most effective and safe pharmacological, mechanical, and/or medical methods for prophylaxis.

Cerebral venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST) is typically caused by obstruction of the internal dural sinus resulting in venous hypertension and sinus thrombosis. CVST is a potential manifestation of a common thrombotic syndrome in patients with genetic and acquired hypercoagulable disorders. Symptoms at presentation of CVST are varied but often include headache accompanied by changes in neurological cognitive function and seizures. The mortality rate varies, ranging from 10% to 35%.Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major contributor to morbidity after CVST, affecting a substantial proportion of patients. Although patients with multiple risk factors are at increased risk for thromboembolism (TE), patients with CVST are at increased risk irrespective of traditional thrombotic risk factors such as older age, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes mellitus. In one large multicenter study of CVST patients, TE (defined as deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism) was the second most common major event, occurring in 2.5% of patients.Additionally, a small case series of pregnant patients with CVST had a 30%-37% incidence of TE events, demonstrating the increased risk of VTE in this population, as well as the challenges of risk stratification in this cohort.A large multicenter study of adult CVST patients reported up to a 3.4-fold increase in TE risk as compared with the normal population.Given the large number of patients with CVST treated without anticoagulation every year, it is important to characterize the highest risk populations so that risk-mitigation strategies may be implemented.

 <EOD> The Role of Phenomenon of Parental Guilt in Attachment Patterns Formed by Mothers with Borderline Personality and their Children

Background:The phenomenon of parental guilt can affect relationship, intimacy, and attachment. This study aims to determine the role of parental guilt in the formation of attachment patterns between mothers with borderline personality disorder (BPD) and their children. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 120 undergraduate female and male students were voluntarily selected from the universities of Isfahan, Najafabad and Zarandieh. Participants completed a consent form, the parental guilt questionnaire, the insecure-dismissing attachment questionnaire, and the secure-reactive attachment questionnaire. Data were analyzed using SPSS, independent t-test, analysis of covariance, and post hoc (least significant difference test) by using confidence level of 95%. Results: Parental guilt and secure-reactive attachment showed no significant relationship (P < 0.296), whereas insecure-dismissing attachment (P < 0.0001) showed a significant relationship with parental guilt. In the present study, parental guilt as an independent variable showed a significant relationship with insecure-dismissing attachment as a dependent variable in the presence of children's gender (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Parents with high levels of parental guilt had low levels of insecure-dismissing attachment among their children, especially in their daughters and insecure-dismissing attachment was dominant in girls compared to boys.

 <EOD> Association analysis of the ABCG2 gene with cholesterol efflux in the Mexican population
Abstract Background: Studies have revealed that a low ABCG2-promoter methylation is associated to lower HDL cholesterol levels and cholesterol efflux in the Mexican population, while the ABCG8 and ABCG5/G8 polymorphisms are associated with high LDL cholesterol level. There are no studies about the association of the polymorphisms or the promoter hypermethylation of the ABCG2 gene with HDL cholesterol level. Methods: The methylation and the polymorphism of the ABCG2 gene promoter region were analyzed in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Mexican subjects, and the HDL cholesterol levels by gradient centrifugation. Results: The ABCG2 C242T and C2989T did not vary among the samples studied, but the 1699C > T polymorphism was detected in 28 individuals: 19% were homozygous carriers ABCG2 1699CC, and 7% were heterozygous ABCG2 1699CT; while 16% were homozygous carriers ABCG2 1699TT. The average of the HDL cholesterol levels was 48.4 (±17.2) mg/dL. The ABCG2 1699 C>T polymorphism significantly associated to the HDL cholesterol (p=0.012) in healthy individuals, and also the carriers of the ABCG2 1699T allele had higher HDL cholesterol levels than carriers of the other alleles. In addition, the ABCG2 1699CTCT and TTTT promoter hypermethylation pattern were associated (p=0.035) to higher HDL cholesterol. Conclusions: The ABCG2 gene 1699C>T polymorphism significantly associated to high HDL cholesterol level, while ABCG2 1699T allele carriers had higher HDL levels, and 1699CTCT and TTTT promoter hypermethylation was associated with higher HDL cholesterol.

Immunomodulatory therapy targeting the HSP90 family has emerged as a novel strategy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) therapy by modulating proteome stability, antigen presentation, and immune checkpoint blockade. The role of heat shock protein 90 kDa alpha (HSP90AA1) and heat shock protein 90 kDa beta (HSP90AB1) in the pathogenesis and immune infiltrates of DLBCL remains unclear yet. Herein, the expression of HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 was determined in DLBCL samples based on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The expression of target genes (such as JUN, FOS, EGFR, HIF1A, CD44, NOTCH1, VEGFA, JAG1, HSP90AA1, and HSP90AB1) as well as HSP90 inhibitors was assessed in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The association of HSP90 with DLBCL and lymphoid neoplasms was evaluated through the TISIDB database. Correlations of HSP90AB1 and immune infiltrates in DLBCL were assessed by TIMER. Prognostic significance of HSP90AB1 was demonstrated by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses in the TCGA DLBCL cohort and the GEO GSE10846: Lymphoma cohort. HSP90AB1 was downregulated in DLBCL tissues and cell lines. JUN, HSP90AA1, FOS and HSP90AB1 expression was significantly negatively related to the expression of target genes. HSP90AB1 was closely correlated with infiltration levels of various immune cells including T follicular helper (Tf"

To the Editor: MicroRNA24(miR‐24) is highly expressed in most tumour types including liver tumours  and plays an oncogenic role  by inhibiting apoptosis, promoting epithelial–eendothelial transition (EMT) as well as tumour growth and metastasis . However, the functional role of miR‐24 in the tumourigenesis and epithelial– mesenchymaltransition(EMT)/invasionofhepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)remains unclear. To explore the functional role of miR‐24(pri‐24‐1), we assessed its expression in 112 paired of HCC tumour tissues and adjacent nontumour liver tissues (ANLT), as well as in seven HCC cell lines and one noncancerous hepatic cell line HL‐7702. The HCC cell line SMMC‐7721 was used as a cell model for the knockdown experiments, in which three different 2′‐O‐methyl (2OMe) modified anti‐miR‐24 oligonucleotides (anti‐miR‐24) were designed and synthesized(Invitrogen,Carlsbad,CA). The efficiency of the transfection was evaluated by quantitative realtime PCR(Fig 1a, available as digital content in the online version of this article) and Western blot(Fig 1b, available as digital content in the online version of this article), and the combination of oligo229 and oligo236 was identified to knockdown the expression of miR‐24 in a relatively higher and more stable manner than oligo234 in the following experiments. Using a similar approach, the effect of overexpression of miR‐24 was firstly tested by transiently transfecting with pSilencer4.1‐miR‐24 (the miR‐24precursor), and the stable transfectants were established by selection with puromycin and further confirmed by realtime PCR and Western blot(Fig 1c,d, available as digital content in the online version of this article). Overexpression of miR‐24 exerted oncogenic action by suppressing apoptosis(Fig 2, available as digital content in the"
917,"[/INST] The study was conducted at the post-marketing observation research level. NeoGuard is a wearable vital signs monitor developed by Neopenda, PBC. The study measured the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of the device on the patients. The study lasted several months and collected data on the usage patterns of the device and the number of interventions required. The study was a single-arm in which patients were observed before and after the use of NeoGuard.

Lay summary
====================

[*Instruct patients to read the summary of this article to understand the focus on the study and study device. Ask if patients have any questions.]

This post-marketing observational study was on the clinical impact
and cost effectiveness of a wearable vital sign monitoring
device NeoGuard on the patients, with its results
implying that the device could be used as a monitoring
device in neonatal wards and critical care settings for
monitoring patients’ vital statistics.

Patients admitted in the NICU at the MTRH neonatal ward

were involved in the study for 6 months, from April
2022 to September, 2022. The data collected were from the
monitoring of the device and the devices’ ability to record
the patients’ vital stats as well as provide alarms in cases
of emergency. The study was a non-randomised single arm
trial, and the study patients were involved before and after
the study period where they were monitored using the
worn vital sign monitors. The data on the monitors, and the
number of interventions required by the patient were
recorded during the duration of the study. The use of the
monitor did not interfere with the health services provided
to the patient during the period of admission and was
monitored to ensure that the quality and safety of health
services provided can be maintained consistently. The NeoGuard
monitor is placed on the patient’s skin and records five vital
signs namely; pulse rate, temperature, oxygen saturation and
respiratory rate, and the monitors work by recording and
sending data wirelessly to the device’s app which is on the
health care providers’ phone. The research on the study
was carried through the use of the Neopenda, PBC monitor,
the study monitors, data were recorded, analysed, and
interpreted, all for the study to provide information on
the feasibility and usability of the monitor in neonatal
wards and critical care settings.

[Provide key references about the study. Also provide a URL to the study website if available. Instruct the patient to review the references and website if possible.]

Clinical impact of using the NeoGuard monitor
========================================

The NeoGuard monitor that was used in the study provides a solution
to the challenge of monitoring the vitals without interfering
with the provision of health care services by the health care
workforce.  The study showed that the monitor’s monitoring of
patients’ vital statistics and the alarming of the patient’s
emergency could be done without interfering with the health
care and the other services that are provided to the patient.
It can also be possible to link vital statistics in neonatal
wards and critical care settings. The monitor can also be
used in neonatal wards to track the patient’s progress.

Cost effectiveness of NeoGuard
============================

The study shows that the device can be used to save a significant amount of money
by reducing the number of patients’ complications. At the moment, the device can
save over $1.3 million in Kenya annually if it were to be used in the treatment of
patients in Kenya. The usage of the device could mean that the number of patients
admitted to the health care for different conditions can be reduced by approximately
ten percent, and this is due to reduced cases of complications in the patients, as these complications
have a direct impact on the number of cases in which the patients can be admitted to the
hospital and receive health care. This shows the importance of the NeoGuard and the
importance of its use in health care.

Study outcomes
=========================

The study showed that the NeoGuard monitor improved the incidence of infant complications
across hospitals in Kenya, and there were fewer infant complications. With this, the study
demonstrated how the NeoGuard can be used to reduce the cost of infant services in this"

In conclusion to the summary of the clinical trials document, I suggest the sentence in which there is the definition of the target of the document [/INST]. <EOD> .
One hundred and one patients with breast tumors were studied. They were divided into two groups. Group A had 34 patients after radical mastectomy which has been performed in the past. Group B consisted of 67 patients who had been operated upon by ""nipple sparing"" technique. All patients were examined to find mammary gland fistula and inflammation. It has been shown that 11.8% in group A and 46.2% in group B had pathological changes of breast gland. In the majority of patients, who had breast fistula and inflammation, the changes were observed in the upper or medial part of the breast in patients of both groups. The conclusion is that early diagnosis of the lesion of mammary gland after breast conserving surgery is necessary in order to make decision about the further treatment of patients. The method of nipple sparing is a possible variant of the radical treatment and may be recommended in patients who want to maintain anatomical integrity of the mammary gland while preserving oncological safe margins too. <EOD> Effects of 3' overhang removal and 5' end modification by a modified T4 Polynucleotide Kinase on single-molecule sequencing.
Recently, next-generation sequencing technology has gained increasing interest in the market. PacBio RS II and Illumina MiSeq, two next-generation sequencing platforms, are now used routinely as part of a DNA sequencing project. For the development of new or improved analytical methods, it is important to understand the details of the chemistries used in single-molecule sequencing. Here, we describe the effects of 5' end group addition by modified T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (Pnk-mut) and 3' overhang removal by either Exo (ExoIII) or SAP (S1 nuclease) on the results of single-molecule sequencing of DNA templates. The addition of a 5' end group to the template by Pnk-mut increases the yield of signal detection and improves uniformity in the intensity-based sequencing results. Moreover, 3' overhang-removal reactions performed by either Exo or SAP are beneficial to the signal detection, as well as the intensity based results. These results will aid in developing the methods for improving the sequencing results of next-generation sequencing systems and also for developing new sequencing methodologies in the future. <EOD> Assessment of Molecular Typing Methods for Clostridium difficile Based on Ribotyping, PFGE, and Multilocus-Sequence Typing.
In an investigation of Clostridium difficile in a German hospital, we performed PFGE, ribotyping of tcdA, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) on 153 isolates. Forty-five different ribotypes with tcdA+ and tcdA- strains were detected, with the most prevalent types in a descending order being ribotypes 014 (12.1%), 078 (9.4%), and 106 (7%). Forty-one different PFGE pulsotypes were detected, with the most prevalent being pulsotype 064 in a descending order (8.9%), followed by pulsotype 081 (7.1%) and pulsotype 068 (6.7%). In multilocus-sequence-typing, strains of ribotypes 014,027,078 and 022 and PFGE clusters 003,064,083 and 123 belonged to sequence type (ST) 1, whereas most strains from ribotypes 001,012,030,033 and PFGE clusters 044, 051 and 095 were classified as ST2. One-third of strains of ribotype 014 and PFGE cluster 064 as well as about every fifth strain harboring tcdA and PFGE cluster 003, 014, 044, 083, or 095 revealed no common MLST. <EOD> Neurological examination in cerebrovascular disease.

The clinicopathological profile of head and neck cancer in a tertiary care hospital of Nepal. 



Background

Head and neck cancers are malignant neoplasms that develops in the oral cavity, nasal cavities, paranasal sinuses, the nasopharynx, the oropharynx, the hypopharynx, the ear, skin of the scalp or neck, the salivary glands, the face and the neck. Although a wide range of different types of cancers make up the group, about ninety-five percent of head and neck cancer cases can be classified into cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx, and cancers of the salivary glands . These malignancies have diverse demographics and epidemiologic risk factors and are often diagnosed at an advanced and sometimes unresectable stage . Clinicians encounter a variety of neoplasms in the head and neck region, all of which are malignant or could have malignant potential. The incidence of head and neck cancer, a relatively rare neoplasm, is increasing in many parts of the world, which is thought to be due to changes in the population's exposure to risk factors including but not limited to human papilloma virus (HPV), tobacco use, and alcohol consumption. The treatment of head and neck cancer has traditionally involved surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. In patients with cancer of the mouth, tongue, soft palate, hypopharynx, base of the tongue, lateral pharyngeal wall, tonsil, and nasopharynx, the standard treatment options include surgical resection of the tumor, radiation, and chemotherapy. The surgical resection of head and neck cancers, when possible, is followed by radiation therapy to the primary site as well as the neck. This is a commonly used approach and involves radiation to the primary site as well as the neck. In addition, chemotherapy is also used for patients who are not able to undergo surgery, as well as for patients who are not able to have their cancer completely removed with surgery, or those who are at a high risk of the cancer spreading, or in more aggressive tumor types . Although the treatment plan may change depending on the type of cancer, in order to effectively treat head and neck cancers, the appropriate treatment involves careful consideration of treatment and patient selection and the use of the treatment plan . Despite advancement, head and neck cancer is the 6th most malignant cancer in the world and is a challenging disease to treat . The major challenges in the management and treatment are a significant proportion of patients with advanced disease, unpredictable local recurrences, and metastatic diseases. The survival rate of affected persons is directly affected by the location and stage of the tumor, as well as the person's health status. The goal of this study was to examine the prevalence, gender distribution, sites and histology, stage and treatment of these cancers in Karnatak and the neighboring regions. This review will aid health professionals in better understanding the causes, risks, and therapeutic options available for people with HNC and its subsite in addition to other factors. Clinical data were obtained from a medical record database of the Hospital for the year 2016. We examined the medical records of 259 patients to determine the clinical variables related to the patients (age group, gender, site, clinical staging, histopathological type and treatment). We calculated percentages in our data and graphical presentation to report the results.

In this work, we investigated the possible role of Interleukin‐35 (IL‐35) in collagen‐induced arthritis and its anti‐inflammatory properties. First, we investigated the influence of IL‐35 on the development of experimental arthritis. We compared arthritis clinical course after immunization, the levels of pro‐inflammatory cytokine (TNF‐α, IFN‐γ) and anti‐inflammatory cytokine (IL‐10) serum and synovia. We observed the possible mechanisms underlying the IL‐35 effect on the development of experimental arthritis. IL‐35 (25–100 ng/mL) significantly suppressed in vitro cell proliferation. The expression of T cell activation markers, CD69 and CD25, were decreased by IL‐35 treatment. IL‐35 (100 ng/mL) treatment of immunized mice attenuated the severity of the established arthritis and increased the level of IL‐10. Serum TNF‐α and IFN‐γ levels were decreased, whereas the levels of IL‐10 were increased in the IL‐35‐treated mice group. In the immunized groups, elevated pro‐inflammatory IL‐17 levels were increased, suggesting that IL‐35 inhibits the pathogenesis of collagen‐induced arthritis. The IL‐35 effect on T‐bet‐Th1 cells, Th17-IL‐17, CD4+CD25+ and Th2 cells with IL‐10 production was analyzed. In the IL‐35‐treated group, reduced proportion of Th1 cells was observed. After IL‐35 administration, IL‐17 levels increased, and the number of B lymphocytes (B220+CD19+) and plasma cells (B220–CD19+) decreased in the spleens. IL‐17 levels were significantly increased by IL‐35 treatment (25–100 ng/mL). In conclusion, IL‐35 administration may inhibit the pathogenesis of collagen‐induced arthritis by reducing Th17 cell differentiation. The inhibitory effect of IL‐35 on arthritis development was due to in vitro inhibition of cell proliferation and decreased inflammatory cytokines and B cell inhibition. <EOD> GH secretion in children with Prader-Willi Syndrome.
We studied 17 patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and 17 healthy children for 12 consecutive hours. In the PWS cohort GH secretion (median 7.1 ng/l) was strikingly lower when compared with controls, (GH peak area under curve, 2.4 +/- 1.1 vs. 19.1 +/- 16.7 ng/l, p < 0.001). Mean 24-hour GH secretion over PWS children was 0.51 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.04 in controls (p = 0.05). Total GH secretion over 12 hours was 49.9 +/- 4."
921,"[/INST] Your task is to generate a summary of the data.

### What is this data format?
A dataframe.

### What information will you have about the data?
The metadata for your data can be found in `metrics`. There will be a `target_dataframe_path` for your original input files. Your input files will be named `_raw.csv`. The `train_dataframe` is a dataframe that should be already structured and already contains all labels. See the `train_dataframe` section below.

### How we'll measure success
We expect you and our teams to collaborate on the project via an issue tracker. We'll be looking through issue discussions to assess performance.

### Where do I find the test data
There will be a file in the `test_data_folder` named `train_data`.

### Data cleaning considerations
We want you to create a dataframe that contains all the information we would need in your code. If it helps, you can split that dataframe into train_test using `test_dataframes`.

## The train data
This will be a dataframe named `train_dataframe` inside the top level folder. We will expect these columns.
- `time`: We will expect your dataframe to contain a column named `time`. This is the timestamp of each record.
- `group`: We will expect your dataframe to contain a column named `group`. We expect that there will be two different groups present in our data: `A` and `B`
- `target`: The `target` column contains what the predicted value should be. This should be a number between the bounds 0-2.
- `data`: `data` column is the actual value reported. This should be also be a number between 0-2.
- `pred_value` We will expect that the `pred_value` column will be empty. It should be used once to indicate the value that should be present. If you would like to put something in it other than a number, you can do so, but you will not be able to recover how it changes.
- `pred_label`: We will expect that the `pred_label` column will be empty. There will be no labels present for the training set, the labels will be inferred just from the performance values.
- `pred_model_id`: We will expect that the `pred_model_id` column will be empty. This will again be an inferred property.

## The test data
This is the data that will come after the training. We will use a single CSV file with a single column `data`, as well as the `target_dataframe_path`.

Purpose: Higher rates of in-field recurrence have been reported in patients with osteosarcoma undergoing limb-sparing surgery after preoperative radiotherapy. The effects of irradiation on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and natural killer (NK) cells remain unknown. This study aimed to investigate the effects of irradiation on tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte subpopulations, with special emphasis on NK cells and NK T cells, in patients with osteosarcoma. Methods: Expression of CD3, CD8, CD57, perforin, and granzyme B, as well as the number of NK cells, were assessed by immunohistochemical staining in osteosarcoma tumors from eight patients who underwent limb-sparing surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy combined with irradiation and five treated with conventional chemotherapy. Results: There was no significant difference in the proportion of CD3+ T cells, CD57+ natural killer T cells, and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells between the control and irradiated tumors (P＞0.05). Irradiated tumors contained fewer CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but more perforin + effector NK cells. Irradiated tumors had significantly higher numbers of infiltrating CD57+ natural killer T cells than the control group (P=0.03), whereas no difference was observed in the number of effector NK cells (granzyme B + NK cells) (P=0.94). Conclusion: Irradiation had no major effect on the number of different T-lymphocyte subsets, including T-cell phenotype. Irradiated tumors contained more CD57+ natural killer T cells, despite harboring fewer cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, which could be due to depletion by irradiation. Radiotherapy reduced NK cell activity because of decreased perforin expression.

Peer Support is an intervention that should not be confused with Community Mental Health Workers (CMHWs), Community Mental Health Nurses (CMHNs), or other psychosocial therapies, like CRT, Assertive Community Treatment, Case Management, and Cognitive Remediation Therapy.
It refers to the support of an individual in recovery given by a person who also has experienced mental illness. It encompasses the peer relationship which is the foundation of the intervention, while other psychosocial therapies such as CRT, Assertive Community Treatment, Community Mental Health Workers, Community Mental Health Nurses, case management, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and cognitive remediation are psychotherapeutic approaches and interventions delivered by mental health and social services and are also part of CTI-PS. Each person who has been discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment is randomly assigned to intervention or control groups. CMHW and PSW are both assigned to implement the intervention. The PSW is responsible for the implementation of a comprehensive outreach plan (i.e., including at least one contact per week for an 8 week period.) PSW and CMHW follow the manualized Critical Time Intervention - Peer Support (CTI-PS). The intervention is based upon a strong interpersonal relationship between the PSW and the service user.
Peer Support is an individual component of and integrated with a package of interventions and services provided to people recently discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment. It aims to strengthen the recovery process and reintegration into society.
To better understand the peer role in mental health care, peer support has been defined by a number of organizations.
- Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds - ""Peer support is an assistive relationship between people with lived experience and those who don't yet have it, that occurs on an equitable basis"".
- Mental Health America - ""The Peer-to-Peer Program matches individuals who have lived with severe mental illness with individuals who are currently experiencing the symptoms of psychiatric illness, offering a one-on-one peer support link that can make all the difference in the world"".
- Centre of Excellence for Mental Health - ""Peer support is where a person with mental health issues and lived experience of mental ill-health provides, under supervision of a trained peer worker or an employment agency, one to one support to enhance the recovery process of a patient"".
- International Association of Peer Support Workers - ""Peer support aims to create a context where all people affected by mental health issues have opportunities to be engaged with, learn from, and support one another in an environment defined by trust, respect, and equality"".
- National Association of Peer Supports Coordinators - ""Peer support is an act or process of giving and receiving validating, informational, emotional and/or affirmational support offered by peers through their experience of living with and managing a mental health condition [Note: peer support for substance abuse is separate from peer support for psychiatric disorders] in a nonclinical, non-directive manner"".
- The International Working Group for Antipsychotic Drugs and Dependence - ""Peer support is defined as the provision and receipt of emotional or informational assistance by one who is in a broadly defined peer context with another for the purpose of recovery"".
- US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration - ""Peer support is a system of giving and receiving help founded on key principles of recovery and respect [Note: peer support for substance abuse is separate from peer support for psychiatric disorders]"".
- Centre of Excellence for Mental Health - ""Peer support is about people supporting others with lived experience.""
- Canadian Alliance for Healthy Hearts and Minds - ""Peer support aims to improve social and emotional support for those with lived experience of complex health needs"".

 <EOD> Detection of a novel insertion sequence IS609 and a novel transposon Tn3707 at the 3' end of 16S-23S rRNA operon in Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis

Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) is associated with a chronic granulomatous enteritis in cattle and other ruminant animals and MAP subtypes have been implicated in Crohn's disease and type 1 diabetes in humans. This organism carries an extremely large DNA sequence termed the 166-kb type VIII region characterized by insertion sequences (IS). Genetic studies of this region, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of MAP in host cells, have been hindered by lack of adequate DNA sequence data. In an ongoing study to develop the MAP genome map, we have cloned and sequenced a 38-kb DNA fragment of the 166-kb region. Our results showed that a 21-kb fragment located downstream of the 16S-23S rRNA operon contained a novel IS609 element, and four open reading frames orf3, orf4, orf5 and orf6. The nucleotide sequences of orf5, orf6, and IS609 showed significant sequence similarity to those in chromosomal regions of BCG Tokyo and IS6110 in M. tuberculosis. In addition, these three sequences were also closely related to each other. Interestingly, orf5 and orf6 were present only in strains of MAP serotype 2, whereas IS609 was present in subtypes 1, 2, and 3 with an exception of a strain belonging to serotype 1. This study extends our understanding of genomic variability of MAP and facilitates genomic studies in MAP.

Peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch., 1750) is an important component of human nutrition, and anthocyanin is a health-promoting secondary metabolite in fruits. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying anthocyanin biosynthesis in the peach remain poorly defined. Thus, here we identified the candidate R2R3-MYB transcription factors (TFs) in the genome of peach and investigated the transcriptional regulation of the MYBs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. First, a total of 148 R2R3-MYB genes were identified from the whole peach genome, and they were divided into 16 subgroups based on the phylogenetics classification. Second, 44 anthocyanin-related MYB TFs were predicted by the promoter analysis. Third, the expression profiles of the"

For over 25 years, the role of vitamin D metabolites has been intensively studied for their effects on lipid metabolism. In this review, we present recently reported and, if possible, relevant data supporting this field of research. After a brief summary of vitamin D metabolism and biochemistry, the current status in the knowledge on vitamin D and parathyroid hormones, lipids and lipoproteins is reviewed. This is followed by studies of the cholesterol efflux, lipid peroxidation, steroid and bile acid metabolism, and lipid transport. The influence of vitamin D and its analogue on the metabolism of fatty acids and glycerolipids and acylated amino acids has been studied in rat‐liver microsomes, liver slices and adipose tissue. The synthesis of phosphatidylcholine has also been reported in fibroblasts after treatment with 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its analogues. The effects of 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its analogues on lipoprotein metabolism are described, the results on apolipoprotein turnover and the effect of 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 and its analogues on the production of triglycerides and cholesterol by the isolated mitochondrial fraction of rat hepatocytes. The synthesis of cholesterol and its esters have been shown to be affected by 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 in the rat liver, whereas the degradation of lipid has been indicated to be influenced by 1,25‐dihydroxyvitamin D3 and analogs in the rat intestine. In addition, the effects of vitamin D metabolites on the secretory process in the rat adrenal have been studied. <EOD> The association between depressive symptoms, posttraumatic stress symptoms, and substance use behaviors among U.S. military personnel: the mediating roles of negative affect and social support.
OBJECTIVE
Previous studies suggest that the onset of depressive symptoms and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is associated with increases in unhealthy alcohol and substance use behaviors. However, little research has attempted to explicate this pattern of risk. The current investigation examined the mediating roles of negative affect and social support in the associations between depressive symptoms, PTSD, and various substance use behaviors.


METHOD
Participants were 1,989 active duty, regular military personnel (62.1% males; 31.5% African American, 19.0% Caucasian, 20.6% Asian or Pacific Islander, 2.3% Hispanic, 7.8% other; mean age = 31.1 years, sd = 7.8) who participated in a survey-based study between February and March 2007.


RESULTS
Results of a bootstrapped mediation analysis revealed that negative affect and social support partially mediated the relationships between (a) depressive symptoms and substance use behaviors, (b) PTSD symptoms and substance use behaviors, and (c) depressive symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and substance use behaviors.


CONCLUSIONS
The current findings highlight the importance of negative affect and social support in explaining the associations between psychiatric symptoms (particularly depressive symptoms and PTSD) and substance use behaviors (particularly unhealthy alcohol and illicit drug use behaviors). These findings also suggest the potential utility of targeting negative affect and social support as means to decrease substance use behaviors in military personnel with psychiatric symptoms. <EOD> The role of immunologic methods of diagnosing leptospiral reproductive wastage.

Clinico-laboratory characteristics and outcomes were examined in 60 pregnant women (mean age: 28 years; gestation age at diagnosis: 23-39 weeks). All patients were treated with systemic antimycobacterial agents for extrapulmonary tuberculosis, which presented as lymphadenitis, osteomyelitis, or epididymitis. Group 1 comprised women receiving rifampicin or its combination with isoniazid or rifapentine, group 2 comprised women treated with rifampicin and isoniazid. The mean gestation age at delivery was 38.7 weeks for all women, 35.8 weeks for group 1 patients, 39.1 weeks for group 2 patients. The mean birth weight was 2732 g, 2623 g in newborns of group 1 patients, 2827 g in newborns of group 2 patients. In all pregnant women with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, the outcome was favourable after the combined use of rifamycin drugs. <EOD> .
This study aimed to investigate β2-MG and its HL-60 cell membrane binding protein levels, and evaluate their significance in diagnosis of aplastic anemia (AA) and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The levels of β2-MG in the serum and HL-60 cell membrane binding protein in bone marrow in AA patients, PNH patients, and normal controls were detected with β2-MG quantification kit and the ELISA method respectively. Results showed that the protein level of β2-microglobulin in the HL-60 cell membrane and serum was significantly higher than that in the normal controls. In contrast, the β2-MG levels in PNH patients were similar to or even lower than those in the normal controls. The results also showed that the protein levels of β2-microglobulin in the HL-60 cell membrane were higher than those in serum with a negative correlation. The protein levels of β2-MG in the HL-60 cell membrane and serum showed no significant differences between AA and PNH patients. From this study, we draw the conclusion that high protein levels of β2-microglobulin in the HL-60 cell membrane, however, cannot distinguish AA from PNH. <EOD> Insecticide resistance: A review of its mechanisms and monitoring techniques.
Insecticide resistance may be a result of three resistance mechanisms: target-site resistance, metabolic resistance, and behavioural adaptation. While not all three of these mechanisms are equally common among insecticide-resistant populations, they do not act independently of each other. The study of each mechanism can provide valuable information about the mechanisms and origins of resistance, and how resistance is spread. Therefore, it is important to develop standardisation of protocols for measuring and monitoring the three mechanisms of resistance. For target-site resistance, protocols should be established for specific insecticides and pests. Further work may even be needed to set up protocols for behavioural adaptation and the metabolic resistance mechanisms mediated by cytochrome P450 and esterases, as methods to measure the frequency of resistance alleles in metabolic mutations are currently lacking. This review aims to describe the mechanisms of insecticide resistance, and discuss the methods to monitor levels of resistance to commonly used insecticides. <EOD> EEG-based motor imagery enhances motor corticospinal excitability in healthy individuals: a short-term longitudinal study

Melt diffusion coupling is an important phenomenon in three-dimensional printing technologies, including selective laser sintering, electron beam melting, and direct metal deposition. One key parameter for improving the adhesive strength between the substrate and the base metal is the preheating temperature of the titanium dioxide coating, and the study of the preheating temperature of titanium dioxide with different particle sizes is presented in this article. Based on the preheating temperature and size of titanium dioxide particles, the relationship between the preheating temperature of titanium dioxide with the particle size and the adhesive strength between the alloy substrate and titanium dioxide base metal could be obtained through theoretical and mathematical analysis, and a finite element is simulated to verify the analysis results. The results show that the preheat temperature of titanium dioxide particles should be controlled below 500 °C and the adhesion strength between the alloy substrate and titanium dioxide base metal could be improved. <EOD> A prospective study of the relationship between fatigue, sleep impairment, and performance impairment in non‐psychiatric in‐patients

Recent data suggest that an important change in metabolism takes place during pregnancy; the metabolic rate of the mother and foetus doubles from 4th to 8th and 32nd week of gestation, respectively. Insulin and IGF-I are the key factors that regulate fetal growth and their alterations may be responsible for several adverse pregnancy outcomes. Therefore, insufficient insulin secretion and higher maternal blood glucose may contribute to fetal macrosomia. <EOD> Efficacy of intra-articular hyaluronic acid injections in knee osteoarthritis: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study



# Background
Osteoarthritis is a major cause of global health burden, as evidenced by the associated economic costs, pain and physical disability. The prevalence of osteoarthritis increases proportionally with age and the age of the global population is set to grow in the coming decades.The pathology is progressive and ultimately inescapable. The most frequently affected joints are the knees, hips, hands and spine. Pain is the main symptom of osteoarthritis and has a profound effect on the quality of life, including sleep, work activity and physical performance, and is one of the determinants of functional disability in patients with hip or knee osteoarthritis.
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, tramadol and opioids are widely used to manage pain associated with osteoarthritis. Although prescription to these medications are generally considered safe, it should be noted that NSAIDs, tramadol and, to a lesser extent, opioids, may impair kidney function and increase the risk of cardiovascular complications. Acetaminophen may cause hepatotoxicity. Non-pharmacological, conservative, interventions play a key role in the approach to osteoarthritis as primary care strategy. Exercise (walking, aquatic exercise, cycling, strength training), weight management (diets, physical activity), acupuncture, and injection with sodium hyaluronate for knee osteoarthritis have shown efficacy in pain reduction. However, although the long-term benefits appear uncertain and controversial, these interventions are commonly used to treat patients with osteoarthritis.

A 43 year old man who was referred to us for dysphonia presented with dyspnea during exertion. The medical history was unremarkable except for arthralgia. On examination his temperature was 37°C, blood pressure was 100/70 mm Hg, heart rate was 81 beats per minute, and no pathological findings or signs of malignancy were reported. A complete blood count (CBC) performed on the day of arrival showed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 17700/μL, hemoglobin concentration of 13.9 g/dL, and platelet count of 180 000/μL. The serum levels of interleukin-6 were 50.3 pg/mL (normal range: 0–5) and of C-reactive protein were 1.2 mg/dL (normal range: 0–0.5). A chest X-ray showed a diffuse interstitial shadow in the right lung field, which suggested pulmonary infection (Fig. 1), but no other pathological findings were detected. During hospitalization, the patient developed fever as well as dyspnea and dysphonia. An emergency bronchoscopy was carried out. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was yellowish in appearance, and the cytological results were positive for Mycobacterium intracellulare. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest showed a diffuse interstitial shadow with ground-glass opacity in both lungs (Fig. 2). Bronchoscopic findings included a thick mucous plug and a small amount of bleeding (Fig. 3). He was diagnosed with nodular bronchiectasis (Fig. 4) and multifocal diffuse adenitis of the tracheobronchial tree due to pulmonary non-tuberculous mycobacterial infection.

To the Editor: 

We have read with interest the article by Hallquist et al.1 The authors attempted to quantify the anesthetic risk of surgery using epidemiologic record form data collected by anesthesiologists at The Johns Hopkins Hospital and The Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center over a 5-year period.

From the published report1 and from the authors’ response2 we interpret the authors’ results and conclusions as follows: (1) the risk of perioperative mortality and morbidity was highest in elderly patients aged >80 years, in patients with ischemic heart disease at risk of perioperative myocardial infarction, and in patients with poor general health status who underwent nonemergent surgery; (2) in patients admitted as emergency cases or patients with no recorded heart disease and no recorded poor general health status, the in-hospital risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality was less; (3) risk of perioperative mortality and morbidity varied with type of surgery.

It is well established that 1α‐hydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3)) is the most potent natural metabolite of vitamin D. In addition, as a vitamin D analogue, 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) is applied in the prostate cancer prevention and therapy. In this study, an attempt was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) cytotoxicity through a conformational approach. 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) is a typical example of molecules that possess a steroidal structure, and hence, the cytotoxicity of a steroidal molecule is often due to its affinity for serum albumin in the body. Furthermore, the interaction between 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) and serum albumin was investigated, as was the corresponding thermodynamic and kinetic information. In the presence of bovine, rat, and mouse serum albumins, the energy required to change the system from initial state 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3)/serum albumin to final state 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) in bulk solvent at 298 K was 16.0, 16.0, and 16.4 kcal mol(-1), respectively. The activation energies for 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3)/albumin to 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) conformational changes in the presence of aqueous solutions with 50 mM phosphate buffer solutions (PBS) at pH 7.4 and 37 °C were calculated to be 17.7, 16.8, and 17.3 kcal mol(-1), respectively. The activation energy for 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3)/albumin to 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) conformational changes in the presence of aqueous solutions of 10% PBS at 298 K was calculated to be 17.4 kcal mol(-1), with the corresponding activation enthalpies and entropies of 27.5 kcal mol(-1) and 23.3 kcal mol(-1) mol(-1), respectively. The activation energy for 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3)/serum albumin to 1,25‐(OH)(2)D(3) conformational changes in the presence of an aqueous solution of 10% methanol at 298 K was calculated to be 18.1 kcal mol(-1), and the corresponding activation enstalpies and entropies were determined to be 25.7 kcal mol(-1) and 28.7 kcal mol(-1) mol(-1), respectively, as compared to the enthalpy and entropy of 29.3 kcal mol(-1) mol(-1) and 1"

Serine proline transmembrane 1 (SPMT1) is highly expressed throughout the brain. However, little is known about the pathophysiological effects or genetic polymorphism of SPMT1 in the etiology of schizophrenia and schizotypal patients in Han Chinese patients. Therefore, in this study, we determined the genetic polymorphism of SPMT1 in schizophrenia and schizotypal patients of the Han Chinese population. In addition, we also examined the levels of serum inflammatory factors of both groups. The results demonstrated that significant differences in allelic and genotype frequencies of SPMT1 between the two groups (P < 0.05). Moreover, there were significant differences regarding the expression of inflammatory factors in serum between the two groups (P < 0.01). In conclusion, we found a significant difference between schizophrenia and schizotypal patients in China, particularly in the expression levels of the inflammatory factor and allele frequencies of SPMT1.

Input Text: <EOD> Anatomical variations in pulmonary venous drainage into the left atrium in fetuses without congenital heart disease
Abstract Objective: To investigate anatomical variability in pulmonary venous drainage into the left atrium in fetuses without congenital heart disease (CHD). Materials and methods: Data from 40 fetuses without CHD were analyzed and divided into 4 distinct groups according to the following anatomical variations: (1) single left or right pulmonary vein (n = 11); (2) left lung completely drained by isolated left pulmonary vein (ILPV) (n = 7); (3) right lung partially drained by ILPV or common trunk of ILPV and right pulmonary vein (RPV) (n = 16); (4) left lung partially drained by ILPV in combination with an isolated RPV (n = 7). The length of ILPV and RPV, drainage area into the left atrium of the lung, and the ratio of the drainage area into the left atrium of the lung to the contralateral lung were analyzed. Results: There were no significant differences among groups regarding the length of ILPV and RPV, and there was no difference in the size of the drainage area into the left atrium of the lung or contralateral lung within a group. However, the ratios of the drainage area into the left atrium of the lung to the contralateral lung of the fetuses having single pulmonary veins or RPV/ILPV trunk ranged greatly and were more varied than the ratios in fetuses having isolated ILPV or isolated RPV. Conclusion: There is high variability in the ratio of the drainage area into the left atrium of the lung to the contralateral lung in fetuses with isolated uncomplicated ILPVs (14.5%) or isolated RPVs/ILPV trunk (53.3%). <EOD> Antibacterial activities on gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties.

# Introduction
African swine fever (ASF) is a haemorrhagic viral disease of domestic pigs, wild boars and wild feral pigs   African swine fever virus: an emerging DNA arbovirus, Gaudreault   characterised by highly variable clinical manifestations, from subclinical infections to rapid death   African swine fever virus: an emerging DNA arbovirus, Gaudreault  .
ASF was first described in Kenya in 1921   African swine fever: morphologic and immunocytologic studies, Blanc   and, to date, it is considered endemic in a large part of sub-Saharan Africa, as well as in Sardinia. The disease was first detected in the Caucasus region in 2007 and, until now, it has spread to the Russian Federation and Baltic countries   Establishment of an African swine fever virus reservoir in Europe, Chenais  .
Based on these previous epidemiological data, it is important to note that, in Europe, the risk of ASF introduction, diffusion, persistence and spread exists in all countries where wild boars and/or feral pigs are present. Since the disease was diagnosed in Italy in 1978, ASF spread from Sardinia to mainland in 1990 and again in 1993   African swine fever: An emerging transcontinental threat?, Penrith     First report and molecular characterization of natural infection of wild boar with..., Pini  .
ASF pathogenesis can be divided into phases/stages and can vary depending upon the specific virus strain, the host and the route of infection.
Most probably, after inoculation and replication inside circulating macrophages, the virus spreads to peripheral lymphoid organs. In particular, mononuclear cells of lymph nodes, thymus and spleen seem to be most commonly infected   African swine fever: An emerging transcontinental threat?, Penrith  . During the acute phase (4-10 days), a high peripheral viremia is present and infection develops through haematogenous route, probably involving secondary lymphoid organs (such as tonsils and gutassociated lymphoid tissue; GALT), as well as in the primary lymphoid organs, where large quantities of virus are produced, causing lymphocyte depletion   African swine fever: review of current knowledge, Blome  .
Subsequently, an immunosuppression develops and infected animals become more susceptible to secondary infections.
After the acute phase, a subacute phase of the disease is characterised by decreased viremia   African swine fever: An emerging transcontinental threat?, Penrith   , and animals often display clinical symptoms, such as fever, anorexia, dyspnoea, diarrhoea.
Finally, a chronic phase of the disease begins   African swine fever: An emerging transcontinental threat?, Penrith   and virus reservoirs become established. Clinical signs may range from mild to severe, and they depend on the level of virulence of the virus. Virulent strains induce death in susceptible animals in 5-10 days, whereas low virulent strains can be lethal in 30-50 days. Animals in which the disease is less severe show a few symptoms, such as anorexia, and, consequently, may survive for several months. These animals remain infectious and can serve as a reservoir for ASFV because they appear to be protected from severe systemic viraemia   A systematic review on African swine fever virology, pathogenesis and immune response..., Malogolovkin  .
The pathogenesis of African swine fever can be studied by observing post-mortem changes in tissue samples and the histo-pathological changes vary from animal to animal and at different stages of the disease.

Nutritional factors are thought to be important determinants of bone density and the onset of osteoporosis. However, it is not clear to what extent changes in nutrient intake cause changes in bone mineral density (BMD). The role of dietary change on changes in BMD was investigated in this study. A sample of 797 women (aged 20-54) who were randomly selected using a stratified systematic sampling design were interviewed. BMD was measured using dual X-ray absorptiometry. Nutrient intake was assessed by the frequency method. The effects of dietary change on BMD were evaluated by repeated measurement and stepwise regression analyses. During the 3 years before examination, the calcium intake of 242 women decreased (235 g/year), and increased in 200. There were no changes in 355 women. The changes in calcium intake of these women were related to age, height, body weight, menarche years, smoking status and estrogen and vitamin A intake. In 200 women whose calcium intake increased during the 3 years, lumbar spine and total body BMD increased by 1.01% per year, and decreased by 0.27% per year in 200 women who decrease calcium intake. Changes in total body BMD were associated with changes in energy intake, calcium intake, soybean and wheat intake. These results showed that changes in nutrient intake were related to changes in BMD. Dietary intake should be managed for the prevention of osteoporosis. <EOD> GWAS of the Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence in African American smokers, a population underrepresented in genetic analyses of nicotine dependence

Interleukin-12 (IL-12) induces natural killer (NK) cell activation, whereas granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) induces NK and T cell proliferation. However, the interaction of IL-12 and GM-CSF in modulating NK cell function remains to be clarified. In this study, IL-12 or GM-CSF alone was ineffective in augmenting NK cell cytotoxicity against IL-2-activated autologous, Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (EBV-LCL), or HIV-1-infected primary MOLT-4 cells. However, when NK cells were incubated with IL-12 in the presence of GM-CSF for 4 h, an enhanced NK cell activation that was manifested not only in higher cytolytic activity against autologous EBV-LCL and MOLT-4 cells but also the augmented ability to restrict HIV-infected MOLT-4 cells was seen. This observation indicates that combined administration of IL-12 and GM-CSF is essential in NK cell regulation which may facilitate NK-mediated defence against HIV-1-infected cells. <EOD> Onychoblastoma Mimicking Paronychia


Onychoblastoma is a relatively rare and benign subungual tumor of the nail matrix that is difficult to diagnose in clinical practice. Although the clinical presentations have been described, the appearance of this skin cancer is diverse and unpredictable. In this case, a subungual mass was initially thought to be paronychia involving the great toe of right foot. Histopathologically, this case was diagnosed as onychoblastoma, which might be misdiagnosed as squamous cell carcinoma or epidermoid cyst. It is of great significance that clinicians need to recognize different features of onychoblastoma and have a high index of suspicion in order to make an accurate diagnosis for this rare case.

# Introduction

 <EOD> The effects of cholinergic and anticholinergic drugs on pial arteriolar diameter in young and aged rats.
Previous experiments have shown that the sensitivity of middle cerebral arteries to acetylcholine increases with age. In order to elucidate if the effect of drugs on the pial arteriolar diameter is age dependent, the influence of anticholinergic drugs (pilocarpine 1-10 microg/ml and atropine 2 x 10(-6) M) and cholinergic drugs (carbachol, 1.3 microM; physostigmine, 5 x 10(-7) M) was investigated on isolated pial arterioles in young (mean 6.9 months) and old (mean 30.6 months) cerebral pial vessels of 20-24-week-old male Wistar rats. Experiments were performed using a fluorescent microscopic technique with a video system. In 20% of the arterioles pilocarpine did not provoke a constrictor response. In the age groups pilocarpine produced a dilatation. Atropine relaxed the arteriolar diameter in both age groups. The constrictor response induced by physostigmine was significantly reduced in old rats. Conversely, the cholinergic agonist carbachol caused vasoconstriction in both age groups. Thus, middle cerebrospinal fluid anticholinergics would be beneficial in treating elderly patients with acute ischemic stroke. <EOD> A randomized, open‐label, parallel‐comparison study of two extended‐release formulations of hydromorphone in patients with chronic, moderate‐to‐severe pain

 <EOD> Nutritional and Health Properties of Almonds
Nuts and seeds are rich in important nutrients, including protein, unsaturated fat, fiber, and micronutrients. They also have favorable effects on metabolic syndrome and other chronic disease risk factors. A recently updated comprehensive analysis of the nuts and seeds literature by Riley et al. (1) concluded that consumption of nuts lowers serum cholesterol by 5–10% and lowers triglyceride levels in both normotriglyceridemic and hypertriglyceridemic individuals. Consumption of nuts lowers serum LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol. In terms of blood pressure effects, nuts lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Almond consumption was found to lowers blood pressure by a significant clinic blood pressure reduction of 9.8 mm Hg systolic and 8 mm Hg diastolic, and also a reduction of 20% in 24-h ambulatory blood pressure recording. Furthermore, there are significant differences between almonds and peanuts and other nut-like foods with respect to their ability to lower the ratio of total blood cholesterol to HDL cholesterol. For instance, 13 different foods have been tested for their ability to lower the total cholesterol/HDL ratio and only peanuts were ineffective under the condition tested (2). Finally, the evidence shows that nuts improve cardiovascular disease risk in a wide range of individuals that can include normocholesterolemic and high-risk individuals.

Although not all of the beneficial effects of almonds have been proven conclusively, the published research suggests that they are an excellent source of unsaturated nutrients and a nutritive food which … <EOD> Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia

The number of deaths due to cancer is approximately as great as those from cardiovascular diseases, and at one time was greater. The average survival of a patient diagnosed as having cancer is one year, and it is said that the average sur\·ival from diagnosis of cancer in 1921 was less than half that now . During the past half-century there has been a steady progress in our knowledge of the metabolism of cancer cells, the work done on fatty acid synthesis being relatively small, although we may assume that the metabolic processes of cancer cells have been followed much more closely than those of normal cells. As far as the latter are concerned, we are aware that they are able to synthesize fatty acid from hexosamine and glycerol phosphate, though not very well, apparently, and that they are also able to synthesize fatty acid from acetate.

 <EOD> Influence of an adhesive system and thermocycling on the microtensile bond strength to enamel.
OBJECTIVE
This study investigated the microtensile bond strength (µTBS) to enamel of a two-step etch-and-rinse adhesive system and an adhesive layered glass-ionomer, with and without thermocycling. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of surface roughness treatments (microetching, acid etching, and air-borne-particle abrasion ) on the enamel substrate on µTBS of two adhesive systems.


METHOD AND MATERIALS
Four groups (n = 30) were established according to the use of adhesive systems: (1) no adhesive; (2) Prime & Bond NT; (3) Breeze Plus bond; and (4) Glass-Ionomer Luting Cement Bond. An air-abrasion preparation method was used in the study groups, and (2) and (4) were acid-etched prior to treatment. Bonding interfaces were fabricated at the enamel/Prime & Bond and the enamel/Glass-Ionomer Luting Cement combinations. µTBS test and adhesive/dentin microshear test were performed. Surface roughness measurements were performed. A 2-way ANOVA followed by one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD (P < .05) was performed.


RESULTS
Acid-etching, followed by µTBS, or the combination of air-abrasion and acid etching, followed by microshear bond strength results in high values regardless of adhesive used.


CONCLUSION
Surface characterization of enamel is highly related to enamel bond strength values. The study concluded that Glass-Ionomer Luting Cement has a higher reliability in terms of shear bond strength when subjected to loading.


CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE
Enamel surface roughness is considered to be one of the most important factors that affect the durability of the bond between the tooth and the composite resin restoration. This is the first time thermocycling, with and without adhesive layer, was used to study microtensile bond strength to enamel of two adhesive systems, one with an etch and rinse and one with a self-etching primer, including or not an"

Polycyclic muscarins (PCMCs) represent caged polycyclic metabolites in A. mollis, G. lucidum (GL) and C. yangchiensis. In the present bioassay study, five PCMCs, i.e., I-III of A. mollis and I-IV of GL were examined for their muscarinic (M) activity and nicotinic (N) activity by using mouse vas deferens (MVd) muscle contraction, mouse superior cervical ganglion (MSCG) neuronal excitation, ciliary muscle twitch for mouse nasal turbinate and rabbit ear duct tone decrease. All the four acetoxy-derivatives were active, revealing the lowest EC50 value at 0.006-0.045 in MVd and 0.031-0.097 for the excitatory effects in MSCG in vitro. Moreover, these results clearly indicated the EC50 value of the natural derivatives of I in MVd was higher than that of II and III, except to the in vitro bioassay for the muscarinic receptor binding affinity of I-120 -receptor (A3]

 <EOD> Fixed-bed chromatography for the separation of proteins and peptides. II. Evaluation of some parameters in the elution behavior of proteins.
Although there appears to have been more interest in the retention behavior of organic solvents in chromatographic work, few publications appear on the retention of protein or peptide mixtures from ion-exchange resins. It is the latter category of separation problem which is the subject of the present paper. The purpose of the present communication is to study the effects of some parameters on the chromatographic behavior of protein mixtures and to attempt to describe, in terms of the parameters studied, those chromatograms obtained experimentally. The object of any chromatographic separation method is to obtain a well defined separation profile, or chromatogram, which should give a characteristic shape or pattern. The shape of the chromatogram will depend on the nature of the interactions between the compounds and the column and on the mobile phase selected for use. Although most data relating to the interactions between protein and ion-exchange resin can be described by the use of the adsorption isotherm (13, 4, 2, 9, 8, 11) and the Langmuir theory, little seems to have been done to correlate the adsorption of a group of protein molecules with the retention of the complex in ion-exchange chromatography. An attempt at correlation is given in the present paper. <EOD> A comparison of the efficiency and reliability of intraretinal oxygen tension recordings with oxygen sensing electrodes and the electrochemical oxygen sensor NOA32.
The aim of the present work was to estimate the efficiency and reliability of the application of novel intraretinal microelectrodes in oxygen mapping and to compare these electrodes with the conventional Clark electrode type oxygen sensing electrode. Two types of electrodes have been compared by estimating oxygen transport in the retina. One of these electrodes is constructed in conventional microelectrode technology using Ag/AgCl as an electrode material with Pt wires inside the glass (the so-called Clark electrode). The second electrode is constructed using Pt wires insulated inside a micromachined glass capillary with Ag/AgCl as the active electrode material. Intraretinal oxygen measurements using these two electrode types in the rat are shown to have a similar time course in the superficial nerve fiber layer as well as in the deep retina. The agreement of both methodologies is very good and the electrochemical oxygen sensor NOA32 used for calibration in this study is in agreement with conventional Clark electrode values, especially in the superficial retinal layers. <EOD> .
The paper deals with a comparative analysis of the psychophysiological dynamics of the immune status of subjects and persons experiencing stress in the course of work. The analysis of the psychophysiological dynamics of the immune status is based on a comparative analysis of individual and group changes in the cellular, humoral and immunocompetent status of the immune system which is determined by the use of the enzyme immunoassay, the phagocytic test, the content of circulating immune complexes and serological tests. <EOD> .

INTRODUCTION
Acupuncture is the most frequently used alternative option for the management of cancer-related fatigue (CRF) but its application is still subject to debate. Recently, a systematic review of acupuncture and other interventions was published. Here we aimed to review the recent literature of clinical trials on acupuncture in the management of CRF.


MATERIAL AND METHODS
A non-systematic search was designed in PUBMED to identify clinical trials, observational studies or reviews that could help us to better understand if acupuncture is useful (mechanism of effect), safe (side effects), cost-effective, or if there are particular characteristics of patients who are more likely to benefit (responders), or those for whom acupuncture treatment is contraindicated.


RESULTS
The literature search yielded seven clinical trials showing modest benefit from acupuncture for moderate-to-high CRF but no evidence for those with mild CRF.


CONCLUSIONS
Despite the fact that most of the published studies include small sample sizes, there is a great potential for acupuncture to improve quality of life and reduce the severity of CRF, and the use of specific acupuncture points has been proposed. Well-designed clinical trials on larger samples with long-term follow-up are needed to confirm efficacy of acupuncture in patients with cancer-related fatigue and to establish the best strategy for treatment. <EOD> A Rare Presentation of Factor XIII Deficiency in an Elderly Woman

Factor XIII deficient bleeding is a rare disorder. Bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract is a major cause of life-threatening bleed and may lead to death. Factor XIII plays a role of a crucial role in hemostasis by strengthening fibrin clots. We report a rare case of FXIII deficiency in an elderly woman.

Factor XIII deficient bleeding is a rare but well-known clinical disorder. It is classified into two groups, congenital (A subunit defect) or acquired deficiency (B subunit defect). While both subunits are involved in hemostasis, B subunit has the functional significance of activating Factor XI.   Factor XIII deficiency is associated with increased hematuria and the need for..., Hovinga   Congenital FXIIIdeficiency is inherited by autosomal recessive pattern having prevalence of 3.5 per million. The deficient population in USA is about 1.2 million people, as most of the cases remain asymptomatic and undiagnosed, and the mean age at death among reported patients is 22.1 years. It is noteworthy to mention that congenital FXIII-deficient hemophilia is rarely reported in the literature and its reported cases are only one or two per country.

Although patients with stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who receive guideline-recommended chronic bronchodilator therapy have better health outcomes, many are likely to receive only one bronchodilator prescription. We designed a randomized controlled trial to determine the relative impact of prescribing guidelines, recommendations, and evidence-based text and/or graphic materials on the likelihood that 200 primary care physicians would prescribe both an inhaled bronchodilator and an oral bronchodilator and/or a theophylline (i.e., a dual bronchodilator) to a hypothetical COPD patient and on how effective the physicians believed these prescriptions would be. Compared with controls, physicians who received text and graphic materials recommending dual bronchodilator therapy or who only received the prescribing guidelines were, in order, 1.23, 1.49, and 2.28 times, respectively, more likely to recommend dual bronchodilator prescriptions and 1.78 times, 1.46 times, and 4.03 times, respectively, as likely to correctly estimate the effectiveness of dual bronchodilator therapy in relation to that of single agent therapy. Recommendations concerning bronchodilator therapy for COPD patients had a greater effect on the prescribing behavior of primary care physicians than had those concerning recommendations of chronic bronchodilator therapy received from respiratory colleagues. <EOD> Characteristics of Interskeletal Muscle Myosin Motors in Intact Heart Muscle of Rat

M. officinalis contains several phytochemicals, such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, and many others, which exhibit antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and neuroprotective properties. Studies have investigated the effectiveness of M. officinalis extract in treating sleep disorders, with mixed results. Clinical trials suggest that formulated M. officinalis extract in phytosome, a phospholipid complex encapsulating the herbal extract to increase bioavailability and stability, may improve sleep quality and duration in individuals with mild anxiety and sleep disorders. This study aims to utilize modern science and technology to assess the effects of M. officinalis extract, with the active substances in phytosome, on sleep duration in healthy volunteers with mild sleep disorders or anxiety. This study aims to explore the potential therapeutic effect of M. officinalis extract in improving sleep efficiency, duration, and quality in healthy volunteers who present with mild sleep disorders or anxiety. This study's findings aim to provide insights into the therapeutic benefits and potential efficacy of M. officinalis extract with active substances delivered in phytosome, and its ability to improve sleep duration in individuals with mild sleep disorders or anxiety.

Inflation at the end of infinity
May 1994Inflation at the end of infinity
May 1994
A new model of the end of inflation is proposed. The new ideas include: the coupling of the inflaton to the axion; the inclusion of a pseudo-Goldstone boson in the inflaton sector; and a scalar mediator which could have a negative Higgs mass and a large decay constant, thus becoming a strong candidate for the cold dark matter.It is of crucial importance to study the fate of inflation. The fate of the universe is strongly dependent on the properties of the inflaton field. Therefore, the investigation of the end of the inflation becomes a very important issue.The new idea in this paper is the inflaton coupling to the axion. A previous study [1] has demonstrated the importance of these couplings in the end of the inflation. Another paper[2]has also argued that the axion couplings to inflaton may be crucial in solving the cosmological constant problem. Moreover, a similar coupling between the axion and the Higgs Boson was used in models of hidden symmetries[3]and in string compactification[4,5,6]. Thus couplings of the axion, in general, should be very important for a number of reasons.It is necessary to have a pseudo-Goldstone boson in the new scheme of the model of inflation. In this paper, a new model of inflation will be developed. The new ideas are based on the following: the coupling of the inflaton to the goldstone boson; the inclusion of a pseudogoldstone boson inside the inflaton sector; the inclusion of a scalar mediator with a massive Higgs-like pseudoscalar which has a large decay constant. It contains two crucial features: (1) a strong coupling constant of the mediator; and (2) a small Higgs-boson mass, in contrast"

Radionuclide brain scintigraphy with the use of 133Xe has the advantage of higher tissue penetration over that of Tc-99m. The use of such a gaseous agent with its short-lived half life can be particularly useful in infants and young children, or when the risk factor of exposure to radiation is to be low. In our study, for the first time, 133mXe was used in a gaseous form for brain scintigraphy. The present study was done for 1 year (July 2003-June 2004). During the period from June 2003 to May 2004, a total of 156 scans were performed with 133Xe. This number comprised 71 normal scans, 54 normal CT scan-negative cerebrovascular accident scan, 15 epileptic patients, 35 encephalitis syndrome (acute meningoencephalitis/encephalomyelitis). No side effects (fatal, respiratory) were noted in any of the study cases. Although 133mXe shows a high tissue-penetration, yet, with its short physical half-life, it was noticed that in children, it cannot be administered in a significant concentration. The concentration of 35- 40% was found satisfactory in normal adults, which was lower in children. Since there is a large uptake of this gaseous agent in the oral cavity and air passages, it is suggested to block the oral cavity and air passages thoroughly. In neurological examination, it was noticed that in children, the concentration of 133Xe in the brain is low. In adults, it was observed that the concentration of tracer is highest in the cerebellum and lowest in the frontal cortex. The concentration of the tracer increases in the frontal cortex and in other brain regions in decreasing order. In conclusion, the use of 133mXe as a gaseous radiopharmaceutical is highly advantageous in brain scintigraphy as it does not have an adverse effect on the air passages and the risk associated with radiation is low. The gaseous emulsion of 133Xe can be used for brain scintigraphy in neurological disease conditions, neonates (birth weight is 500-1000 g), young children, and for repeat studies, in patients who are suspected of having recurrence of the disease after treatment. <EOD> Pharmacokinetics of ceftizoxime in patients with renal failure.

Background
---------

Objective:
The aim of this study was to assess the effect of higher doses of estrogens supplementation (ES) on vasomotor symptoms (VMS), quality of life (QoL) and bone mineral density (BMD) in women with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).

Background:
POI is a syndrome which is defined as the cessation of menses prior to the age of 40 years.

VMS are the most frequent symptom of POI, which negatively impacts the QoL severely, as well as BMD.

Treatment of patients suffering from POI should include hormone replacement therapy (HRT), usually in the form of estrogen combined with either progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate. At present, clinicians prescribe standard HRT dose, that is considered sufficient to control VMS and to improve QoL. However, women, who have complaint of non-control and/or increase of VMS while using ES also have reduced QoL and bone density, compared with healthy women, suggesting that the standard dose ES may be insufficient in such women. It is necessary to study the safety and effectiveness of ES in women with POI at standard and higher doses.

Materials and methods:
Women with POI (n= 86), were included in the present study. In the first 24 months, women received standard HRT (oestradiol and micronized progesterone) in the form of a single daily administration. Afterwards, the women were divided into two groups. The first group received the standard HRT dose (n=92; 1 mg of the estradiol valerate once a day and 200 mg of micronized progesterone vaginally every 14 days and at a total dose of 5.8 mg per month). The second group (n=268) received a standard HRT dose up to the age of 40 and the dosage was increased to 3 mg"

#### Background
##### Research Summary

Background: Previous research shows that a compound derived from natural molecules has the anti-inflammatory effect in both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and it can protect cognitive impairment induced by high lipids, suggesting that it may have pharmaceutical effects for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  AADAC is a compound extracted from Adenosine. Its effect on blood lipid regulation has been tested, and preliminary experiments have confirmed it has certain anti-inflammatory ability in animal models. The study has preliminarily proved that it has a certain effect in improving or protecting cognitive impairment of an animal model. But its specific mechanism of action is still unclear, so this study has put forward the following questions：AADAC has a certain blood lipid regulation effect in vivo, can AADAC inhibit inflammation of vascular endothelial cells and regulate expression of related genes. Can AADAC affect cognitive impairment and expression of related related genes and proteins in animal models. Can AADAC improve or protect cognitive impairment of an animal model, and what is the possible mechanism?

##### Specific Objectives / Goals

The specific purposes of the study are as follows：Firstly, explore the effect of compound AADAC on the function, inflammation, and other related genes and proteins of blood vessels. Secondly, explore the effect of compound AADAC on the function, inflammation, and other related genes and proteins of hippocampal neurons in the rat brain. Thirdly, preliminarily understand the impact of compound AADAC on the function and expression of related genes and proteins in animal models, but the specific mechanisms through which the compound AADAC can improve cognitive impairment and inflammation, and the possible relationship between them is not known, and the purpose of this study is to explore them by specific research and experiments.

This paper describes a new function of human spleen cells in augmenting the ability of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC), but not of monocytes, to lyse tumor target cells in mixed lymphocyte‐tumor cell culture (MLTC) cultures. It has previously been shown that MLTC cultures are a more potent antigen‐dependent source of cytotoxic cells than is the lymphocyte‐tumor cell mixture of the culture, the latter being the source of tumor‐specific cytotoxic cells in cancer patients (1). Here it was shown that spleen cells are required to augment the MLTC‐induced cytotoxicity of normal human lymphocytes but are not active in increasing the lytic activity of blood monocytes. Lytic activity was induced in the presence of normal human l‐leucine and augmented by the addition of spleen‐cell‐conditioned medium (SL‐CM) to the induction medium of the lymphocyte‐tumor cell mixture. The addition of SL‐CM attenuated the proliferative effects of spleen cells on responder cells and was active in the absence of spleen cells; moreover, the stimulation of the production of cytotoxic cells was spleen‐cell‐dependent.

Urolithin A Supplementation in Middle-aged Adults With Obesity
Objective: To study endothelial, cerebrovascular, and serum functional markers of nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and mitochondrial function changes following 4 weeks of urolithin A (UA) supplementation in middle-aged adults with obesity.

Background: Obesity is an emerging worldwide epidemic, and is associated with reduced brain health and impaired cerebrovascular function. NO plays an important role in endothelial function and cerebral blood flow (CBF), and is altered in obesity. UA is a diet-derived metabolite of ellagitannins and ellagic acid from pomegranate fruit, walnuts, and berries, and is recently found to be an activator of mitophagy, a cellular degradation of the mitochondria. UA supplementation was recently shown to acutely increase endothelial NO and increase forearm blood flow in normotensive, elderly adults with obesity. There is some evidence indicating that NO and mitochondrial homeostasis are disrupted in obese humans and animal models, hence studying mitochondrial function in UA-supplemented middle-aged adults with obesity is needed.
Methods: Fifty-four participants (40-64 years of age) body mass index of greater than 30 kg/m2 will be recruited to participate in a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel study for 4 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to intervention or control group. Those in the intervention group will consume 1,000 mg of UA daily in the form of softgel capsules, whereas those in the control group will consume a placebo. Data collection will occur at baseline (day 0) and endpoint (day 28). The investigators will compare outcomes between control and intervention group. Researchers expect that UA supplementation in middle-aged adults with obesity improves endothelial and cerebrovascular function, and that this improvement is accompanied by changes in biomarkers of mitochondrial function and NO bioavailability.

 <EOD> The impact of the environment and lifestyle factors on the natural ageing process
Ageing is an inevitable physiological process that involves the cumulative and irreversible deterioration of functions and structures that arise as a result of the imbalance between the production of free radicals and antioxidant defence mechanisms. The impact of ageing can be divided into two phases: early and late. The early phase of ageing is driven by hormonal alterations, diet, inflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and epigenetic modifications and represents a phase where the body is more susceptible to disease and environmental factors. In contrast, the later phase is linked with the slow deterioration of tissues and organ functions and is characterized by the onset of age-related pathologies and diseases. Although environmental factors such as air pollution or stress are considered important determinants of health trajectories, the role of these factors in early ageing has been understudied. A deeper understanding of the early ageing phase would lead to better strategies for the prevention of age-related diseases and improve life expectancy at a later age. <EOD> Transformation of Mature Preadipocytes to Adipocytes and Its Inhibition by Protein Kinase Inhibitor, Staurosporine: Activation of PKC and Phosphorylation of Protein Kinases

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the effect of human recombinant epidermal growth factor (rh-EGF) on the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), so as to provide a potential therapy for neovascular occlusion.


METHODS
The effect of rh-EGF on the HUVEC proliferation was studied by MTT assay. The cell proliferation and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry, the tube formations were explored by matrigel tube formation tests and cell migration was analyzed by transwell chamber filter, and RT-PCR was used to detect eNOS and VEGF mRNA expressions.


RESULTS
At the 0 - 96 h of HUVEC treatment with rh-EGF, the HUVEC growth rate increased with a time-dependent manner, and reached the plateau from 72 h to120 h, the difference was statistically significant. The results of the FACS showed that the proportion of G0/G1 phase was 79.49% and 11.8% in the treated and untreated groups respectively, a significant difference was revealed (P < 0.01). The cell proliferation index (PI) was also increased from 3.51% to 28.79%, again a difference was noticed (P < 0.01). And the total number of the treated-HUVECs was significantly increased as well (P < 0.01). The results of the matrigel tube forming test indicated that the total tube length was 8.41 +/- 4.22 and 16.83 +/- 6.71 in the treated and untreated groups respectively, the difference was notably significant (P < 0.01). And the number of the branch point of HUVEC tube formation was also increased significantly (P < 0.01). And from flow cytometry, HUVEC growth cycle was shortens obviously, the G0/G1 cell proportions in the treated group were 74.86 +/- 9.80% within 66 h, and 53.09 +/- 9.72% from 66 h to 120 h, and 43.61% +/- 13.30% from 120 h to 168 h, which was significantly different as well from that of the untreated group (P < 0.01, P < 0.05, P < 0.05). HUVEC cell number and cell proliferation were also significantly different from the untreated group (P < 0.01). RT-PCR showed that: (1) The expression of eNOS mRNA was significantly increased in the treatment group. (2) The VEGF expression was also increased obviously in the treatment group.


CONCLUSIONS
The rh-EGF can promote the cell proliferation and cell cycle and enhance cell neovascularization. The high concentration of the rh-EGF can stimulate the cell motility. In conclusion, rh-EGF can be used as the potential therapeutics for the neovascular occlusion. <EOD> Inhibition of Sirt1 by nicotinamide results in decreased resistance of macrophages against oxidative stress.
The mammalian Sir2 ortholog Sirt1 has emerged as an important sensor of metabolic activity in addition to its well-known contribution as a cell cycle controller and tumor suppressor. Recent data suggest that Sirt1 may also represent a hub of signaling between energy availability and DNA damage signaling. Here we provide data indicating that oxidative stress induces Sirt1 expression in mouse macrophage cell lines MHS and RAW 264.7. These data suggest that Sirt1 induction by oxidative stress may represent an organismal adaptation to increase survival of the affected cell upon activation of DNA damage signaling pathways. Inhibition of Sirt1 by nicotinamide (NAM) resulted in increased DNA fragmentation and accelerated cell death induction upon exposure to oxidative stress."

 <EOD> A simple clinical tool for identifying a severe oral form of acetaminophen poisoning.
BACKGROUND
Clinical diagnosis of cases of acetaminophen poisoning is difficult, especially in patients who present a delayed onset of symptoms. This prospective, multicenter study was conducted to develop and validate a simple clinical tool for identifying a severe oral form of acetaminophen poisoning.


METHODS
Data were collected from 1,047 poisoning cases in three French intensive care units that occurred between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2002. To identify criteria for a severe oral form of acetaminophen poisoning, simple and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted separately on a derivation (n = 649) and a validation population (n = 358). The discriminative accuracy of each of these clinical rules was assessed in the validation set using odds ratios, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow calibration test.


RESULTS
Four statistically significant independent risk factors were identified: consciousness disturbance, coagulation disorders, elevated creatine phosphokinase, and jaundice. The probability of a severe oral form of acetaminophen poisoning in the validation group was 87.95% (95% confidence interval, 63.31 to 97.32) for a patient who presented with three of these clinical criteria.


CONCLUSIONS
We were able to develop a simple clinical tool for identifying a severe oral form of acetaminophen poisoning. The availability of this tool may help reduce the delay in diagnosis of this condition and reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with it. <EOD> Synchronized oscillations in a neuron model with spike frequency adaptation and a delayed adaptation
The presence of noise and the delay in adaptation were studied in the delayed phase sensitivity (FitzHugh-Nagumo) neuron model. This model consisted of a linear part and a nonlinear part with adaptive spike frequency threshold. Noise was added in different ways. First, white Gaussian noise was added to the spike frequency threshold, and second, the external input current was corrupted by a white noise process. In all cases, synchronized oscillations, with a period that was independent of input noise, were obtained. A theoretical explanation was given based on multiple-feedback loops. In the absence of noise, the oscillatory behavior was due to a negative feedback loop within the spike frequency threshold to the linear part of the system. <EOD> Fibrinogen concentration measured by the Clauss assay in patients affected by cerebral or extracerebral vascular occlusions.
Prothrombotic factors, thrombocyte aggregation, fibrinolysis are important pathogenetic factors in the etiology of atherothrombosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate fibrinogen concentration in the plasma of subjects with a thrombosis of intra- or extracerebral vessels. Fibrinogen concentration was estimated in 44 patients affected by intracerebral haemorrhagic infarct (INC), 60 patients affected by acute coronary event (ACE) and 23 healthy controls (CTR), utilizing the Clauss method. Fibrinogen concentration was found significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in patients with INC and ACE if compared with CTR. A positive correlation was found (p < 0.001) between serum fibrinogen and CPK and serum albumin in both subjects with ACE and with INC. The significant difference (p < 0.001) of fibrinogen concentration in the three groups of subjects, if compared with each other, suggested that fibrinogen concentration may be a biological parameter able to modify the tendency to intraocular haemorrhagic complications or ischemic heart damage. <EOD> .

 <EOD> Revision of the genus Protophorpeus (Decapoda, Anomura, Paguroidea) from the Indo-West Pacific, with descriptions of P. vanderbilti sp. nov. and P. kagoshimensis (Kabata, 1927) comb. nov.
The genus Protophorpeus from the Indo-West Pacific is revised. The genus is redescribed and five species are described based on both existing and novel material, bringing the number of species in the genus to three, including the type species P. sericeus Rathbun, 1911 and two recently described species from the Red Sea, namely P. aldarwensis Sfenthourakis & Bruce, 2010 and P. redspotted Sfenthourakis & Williams, 2013. The genetic distances among the studied taxa, the mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit I gene (COI), and mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene are very low and do not support recognizing several recently described species (i.e. P. aldarwensis sp. nov. and P. redspotted sp. nov.) as valid species. A new species found in the north-western part of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aqaba, is described under the current name P. vanderbilti Sfenthourakis, Zengeya, Williams, & Khalaf, 2016 from the USA, collected in 2015. The species was originally described by Rathbun (1911) as Anoplocaris aethiopica Rathbun, 1911 from Somalia and the species was transferred to the genus Protophorpeus as Protophorpeus aethiopica (Rathbun, 1911) by Balss (1913), the senior synonym being Anoplocaris sericeus Rathbun, 1911. A lectotype is designated for Anoplocaris sericeus and Protophorpeus aethiopicus (Balss, 1913), respectively, the senior synonym. Including this material results in the revalidation of Protophorpeus sericeus as the type species of the genus; this work may resolve previous taxonomic uncertainties as to where type specimens in the name P. sericeus were deposited and provide a link between Rathbun's 1911 and Balss's 1913 names. The genetic data presented here supports the species status of four taxa. The COI data indicate that a fifth taxon in P. sericeus may be further subdivided into two subclades, each represented by 2-6 morphologically distinct specimens. Two species, a deep-water species from Taiwan and a shallow-water species from the western Pacific appear to contain deep and shallow water forms, respectively. <EOD> An Evolutionary Transition Model of HIV Drug Resistance and Its Spread Based on Certain Stochastic Processes

HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) refers to an HIV variant that is resistant to one or more anti-HIV drugs. The high-risk group of HIV infection is mainly composed of men who have sex with men (MSM) and injection drug users (IDUs). Based on the Markov chain, we construct a continuous-time Markov chain model of HIVDR based on the spread state and the mutation. Our model can predict the speed at which the prevalence of the high-resistance strain increases and the time it takes to reach the peak of prevalence using a large number of drug treatment simulations of patients' HIV drug tolerance. A method for calculating resistance rates is also introduced in this study. By simulating patients' drug tolerance, we establish a mathematical model that can predict the trend of the proportion of prevalence of HIVDR to anti-retroviral therapy.

Background and rationale
=============
There have been recent advances in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) care management which led to a dramatic evolution in the evolution of health care needs and the organization of MS care in France. As a consequence, the management of MS patients is an essential component of any hospital's activities. The hospital of choice in managing a patient and coordinating treatment is the main hospital that patient receives. For patients who have progressive MS (secondary progressive MS (SPMS), primary progressive MS (PPMS) or progressive relapsing MS (PRMS), it must be a tertiary hospital, which has the necessary technologies for patient health care and rehabilitation, as well as sufficient specialised physicians. The main objective of the hospital in treating patients with MS is to provide a therapeutic and care pathways which are adapted to the particular needs of this patient population. The MS health care pathway will be defined as the patient's journey from home to the hospital, and then on to the rehabilitation unit. The clinical and patient oriented evaluation of the disease severity and related functional level, is an essential prerequisite to the choice of an appropriate therapeutic intervention (i.e. drug(s) and/or physiotherapy) and an adaptable patient pathway.

According to the most recent MS epidemiologic data, in 2015 in France, the number of patients with MS was estimated to be 124,300 1 , among which 63,562 2 treated in hospitals and 13,660 treated in Rehabilitation Units 

According to the guidelines of a working group of the European Federation of Clinical Societies (EFNS), the first objective is to provide for early initiation of a disease modifying drugs (DMD) as DMD treatment should start rapidly and early in the disease to modify its course to slow the progression. The second objective is to define a patient pathway providing optimal care, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment of MS, and for monitoring patients with PPMS with an MRI scan exam every 6 to 12 months. Finally, the third objective is to monitor patients with a SPMS with an MRI scan every 1 to 2 years. There is now a better understanding of the importance of early symptomatology detection. It is now known that an early diagnosis using an MRI scan leads to more appropriate diagnosis and treatment of MS. An early early detection requires an early start of DMD, which favours better management of the disease and its better prevention of disability progression. According to ESMS, these guidelines in 2015, have proposed a first assessment of the EDSS score by a neurologist then an MRI.

Patient care is then managed in the usual MS centres. There are MS Centers and Rehab Units in France. There are already approximately 950 MS Centers, 55 multistaffed Rehab Units and 1000 rehabilitation units devoted to MS.

Conclusion: A single-blind, clusterrandomized trial of treatment for VTE was performed. Two
clusters were formed in each hospital, each comprising a group of patients. If patients
received a low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) on the basis of the software, they
were enrolled into the study. The main results
showed that at 90 days the bleeding risk in patients treated
with low molecular weight heparin profiles was not affected by randomization.
The clinical trial was performed on a large population at nine different
academic hospitals in Norway, but only small clusters of patients
within each hospital. There is a lack of evidence regarding the use of LMWH in this clinical setting
for patients with
VTE. There is
also lack of evidence in patients using different prefilled syringes
and randomization. We cannot conclude the results of this clinical trial
to this population

# Strengths and Limitations


# Discussion and findings

This paragraph contains your interpretation of the results described in the abstract

The efficacy and safety of dalteparin and tinzaparin will vary with changes in indications
and risk factors. These effects have not been studied. Clinical experience has shown
that both drugs reduce death rates and bleeding. However, there are no
clear indications when and how the use of low molecular weight heparin should be
prescribed. Therefore, we have investigated and will continue to evaluate these
drugs in a randomized way so as to provide guidance to
treatment with low molecular weight heparin.

In the current clinical setting in Norway, we have a large group of patients who
have no symptoms or signs of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary thromboembolism
or other diseases. In the current clinical setting in Norway, we have a large group of patients which have no symptoms or signs of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary thrombosis. Our intention is to have an RCT to assess the side effects of LMWH for the above patients, as well as to have an RCT to compare the effect between two LMWH,

After the introduction of ultrasound into clinical medicine, anesthesiologists recognized the potential role of the procedure during preanesthetic evaluation of patients. They have been using ultrasound to diagnose pleural effusions, ascites, or any other space-occupying mass in the abdomen or thorax. Ultrasound provides a noninvasive way to differentiate benign versus malignant pleural effusions as well as ascites versus hemoperitoneum. Ultrasound findings are an important indicator of disease process. For this reason, this mode of imaging has been invaluable in assisting medical and surgical teams to plan optimal therapy. The purpose of this paper is to review the application of ultrasonography in anesthesiology practice. <EOD> Growth and Physical Properties of Copper at High Temperatures

 

# Experimental methods
In the earlier phase of this work, it became evident that, in consequence of the very small size of the specimens (the usual size of the pellets is 5 X 5 mm.) and in consequence of the small quantity (1-2 rag.) of copper required for a reasonable number of observations, the reproducibility of the results was entirely dependent on the accuracy of the melting and the handling of the copper. It was necessary, therefore, to devise a melting procedure and a method of packing such as would yield specimens of definite composition and of almost uniform size and shape.
The melting method described above, and employed for this investigation, is designed for the preparation of small pellets of metalloids or of alloys containing metals which can be reduced directly to the metal under an inert atmosphere or in the presence of a small quantity (2 per cent) of nitrogen. As an example, a 2 cm. pellet of magnesium was produced in the following manner: MgO (14-6 per cent), graphite (12 per cent), iron (0-4 per cent), and alloying element (0 to 60 percent) were mixed in a mortar, and pressed into pellets about 1 cm. in diameter. These pellets were wrapped with fine gauze to prevent contact of the surface with the air, and the cylindrical pellets were melted in a tube furnace, as described. The specimens obtained were about 1 cm. in diameter; they were small compared with the 5 X 5 ram. usual specimens, but the size was convenient, and the pellets were uniform in shape.
The 96-100 per cent platinum cylinders (5 X 5 mm.) and pellets (1 X 1 0 ram.) employed in this investigation were from a supply kindly placed at our disposal by Dr. T. H. Ostergren of this Institute. The electrodes were prepared using platinum foil melted in an induction furnace. The copper was then shaped into cylinders or pellets. As described by , it is essential that the platinum electrodes be washed before use in the apparatus to be described. The surface of platinum, in common with metals having high melting points, is covered with oxides which, when ignited, give rise to oxides of the alloying metal, when the metal has been added.

 <EOD> Identification of new functional domains and characterisation of the conserved region of the mitochondrial presequence-binding protein  presequence receptor component.
The mitochondrial presequence-binding protein ( mPPB/PRCP ) possesses an N-terminal presequencing domain and a C-terminal presequence-receptor domain, which interacts with mitochondrial outer membrane Tim22. Previously, we showed that its N-terminal domain ( 1-331 aa) interacts with the mitochondrial presequence, MTS2-72, of a malate dehydrogenase from the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum, whereas its C-terminal domain binds to the transmembrane domain of Tim22. In the present study, we identified functional domains of the yeast mPPB . We found that mPPB is an elongated dimer in solution at neutral pH. Disrupting either disulfide bond in the N-terminal presequence-binding domain of mPPB ( 65-189 aa) resulted in failure to bind MTS2-57, which lacks the consensus presequence binding region. This implies the importance of both the N-terminus and the C-terminus of the mPPB for the binding of MTS2-57. Next, we analysed the effect of the N-terminal 16 aa on the MTS2-binding in vitro using an N-terminal deletion mutant. We found that the first 16 aa are not required but that the presence of this N-terminal sequence enhances binding of mPPB to MTS2. In addition, replacement of mPPB with yeast MAP30 , an atypical ATPase from mitochondria, which is a member of the mitochondrial contact site and cristae organizing system, disrupts the interspace between the inner and outer membranes of mitochondria. Our results reveal new functional domains of mPPB . Furthermore, the characterisation of new functional domains of the conserved region of the mitochondrial outer membrane receptor component of presequence-transport complex  will contribute to the development of targeting treatments for the inner membrane of mitochondria. <EOD> The Cysteine-rich LIM-only Cancer Protein Cable Protects Fibroblasts from H2O2-mediated Cytochrome C Release and Death

Many types of cells, such as normal fibroblasts and the epithelium of the intestinal mucosa, express the cysteine-rich LIM-only (CRP1)/cysteine-rich intestinal protein (CRIP) family of LIM-proteins. Here we show that overexpression of CRP1 protects the proliferating mouse C3H10T1/2 fibroblast line for up to two days from death induced by thapsigargin-and hypoxia-induced ER stress, but not from death induced by H 2 O 2 . Our results suggest that this may be caused by induction of a metabolic switch towards an increased glycolytic metabolism, as observed by an increased ratio of NADH/NAD + .

Summary: [/INST]

 <EOD> Isosorbide mononitrate effect on exercise tolerance after myocardial infarction.
Isosorbide mononitrate (Ismo-20, Ismo-5) is a long-acting organic nitrate vasodilator which has not yet been investigated clinically. In 10 patients at 6-12 months after a myocardial infarction (MI) exercise and heart rate and blood pressure increments during exercise and time to fatigue were measured on 3 days: placebo (Pl), Ismo-20 (5 and 20 mg per day) and Ismo-5 (5 mg). Ismo-5 increased exercise duration (Pl: M = 3.86 min, SD = 0.8; Ismo-5: M = 5.5 min, SD = 1.7; NS), decreased the average heart rate response and slightly increased the blood pressure response during exercise (Pl vs Ismo-5: average heart rate increment 70.61 +/- 3.3, NS; blood pressure increment 19.0 +/- 4.5, NS). Ismo-20 had no effect. These data show a beneficial effect of Ismo-5 on cardiac performance by prolonging exercise tolerance, and this effect may be due, at least in part, to Ismo-5's effect in reducing the heart rate response during exercise in patients with MI. <EOD> Clinical Characteristics in Newly Diagnosed Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Patients: A Retrospective Study From Northeast China (1990–2013)

Objectives: To describe the demographic, clinical characteristics, and laboratory and treatments of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) from Northeast China.Methods: A total of 1,580 patients (1,040 females and 540 males) who were newly diagnosed and hospitalized in our hospital during 1990-2013 were studied retrospectively. Data of medical history, physical and laboratory examinations from the time of admission (20.6 ± 12.4 years of age) to the end of the last follow-up (43.1 ± 7.2 years of age) were collected.Results: The mean diagnostic delay was 10.5 months (4.9 months in females and 15.0 months in males). The rate of nephritis was higher in patients of the age group ≥40 years and patients with longer diagnostic delay compared to those who were younger patients or had shorter delay (P < 0.05). In patients with kidney disease, 15.7% were complicated with hypertension (compared to a total of 10.6% hypertension) and the mean level of proteinuria was 1,610 mg/24-h urine specimen (1,444 mg/24-h urine specimen in patients without kidney disease). Twelve ankles were complicated with a necrotizing fasciitis-like lesion and two patients died. The median follow-up was 1 year. Conclusions: Delay in diagnosing lupus patients should be avoided and treated early with immunosuppressants.

1.  <EOD> The N-Acetylglucosamine-Containing Lipopolysaccharide O-antigen Modification of Neisseria meningitidis Has a Role in Bacterial Virulence, Including Pathogenicity and Invasion
ABSTRACT Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B strains encode the genes neis8531 and neis0126, both of which map in the vtr region of the virulence plasmid B:17. A role for these two operons in pathogenicity was demonstrated by the marked effect of a disruption of either or both of these genes on bacterial survival in blood, spleen, and bloodstream neutrophils. The role of the gene products on bacterial invasion was examined by analysis of their ability to promote translocation of GFP or Lucifer yellow through monolayers of human embryonic kidney cells. Although neis8531 and neis0126 were not identified as invasins during genetic screens and despite a lack of a similarity with other bacterial virulence or pathogenicity-associated factors, a role in promoting both bacterial invasion and survival into cells was shown. This was observed not only for strains of meningococci but also for Escherichia coli, in which Neis8531 was transcribed. Bacteria treated with D-cycloserine (DCS), a compound that causes the release of the O-linked heptose side chain of the neisserial core lipopolysaccharide, demonstrated attenuated ability to invade cultured cells. Complementation of either strain M93U:G5589 or E. coli transformed with neis0126 resulted in restoration of bacterial invasiveness due to the synthesis of core lipopolysaccharide with the modified O antigen. These data suggested a possible role for the modification of glycerophosphorylethanolamine groups of the O antigen in bacterial invasiveness. <EOD> Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a national lockdown on children's pediatric emergency healthcare use during the first phase of the pandemic in Japan: A nationwide cohort study

BackgroundA study on children's health and emergency care was needed in Japan where emergency care systems are underused. As emergency healthcare use provides important health information on the health of children and is relevant to the response to future health issues and the allocation of healthcare resources.ObjectiveThe aim of this study is to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and a national lockdown on children's emergency care healthcare use, including the number of visits during the pre-pandemic and pandemic months, and the reasons for visits.ResultsThere were significant reductions in the overall pediatric visits to emergency care facilities in 2020 compared with before the outbreak and during the first nationwide lockdown. The 2020 number of pediatric visits to emergency care facilities was 68.6% of those in the corresponding period in 2019, which was a markedly higher reduction compared with the reduction (25%) in all of Japan. The reductions were most prominent in the visits for child injuries and poisoning.

# Introduction
Children's health status and emergency care use have long been of interest for the national health authorities in Japan since the Japanese Ministry of Education and Welfare issued a statement regarding the national goal for the elimination of child injuries in Japan and since the government began subsidizing and operating emergency transportation services for pediatric patients in the 1960s. The goal for children's health was based on the 12 major child health problems revealed in a 1963 survey of school-aged children and the 11 leading causes of death among children younger than 15 years old. Although the number of deaths due to pediatric diseases and accidents has decreased steadily in recent years in Japan   Development of pediatric critical care and pediatric severe trauma in Japan: Japanese..., Sekizawa   , data from a 2016 study showed that 75.8% of children in Japan visited an emergency care unit at least once in their entire life   Emergency medical service for children in Japan: A report using data from..., Inoue  .

PURPOSE
To assess the prognostic value of renal cell carcinoma tumour necrosis.


MATERIALS AND METHODS
Between January 2000 and November 2002, we enrolled 47 patients with renal cell carcinoma who underwent radical nephrectomy without preoperative treatment, and in whom the diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic results. The association of histopathologic findings with cancer specific survival and progression free survival was assessed using the t test for survival data. A p value of less than or equal to .05 was considered statistically significant. The survival data were assessed using Kaplan-meier curves, the log-rank test.


RESULTS
There was a significant relationship (p = .003) between tumoral necrosis and metastatic stage. In stage T3-T4 tumours, we observed a decrease of cancer specific survival (p < .001) and progression free survival (p < .001) for patients with necrosis >10%. Kaplan-meier curves of cancer specific survival and progression free survival for stage T3-T4 showed a decrease of these survivals according to the tumour necrosis level. These differences are highly statistically significant (p < .0001).


CONCLUSION
The renal cell carcinoma tumour necrosis degree is a negative prognostic factor. <EOD> The effect of intra-articular injection of fibrin clot on experimental osteoarthritis.

Background: Lewy body disorders, of which dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most common form, encompass neurodegenerative diseases characterized by abnormal aggregation of α-synuclein, including Parkinson's disease, DLB, as well as a number of other disorders and variants. Currently, the diagnostic criteria of DLB heavily rely on clinical presentations, however with a significant proportion of patients classified as prodromal. While research suggests that genetic mechanisms are vital in the development of this condition, no genome-wide analysis has been conducted to examine potential candidate mechanisms influencing susceptibility to this disease. As such, we aim to provide an initial characterization of DLB disease in the context of genetics, to provide potential avenues of future genetic research.Methods:The present work is a large-scale association analysis of DLB in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. We apply case-only association tests and case-control matching via multivariate regression and logistic regression, respectively. The top association findings were examined to identify a set of genome-wide significant genes associated with the development of DLB.Results:We report a significant association of rs1068013, a missense variant in the SEMA5A gene in late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), with an odds ratio of 1.1. In addition, we have identified a set of genes associated with DLB, as well as its associated clinical presentations, including motor and visual processing abnormalities.Conclusions: Findings suggest that genetic mechanisms might play a complex role in the presentation of DLB, and that a genome-wide understanding of the etiology of DLB holds potential for furthering our understanding of the development of the disease itself. Future follow-up studies aimed at replicating those results and elucidating the mechanisms responsible could prove useful to the development of novel therapeutics for DLB and related diseases.

# Background
Cognitive dysfunction is a central feature of dementia and other neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), the second most common form of dementia, known for its heterogeneous presentation and symptom complexity. Pathologically, DLB is characterized by the aggregation of α-synuclein and Lewy bodies, which are implicated in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. The genetics of DLB, however, remain currently understudied as the only notable genetic factor, APOE4, is well known for its strong association with late-onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD). As a result, there is a significant gap in our understanding of which genetic factors may be responsible for the mechanisms behind the development or presentation of DLB. Our analysis aims to address this gap, through a quantitative description of genetics, with the hope that identifying genetics of DLB may allow us to further our understanding of the mechanisms by which the disease develops.
DLB was first described as a distinct disease in 1976 by the Dutch neurologist P.J.D.   Diagnosis and management of dementia with Lewy bodies: third report of the..., Mckeith  . The defining features are cognitive impairment, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating cognition.

Further, the current criteria for diagnosis are based entirely on clinical observations without biochemical verification, which could present a challenge to the accurate identification and reporting of DLB, especially in early stages   Recent developments in dementia with Lewy bodies, Ong  .

Summary In the early part of the last decade Korea had the world's highest fertility rate with more than 7 children per woman on average. There existed no organization to provide family planning services although the Korean government did provide abortions for a fee in abortion hot spots in the villages and towns. Family planning programs have been initiated in Korea since April 1962. The program was started in Seoul's rural area with the participation of provincial health services provincial family planning associations and private family planning organizations and clinics. The main purpose was for doctors family planning physicians and midwives to receive family planning training at the 4 training centers and to learn from the experience of the pilot centers. Doctors also received training on the use of modern birth control methods. Nurses physicians and midwives received training in the provision of family planning services. The government has not invested substantial capital to set up new facilities. The focus is to conduct training to build competencies and capacity to provide quality services. The National Family Planning Program also supports research to meet the information needs of staff or government or researchers or policy makers and other public and private institutions. The National Family Planning Program in Korea covers the following activities: 1) the expansion of service delivery to other areas beyond the pilot program 2) a survey of contraceptive use 3) the operation of 139 family planning clinics established in 1974 and 4) clinical training programs under the auspices of the Family Planning Clinics of the National Medical Center and Yonsei University Medical Hospital in Seoul. In 1965 the Family Planning Clinics received contracts to provide services and in its first year the clinic served 900 patients. In 1974 under the National Family Planning Program the Family Planning Clinics increased from 30 to 130 in 15 months and by the end of 1974 60000 patients had visited the 130 clinics. (excerpt) <EOD> The role of protein and amino acid supplements in muscle injury and repair.
Growth factors are small peptides secreted by cells and present throughout the body including skeletal muscle, heart, and lung. Many are members of the transforming growth factor (TGF) family, which is responsible for cell proliferation, differentiation, and repair. Among others, these growth factors include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), growth differentiation factors (GDNF), insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF). Skeletal muscle is a highly adaptive tissue able to recover from injury to a greater degree than other tissues, such as the heart or lung, by increasing protein synthesis and reducing proteolysis. Protein synthesis requires the essential amino acids to be present and is directly regulated by muscle contraction. Therefore, protein supplementation increases protein synthesis in both injured and normal muscle. Further research on the specific role of each protein and amino acid in muscle injury and repair is needed. Growth factors have been shown to be released from muscle in response to injury and contribute to repair. Protein supplementation and injection of amino acids have also been shown to promote muscle healing, although the mechanism of action is not fully understood. Protein supplementation in conjunction with growth factors may prove to be beneficial for muscle injury and recovery. <EOD> BIOTIC SPECIES OF MOTH FLIES (Diptera: Psychomyiidae) IN THE RUSSIAN ARCTIC REGION

Palladium on charcoal (Pd/C) catalyzes highly selective oxidative esterification of benzylic, heterobenzylic, aryl, sulfonyl, and alkyl alcohols with hydrogen peroxide in water at room temperature. The high yield is achieved even without the addition of ligands (e.g., acetic acid, pyridine, or DTBNP). The catalytic system of Pd/C and hydrogen peroxide in water is effective as an oxidative esterifying reagent for alcohols and readily available pharmaceuticals and alcohol-containing chemicals. <EOD> High‐resolution melting analysis as a tool for molecular diagnostics of mitochondrial diseases
High‐resolution melting analysis on capillary electrophoresis systems is becoming a powerful tool in mtDNA diagnostics. As an example for validation, we tested 62 mitochondrial‐related samples for mtDNA‐specific abnormalities using a rapid and automatable high‐resolution melting protocol on the rotor‐gene 6000 system from Corbett Life Science. After quality control we detected six variants (two homoplasmons, three heteroplasmons, and one deletion) in 3.21% in four probands with clinical symptoms for mitochondrial disorders. After validation by Sanger sequencing, variants were confirmed for two samples, heteroplasmy for one case, and a deletion for the other. Additionally, we could detect an unexpected deletion in a control sample after visualization by melting curves and further verification by pyrosequencing. We conclude that this method is a fast and accurate screening tool for diagnostics of mitochondrial disorders. After identification of suspicious fragments, melting analysis on a gel‐based system allows a fast discrimination of wild and mutant alleles by visualization of melting curves. As a fast and automatable molecular diagnostic tool for high‐resolution DNA analysis, we propose high‐resolution melting analysis for mitochondrial DNA diagnostic. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. <EOD> Evaluation of a new, low cost, disposable dental probe for dental screening.

 <EOD> Isolated Intraventricular Hematoma and Sturge Weber Syndrome



## Sturge-weber syndrome is a neurocutaneous syndrome
which constitutes an anomaly related to hemispheric angiomas along the trigeminal nerve branch in the neonatal period. In this study, it was seen that a 17-year-old girl was admitted to the emergency room with headache, weakness of the left side of the body and aphasia. The patient developed intraventricular hematoma (IVH) which was completely resected under surgical treatment. At her next examination, it was seen histopathologically that the removed hematoma contained hemoglobin and was made up of broken red corpuscles. It was also seen that the IVH was consistent with the cerebral hemangioma in the left parietal-occipital regions of her brain. Sturge-Weber Syndrome also constitutes angiomas in the brain and sometimes in the face, and is diagnosed through the presence of angiograms of cerebral hemangioma in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as well as the presence of a spot on the face. Neurocutaneous syndromes constitute a group of diseases which may show cutaneous pigmentation in all organ systems. This is very important to be able to make early diagnoses of infants with these diseases, since these constitute life-critical diseases and, if left untreated, progress very fast. <EOD> .
Burnout is a syndrome characterized by physical, affective, and cognitive manifestations. It has been identified as a public health concern in clinical and nonclinical health personnel. A structural equation model was constructed that included two burnout factors: emotional exhaustion and depersonalization, with a third factor called personal accomplishment. This model was tested in a sample of 375 health personnel. The results showed that physical, emotional and social demands were not good predictors of burnout, although working shift, a shortage of human and material resources and an unhealthy environment were significant predictors of burnout. The authors suggest that future studies adopt the same methodology to identify predictors of burnout for each health condition or health problem. <EOD> Phase control in ultrashort pulse laser ablation.
We describe an approach to phase lock the frequency of an ultrashort pulsed laser system. Two separate methods are used in which the laser system undergoes a chirped frequency sweep or a chirped frequency sweep is introduced to the ultrashort pulse. The phase is locked by using the signal from a fiber optic reflectometer that is either part of the laser system or coupled into the laser system. The technique is applied to an ultrafast regenerative amplifier whose laser system frequency is 1063 nm and 1 mJ pulses at 6.7 ps pulse width. The phase control technique is shown to increase the pulse energy up to 80% and to increase the output pulse duration up to 80%. The technique should be useful to those investigating pulsed laser phenomena at intensities greater than approximately 10 GW/cm2. <EOD> Cystic Lymphangioma of the Pancreas: A Case Report and Review of Therapeutic Strategies
A 63-year-old man with a history of an unresected 5.5 cm × 4.2 cm cystic pancreatic lesion was admitted to this hospital with epigastric pain. Plain computed tomography (CT) showed a 4.6-cm × 5.3-cm homogeneous cystic tumor located in the pancreatic body. The lesion showed a hyperintense image on T2-weighted magnetic resonance images. The wall contained a solid component that was slightly hypointense on T1-weighted images and not contrasted. We diagnosed the lesion as a benign or borderline tumor and performed a laparoscopic distal pancreatectomy. Macroscopically, a unicystic mass was seen, measuring 48 mm × 40 mm in diameter. It was not resected en bloc, with the main pancreatic duct. The cyst walls showed a clear lining and a smooth surface. The cyst was filled with a clear yellowish milky fluid, with multiloculated cystic components. Histologically, the cystic wall was thin,"

B lymphoblast-induced maturation protein (BATF) is a pleiotropic transcription factor that belongs to the APETLA (AP-1) family. Previous studies have identified the functional roles of BATF in the development of T cell receptor (TCR) beta(+) T cells. However, the role of BATF in the development of NKT cells remains largely unknown. In this study, we present evidence that BATF plays a pivotal role in NKT cell development. NKT cell-specific gene expression of BATF is very low in a double-positive stage and starts to be gradually up-regulated in the NKT single-positive stage. Transgenic mice that overexpress BATF in NKT cells have significantly increased NKT cell numbers in thymus and spleen. Moreover, Batf(-/-) mice have a less NKT cell accumulation in the spleen. Surprisingly, we found that Batf(-/-) NKT cells are less mature; however, they show no defect in TCR signaling, proliferation, or cytokine secretion. NKT cell development is impaired in Batf(-/-) mice owing to reduced progenitors and diminished DP, SP, and CD4(+) SP stages. Thus, our findings indicate that BATF plays a critical role in the NKT cell process of DP to SP, CD4(+)SP stage, which contributes to the NKT cell development. <EOD> An unusual case of a patient with abducentrodentatoma.

Design Details

Primary Purpose: Treatment
Allocation: Randomized
Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment
Interventional Model Description: After 20 patients randomized the advisory board will unblind subjects to determine if the fluoxetine arm should be continued. Since it is not expected to have any beneficial effect of this treatment (it is only a comparative control to the effect of paroxetine on serotonin metabolism). Based on the decision of the committee the study could exclude the serotonin arm and the definitive sample size is going to be calculated. The fluoxetine group was removed from the study after analysis of the first 20 patients (as foreseen in the initial protocol, after 20 patients included the blind would be broken to determine the final sample size) as it did not present an apparent benefit in the primary outcome. Considering that it had been included as a comparator for the effect of paroxetine on serotonin metabolism, and no beneficial effect from its use was anticipated, the study management committee decided to withdraw it.

Background: Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a sudden and fatal arrhythmia that presents with no apparent cause. In the treatment of thyroid cancer, general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation, neck circumference restriction, and tissue resection may all lead to changes in hemodynamic parameters, resulting in the occurrence of VF. However, VF without relevant underlying disease is rare during thyroid cancer surgery.Case presentation: In this study, we report the case of a 56-year-old female with suspected thyroid cancer who underwent surgery. During surgery, the patient's heart rate showed slow abnormal changes and blood pressure fluctuations, and VF occurred 4 min after the operation without obvious cause. After 10 min of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), the patient's hemodynamic function returned to normal. Subsequently, the patient was extubated successfully and discharged from the intensive care unit on the 3 rd day. The patient was then diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer after pathology confirmed the papillary thyroid cancer cells.Conclusion: This study reports a case of VF in a patient with no relevant underlying disease during surgery. We emphasize the importance of the vigilant monitoring of patients, early detection of adverse events, rapid adjustment of anesthesia in case of abnormal hemodynamic changes, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation measures to ensure the recovery of patients.

# Background
Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is an arrhythmia caused by abnormal depolarization of the ventricles. VF can cause sudden death, with a mortality rate of >80% and death within 1 h after the onset of VF. Sudden death has always been a major challenge in clinical practice, and there is little research to prevent and diagnose the disease at an early stage. Therefore, VF is a life-threatening disease that physicians must understand. In general, surgery can damage the myocardium, leading to abnormal electrical heart signals. VF is often caused by ischemia and hypoxia, but can also occur when the heart is mechanically damaged, leading to death. Studies have shown that VF occurs in 0"

 <EOD> Clinical Characteristics and Outcomes Associated With Long-Term Use of Opioids Among Patients Undergoing Total Hip or Knee Osteoarthritis Arthroplasty: A Retrospective Cohort Analysis of a US Claims Database.
Patients with osteoarthritis who received total hip (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to treat osteoarthritis may need long-term opioid use for postprocedural pain and other symptoms. Opioids are prescribed for pain in approximately 70% of THA and TKA patients; however, most of this prescribing continues long term.1 There are no published data describing the rates of and factors associated with long-term opioid use in THA and TKA patients. Our objective is to assess the rate of and factors associated with long-term opioid use (defined as a prescribing gap of ≥ 181 days or 6 months) in patients undergoing THA or TKA for osteoarthritis.

This retrospective cohort study utilized OptumLabs Data Warehouse (Optum, Eden Prairie, Minnesota) data, which includes insurance claims and electronic health record data from a large private insurer in the United States. The study period was January 1, 2007 through September 30, 2017, and the follow-up period was June 1, 2016 through September 30, 2017. Institutional review board approval was obtained from the Human Subject Research Protection Program at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, Texas).

Patients undergoing THA or TKA (International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System 81.51 or 81.54 for THA and 81.52 or 81.53 for TKA) were identified using Current Procedural Terminology codes, with subsequent exclusion of patients with previous procedures performed on the same joint, a major … <EOD> Efficient expression of foreign genes in the milk of dairy goats after intrauterine injection of transgenic embryos produced by in vitro fertilization.
The human thrombopoietin (hTHPO) gene was introduced into goat embryos by the pronuclear injection method and then transgenic embryos were aggregated with in vitro-matured goat oocytes. Of the 1319 embryos injected, 713 survived, and of the 710 surviving embryos injected into goat ovaries, 606 (97.3%) were transferred into one uterus of a recipient goat. Two transgenic offspring were obtained, and the hTHPO gene was maintained in the germ line. One transgenic founder animal, 3871T, was detected to express the hTHPO gene. Southern-blot analysis revealed that the copy number of transgene integrated was about 4.0-fold the transgenic founder DNA as the wild type (wt) DNA in animal 3871T, while it was 5.3-fold in the wt DNA at 10 months post-birth, at which age milk could be collected. RT-PCR analysis showed that the hTHPO mRNA was expressed in milk produced by the transgenic founder. The peak hTHPO mRNA levels in milk produced by the transgenic founder at 1.5 months after the first delivery were about 110 times as much as that in milk produced by the wt founder. It would be expected that the transgenic founder produced a similar amount of hTHPO protein in milk as did the wt founder. The peak hTHPO protein levels were 123 ng/ml milk in the transgenic founder at 2 months after the first delivery and was about 100 times higher than that in milk of the wt founder. Taking the amount of hTHPO protein present in human serum at an average time of 2.2 ng/ml, transgenic goat's milk would be enough to replace human therapeutic-dose hTHPO (0.3 mg/kg). Furthermore, we observed a case of natural mating between a transgenic male founder (3871T) and a wt female goat. A transgenic female founder ("

To predict ecotoxicological risk in wild fish stocks to the widespread contaminant 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and its environmental metabolites, it is important to assess a wide variety of toxicological endpoints. Many toxicants have established immunotoxic consequences; therefore, a thorough understanding of how TCDD affects fish immune-responses is necessary. The stress-responsivity may contribute to a decline in immune defense, therefore the combined effects of TCDD on immune-responsivity and the interplay between stress-responsivity and immune-responsivity following TCDD exposure was determined in this study. Juvenile hatchery-reared chinook salmon (n = 140, 30 g) were exposed to lethal TCDD concentrations (2 mg TCDD-eq L -1 ) or non-lethal concentrations of TCDD (100 and 300 ng TCDD-eq L -1 ) for 14 days, while also acclimated to 20°C, 15°C or 8°C. Immune and hematological status was assessed in combination with immune responses to acute cortisol and ACTH stimulations. Exposure to lethal TCDD concentrations impaired the fish immune system, hematologically and immune-responsively when compared to controls. Nonlethal TCDD had no detrimental hematological or immune-responsive effect, but resulted in increased fish stress responsivity. In fish exposed to non-lethal stressors and TCDD, the presence of the stressors ameliorated the TCDD response, as indicated by no mortality and no effect on immune parameters. The interactions observed between TCDD and the stressors provide a framework for exploring the relative effects of other stressors on TCDD-exposed fish.

Introduction contamination was found in all 10 of the monitored samples taken along the 1000-km migration route from the river to the ocean. The toxicity of the 2 primary dioxin TEQ compounds, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and 1,2,3,7,8-pentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (PeCDD), is well documented. In the Fraser River, TCDD and PeCDD were detected in 96% of the fish samples, with TCDD being the predominant dioxin congener, ranging from 86-100% depending on fish developmental stage (Early Prespawning, Early Spawning, Late Maturing, and Late Prespawning). Dioxin concentrations were highest in Late Maturing fish (TCDD: 297-689 pg TEQ g ww -1 , PeCDD: 259-380 pg TEQ g ww -1 ) followed by Late Prespawning fish (TCDD: 206-638 pg TEQ g ww -1 , PeCDD: 55-232 pg TEQ g ww -1 ), Early Spawning fish (TCDD: 191-432 pg TEQ g ww -1 , PeCDD: 157-258 pg TEQ g ww -1 ), and Early Prespawning fish (TCDD: 129-203 pg TEQ g ww -1 , PeCDD: 69-240 pg TEQ g ww -1 )   Chemical contaminants in juvenile Fraser River sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka, during development..., Kelly  .

OBJECTIVE
To investigate the safety and efficacy of the intraglomerular sclerosis in renal biopsy.


METHODS
Using intraglomerular sclerosis methods, we made renal biopsies in 108 cases with clinical diagnosis as membranous nephropathy, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, focal glomerulosclerosis, lupus nephritis, minimal change disease, mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and amyloidosis. After the biopsies, the patient's blood pressure was continuously monitored for 30 min and then 24 h. Urine color was detected. After the patients drank 150 - 200 ml water, the time of first urination was recorded. If the volume of hemorrhage from the biopsy wound on the day 1 to the day 3 was over 50 ml, we would give blood transfusion.


RESULTS
The hemoglobin (Hb) levels decreased more than 2 g/L compared with the control values in 15 (14.06%) cases, but Hb returned to normal levels after blood transfusion. The mean time of first urination in 103 cases was (1.97 +/- 1.15) h, the maximal time was (5.0 +/- 1.16) h. In the 103 cases, 3 (2.92%) persons were hematuric, 3 (2.92%) had mild oliguria, and 2 (1.94%) had vomiting. In the 108 cases, 2 (1.85%) patients suffered from severe headache, and 1 (0.93%) patient complained of nausea (all recovered shortly) when the biopsies were performed.


CONCLUSION
The safety and effectiveness of the intraglomerular sclerosis are not inferior to those of the conventional method. <EOD> Cochlear Implant Use and Hearing Preservation Following Meningiomas Treated With Surgery and Radiosurgery in Pediatric Patients
Objective To evaluate hearing preservation and cochlear implant (CI) use in pediatric patients with meningiomas. Study Design Case-series study using prospectively collected data in a retrospective review. Setting National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke CNS Clinical Trials Group. Patients Pediatric patients with meningiomas treated with resection and/or radiosurgery who were also followed prospectively with respect to hearing preservation and CI use. Intervention(s) Surgical resection with or without postoperative radiosurgery. Main Outcome Measures Audiologic evaluation by experienced audiologists using pure-tone audiometry, speech audiometry, and otoacoustic emissions. Results All pediatric meningiomas treated with some form of resection with and without radiosurgery were evaluated. Of the 141 patients, 31 (22%; 23 pediatric and 8 adults) had some form of pre- and post-operative hearing testing. Of those who had pre- and post-operative testing, 20% (6 patients) had profound sensorineural hearing loss preoperatively, and all achieved at least a class D grade (better than 50% word recognition within 1 m) at the final follow-up. Seven patients underwent CI placement and 42 were lost to follow-up after surgery. Of the 42 patients lost to follow-up, 30 underwent cochlear implantation. Those undergoing CI were evaluated by the same audiologists prior to cochlear implantation with all having a profound sensorineural hearing loss pre-implanation. This cohort of post-CI patients was examined by audiologists pre- and postoperatively with the same examinations used in preoperative assessments. Pre-operatively, all 7 patients had word recognition scores within the class A category (>90%) with a mean follow-up of 90 months (range 12–1"

# Discussion

The main results of this clinical trial will be:

1. The study will provide preliminary evidence on the efficacy of a device for the treatment of medians sternotomy in terms of sternal stability, postoperative sternal stability, safety, prevalence of reinterventions, sternal wound infection, quality of life and sternum integrity.

2. In addition, this study will provide evidence on the efficacy/effectiveness to improve clinical results in terms of postoperative chest pain, upper limb functional capacity, sternal closure operation time.

3. The study will provide information on the cost-effectiveness of the device, comparing it to the standard of care method.


### Safety considerations
In this study the closure system must be tested for its ability to ensure the stability, function and integrity of the sternal closure during different mechanically actions. These tests will be performed on cadavers. For this, it will be necessary that different professionals of the participating centers will be trained to assess the safety of the novel device (Stern FIX).

# Introduction
The influenza virus causes seasonal flu epidemics and pandemics with high morbidity and mortality annually   Influenza virus infection, Forghani  . Infection spreads in seasonal epidemics by about 20% of the global population, and more than 75% of the population is infected in a pandemic. There has been a 3-fold increase in fatal cases resulting from the increased global population, an ageing population and an increased susceptibility to influenza   Global mortality of 2009 pandemic influenza A H1N1, Viboud  .
Influenza viruses, the type A, B, C or D, have a segmented negative sense RNA genome. Four types of influenza A viruses (IAV) have been classified by two major surface antigens encoded by the genome: hemagglutinin and neuroaminidase on the envelope   Influenza viruses: basic biology and potential drug targets, Kumar  . According to the antigenic difference of the hemagglutinin protein, more than 18 hemagglutinin subtypes identified to date have been recognized as strains influenza A viruses. Among these, subtypes H1, H2, H5, H6, H8, or H13 circulate in birds, and subtypes H3, H4, H7-10, H11, H12 or H14, and H15 virus strains circulate in both birds and mammals. Since 2013, several new strains influenza A such as H7N9, H10N8, H6N1, H5N6, H5N8, H5N1 and H7N9 viruses circulated in the poultry or avian community and caused multiple human infections have been recognized   Avian influenza virus (AIV) surveillance in free-grazing ducks on the Yangtze River..., Liu  .

``` <EOD> Identification of an Apoptosis-Related Gene Expressing Pattern Predictive for Adverse Outcome in Patients with Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tears

Background: Tissue-sparing approaches using arthroscopic anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction have been developed to reduce the occurrence of postoperative complications such as stiff knee, osteoarthritis and patellofemoral chondrosis. Thus, it is more important to select the patients who probably benefit from the procedure to avoid inadequate surgical intervention.Purpose: To identify genes involved in apoptosis that are associated with clinical outcome after an arthroscopic transtibial tunnel ACL reconstruction and to assess the discriminatory power of the respective gene-expression patterns.Methodology/Principal Findings: We identified genes that showed significant differences in gene transcription between cartilage from tibial and femoral ACL lesions using the expression profile of 1,403 genes in a set of 8 cartilage specimens from patients that underwent arthroscopic reconstruction. Apoptosis-associated candidate genes were assessed in 21 cartilage specimens from patients undergoing open autologous ACL reconstruction. A high-throughput gene-expression analysis was performed using the Human Apoptosis RT2 Profiler TM PCR array. TGFbeta1 stimulated chondrocytes and normal chondrocytes served as positive and negative controls. Statistical analysis was based on Student's t-test (p,0.05). In the validation phase the relative expression was calculated with respect to the mean expression level of the 15 control genes. Statistical analysis was performed with respect to the functional annotation clustering (Benjamini & Hochberg FDR corrected p-value, p,0.05). Genes associated with apoptosis as well as cell proliferation and apoptosis/survival were identified. We could verify a significantly lower expression of TGFBR2 (P = 0.0266, FC: 21.33) and SOCS1 (P = 0.0211, FC: 21.57) in cartilage from the ACL tibial lesion compared to the femoral lesion.Conclusions: A different expression of genes associated with apoptosis and cell cycle arrest are related to the anatomic origin of the ACL injury. Therefore, the distinct expression pattern could be used to identify patients who benefit from an ACL-respecting surgical intervention. Further investigations are required to confirm the findings and to identify the molecular mechanisms, which are responsible for the different gene expression patterns in chondrocytes associated with the anatomic origin of ACL injury.
