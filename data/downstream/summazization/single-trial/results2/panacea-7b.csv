The three main types of pain share some common characteristics that have been found in recent years in various chronic pain conditions. The concept of nociplastic pain refers to neuropathic pain due to persistent abnormalities in the pain processing system in the central nervous system. Chronic migraine and fibromyalgia are two of the conditions mainly classified as nociplastic, while vulvodynia has not been fully categorized yet. The study will evaluate the role of personality factors, defense mechanisms and history of traumatic events, the presence of central sensitization in the genesis of these pain conditions and the possible therapeutic implications in the treatment of these conditions."

Background: Abdominal wall wound closure remains a critical step in open abdominal procedures and its outcomes can significantly impact overall patient recovery. Currently, there is no standardized measurement or guidance for surgeons on how to best close these incisions. Methods: This is a single center, single arm prospective interventional study on suture device Suture-TOOL® for the closure of midline abdominal incisions. The aim of this study is to evaluate stitch length adequacy and ease of use. 92 patients are planned to be consecutively enrolled. The primary endpoints are i) proportion of laparotomy incisions with a stitch length/wound length (SL/WL) ratio ≥ 4, and ii) wound length/stitch length ratio. Secondary endpoints are i) evaluation of comfort for surgeons as well as satisfaction with the final closure using the Visual Analog Scale."

The aim of the study is to identify immune markers through the analyses of peripheral blood and stool samples, as well as from imaging the tumor. Further, metabolic characteristics with their potential immunological relevance in tumor patients should be analyzed. The study will include cancer patients with primary salivary gland carcinoma, patients with benign salivary gland tumor (chronic inflammatory tumor) and healthy volunteers.
All patients will be recruited before surgery or radiotherapy, if applicable. In salivary gland carcinoma and benign tumors, a tumor sample will be collected before tumor surgery. Peripheral blood and a stool sample will be collected from each patient in salivary gland carcinoma and chronic inflammatory tumors as standard procedure for the treatment. Furthermore, saliva and tumor samples will be stored by using specific protocols for the tissue collection. The patients with a benign tumor will be assessed once and stool and saliva samples will be collected once only. Healthy volunteers will be recruited only once and they will donate stool and saliva samples only once."

Clinical studies examining the effects of various dietary patterns on MS are ongoing, and evidence is still lacking regarding the use of any specific dietary therapy for individuals with MS. In general, individuals living in high-income western countries where the disease is more common; They lead a sedentary life, are less exposed to sunlight, and are fed a high-energy diet rich in animal-derived saturated fats and refined sugar. The Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model that is universally thought to improve health, and it is known that the Mediterranean diet has beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.
The major difference between the Mediterranean diet and the Western-style diet is the source and amount of dietary fat and carbohydrates. The Mediterranean diet is rich in foods containing monounsaturated fat (especially omega-3), antioxidant vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, C, E, folic acid, selenium, zinc, calcium), which are thought to have positive effects on the prevention and course of MS. Preferring vegetable oils instead of animal fats in Mediterranean type diet, preferring fish instead of red meat consumption, preferring low-fat / fat-free milk and dairy products, limiting the intake of simple sugar and refined carbohydrates, increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in pulp and antioxidants. It is thought that this type of nutrition may positively affect the course and treatment of immune diseases by reducing inflammation. Although there is no effective clinical evidence for the application of nutritional support as complementary therapy in MS patients, it is known that patients often use various nutritional supplements to reduce symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. It is also important to determine the frequency of current nutritional support use in order to prevent unconscious use of nutritional support in the group. Because the most common symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, individuals with MS are often less physically active than age-matched adults All these negativities result in decreased functional activities, loss of mobility and balance problems. Walking and, in a broader sense, mobility are functions that are frequently affected in MS and have a high negative impact on quality of life. Gait problems are not uncommon in MS, and it is reported that a significant portion of individuals in this group are adversely affected by their daily living activities. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters."

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, recurrent, and incompletely understood disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn leads to significant physical and mental health problems. The clinical manifestations of CD are diverse, mainly manifested in abdominal pain, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, bowel obstruction, abdominal mass, weight loss, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other symptoms, seriously affecting patients' life. CD prevalence rates have been increasing year by year worldwide. In terms of socio-economic burden, CD is known to involve a high degree of disease recurrence and relapse. In clinical practice, current medical strategies for the treatment of CD focus on reducing disease recurrence and maintaining disease remission. However, the current situation of the disease activity and disease progression of CD are often not accurately evaluated by standard indicators (such as CRP). It can lead to suboptimal treatment and increase the risk of the ineffectiveness of CD treatment, resulting in lower patient compliance, and even the failure of treatment.
Ustekinumab (UST) is a fully human anti-interleukin (IL) 12/23 receptor that selectively targets multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, with significant efficacy and safety in the treatment of CD in Chinese and foreign data. In the past two years, our team has made more in-depth practice and experience with UST in the treatment of CD. In order to guide UST treatment and improve patient response to UST, our team initiated the development of a selective induction therapy (SIIT) based on UST clinical decision-making tools for CD in a research. The concept of SIIT mainly aims to select patients with high likelihood of response to UST regimens according to different indicators (C-reactive protein (CRP) level, Mayo score, and history of treatment failure), and then give a more personalized therapy to reduce the number of doses of UST, shorten the duration of intravenous dripping, and thus improve treatment compliance and adverse events caused by UST.
This study is an original design based on the above considerations. It will use a prospective and randomized manner to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 treatment methods (SIIT and standard induction therapy group) in patients with moderate and low response CD. Our team believes that SIIT can effectively improve the short-term and long-term treatment effects of UST for CD, and also reduce the adverse events of UST and improve patient compliance, providing a new medical approach for the individualized treatment of CD."

The investigators intend to design the characteristics of two fictitious overactive bladder (OAB) therapies to conduct a discrete choice experiment (DCE). To complete this study, patient will be approached in the urology department. They will be given a questionnaire to provide their treatment preferences given the trade-offs in therapy characteristics. This study will include a total of 88 adult patients with overactive bladder. Their treatment preference will be measured as their choice between two fictitious OAB treatments - one involving Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) and the other involving Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM). They will choose between the therapies by filling in the DCE questionnaire. The DCE will also include sociodemographic questions such as age, gender, ethnicity, education level, language spoken, and OAB-related quality of life questionnaires to improve understanding of the CALD population with OAB."

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic endocrinologic disorder that is characterized by the absence or insufficient production and release of insulin due to specific autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islets. This autoimmune destruction is the result of the body's abnormal immune response, leading to significant impairment of the production and secretion of insulin. This impairment leads to hyperglycemia, which over time, can cause damage to multiple body systems such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and the cardiovascular system resulting in chronic complications and significantly reduced quality of life for those living with T1DM. In 2013, it was estimated that there were 145 047 people living with T1DM in South Africa, with some estimates even higher. The prevalence of T1DM in South Africa is increasing, making T1DM one of the fastest growing chronic conditions in the country. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, unlike Type 2 diabetes mellitus, has no clearly defined prevention strategies, hence, there are limited strategies for preventing long-term complications for this disease. Therefore, ongoing management of T1DM, including blood glucose levels, is crucial in preventing the occurrence of these complications, improving life expectancy and quality of life. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the management of T1DM is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to continuously measure glucose levels, provide real-time insights into glucose trends, and provide alerts when blood glucose levels exceed certain thresholds of either too high, or too low. The use of CGM devices has been shown to be associated with clinically significant improvements in HbA1c and other glycemic measures in people living with T1DM. However, despite the benefits of using CGM, there is limited or no access to CGM in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa, due to factors such as high cost, difficulty of use, and lack of local regulatory approval. With the emergence of FreeStyle Libre CGM as a technology that does not require calibration, and the subsequent local regulatory approval in South Africa, there is an opportunity to test the effectiveness and safety of this technology locally. Despite the benefits of using CGM in diabetes management, there has been limited information related to the use of CGM and its impact on glycemic control, quality of life, and cost in South Africa. While there has been research on the use of CGM in both developed and LMICs, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of CGM in LMICs such as South Africa. The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using CGM compared to standard of care in improving HbA1c levels, while assessing its impact on unplanned admission visits related to diabetes, quality of life and cost effectiveness of using CGM among people living with T1DM. The secondary objectives will include: 1. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on blood glucose levels in comparison to standard of care in people living with type 1 diabetes; 2. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes; 3. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications; 4. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on quality of life of recipients of diabetes care and their caregivers (where applicable); 5. Cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. The study aims to enroll 330 participants, divided into 3 study arms. The first arm will consist of participants who will use a CGM in a continuous manner for 9 months starting at enrolment. The second arm will consist of participants who will use the CGM on 4 occasions over the course of 9 months, each CGM use lasting for 2 weeks, with a 9-week break between each use. The third arm will consist of participants who will receive standard of care which will include their own choice of blood glucose monitoring device.  The study is a randomized controlled trial with a pragmatic design aimed at assessing the effectiveness and safety of using CGM compared to standard of care in improving HbA1c levels, while assessing its impact on unplanned admission visits related to diabetes, quality of life and cost effectiveness of using CGM among people living with T1DM, taking into consideration real-world conditions.  A mixed method design will be used to collect data from recipients of diabetes"

AIM OF THE STUDY: The main aim of the study is the treatment of PCa with fractionated Stereo Tactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), an effective and safe treatment, with an intensification of the dose of the radiation target inside the tumor (Dose Intensified Localisation), with the possible increase of cancer control. A few institutions have reported on the intensification of the dose to the DIL (Dose intensified Localisation), without negative consequences on the urinary and gastrointestinal complications. A SBRT study could be defined as a local therapy, not requiring androgen deprivation treatment.
CONDITIONS: Prostate cancer is the main reason underlying the increase in number of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Recent developments in imaging and therapy have brought about an improvement in accuracy and dose distribution. SBRT is a stereotactic radiotherapy technique that uses a higher doses than conventional radiation for the same duration of time, thus reducing the overall treatment time.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a treatment protocol based on SBRT with focal dose intensification on the DIL (Dose intensified Localisation) on PCa patients.
TARGET SIZE: The proposed study has a one-arm, open-label, phase II design, to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a dose escalated SBRT treatment.
POPULATION: Patients will be selected according to the standard risk assessment for prostate cancer. Patients will be histologically confirmed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage intermediate or high and radiological evidence of Prostate cancer.
TREATMENT: A total dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy will be delivered to the whole prostate (including seminal vesicles) using VMAT. Focal dose intensification on DIL as a simultaneous integrated boost - SIBOMP - will be delivered with a dose of 50 Gy in 5 sessions, with a partial protection of the prostatic urethra and bladder trigone. This treatment could be defined as a local therapy, therefore allowing to avoid systemic therapy or androgen deprivation treatment."

The objective of the proposal ""smIlEr"" is to conduct a clinical study in which young people with controlled asthma, age 12-17, can experience a serious game called ""smIlEr"" specifically designed to evaluate whether it has an impact on the effectiveness of the intervention. The main focus is on the physical and psychosocial effects on the children. The study was inspired by the observation that exercise can lead to a significant reduction in asthma related symptoms and that, at the same time, it can improve the overall quality of life. The study is a randomized, controlled trial with pre-post design. 42 children (M = 14; f = 6), 12-17 years old and with controlled asthma according to GINA will receive either the ""smIlEr"" experience or the standard treatment plan (i.e. asthma educational material and physical exercise at home). The children of both intervention groups will be asked to complete 3 in-lab sessions for physiological monitoring and assessment of quality of life. After the sessions, each child will take home a smart wristband suitable for monitoring the amount of exercise performed. Data analysis will focus on group-mean differences in the number of steps recorded during the first and the last week of treatment using the wristbands, in the level of quality of life measured by questionnaires and in the level of the psychobiological response measured by blood biomarkers."

The research hypotheses of the study are: 
1. Acute stress enhances the behavioral and neural effects of PIT on drug-associated cues in subjects with AUD and increases with the severity of AUD. 
2. SUD subjects who show strong PIT effects also show higher impulsivity, worse cognitive control, stronger urge to drink and higher levels of alcohol consumption over the following year. 
3. Cue-induced PIT effects differ between outcome-specific and general PIT effects. 
4. Sources of chronic stress (e.g., social readjustment rating scale, perceived stress scale) moderate the effects of acute stress on PIT effects on drug-associated cues in individuals with AUD. 
5. Sources of chronic stress (e.g., social readjustment rating scale, perceived stress scale) moderate the effects of acute stress on SUD subjects' impulsivity, cognitive control and urge to drink."

Frexalimab is a first-in-class therapeutic human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively inactivates complement component 5 (C5), a component of the complement system that drives inflammation and destruction of tissues. Preclinical studies demonstrated that frexalimab reduces neuronal death and reduces clinical disease and neuropathology in multiple sclerosis (MS) animal models.
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous infusions of frexalimab vs placebo in subjects with nonrelapsing secondary progressive MS. Approximately 840 subjects with nonrelapsing secondary progressive MS who have experienced stable disability progression and are on no concomitant disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous infusions of frexalimab (two infusions of 900 mg, followed by monthly infusions of 600 mg for up to 160 weeks) or placebo. The co-primary efficacy endpoints include time to onset of composite confirmed disability progression (cCDP), confirmed over 6 months. The primary analysis will be based on a mixed model for recurrent (MMRM) analysis. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints include time to onset of cCDP, confirmed over 3 months, time to onset of individual components of the composite, confirmed over 3 months or 6 months, number of new and/or enlarging T2hyperintense lesions per scan as detected by MRI, and number of new and/or enlarging T2hyperintense lesions per month. Safety endpoints will assess adverse events, SAEs, AEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation and AE of special interests (AESIs), number of participants with potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) in laboratory tests, ECG, and vital signs, number of participants with abnormal laboratory results, abnormal ECG with the occurrence of AEs during the double-blind treatment period or the End of Study (EOS) visit. Exploratory biomarker endpoints will include change from baseline in serum Ig levels, serum free light chain (FLC) levels, plasma NfL levels, and plasma c5 levels over time. Subjects who experience disability progression after 80 weeks of treatment will be offered an additional blinded treatment phase with open label frexalimab. All subjects after 160 weeks or early withdrawal will enter the open label treatment period with frexalimab. Subjects may also receive rescue therapy at any point if judged needed by the investigator."

Cleft lip and palate are the most common congenital craniofacial anomaly. For unilateral cleft lip repair, Mishra and modified Millard techniques, have been recently improved. No research has been done to compare these two techniques. Aim of the study is to compare surgical repositioning outcomes between both these techniques and evaluate surgical correction of unilateral cleft lip with Mishra and modified Millard techniques.
Inclusion Criteria: 21 infants of unilateral isolated cleft lip in a group of 21 age of 3-6 month group A -21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had mishra technique repair group B -21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had modified Millard technique repair.
Methods: Anthropometric measurements of both cleft and non cl-teft sides with digital caliper (mm) in centimeter in millimeter, unilateral cleft lip measurements: Vertical lip height Horizontal lip length (horizontal lip length)Philtral length on surgical repaired cleft lip compared to surgical repaired non cleft lip. Qualitative assessment were evaluated before and after repair.
Statistical Analysis: Statistical software was used for data analysis. Analysis was performed by SPSS ver. 24. Student t test, Mann Whitney U test, One way Anova test was used for analysis. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
At 3 months post operative, the surgical repair unilateral cleft lip measurement of the non cleft side (N = 21) the vertical lip height, horizontal lip length and philtral length was measured as 25.6 ±1.99 mm, 37.88±0.66 mm and 11.33±1.33 mm respectively.
The postoperative measurements of horizontal lip length were statistically significant between group A and group B (p<0.001). The mean post operative horizontal lip length of group A was significantly increased than the group B at a post operative of 25 mo.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCVS) predicts that in 2031 heart failure will be the leading cause of hospitalization among those 65 years and older, outstripping all other cardiovascular diseases combined. Unfortunately, many people with HF do not know they have the condition until they end up in the hospital. Early screening for HF can help detect and treat the disease before it is too late. The goal of this study is to provide a screening strategy to help identify patients who are at risk of developing HF within the next 6 months. It is a 6-month pilot study of usual care versus invitation to screening, focusing on patients with three and above risk factors for HF. The investigators want to determine if early screening of patients at risk of developing HF can help identify the right patients, so they can receive treatment, as well as potentially identify those at the most danger so that they can receive closer follow up."

Both the primary and secondary outcomes are significant as they help physiotherapists understand the impact of hospitalization on patients with cardiac diseases and assess the most important factors involved in the complexity level and physical therapist care required. This information is essential in guiding interventions aimed at preventable morbidity in patients hospitalized for cardiac diseases such as respiratory and systemic complications that lead to longer hospital stay, complications, and ultimately mortality. The time frame for the study is an average of 3 months for phase 2 and 3 years for phase 3. This is a reasonable timeframe to collect data and assess the outcomes of the intervention."

Research has found that patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have relatively high symptom burden and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) prior and subsequent to chemotherapy and targeted therapies for relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. Although symptom burden in this population has received increasing attention from clinicians it remains unclear how best to assess and address symptoms and distress in MM patients. The advent of effective therapies for R/R MM, including combination treatments that include immune therapies has led to improved long-term outcomes for patients. However, it is unclear how recent advances in treatment have influenced the symptom burden, daily lives, and HRQoL of MM patients undergoing therapy. A prospective study of patients with R/R MM to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of DLC and its potential to augment existing standards of care for patient support is underway. An opportunity exists to explore how a digital health coaching platform might be used for symptom assessment, behavioral interventions, and to foster greater patient activation.
This study is feasibility-based and will seek to understand the role of digital therapeutics in improving the care of patients with R/R MM. The preliminary outcomes of this study are: (1) to provide a first-look at the feasibility and acceptability of a DLC intervention in patients with R/R MM undergoing chemotherapy treatment; (2) to examine the relationships between PROs, clinical assessment, and wearable data; and (3) to characterize how patients with R/R MM engage with a digital health coaching platform and the effect of engagement on HRQoL and other supportive care outcomes. By characterizing barriers and enablers to enrollment, feasibility, and patient engagement, and through the inclusion of bi-directional assessments between the patient and participating health advisors, this study will inform future interventional studies designed to engage and support patients with R/R MM as they undergo chemotherapy treatment.

The effect of a 4-week 10-20 g/day WholeFiberTM intervention (a dried vegetable rich in 4 types of prebiotic fiber, including inulin, pectin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose) on fecal calprotectin, IBD-complaints and QoL, serum inflammatory markers, gut microbiota and SCFA-levels, was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Secondary endpoints were the response on the intervention with WholeFiberTM, depending on whether the patient had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Fecal samples were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and SCFA-levels determined in stool samples. In addition, an evaluation questionnaire was administered to assess feasibility and acceptance of the WholeFiberTM intervention in this population. All samples were collected by the UMCG study team before and after a 4-week intervention. It was determined that the intervention resulted in improvements of fecal calprotectin and several aspects of fatigue in patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis. The effect of WholeFiberTM on health-related quality of life was not consistently observed in the two groups of patients. Improvements of stool consistency and stool frequency were not consistently observed either. Changes were observed in the fecal microbiota composition for patients with ulcerative colitis, but not for patients with Crohn's disease. Overall, this pilot study suggests that the daily use of 10-20 g WholeFiberTM for 4 weeks may provide beneficial effects on clinical outcomes, quality of life and the gut microbiota in patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, although more in-depth studies are warranted."

The main objective is to compare the changes in heart rate variability that occur during exercise with Virtual Reality in chronic renal patients during in-center hemodialysis to those that occur during conventional exercise. The study will include the main questions: What are the differences in the changes in heart rate variability modulation between chronic renal patients who undergo conventional physical exercise before and during hemodialysis sessions, and those who engage in virtual environment exercises? How does the virtual environment influence the changes in heart rate variability modulation compared to conventional physical exercise in chronic renal patients before and during hemodialysis sessions? What is the relative effectiveness of conventional physical exercise compared to virtual environment exercise in improving heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients before and during hemodialysis sessions? For this purpose, heart rate and respiratory rate data, as well as blood pressure, oxygen saturation, laboratory tests, quality of life, anxiety, depression, and physical activity will be collected."
