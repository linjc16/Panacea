The three main types of pain share some common characteristics that have been found in recent years in various chronic pain conditions. The concept of nociplastic pain refers to neuropathic pain due to persistent abnormalities in the pain processing system in the central nervous system. Chronic migraine and fibromyalgia are two of the conditions mainly classified as nociplastic, while vulvodynia has not been fully categorized yet. The study will evaluate the role of personality factors, defense mechanisms and history of traumatic events, the presence of central sensitization in the genesis of these pain conditions and the possible therapeutic implications in the treatment of these conditions."

Background: Abdominal wall wound closure remains a critical step in open abdominal procedures and its outcomes can significantly impact overall patient recovery. Currently, there is no standardized measurement or guidance for surgeons on how to best close these incisions. Methods: This is a single center, single arm prospective interventional study on suture device Suture-TOOL® for the closure of midline abdominal incisions. The aim of this study is to evaluate stitch length adequacy and ease of use. 92 patients are planned to be consecutively enrolled. The primary endpoints are i) proportion of laparotomy incisions with a stitch length/wound length (SL/WL) ratio ≥ 4, and ii) wound length/stitch length ratio. Secondary endpoints are i) evaluation of comfort for surgeons as well as satisfaction with the final closure using the Visual Analog Scale."

The aim of the study is to identify immune markers through the analyses of peripheral blood and stool samples, as well as from imaging the tumor. Further, metabolic characteristics with their potential immunological relevance in tumor patients should be analyzed. The study will include cancer patients with primary salivary gland carcinoma, patients with benign salivary gland tumor (chronic inflammatory tumor) and healthy volunteers.
All patients will be recruited before surgery or radiotherapy, if applicable. In salivary gland carcinoma and benign tumors, a tumor sample will be collected before tumor surgery. Peripheral blood and a stool sample will be collected from each patient in salivary gland carcinoma and chronic inflammatory tumors as standard procedure for the treatment. Furthermore, saliva and tumor samples will be stored by using specific protocols for the tissue collection. The patients with a benign tumor will be assessed once and stool and saliva samples will be collected once only. Healthy volunteers will be recruited only once and they will donate stool and saliva samples only once."

Clinical studies examining the effects of various dietary patterns on MS are ongoing, and evidence is still lacking regarding the use of any specific dietary therapy for individuals with MS. In general, individuals living in high-income western countries where the disease is more common; They lead a sedentary life, are less exposed to sunlight, and are fed a high-energy diet rich in animal-derived saturated fats and refined sugar. The Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model that is universally thought to improve health, and it is known that the Mediterranean diet has beneficial effects in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.
The major difference between the Mediterranean diet and the Western-style diet is the source and amount of dietary fat and carbohydrates. The Mediterranean diet is rich in foods containing monounsaturated fat (especially omega-3), antioxidant vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, C, E, folic acid, selenium, zinc, calcium), which are thought to have positive effects on the prevention and course of MS. Preferring vegetable oils instead of animal fats in Mediterranean type diet, preferring fish instead of red meat consumption, preferring low-fat / fat-free milk and dairy products, limiting the intake of simple sugar and refined carbohydrates, increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in pulp and antioxidants. It is thought that this type of nutrition may positively affect the course and treatment of immune diseases by reducing inflammation. Although there is no effective clinical evidence for the application of nutritional support as complementary therapy in MS patients, it is known that patients often use various nutritional supplements to reduce symptoms that negatively affect their quality of life. It is also important to determine the frequency of current nutritional support use in order to prevent unconscious use of nutritional support in the group. Because the most common symptoms of MS are muscle weakness, individuals with MS are often less physically active than age-matched adults All these negativities result in decreased functional activities, loss of mobility and balance problems. Walking and, in a broader sense, mobility are functions that are frequently affected in MS and have a high negative impact on quality of life. Gait problems are not uncommon in MS, and it is reported that a significant portion of individuals in this group are adversely affected by their daily living activities. The aim of this study is to determine compliance with the Mediterranean diet, the tendency to use various nutritional supplements, physical activity habits, walking-related problems and quality of life in MS patients and to evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters."

Crohn's disease (CD) is a chronic, recurrent, and incompletely understood disease of the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn leads to significant physical and mental health problems. The clinical manifestations of CD are diverse, mainly manifested in abdominal pain, abnormal gastrointestinal motility, bowel obstruction, abdominal mass, weight loss, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding, and other symptoms, seriously affecting patients' life. CD prevalence rates have been increasing year by year worldwide. In terms of socio-economic burden, CD is known to involve a high degree of disease recurrence and relapse. In clinical practice, current medical strategies for the treatment of CD focus on reducing disease recurrence and maintaining disease remission. However, the current situation of the disease activity and disease progression of CD are often not accurately evaluated by standard indicators (such as CRP). It can lead to suboptimal treatment and increase the risk of the ineffectiveness of CD treatment, resulting in lower patient compliance, and even the failure of treatment.
Ustekinumab (UST) is a fully human anti-interleukin (IL) 12/23 receptor that selectively targets multiple pro-inflammatory cytokines, with significant efficacy and safety in the treatment of CD in Chinese and foreign data. In the past two years, our team has made more in-depth practice and experience with UST in the treatment of CD. In order to guide UST treatment and improve patient response to UST, our team initiated the development of a selective induction therapy (SIIT) based on UST clinical decision-making tools for CD in a research. The concept of SIIT mainly aims to select patients with high likelihood of response to UST regimens according to different indicators (C-reactive protein (CRP) level, Mayo score, and history of treatment failure), and then give a more personalized therapy to reduce the number of doses of UST, shorten the duration of intravenous dripping, and thus improve treatment compliance and adverse events caused by UST.
This study is an original design based on the above considerations. It will use a prospective and randomized manner to compare the efficacy and safety of 2 treatment methods (SIIT and standard induction therapy group) in patients with moderate and low response CD. Our team believes that SIIT can effectively improve the short-term and long-term treatment effects of UST for CD, and also reduce the adverse events of UST and improve patient compliance, providing a new medical approach for the individualized treatment of CD."

The investigators intend to design the characteristics of two fictitious overactive bladder (OAB) therapies to conduct a discrete choice experiment (DCE). To complete this study, patient will be approached in the urology department. They will be given a questionnaire to provide their treatment preferences given the trade-offs in therapy characteristics. This study will include a total of 88 adult patients with overactive bladder. Their treatment preference will be measured as their choice between two fictitious OAB treatments - one involving Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) and the other involving Sacral Neuromodulation (SNM). They will choose between the therapies by filling in the DCE questionnaire. The DCE will also include sociodemographic questions such as age, gender, ethnicity, education level, language spoken, and OAB-related quality of life questionnaires to improve understanding of the CALD population with OAB."

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is a chronic endocrinologic disorder that is characterized by the absence or insufficient production and release of insulin due to specific autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic islets. This autoimmune destruction is the result of the body's abnormal immune response, leading to significant impairment of the production and secretion of insulin. This impairment leads to hyperglycemia, which over time, can cause damage to multiple body systems such as the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and the cardiovascular system resulting in chronic complications and significantly reduced quality of life for those living with T1DM. In 2013, it was estimated that there were 145 047 people living with T1DM in South Africa, with some estimates even higher. The prevalence of T1DM in South Africa is increasing, making T1DM one of the fastest growing chronic conditions in the country. Type 1 diabetes mellitus, unlike Type 2 diabetes mellitus, has no clearly defined prevention strategies, hence, there are limited strategies for preventing long-term complications for this disease. Therefore, ongoing management of T1DM, including blood glucose levels, is crucial in preventing the occurrence of these complications, improving life expectancy and quality of life. The use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) in the management of T1DM is becoming increasingly popular due to its ability to continuously measure glucose levels, provide real-time insights into glucose trends, and provide alerts when blood glucose levels exceed certain thresholds of either too high, or too low. The use of CGM devices has been shown to be associated with clinically significant improvements in HbA1c and other glycemic measures in people living with T1DM. However, despite the benefits of using CGM, there is limited or no access to CGM in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) such as South Africa, due to factors such as high cost, difficulty of use, and lack of local regulatory approval. With the emergence of FreeStyle Libre CGM as a technology that does not require calibration, and the subsequent local regulatory approval in South Africa, there is an opportunity to test the effectiveness and safety of this technology locally. Despite the benefits of using CGM in diabetes management, there has been limited information related to the use of CGM and its impact on glycemic control, quality of life, and cost in South Africa. While there has been research on the use of CGM in both developed and LMICs, little is known about the effectiveness and safety of CGM in LMICs such as South Africa. The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of using CGM compared to standard of care in improving HbA1c levels, while assessing its impact on unplanned admission visits related to diabetes, quality of life and cost effectiveness of using CGM among people living with T1DM. The secondary objectives will include: 1. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on blood glucose levels in comparison to standard of care in people living with type 1 diabetes; 2. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on the variability of blood glucose concentrations related to diabetes; 3. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on unplanned visits to outpatient clinics and/or hospital related to diabetes complications; 4. Impact of continuous and intermittent CGM use on quality of life of recipients of diabetes care and their caregivers (where applicable); 5. Cost of continuous and intermittent CGM use from a user and provider perspective. The study aims to enroll 330 participants, divided into 3 study arms. The first arm will consist of participants who will use a CGM in a continuous manner for 9 months starting at enrolment. The second arm will consist of participants who will use the CGM on 4 occasions over the course of 9 months, each CGM use lasting for 2 weeks, with a 9-week break between each use. The third arm will consist of participants who will receive standard of care which will include their own choice of blood glucose monitoring device.  The study is a randomized controlled trial with a pragmatic design aimed at assessing the effectiveness and safety of using CGM compared to standard of care in improving HbA1c levels, while assessing its impact on unplanned admission visits related to diabetes, quality of life and cost effectiveness of using CGM among people living with T1DM, taking into consideration real-world conditions.  A mixed method design will be used to collect data from recipients of diabetes"

AIM OF THE STUDY: The main aim of the study is the treatment of PCa with fractionated Stereo Tactic Body Radiotherapy (SBRT), an effective and safe treatment, with an intensification of the dose of the radiation target inside the tumor (Dose Intensified Localisation), with the possible increase of cancer control. A few institutions have reported on the intensification of the dose to the DIL (Dose intensified Localisation), without negative consequences on the urinary and gastrointestinal complications. A SBRT study could be defined as a local therapy, not requiring androgen deprivation treatment.
CONDITIONS: Prostate cancer is the main reason underlying the increase in number of diagnostic and therapeutic techniques. Recent developments in imaging and therapy have brought about an improvement in accuracy and dose distribution. SBRT is a stereotactic radiotherapy technique that uses a higher doses than conventional radiation for the same duration of time, thus reducing the overall treatment time.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of a treatment protocol based on SBRT with focal dose intensification on the DIL (Dose intensified Localisation) on PCa patients.
TARGET SIZE: The proposed study has a one-arm, open-label, phase II design, to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of a dose escalated SBRT treatment.
POPULATION: Patients will be selected according to the standard risk assessment for prostate cancer. Patients will be histologically confirmed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate, clinical stage intermediate or high and radiological evidence of Prostate cancer.
TREATMENT: A total dose of 36.25 Gy in 5 fractions of 7.25 Gy will be delivered to the whole prostate (including seminal vesicles) using VMAT. Focal dose intensification on DIL as a simultaneous integrated boost - SIBOMP - will be delivered with a dose of 50 Gy in 5 sessions, with a partial protection of the prostatic urethra and bladder trigone. This treatment could be defined as a local therapy, therefore allowing to avoid systemic therapy or androgen deprivation treatment."

The objective of the proposal ""smIlEr"" is to conduct a clinical study in which young people with controlled asthma, age 12-17, can experience a serious game called ""smIlEr"" specifically designed to evaluate whether it has an impact on the effectiveness of the intervention. The main focus is on the physical and psychosocial effects on the children. The study was inspired by the observation that exercise can lead to a significant reduction in asthma related symptoms and that, at the same time, it can improve the overall quality of life. The study is a randomized, controlled trial with pre-post design. 42 children (M = 14; f = 6), 12-17 years old and with controlled asthma according to GINA will receive either the ""smIlEr"" experience or the standard treatment plan (i.e. asthma educational material and physical exercise at home). The children of both intervention groups will be asked to complete 3 in-lab sessions for physiological monitoring and assessment of quality of life. After the sessions, each child will take home a smart wristband suitable for monitoring the amount of exercise performed. Data analysis will focus on group-mean differences in the number of steps recorded during the first and the last week of treatment using the wristbands, in the level of quality of life measured by questionnaires and in the level of the psychobiological response measured by blood biomarkers."

The research hypotheses of the study are: 
1. Acute stress enhances the behavioral and neural effects of PIT on drug-associated cues in subjects with AUD and increases with the severity of AUD. 
2. SUD subjects who show strong PIT effects also show higher impulsivity, worse cognitive control, stronger urge to drink and higher levels of alcohol consumption over the following year. 
3. Cue-induced PIT effects differ between outcome-specific and general PIT effects. 
4. Sources of chronic stress (e.g., social readjustment rating scale, perceived stress scale) moderate the effects of acute stress on PIT effects on drug-associated cues in individuals with AUD. 
5. Sources of chronic stress (e.g., social readjustment rating scale, perceived stress scale) moderate the effects of acute stress on SUD subjects' impulsivity, cognitive control and urge to drink."

Frexalimab is a first-in-class therapeutic human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that selectively inactivates complement component 5 (C5), a component of the complement system that drives inflammation and destruction of tissues. Preclinical studies demonstrated that frexalimab reduces neuronal death and reduces clinical disease and neuropathology in multiple sclerosis (MS) animal models.
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III multicenter study to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous infusions of frexalimab vs placebo in subjects with nonrelapsing secondary progressive MS. Approximately 840 subjects with nonrelapsing secondary progressive MS who have experienced stable disability progression and are on no concomitant disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous infusions of frexalimab (two infusions of 900 mg, followed by monthly infusions of 600 mg for up to 160 weeks) or placebo. The co-primary efficacy endpoints include time to onset of composite confirmed disability progression (cCDP), confirmed over 6 months. The primary analysis will be based on a mixed model for recurrent (MMRM) analysis. Additional secondary efficacy endpoints include time to onset of cCDP, confirmed over 3 months, time to onset of individual components of the composite, confirmed over 3 months or 6 months, number of new and/or enlarging T2hyperintense lesions per scan as detected by MRI, and number of new and/or enlarging T2hyperintense lesions per month. Safety endpoints will assess adverse events, SAEs, AEs leading to permanent study intervention discontinuation and AE of special interests (AESIs), number of participants with potentially clinically significant abnormalities (PCSAs) in laboratory tests, ECG, and vital signs, number of participants with abnormal laboratory results, abnormal ECG with the occurrence of AEs during the double-blind treatment period or the End of Study (EOS) visit. Exploratory biomarker endpoints will include change from baseline in serum Ig levels, serum free light chain (FLC) levels, plasma NfL levels, and plasma c5 levels over time. Subjects who experience disability progression after 80 weeks of treatment will be offered an additional blinded treatment phase with open label frexalimab. All subjects after 160 weeks or early withdrawal will enter the open label treatment period with frexalimab. Subjects may also receive rescue therapy at any point if judged needed by the investigator."

Cleft lip and palate are the most common congenital craniofacial anomaly. For unilateral cleft lip repair, Mishra and modified Millard techniques, have been recently improved. No research has been done to compare these two techniques. Aim of the study is to compare surgical repositioning outcomes between both these techniques and evaluate surgical correction of unilateral cleft lip with Mishra and modified Millard techniques.
Inclusion Criteria: 21 infants of unilateral isolated cleft lip in a group of 21 age of 3-6 month group A -21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had mishra technique repair group B -21 patient of unilateral cleft lip had modified Millard technique repair.
Methods: Anthropometric measurements of both cleft and non cl-teft sides with digital caliper (mm) in centimeter in millimeter, unilateral cleft lip measurements: Vertical lip height Horizontal lip length (horizontal lip length)Philtral length on surgical repaired cleft lip compared to surgical repaired non cleft lip. Qualitative assessment were evaluated before and after repair.
Statistical Analysis: Statistical software was used for data analysis. Analysis was performed by SPSS ver. 24. Student t test, Mann Whitney U test, One way Anova test was used for analysis. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
At 3 months post operative, the surgical repair unilateral cleft lip measurement of the non cleft side (N = 21) the vertical lip height, horizontal lip length and philtral length was measured as 25.6 ±1.99 mm, 37.88±0.66 mm and 11.33±1.33 mm respectively.
The postoperative measurements of horizontal lip length were statistically significant between group A and group B (p<0.001). The mean post operative horizontal lip length of group A was significantly increased than the group B at a post operative of 25 mo.

The Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCVS) predicts that in 2031 heart failure will be the leading cause of hospitalization among those 65 years and older, outstripping all other cardiovascular diseases combined. Unfortunately, many people with HF do not know they have the condition until they end up in the hospital. Early screening for HF can help detect and treat the disease before it is too late. The goal of this study is to provide a screening strategy to help identify patients who are at risk of developing HF within the next 6 months. It is a 6-month pilot study of usual care versus invitation to screening, focusing on patients with three and above risk factors for HF. The investigators want to determine if early screening of patients at risk of developing HF can help identify the right patients, so they can receive treatment, as well as potentially identify those at the most danger so that they can receive closer follow up."

Both the primary and secondary outcomes are significant as they help physiotherapists understand the impact of hospitalization on patients with cardiac diseases and assess the most important factors involved in the complexity level and physical therapist care required. This information is essential in guiding interventions aimed at preventable morbidity in patients hospitalized for cardiac diseases such as respiratory and systemic complications that lead to longer hospital stay, complications, and ultimately mortality. The time frame for the study is an average of 3 months for phase 2 and 3 years for phase 3. This is a reasonable timeframe to collect data and assess the outcomes of the intervention."

Research has found that patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have relatively high symptom burden and poor health-related quality of life (HRQoL) prior and subsequent to chemotherapy and targeted therapies for relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease. Although symptom burden in this population has received increasing attention from clinicians it remains unclear how best to assess and address symptoms and distress in MM patients. The advent of effective therapies for R/R MM, including combination treatments that include immune therapies has led to improved long-term outcomes for patients. However, it is unclear how recent advances in treatment have influenced the symptom burden, daily lives, and HRQoL of MM patients undergoing therapy. A prospective study of patients with R/R MM to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary outcomes of DLC and its potential to augment existing standards of care for patient support is underway. An opportunity exists to explore how a digital health coaching platform might be used for symptom assessment, behavioral interventions, and to foster greater patient activation.
This study is feasibility-based and will seek to understand the role of digital therapeutics in improving the care of patients with R/R MM. The preliminary outcomes of this study are: (1) to provide a first-look at the feasibility and acceptability of a DLC intervention in patients with R/R MM undergoing chemotherapy treatment; (2) to examine the relationships between PROs, clinical assessment, and wearable data; and (3) to characterize how patients with R/R MM engage with a digital health coaching platform and the effect of engagement on HRQoL and other supportive care outcomes. By characterizing barriers and enablers to enrollment, feasibility, and patient engagement, and through the inclusion of bi-directional assessments between the patient and participating health advisors, this study will inform future interventional studies designed to engage and support patients with R/R MM as they undergo chemotherapy treatment.

The effect of a 4-week 10-20 g/day WholeFiberTM intervention (a dried vegetable rich in 4 types of prebiotic fiber, including inulin, pectin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose) on fecal calprotectin, IBD-complaints and QoL, serum inflammatory markers, gut microbiota and SCFA-levels, was investigated in patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Secondary endpoints were the response on the intervention with WholeFiberTM, depending on whether the patient had Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Fecal samples were analysed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and SCFA-levels determined in stool samples. In addition, an evaluation questionnaire was administered to assess feasibility and acceptance of the WholeFiberTM intervention in this population. All samples were collected by the UMCG study team before and after a 4-week intervention. It was determined that the intervention resulted in improvements of fecal calprotectin and several aspects of fatigue in patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis. The effect of WholeFiberTM on health-related quality of life was not consistently observed in the two groups of patients. Improvements of stool consistency and stool frequency were not consistently observed either. Changes were observed in the fecal microbiota composition for patients with ulcerative colitis, but not for patients with Crohn's disease. Overall, this pilot study suggests that the daily use of 10-20 g WholeFiberTM for 4 weeks may provide beneficial effects on clinical outcomes, quality of life and the gut microbiota in patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative colitis, although more in-depth studies are warranted."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the surgical efficacy of carpal tunnel release performed with a longitudinal mini incision compared to conventional longitudinal incision. To compare the surgical outcomes regarding; the improvement of symptoms, pain, sensibility, scar effect and recurrence of symptoms postoperatively between both surgical incisions.

Study Population
All selected cases with primary CTS (> 2 years) in Mansoura University hospitals between December 2020 and December 2023; will be submitted to the pre-operational evaluation.
Inclusion criteria:
The main inclusion criteria is patients with primary CTS (> 2 years) attending Mansoura University hospitals, whose diagnosis is EMG-and NCS-proved median neuropathy at the wrist, failed conservative treatment, and absence of any other hand pathology. Additionally, patients with a positive Tinel sign, presence of median nerve entrapment are also included.
Exclusion criteria include presence of proximal radiculopathy, previous history of cervical spondylosis, preoperative presence of inflammatory joint disease and gout, as well as combined nerve compression. Patients with incomplete follow-up data and patients with psychiatric disease are also excluded.

Study Design
This study is designed as an institutional-based, randomized-controlled trial with 2 arms and a cohort size of 104 patients.
Preoperative evaluation will be done for all patients, including; history-taking, visual analogue scale for pain assessment, neurological and neuro-physiological examination, and NCS.
Randomization will be done using a computer-generated table of random numbers, and patients will be assigned to one of the two groups (2-arm trial);
- Active Comparator 1: Mini Incision group
- Active Comparator 2: Conventional group

Intervention/Treatment
The intervention includes two procedures, carpal tunnel release (CTR) mini incision and CTR conventional incision.
In the Mini Incision group, a special metal guide will be used to make a longitudinal mini-incision started just above the proximal flexor wrist crease, then advanced proximally for 1.5 to 2 cm. After blunt dissection, the median nerve will be exposed, with the use of the metal guide, and the transverse carpal ligament will be cut longitudinally using a scissor inserted along the groove in the guide.
In the Conventional group, a longitudinal incision is created between the thenar and hypothenar eminences until reaching the proximal flexor wrist crease.

Postoperative data
All patients will be followed up a a minimum time of 6 months, including out-of-out patient follow-ups. At each follow-up visit, the investigator measures and records; improvement in symptoms, pain, sensibility, scar effect and recurrence of symptoms."

The intervention (AOT+g) is based on the mirror neuron system, which is the same mechanism used to learn new motor skills, through imitation of movements performed by the therapist, and later by patients with CI.
AOT is a training technique based on the concept of neural plasticity of the motor system. AOT is the observation of a specific motor gesture performed by another individual, which promotes neural plasticity by facilitating the imitation of the observed gesture. Neural studies have shown that the observation of an action activates the same regions of the brain that are activated during actual execution of the behavior. Specifically, this technique has been successfully used in children with cerebral palsy and in individuals who have experienced a stroke, with positive results in terms of motor recovery. Furthermore, the technique has proven effective in improving motor skills in healthy adults, in clinical and preclinical populations.
The main objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of AOT as a neurorehabilitation tool in patients with MCI, by comparing the effects in patients who observe an action performed by the therapist, compared with patients who observe an action performed by other patients with the same characteristics, and compared to a control group who do not receive any intervention.
The study is a randomized controlled clinical trial with three groups: an experimental group that will observe an action performed by the therapist, an experimental group that will observe a movement performed by other patients with MCI, and a control group (usual maintenance care).
To determine functional status of the upper limbs, we will use the FMA scale (with items: voluntary movement within synergies, voluntary movement mixing synergies, voluntary movement with little or no synergy, grip, coordination/speed, and passive movement of the joints).
At the beginning of the program, all patients will receive a standardized assessment of the upper limbs carried out by a physical therapist, and the same physical therapist will perform the last assessment at the end of the program. In addition, we will include other assessments specific to the intervention group. Patients in the observation groups will have additional interventions and assessments.
After completing the program, a second assessment in patients with MCI will be made to determine the effectiveness of the AOT."

The use of central venous lines (CVL) has become an essential and routine part of both operative and critical care management. In the context of ultrasound guidance, the use of a real-time, easily accessible, portable and non-expensive device has recently become possible through the development of ultraportable ultrasound equipment. The study has 2 aims:
1. To determine if placing a standard central venous line using ultrasound guidance with a non-portable device may be improved with the use of an ultraportable ultrasound system. 2. To determine whether using an ultraportable ultrasound system in an emergency situation will lead to a quick, accurate and safe placement of an ultraportable ultrasound to replace the standard technique using the conventional ultrasound. The primary objective is time to success expressed by the time between the beginning of the ultrasonographic scan after placement of the sterile protection device and the beginning of fixation of the catheter to the skin after ultrasound verification confirming its correct position. Time to success as assessed by this criteria is measured in seconds. Time to success represents that there is no difference in time to success when using an ultraportable ultrasound device."

Although episiotomy has been accepted as a routine part of obstetric care worldwide, it can cause several maternal morbidities such as wound dehiscence, postpartum hemorrhage, infection, sexual dysfunction, scarring/chronic pain. Er:YAG laser can repair the damaged soft tissues (e.g. muscular layers, blood vessels) and induce tissue remodeling with neocollagenesis and neoangiogenesis. In addition, it can also reduce the pain due to scar tissue and improve the quality of life by restoring the sexual function of the couple. The aim of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic effects of Er:YAG laser on the genital pelvic pain and scar tissue healing of the episiotomy scars in postpartum patients."

Patients with gallstone disease have differences in their gut microbiome and these changes are important in the development of complications, including cholecystitis and acute pancreatitis. The investigators will collect stool from patients with gallstone disease and analyse it for changes in microbiome composition. They will then assess which changes are associated with patient outcomes, such as complications and recovery after cholecystectomy. They hope their research will provide clues to developing new treatments for gallstone disease. The investigators anticipate that the data collection and stool sampling could be completed within 3 years. If you need any further information, please contact the Research and Development office at East Kent Hospitals University NHS Foundation Trust.

Inclusion criteria: All adult patients diagnosed with gallstone disease following confirmation by imaging at an East Kent University Foundation Trust hospital will be eligible to take part in this study. This includes patients awaiting cholecystectomy or those who have not yet been referred for surgery. There are no exclusion criteria.

Samples and data collection: Participants will be given a stool collection kit containing three plastic pots (one inner container within a larger outer container which is then sealed in a second outer container with a clear label showing the patient's name, date and time of sampling). They will be provided with a three-day food diary. Participants who are unable to provide a stool sample at home will be asked to attend the hospital for a stool sample. Stool samples will be collected at the same time points as data is collected from electronic patient records (at least three, see data collection below).
The investigators will explain how the samples will be stored, with the first sample being stored for two years before being removed from the deep freezer, and a sample taken and stored in the laboratory.
Data collection: The patient's routine electronic medical records and imaging results will be reviewed, and information collected from these records. Data collected will include:
- Demographic information such as age and gender
- Risk factors such as Body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol intake, current medication and comorbid conditions
- Pregnant women will also be asked about pregnancy and smoking status during pregnancy
- Cholecystectomy details - type, date and surgical approach; post-operative outcomes - complications, hospital stay, etc. Each time a stool sample is collected, the participant will be asked to fill in the food diary and to complete a small bowel movement questionnaire. They will be reminded of further stool sample collections. The investigators will store each sample in the freezer, before removing the first one after two years. Further samples can then be collected at scheduled time points.
Retrospective data: Data from 2019 will be collected retrospectively according to the same schedule. All data will be maintained as a pseudonymised data set. The information will only be accessible to the research team."

Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) is a common complication in patients with sepsis, with a significant impact on patient mortality and prognosis. Elevated aspartate aminotransferase(AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index (APRI) has been shown to suggest the presence of sepsis-associated organ injury, and the increased APRI levels are associated with poor prognosis of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction. However, it remains unclear whether elevated initial APRI could predict the development or outcome of SALD. Therefore, we sought to evaluate the predictive role of the initial value of APRI for the occurrence of SALD in patients with sepsis.
Elevated initial APRI was a strong predictor, and the level of APRI was continuously increasing in SALD group with time. Elevated initial APRI was also associated with shorter ICU stay, longer hospital stay, and higher 30-day mortality rate in adult patients with sepsis.
In conclusion, elevated initial APRI was associated with the occurrence and outcome of SALD in sepsis patients, which was found to be a clinically useful parameter for early prediction and monitoring of SALD in adult patients."

This is a Phase I randomized, double-blind, comparative study. The study will enroll 10,000 subjects, and the estimated vaccination and clinical observation will take about 6 months. The subjects will be randomly divided into 4 groups: 0-1-month, 0-6-month, 0-2-month, and 1-month, with 2500 cases in each group.

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the immunogenicity, tolerability, and safety of the investigational vaccine in healthy adults aged 18 and older, and to explore the optimal timing of vaccination with Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells). This study will demonstrate the superiority of the omicron variant vaccine and provide reasonable data to support its emergency use in a population at risk of serious outcomes from this virus.

Study Plan and Strategy:
Study type: In a randomized double-blind, active comparative clinical phase I study, a total of 10,000 cases are designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells) vaccination schedule after vaccination with different schedules.
Study Intervention/Design:
1. The 0-1-month immunization program is composed of 2500 cases, who are vaccinated with 2 doses of the investigational vaccine in an interval of 1 month.
2. The 0-6-month immunization program is composed of 2500 cases, who are vaccinated with 2 doses of the investigational vaccine in an interval of 6 months.
3. The 0-2-month immunization program is composed of 2500 cases, who are vaccinated with 3 doses of vaccine (2 primary doses and 1 booster dose).
4. The 1-month immunization program is composed of 2500 cases who are vaccinated with 3 doses of vaccine (2 primary doses of the investigational vaccine and 1 booster dose of the recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells)).

Sample Size Estimation: Considering the expected 95% confidence interval for positive conversion rate (PCR) to be 10% (difference of PCR rate between omicron variant vaccine group and baseline group 10%), and allow a sample size drop of 20%, and using the software PASS15.0, the final sample size of each group is 2500.

Inclusion criteria: The subjects should be healthy adults, aged 18 years and older.

Exclusion criteria:
(1) Subjects with any of the following conditions (known diagnosis, such as laboratory examination, etc.) that may interfere with the understanding of the research results or pose certain risks to their safety are excluded:
Pre-existing autoimmune diseases, including systemic autoimmune diseases, autoimmune endocrine diseases, autoimmune neurological diseases, autoimmune skin diseases, etc.
(2) The subjects should not take immunomodulators or immunosuppressants during the study. However, topical medications such as creams, ointments, eye drops, and nasal sprays are allowed.
(3) Patients with malignant tumors who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, etc. before and after surgery.
(4) Patients who have received monoclonal antibodies ≤ 14 days before vaccination.

The research was planned as an experimental study in order to support the practice of skin-to-skin contact in the delivery room. While analyzing the literature, it was seen that there was very little research on the evaluation of skin-to-skin contact, which is given as a method in some countries and in some hospitals. Studies that have been carried out in this field are mostly qualitative in nature and no studies have been carried out in our country about the evaluation of skin-to-skin contact. The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of skin-to-skin contact on the bond between mother-infant-baby and traumatic birth perception."

The main goal of this study is to compare Visual Analogue Scale(VAS) scores and total opioid consumption between patients who underwent sacral erector spinae plane block and control patients in lumbar disc discectomy surgery. Lumbar disc hernias are most commonly encountered among spinal conditions, and lumbar disc surgery (LDD) is one of the common spinal procedures. While discectomy surgery relieves symptoms and improves the quality of life of patients, it often causes severe post-operative pain, and opioid consumption may cause side effects. There is a consensus in the literature that regional anesthesia techniques may have an important place in the management of postoperative pain. The erector spinae plane block of the sacral erector spine muscle, whose existence was first demonstrated by Forero et al in 2011 as LESB, provides postoperative analgesia in a limited number of studies on abdominal and lumbar surgeries and has become an interesting application in recent years. We aimed to study the effect of an erector spinae plane block performed in patients undergoing lumbar disc discectomy surgery in terms of reducing postoperative pain. Fifty-four ASA 1-3 patients randomized into ESPB (n=27) and control group (n=27) were included. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups in terms of visual analog scale scores and opioid consumption at all times (p>0.05). The results of our study showed that Erector Spinae plane block with bilateral 0.25% bupivacaine did not reduce post-operative pain and opioid consumption in lumbar disc discectomy patients. 13 patients in the group who received the block used it for emergency, we think that these results may be because the patients could not rest in the prone position due to early respiratory efforts after surgery, and the erector spinae muscles were partially stretched at higher levels. In addition, the short-term effect of ESPB on other sensory nerve levels other than the sacral spine may not have provided maximum anesthesia. In a study with similar indications, Ripamontano et al showed that patients with 0.25% ropivacaine had reduced postoperative pain, but not in those with 0.125% bupivacaine. 13 We think that the amount of local anesthetic in this study and the local anesthetic used may have affected the results. It has been shown that ESPB can be performed as a single-shot and continuous block technique. It seems that more studies are needed on the amount of local anesthetic and the use of local anesthetic. Further studies are needed to determine the level of erector spinae muscle that will be most effective in the lumbar region. It seems that the level to be operated on, such as the level of disc herniation, may be the most effective in terms of ESPB success."

Investigators propose to use multimodal ultrasound imaging to develop and validate a practical and inexpensive biomarker for lumbar myofascial pain, which shows sensitivity to change in relation to treatment. Myofascial pain (MP) is a frequent contributing factor to chronic low back pain (cLBP). This study will study 3 sub-groups of subjects, 1) no history of chronic pain over a three-year timeframe, 2) chronic low back pain who are classified as having myofascial pain and no trigger points, and 3) chronic low back pain who are classified as having myofascial pain and active trigger points. The investigators will use deep learning to integrate the measurements and determine if it's able to predict MP. The biomarker will be validated by determining its sensitivity to changes in MP after treatment."

The main aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of emergency structured clinical examination training on the final grade of the emergency department service ECOS, compared with standard learning during the training course. To confirm this, the investigator has chosen three other performance criteria, namely (1) psychological status: state-Trait Anxiety Scale on a scale of 1 to 10, (2) acquisition of medical knowledge: OSCE skills assessment, finally, (3) medical knowledge: OSCEs score. This study, with a randomized control group study, and of an interventional type, will be conducted in a cohort of medical students in a French public hospital.
The inclusion criteria: Students who have completed their last hospital-based internship (ERASMUS) in one of the two emergency departments of CHG, are 18 years of age or older, are medical students, and who have chosen to continue their medical internship in non-ERASMUS emergency departments. Students have the opportunity to participate in this study after signing an information sheet. The exclusion criteria: Refusal to participate, students who return to the emergency department and who have already participated in the study, and non-ERASMUS students. Study methods: Students are divided into two groups, the control group and the intervention group, using sealed and labelled blocks of envelopes. Enrolment by envelope concealment until the end of data collection. In the intervention group, students practice, several times a week, on ECOX training sheets during their hospital-based internship. The control group will practice in the usual way in the department, with an internship tutor and/or specific education, depending on the availability of the latter. These data will be collected by the student during the last 10 weeks of their internship.
The investigators expect: Improved final score on OSCEs in the intervention group compared with the control group, which will be a positive reflection on the integration of the tool. Improved acquisition of knowledge by medical students with the ECOX tool and a potential improvement of the psychological situation of students in the intervention group, which does not have any repercussions on the primary criteria. Improvement in patient care during the end-of-internship service examinations. For this, the investigator must take into account the satisfaction of the students and the hospital staff involved in OSCEs and the teaching of medical knowledge at the end of their internship. The investigator hopes to demonstrate that it is possible to improve the final score of OSCEs by students during their internship, but also in the general student population, during service ECOS in the emergency department."

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) as well as other chronic diseases were becoming more and more common in modern society. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is usually accompanied by various other co-morbidities, such as cardio-vascular disease, connective tissues disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, etc. Chronic disease patients, especially PAH patients with many health problems experience lower quality of life and life expectancy than the normal population. Many studies showed lower activity tolerance, poorer social support, and more symptoms distress, anxiety and depression in PAH patients.
The goal of this project is to develop a web-based health care program, and we want to evaluate the effects of this program on the improvement of PAH patients' social support, active tolerance, symptoms distress, anxiety, depression and quality of life. The investigators have already developed an internet-based home management system that could improve heart failure patients' quality of life. The investigators will modify this program to customize for PAH.
A total of 140 PAH patients will be recruited. There are 4 subgroups, and each group would have different interventions. All groups will have a face-to-face survey at the baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 48 weeks and 60 weeks, and receive the first survey once the patient confirmed as the diagnosis of PAH. This survey will include demographic data, medical history, and quality of life scale. The investigators will use multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) to examine the changes of the PAH symptoms, social support, activity tolerance, and quality of life before and after the intervention."

Background: ALS is a rare neurodegenerative disease with a great variability in clinical progression, disease patterns, and quality of life (QoL) needs. Long term mechanical ventilation support (LTMV) is offered to patients whose ALS-related breathing difficulties is not relieved without mechanical ventilation. There are no consistent data on which factors influences the decision to choose life prolonging treatment with LTMV. However, the quality of life (QoL) and QoL need has become increasingly important. The aim of our study is to describe factors likely to be associated with the QoL of ALS patients and their partners and children.
Furthermore, there are some evidence suggesting that LTMV may be associated with lower QoL in some studies. However, we lack consistent data of the effect of ventilator support on QoL. As a result of high variability in the disease and treatment, we aim to investigate if the decision to accept or reject ventilator supported treatment for ALS influences the QoL of ALS patients and partners and children.
Objectives: To describe factors likely to be associated with the QoL of ALS patients and their partners and children.
To investigate if the decision to accept or reject long term invasive or non-invasive ventilation support in ALS influences QoL of ALS patients and partners and children.
Study design, participants and study arms: In this study, we will investigate factors likely to be associated with the QoL of ALS patients and their partners and children. We will carry out health economics and process evaluation to identify resource use, clinical and health economic outcome measures, cost, and quality of life for both ALS patients and their partners and children. We will perform a longitudinal follow-up study.
We will include both patients who has accepted (Acceptors) and declined life extending treatment (Non-Acceptors) with LTMV. The interventions we consider will be long term mechanical ventilation support.
Primary outcome: To compare general and disease specific quality of life of ALS patients and their partners and children who has accepted or declined long term mechanical ventilation support."

Chronic subdural hematoma (cSDH), also known as subdural hygroma, is an accumulation of blood in a subdural space below the dura mater. Symptoms occur due to the mass effect from the accumulated blood which may lead to neurological deficits related to focal edema and/or mass effect.

Indications for treatment include large chronic subdural hematoma (> 3-5 cm thickness with significant midline shift), symptomatic patients, patients with midline shift 4mm, increased ICP in 24 hours, hydrocephalus, seizure disorder and significant clinical neurologic deficit (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale ≥ 5). Treatment is done under general anesthesia via craniotomy and bur hole evacuation of the hematoma. As part of routine patient monitoring, patients are monitored by electroencephalogram (EEG) intraoperatively for the presence and location of epileptiform activity and then followed for 24 hours in an intensive care unit setting.

There have been several reports in the literature regarding subdural hematomas and the development of epilepsy, particularly focal epilepsy. Electroencephalogram has been the primary modality used to detect and monitor epileptogenic activity in this patient population. This study seeks to examine the relationship of subdural EEG abnormalities to clinical presentation and post surgical neurologic outcomes in patients with large and symptomatic chronic subdural hematoma.

After surgery, patients will have a subdural electrode placed under the craniotomy, crossed from one temporal lobe to the other temporal lobe and overlying the frontal lobes. This electrode will be sampled by continuous video EEG monitoring lasting between 1-5 days. EEG recordings will be obtained at least at 1 hour post-operative and at hourly intervals. All patients and their families will be consented for research.

Inclusion Criteria: Inclusion Criteria:
- chronic/ subacute subdural hematoma deemed necessary for surgical evacuation
- Ability to consent or have LAR consent

Exclusion Criteria:
- emergent need for evacuation
- acute traumatic subdural hematoma
- severe baseline disability (mRS>2) (modified Rankin Scale)

This proposal has specific goals related to monitoring subdural hematoma patients with intraoperative electrocorticography for the presence of epileptiform activity which correlates with anatomic location of post operative complication, a decrease of consciousness/ post operative clinical deterioration, and a decline in patients quality of life. Subdural ECoG monitoring may be used as a tool to monitor this at-risk population, and to improve early detection of post operative complications. By identifying early signs of clinical deterioration and by intervening early, we hope to achieve an outcome reduction and an improved quality of life for these patients.

Background and Rationale:

People with neuromuscular and neurodevelopmental conditions are typically at risk of developing respiratory complications in later life. Treatment with nebulised hypertonic saline (HS) is effective in improving respiratory disease in children and adults with cystic fibrosis (CF). However, its long term safety and benefits in individuals with neuromuscular disease (NMD) or in those with neurodevelopmental conditions such as cerebral palsy (CP) are not known. Therefore, we aim to test the effectiveness and tolerability of a low-dose of HS (6%) as a preventative therapy.

Objective:
The aim is to assess the effect of low dose once daily nebulised hypertonic saline (HS) on the frequency of antibiotic use for respiratory infections over a 52 week period in patients with NMD or CP.

Methods:
The primary outcome will be the number of full courses of antibiotics for respiratory infections (both oral and intravenous). Patients and carers will keep an e-diary recording symptoms and use of antibiotics. A patient is any person with NMD or CP with an indication for HS. The study arms are as follows:
1) HS treatment arm: Nebulised 6% HS once daily.
2) Control arm: Nebulised 0.9% normal saline (NS) once daily

Interventions:
1) HS treatment arm: Nebulised 6% HS once daily.
2) Control arm: Nebulised 0.9% NS once daily

Design:
Open-label, prospective randomised study with 52 week follow-up.

Participants:
Adults and children >5 years old who have NMD or CP.

Inclusion criteria:
Age ≥ 5 years
Diagnosis of NMD or CP
A history of at least one respiratory exacerbation requiring antibiotic treatment with or without the need for hospitalisation in the 12 months prior to recruitment.
If prescribed HS, this will need to be a different dose/ frequency from that being investigated and should be part of an escalation plan.

Exclusion criteria:
Additional diagnosis (e.g. cystic fibrosis), but those with aspiration and/or bronchiectasis secondary to respiratory complications of NMD will be included.
Patients who are already prescribed daily HS in any concentration (i.e., 3%, 5%, 6%, 7%)

Outcome measures:
Primary:
1) Course of antibiotics for respiratory infections measured by the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by the doctor: One full course is the full treatment for one event of respiratory infection, irrespective of the number of days that the course was prescribed for.

Secondary:
1) Lung clearance index measured by multiple breath washout (MBW)- the gold standard lung function test in CF, but not commonly used in NMD or CP.
2) Forced oscillation technique (FOT) - Respiratory resistance (Rrs) (measured in c/L) and respiratory reactance (Xrs). These will be measured by Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) at 12.5 MHz.
3) Lung ultrasound - Global Lung ultrasound score. The global lung ultrasound score (LUS) quantifies lung aeration by translating lung ultrasound patterns into a numerical score across 12 lung regions (six areas on each side of the chest: two ventral regions, two lateral regions, and two posterolateral regions) and summing the results. The aeration pattern observed in each region is scored as: 0: A pattern with ≤2 B lines; 1: >2 separated B lines that cover ≤50% of the pleural line; 2: B lines that cover >50% of the pleural line; or 3: lung consolidation. In theory, the global LUS score can range from 0 (normal aeration in all regions) to 36 (severe abnormal aeration in all regions).
4) Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) - Global inhomogeneity index (quantification of homogeneity of the tidal volume distribution). The image matrix in EIT consists of 32 × 32 pixels. Global inhomogeneity (GI) is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between"

Paraphilic disorders are a group of disorders consisting of sexual deviations, such as sexual preferences to children, sexual acts with non-consenting adults or non-human objects, and so on. They typically manifest as arousal disorder and can create a high risk of sexual assault.

Compulsive sexual behavior disorder (CSBD) is another condition with the potential to create sexual assault, particularly by its association between alcohol and other substance abuse.

Sexsomnia is a rare, yet severe condition characterized by automatic sexual behaviors during sleep, and may cause harm to self or others.

The aim of the present project is to improve our knowledge of the psychosocial determinants of offending behavior and of psychopathology in adults with paraphilic disorders, CSBD and sexsomnia.

The first part of the study is in the form of a diagnostic study.
The second part of the study is a patient registry.
The third part of the study consists of three prospective studies of patients with CSBD or sexsomnia receiving treatment.
The fourth part of the study consists of one prospective, observational study of a sample of randomly selected citizens and controls with regard to paraphilic disorders and CSBD."

Researchers are testing whether a special type of MRI can find changes in the brain resulting from various types and stages of brain tumors. MRI is an imaging test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed pictures of the brain. The investigators want to find out if a special MRI test called activity MRI (aMRI) can distinguish different types of brain tumors from surrounding normal tissues. This study involves patients with brain tumors who are already scheduled to have a different MRI scan using Fluorodeoxyglucose F-18 (¹⁸FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) (different than the MRI aMRI scan). During the study, a gadolinium contrast agent IV will be used for a special MRI scan. A small amount of a radioactive substance will be injected into a vein in the arm.
INCLUSION CRITERIA: Adult patients (greater than 18 years of age) with glioma who require MRI and ¹⁸FDG-PET imaging.

EXCLUSION CRITERIA: Subjects who do not sign an Informed Consent document. Subjects who are pregnant or nursing, not contraception compliant, without a normal menstrual cycle. Subjects without a contraindication and unsuitable venous access for administration of radiotracer through the arm. Subjects with prior hypersensitivity to gadolinium-based contrast media. Subjects who have prior allergic reaction to any component of the ¹⁸F-FDG preparation. Subjects with severe chronic renal disease or currently receiving therapy causing renal dysfunction. Subjects with known or suspected infiltrative or metastatic disease of the bone marrow or any other organ system. Subjects with a prior surgical procedure to the breast, lung or lymphatics. Subjects who have received radiation therapy to the brain within 12 months prior to enrollment. Previous use of anti-inflammatory agents including ibuprofen within one year prior to PET. Subjects with an acute intercurrent illness or medical condition, which has not been controlled on chronic medication by the investigator. Participation in any experimental drug or therapy within 30 days prior to enrollment. Subjects who have any contraindications for receiving gadoterate meglumine.

In 2016, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association HF guidelines were updated to include treatment goals such as prescription of ACEi/ARB or sacubitril/vestatril, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists, beta-blockers, and SGLT2i/inhibitors based on clinical judgment.
The current study is the first to evaluate the effectiveness of multi-pronged, patient-level CDS and embedded clinical pharmacist co-management for improving GDMT in HFrEF patients. Investigators will test the effectiveness of a targeted intervention package on clinicians and clinician perception of GDMT treatment. A focus on the role of clinical pharmacists, education, best practice advisory (BPA) interruptive clinical alerts and patient portals on GDMT, will be evaluated. The study will test whether an alert for patients without GDMT can help physicians identify the appropriate drug therapy for patients with HFrEF. An embedded, patient-level, clinical pharmacist co-management in selected clinics will determine the best approach for optimizing GDMT care.
All eligible enrollments from 5 Geisinger clinics will occur between April 1 and May 31, 2021."

Upper urinary tract stones pose an enormous treatment challenge. Extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is now firmly established as a minimally invasive technique for treatment of urinary stone. Previous study on combination Tamsulosin therapy (alpha-1 blockers) with ESWL for ureteric stone, revealed encouraging improvement in stone clearance. This is a prospective randomized trial to compare success of ureteroscopic stone clearance after single ESWL alone and ESWL combined with Tamsulosin therapy for ureteric stones less than or equal to 15 mm in upper ureter in a university hospital. In patients who failed ESWL alone in a study on stone clearance after single extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy in upper ureteric stones, the outcome after single ESWL is poor and has been reported to be around 30%. Urologists now have 3 choices for management of ureteric stone; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL), ureteroscopy and ureterorenoscopy with Holmium laser lithotripsy. Ureteric stone clearance rates after ESWL for upper urinary tract stones of 0.5-1.8 cm are 33%, 67%, and 80% after one, two and three sessions, respectively. Patients are left with morbidity such as ileus, hematuria and pain. Most patients are treated by 2nd or even 3rd sessions. However, ureteroscopy in upper ureter is considered as gold standard for stone clearance. It is an invasive procedure which gives excellent results, however its morbidity is more. Urologists all over the world tend to combine Urenoscopy with Holmium laser, with ESWL for upper UT stones. Recent trends of management of ureteric stone is to combine alpha 1 blockers with ESWL with reported stone free rates of 80%. ESWL combined with alpha blocker therapy is considered as the future in clearance of ureteric stones. Patients who have stones less than 15 mm, are candidate for Eswl with Tamsulosin therapy, for which there will be a prospective RCT in this Department to compare stone clearance. Null hypothesis: There will be no difference in stone clearance in upper ureteric stone treated with single ESWL (A) and ESWL combined with Tamsulosin therapy (B). Alternative hypothesis: ESWL combined with Tamsulosin therapy will give better stone clearance than ESWL alone in ureteric stones less than or equal to 15 mm.."

Tracheostomy-associated tracheal stenosis (TOTS) is a feared complication after percutaneous tracheostomy. Standard interventions (cyroablation or APC) are no guaranty for success as recannulation and tracheotomy tube exchange are not uncommon. Thus, several interventions have been developed: endoscopic and surgical resection of tracheal tissue, laser, photodynamic therapy and Nd:YAG laser have been tried without long-term, randomized and controlled study results. In this retrospective study, the results of a large group of patients from a single center who underwent one of the above interventions after TOTS will be compared. 
The study aims to compare clinical and technical success (reintervention-free) of several interventions and long-term effects. These include the required number of interventions, the recannulation rate and the rate of longterm tracheotomy-dependence. These data are essential for the decision for the appropriate interventional strategy. 
Patients diagnosed with stenosis after percutaneous tracheostomy during inpatient care at the German Cystic Fibrosis Centre at the Thoracic Clinic Bremen will be evaluated. All patients will be treated with an initial biopsy and cold knife dissection after topical application of lidocaine with Xylocaine®. Depending on the degree of stenosis, resection of tracheal tissue will then be stopped at the stoma, in the middle or the lower part of the trachea. All patients who are cannulated postintervention without stridor and dyspnoea and without the need for tracheal intubation will be regarded as clinically successfully treated. Patients undergoing unplanned interventions and those requiring tracheal intubation or intensive care support will be considered as having failed treatment. The interventions will be judged as successful if the patients have been successfully decannulated after treatment. Those patients who have survived the intervention and required another intervention and recannulation or tracheotomy tube exchange will have failed treatment. If no stenosis is visible and no stridor or dyspnea occurs, no further interventions will be carried out unless the patient is under re-intervention. 
Long-term results related to stenosis after tracheal stenting, tracheostomy tube exchange and decannulation will be collected from the outpatient clinic including results from outpatient laryngo-tracheoscopy. 
The results will be compared by Kaplan-Meier analysis and Chi square statistical analysis to identify the optimal therapeutic strategy. 
The first part would include the comparison of the results of cryotherapy and APC or loop extractions, the second part would focus on patients undergoing laser treatment. 
The first part of the study should help clarify which treatment should be used preferentially in cases with long lesions of the trachea. The second part of the study would investigate whether a single laser treatment is superior to cryotherapy and the type of ablative laser."

The study is an interventional study with a non randomized controlled design to investigate the effect of a psychiatric intervention on HIV / HCV exposure, quality of life, drug use severity and sustainability of improvement in mental health.
A prospective cohort study was performed in three major drugs sites in Hai Phong City from September 2018 to April 2020. The study population included drug-dependent and/or drug-using people living with or at risk of HIV, with or without a psychiatric disorder.
At baseline, 400 HIV (-) and 200 HIV (+), aged above 18 years old, recruited in 2018/19 in the Drive M30 cohort were screened negative for a potential psychiatric disorder at DRIVE M30 visit (Drug, HIV, HIV Infections risk, virological profile, Neuro- Psychiatric disorders, Evaluation: a cohort study) with Quick screening tool (QST), and were free of a major depressive disorder, a psychotic disorder or suicide risk (MINI semi-structured interview). A total of 600 participants will be recruited and followed up for 12 months.
In the intervention group the participants will receive free psychiatric consultation and medication on community-based organization (CBO) sites with full support from CBO members. This psychiatric intervention will be mainly focused to the patients with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder at inclusion (depression, psychosis or suicidal risk), but it will also include people living with HIV with subclinical psychological disturbances of a psychiatrist diagnosis. Patients who did not have psychiatric disorders at inclusion but will receive the psychiatric intervention during the follow-up when diagnosed by a psychiatrist interview will be included in the psychiatric cohort.
Inclusion and control groups will be compared on their baseline characteristics (age, sex, drug and HIV risk behaviour, severity of drug use, psychiatric disorder), HIV/HCV exposure (Viral exposure score, severity of the injection habitus, treatment outcomes (HIV/HCV access to care and virological suppression, drug use severity), quality of life, cost-effectiveness of a community-based psychiatric intervention.
The psychiatric consultation and medication will be implemented on community-based organizations where a majority participants come. This psychiatric intervention may be offered to CBOs that are already implementing DRIVE M30 follow-up and will increase the linkage to care. The psychiatric consultation has been implemented for 400 HIV (-) and 200 HIV (+) and will be given in free during 1 year by a psychiatrist. For the HIV- participants the management of HIV (when confirmed), HCV and drug use will be provided by the same team of CBO on the same location.
Mental health treatment given during the one-year follow-up period will be free to the participants of ANRS 12353/NIDA ROI DA 041978 DRIVE study. All the participants will be linked to care (HIV, methadone, HCV, drug use treatment) at the ANRS 12353/NIDA ROI DA 041978 DRIVE study health facilities including inpatient and outpatient services, and they will receive a full medical evaluation including a psychiatric consultation for the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders and the management of their consequences. Depending on the psychiatric diagnosis participants will receive a psychiatric treatment.
Participants diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder during the follow-up will be proposed the participation in a specialized community-based psychiatric intervention. This intervention is fully integrated with the care of HIV, HCV and drug use. It will be carried out in a community mental health setting where participants could be followed in a non-stigmatized environment and the costs of treatment be lower than in a traditional mental health care settings.
All the participants will be followed up at 12 month. Those who would not be accessible will be traced and receive by phone a telephone questionnaire and a home visit.
The effectiveness of the intervention will be assessed according to the 12 month follow-up data for the study population. Data will be analyzed using the STATA analytical software v.14.3. All data sets (primary and secondary outcome measures) will be analyzed using both intention to treat (ITT), including all participants, and a per-protocol strategy using an effective population of participants who can be evaluated according to the procedures of the clinical protocol. At every time point, we will compare the 2 groups (intervention versus control arm) and the 2 statuses (living with HIV versus not living with"

The object of the present study is to evaluate if the adjuvant use of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with diode laser associated with an endodontic treatment (ET) in patients with apical lesion produces greater disinfection of the canal and improvement of the lesion and success rate. For this, a clinical randomized study will be carried out, controlled, blinded and masked, with 3 parallel groups, in which the patient sample will be randomized in 3 treatment groups. The first is the placebo group, which will receive conventional ET and a simulated treatment with the equipment in which no radiation will be emitted; the second group will receive conventional ET associated with PDT with diode laser, wavelength: 660 nm, fluence 10 s/canal and the third group will receive conventional ET associated with PDT with diode laser at 660 nm, wavelength: 20 s/canal. The photosensitizer used will be methylene blue. Clinical and radiographic examination will be used to obtain baseline values (T0) and values 6 months post-treatment (T1). The presence and size of the apical lesion will be assessed at T0 and T1, the percentage reduction of the lesion will be calculated and the PAI index will be used as a scoring system to evaluate the lesion. The success rate will be assessed for each group 6 months after completion of the treatment. Disinfection of the root canals will be analyzed through the analysis of colony formation (ufc/ml). This study will allow us to know the efficacy of PDT and the effectiveness of the adjuvant use of PDT in apical chronic periodontitis, the type of treatment to be selected between ET and ET+PDT and help to minimize the risk of infectious disease transmission during endodontic procedures."

The investigational use of the Trastuzumab-deruxtecan (T-DXd, ADC-rh7-mcc-HER2) is an intravenous infusion, administered as 5.4 mg per kilogram on every three weeks. Patients, eligible to T-DM1 and who agree to participate in the study, will undergo serial blood samples for liquid biopsy (LB) until progression disease. LB will be performed at baseline and repeated at different time points and/or at progression disease. Based on the results of this study, a diagnostic test for the evaluation of HER2 and (over)expression through liquid biopsy will be developed, with the aim to identify patients with HER2-2D status potentially eligible to receive Trastuzumab Deruxtecan (T-DXd). Patient must have an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. It should be noted that HER2-2D is a liquid biopsy method that is being developed to measure HER2 addition (overexpression + amplification) in blood. It is not approved or available for diagnostic use, and must be considered investigational. This study aims to improve outcome of patients with advanced, metastatic HER2-positive breast cancers who can be exposed to T-DXd by assessing the concordance between radiological RECIST-based evaluation and liquid biopsy results according to HER2-2D status, leading to the choice of appropriate treatment options."

A high number of mental health disorders including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are expected to emerge after natural disasters. After such catastrophic events such as the Earthquakes in Türkiye, the mental health needs of earthquake survivors often exceed available care resources. This study will be designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial, and the potential effectiveness of individual Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) will be tested compared to the Enhanced-Care as Usual (E-CAU) control group. Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) is a cognitive behavioral treatment for PTSD consisting of 12 one-hour sessions. Randomized clinical trials have revealed that CPT is an effective treatment for PTSD and other comorbid conditions in a variety of civilian trauma populations. The study will be conducted in container cities where earthquake survivors from earthquake-affected areas have been relocated. After the baseline assessment, 30 eligible participants will be randomized to two arms: in either the CPT (n =15) or only the control group (E-CAU; n=15). The first session will take place no longer than one week after the pre-intervention assessment. The post-intervention assessment through the same measures will be scheduled six weeks after the pre-intervention assessment (i.e., one week after the 12th CPT session). The follow-up assessment will be conducted one month after the post-assessment. All study participants, including dropouts, will be invited to all outcome assessments. The primary outcome is post-traumatic stress disorder, and the following are the secondary clinical outcomes: symptoms of depression, anxiety, and well-being."

In 2017, Holt, Dehlendorf, and Langer created a framework for contraceptive counseling quality grounded in quality of care and human rights principles and research in healthcare communication. Based on this framework, Holt et al. developed and validated the Quality of Contraceptive Counseling (QCC) Scale, which covers three interrelated aspects of counseling quality: information exchange, interpersonal relationship, and disrespect and abuse . The scale comprehensively measures aspects of the counseling process related not only to information receipt but also individuals' experiences having the opportunity to participate in the method selection process and the degree to which they had positive and trusting experiences with the provider . Associations between quality of contraceptive counseling and characteristics of clients, such as age, education, and reproductive status, could represent significant health disparities and indicate the need for research.

The study will investigate the level of perceived quality of family planning counseling in primary healthcare settings and its determinants among 423 women at reproductive age in El-Dakhla District, New Valley governorate.

Data will be collected through a semi-structured interview administered questionnaire including: Socio-demographic characteristics of women Family planning practice 3-Facility factors such as gender of providers, qualification of providers, type of the health facility. 4-Quality of contraceptive counseling (QCC) scale: it is a 22-item scale which measures the quality of care received by women during family planning visits. It includes : 1) information exchange, 2) interpersonal relations, and 3) disrespect and abuse in contraceptive counseling. The information exchange subscale consists of ten items, the interpersonal relationship subscale consists of seven items, and the disrespect and abuse subscale consists of five items.
The study will use different statistical tests to detect the factors that affect quality of family planning counseling in different domains, and then the findings will be shared with the stakeholders to facilitate policy and practice change. The study results will be beneficial for the policy-maker in the Family Planning department of New Valley Governorate, public health institutes, NGOs, and healthcare providers themselves."

The St. Joseph Children's Program (SJC) is a comprehensive early intervention home visitation program designed for first-time mothers and their infant children during the pregnancy/first year years. A core component of the program is parent-child dyadic interaction. The Home Visitors deliver the content of the program curriculum using a parent-child dyadic interaction approach. The SJC intervention targets the following domains including a healthy pregnancy and life-course health-related behaviors and physical activity, social-emotional health, academic success, and family stability and financial stability. These programs have the potential to improve school readiness, academic attainment, family economic self-sufficiency, social-emotional and behavioral health in the first five years of life and may reduce the risk for adverse short and long-term outcomes (e.g., juvenile delinquency, poor academic achievement, poor health status, etc.). The purpose of this randomized controlled trial is to determine the effectiveness of the SJC intervention. A convenience sample will be provided by Catholic Health Initiatives (CHI). A randomized controlled design was used to assign 325 eligible SJC participants (who meet at least five of the seven characteristics) into two groups; intervention and wait-list control. Participants were followed during their children's first, second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years of life. Intervention sessions were held monthly for two years and then followed up with annual sessions for four additional years. Annual assessments were gathered yearly. The primary outcome was the improvement in parenting skills, child outcomes (e.g., socio-emotional, behavioral, academic, health-related) and reduction in family stress factors, such as maltreatment and delinquency. Secondary outcomes included reduced stress, improved physical activity and increased family economic self-sufficiency."

Background: Malaria remains one of the top infectious killers worldwide, and the development of a safe and effective malaria vaccine is considered a public health priority. One vaccine candidate is a RH5.1 recombinant malaria protein designed for use with the adjuvant AS01B (Matrix-M) to elicit protective immune responses against the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum.
Hypothesis: This study will evaluate the safety of the vaccine candidate (Matrix-M with RH5.1) when administered as either a delayed or fractional regimen. In this study the investigators will administer higher doses of the vaccine than in previous studies to explore the dose-response relationship in relation to vaccine safety and immunogenicity.
Study Objectives: To assess the safety of RH5.1 soluble protein in Matrix-M in healthy adult volunteers by 1) assessing the occurrence of local and systemic reactogenicity following each vaccination, 2) assessing the occurrence of unsolicited adverse events following each vaccination, 3) comparing safety laboratory measures following each vaccination, 4) assessing the occurrence of serious adverse events during the whole study duration.
To assess the humoral immunogenicity of RH5.1 soluble protein with Matrix-M.
To compare the anti-RH5 serum IgG functional immunogenicity between the two groups receiving soluble RH5.1 at different doses.
To compare differences in the innate immune responses between the first and third vaccinations and correlation to adverse event data and adaptive immune responses.
Design: The study will be a randomised, parallel group and multi-centre study. 24 healthy volunteers (12 males and 12 females) will be recruited at each of two sites in the UK to receive 12 vaccinations in total, 4 vaccinations of different doses of 10 or 50 µg of RH5.1 delivered by intramuscular (IM) injection. At each study visit 2 vaccinations will be given on separate days. There will be two treatment groups: Group 1 (delayed regimen): 12 vaccinations given on days 0, 28 and 182 (10 µg or 50 µg RH5.1, 50 µg Matrix-M on days 0 and 28 and 10 µg RH5.1 with 50 µg Matrix-M on day 182). Group 2 (delayed fractional regimen): 12 vaccinations given on days 0, 28 and 182 (2 x 50 µg of RH5.1- Matrix-M on days 0 and 28).
Participants will be followed for 341 days post vaccination in total for each cohort to assess safety and reactogenicity.
Participants will be followed up at specified time points to measure safety laboratory measures, adverse events, reactogenicity and efficacy over 18 months."

The study focuses on multiple system atrophy (MSA), a rare adult-onset neurodegenerative disease with an average life expectancy of 7.9 years. It often results from an autosomal recessive mutation affecting the DNA coding for the alpha-synuclein protein, a protein with a complex role in the nervous system. There is no cure to MSA to date, and symptoms are currently treated with medication, which often results in intestinal malabsorption and gait and balance impairment, among many other non-motor and motor symptoms. The severity of gait impairment often results in falls and, with the progression of the disease, individuals may have problems with swallowing, speaking, writing, walking and handling of hygiene tasks. The overall mortality is high, with sudden death as a consequence of heart failure or autonomic dysfunction. In the latter case, sudden death may occur as a result of aspiration pneumonia secondary to the development of unintelligible speech, a common late-stage symptom of MSA.
In Germany, patients with MSA receive their neurological care at the neurology clinic of the Tirol Kliniken, an academic hospital which acts as a national MSA reference center within the German National Parkinsonism Disease Registry (PPPDR). The overall annual workload related to the out-patient care of people with MSA at the Neurological clinic of the Tirol Kliniken is, despite the rarity of the disease, higher than that of any other neurodegenerative parkinsonism-related disease. In practice, this means that people with MSA have difficulties gaining access to healthcare, a situation with significant emotional and psychological burden on informal caregivers (family members, partners, friends) and with severe socioeconomic impact. The overall quality of care within the national and international MSA community is currently hampered by the lack of evidence-based, structured symptomatic treatment, especially in Germany.
While there are numerous national and international clinical guidelines for the treatment of people with Parkinsonism, there are currently no specific guidelines for the management of MSA. Furthermore, the lack of structured care protocols and clinical training programs has already prevented the standardization of care for people with Parkinsonism, which resulted in significant variations in clinical decision-making and in the treatment and care of people with Parkinsonism and their caregivers in Germany and beyond. Such inter-regional variability in the availability and quality of care and rehabilitation, along with delays from the time of diagnosis to first comprehensive interdisciplinary treatment, may account for the poor prognosis of MSA compared to Parkinsonism, which is associated with a significant reduction in the patients' quality of life and an increase in healthcare-related expenses. This study will provide high-quality clinical recommendations for symptomatic treatment and rehabilitation to people with MSA, which will benefit not only the patients but also the healthcare professionals and caregivers involved in their care.
Objectives: 
Primary objectives of this study are: 
• To evaluate the feasibility of implementing a multidisciplinary, personalized symptomatic treatment model based on the Medical Model of Care Recommendations for People With Parkinsonism (MaCRoP) Guidelines and, if needed, adapted to the local healthcare provisions, legal and psychological framework, as well as local patient needs and preferences. The model includes neurological, psychological and neuro-rehabilitation care delivered on an out-patient basis via mobile palliative care, neurological and neuro-rehabilitation telemedicine strategies, in case individuals with MSA are bedridden or wheelchair-bound, as well as personalized neuro-rehabilitation programs based on the individualized healthcare preferences of the participants. 
• To define and implement outcome measures for future randomized controlled MSA-clinical trials. 

Second objectives of this study are: 
• To assess the efficacy of the multidisciplinary, personalized treatment protocol in improving the quality of life of patients with MSA and their caregivers. 
• To assess the impact of the multidisciplinary, personalized treatment protocol on the number and severity of medical complications and healthcare-related costs in patients with MSA and their caregivers. 
• To provide high-quality treatment and care for people with MSA in Germany, which may benefit not only the patients and caregivers, but also the healthcare professionals involved in their care."

The proposed study, will recruit 200 patients with ISS that is diagnosed by the treating physician with the following characteristics: they have had a minimum of one year of GH-therapy, have been prepubertal at start of and throughout the first year of GH therapy and have responded (or not) to GH treatment at least 1.0 standard deviation(SD) and have had no prior exposure to growth promoting therapy. Children will be recruited from the Department for Paediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Klinikum Melchior, Children's Hospital Zurich and the Royal Women's Hospital Melbourne, Australia.
Blood samples will be collected from individuals of all ages at the study start and a detailed medical and family history will be recorded. Research will take place at the hospital.
In each patient, blood samples will be collected to identify genetic variants in candidate genes using genome-wide association studies. DNA of affected individuals will be analyzed for genetic variations in genes associated with growth. Samples will be stored in a local biobank.
This study will provide important information regarding the genetic determinants of height response to GH replacement therapy for children with ISS. This information will facilitate personalized approaches for patients with ISS based on the response to GH treatment."

The purpose of this study is to assess if hourly neurochecks impact sleep parameters in critically ill adults following aneurysm clipping. A randomized controlled clinical trial will be used.
Critically ill patients requiring post-operative intensive care unit admission after aneurysm clipping may be included. Cerebral aneurysm clipping is a surgical procedure for an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage resulting from rupturing or ""leaking"" of an intracranial aneurysm.
The primary hypothesis of this research is that patients who receive neurochecks every-other-hour will have better sleep quality, as measured by sleep efficiency, less wakefulness, less disruption of slow wave and REM, and higher REM and slow wave percentages.
The primary outcome of this research is the assessment of sleep parameters via standardized polysomnography monitoring following randomization of neurochecks to those performed every hour versus every other hour. Polysomnography measurement at the bedside will take place in a research quality sleep study room within 24-hours post-ICU enrollment.
The secondary outcome of this study is the assessment of sleep quality via the patient's recollection of their sleep experience. This will be obtained using a validated sleep questionnaire (Richards Campbell Sleep Questionnaire) within the 24-hour post ICU awakening window.
A one-group assignment for neurocheck frequency allows the evaluation of both the every hour and every other hour groups to the same group of patients."

Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor of amputations worldwide. Diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFO) is an important cause of amputations. Management of DFO requires appropriate antimicrobial treatment according to the causative microorganisms. However, medical therapy of osteomyelitis depends on an invasive and uncomfortable technique called bone biopsy which might be done surgically or radiologically. In order to overcome these barriers, clinicians have designed a bedside blind bone biopsy procedure that could be performed by the physician at the bedside in a simple manner. The bedside technique is cheaper, safer and seems to be as efficient as the conventional techniques. For these reasons, we propose to compare outcomes and costs between the use of this bedside bone biopsy and the conventional methods.
The primary objective of the study is to estimate the difference in remission of DFO between the 2 groups of biopsy at 12 months. Remission is defined as the epithelization of the ulcer with absence of infection or pain and no loss of limb function. The second objective of this study is to estimate the costs associated with each procedure and to describe the quality of life of patients with diabetic foot using quality of life scores."

Head and neck tumors are the sixth most common cancer and about 90% are squamous cell epidermal tumors, arising from mucosal surfaces of the oral cavity, oropharynx and larynx. Excessive consumption of alcohol and tobacco is associated with cancer risk and has a poor prognosis. However, HPV+ tumors are becoming increasingly more frequent and are often treated equally to HPV- tumors. This study aims to analyze the molecular profile (genes) of HPV+ and HPV- tumors and their respective sensitivity to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Genetic profiles will be compared and if applicable, treatments adjusted accordingly.

Inclusion criteria: Patient with oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma or the oral cavity histologically proven, Primary tumor for which a biopsy or excision is required available and sufficient to carry out molecular analysis.

Exclusion criteria: Patient with Head and Neck cancer other than oropharyngeal or oral cavity squamous cells carcinomas.

|Device: UBaND platform|Mothers are given a smart phone to answer a survey and to provide their contact information. Mothers are invited to answer surveys at specific intervals (typically bi-annually) up to 1 year. Surveys are based on a smart phone app developed for this study. One survey after birth, a survey at one month post-partum, and others after that (at 3, 6, and 12 months). If the mother agrees to participate, she is given the smart phone along-side a rechargeable power bank to provide the phone with power. The phone contains the study app, which is used to collect information from the mother. The app has been developed to ensure that surveys are answered in a step wise fashion. At the start of the survey, there are one or two questions which have to be answered in order to unlock the next set of questions. The app requires a mother to provide contact information. This contact information is used to send a link to a survey. Once the previous survey has been completed and submitted (via the app) a new survey link appears. If a mother fails to answer the survey within 5 days of the survey link being sent (up to five times), she is considered to have dropped out of the study. The app is in English and Swahili, and each survey is presented in the language preferred by the mother. The survey questions are standard questions about maternal and child health, collected through smart phones throughout the world. The mother's personal information is stored in the phone (name, home address, contact information). Mothers are not identified by anything other than a survey unique identifier, and the study team has no ability to see a mother's identity, as this information is encrypted and stored in the phone.|

Although alveolar bone loss following tooth extraction occurs in both the gingival and the interproximal regions, the interproximal bone loss is a significant concern. There are three ways of preserving the alveolar ridge after the extraction of multi-rooted teeth: 1) implant placement without flap elevation; 2) coverage of the tooth extraction socket with a blood clot; 3) coverage with various soft tissue flaps and grafts. The aim of this study is to compare the effect of alveolar ridge preservation based on connective tissue grafting and using a freeze/thaw bone particle allograft combined with an acellular collagen membrane with the alvografted with membrane and collagen membrane only for interproximal bone loss. A secondary aim of the study is to characterize the alterations after alveolar ridge preservation procedure and after implant placement in the same ridge."

Background: The laparoscopic colorectal surgery can reduce the trauma of operation compared with traditional open abdominal approach, but some complications still occur. Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) are common, which lead to increased morbidity, mortality , length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption. The present study aims to investigate effect of prone position training in patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery.
Methods: This is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial guided by the standards of good clinical practice. All eligible participants are divided into two groups: group PPT and group C, and primary outcome the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.
Objective: 1) Assess the reduction in the incidence of PPCs after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery performed in the prone position group compared with the control group; 2) Evaluate the effect of intraoperative prone position on arterial blood gases and the requirement of postoperative ventilator support; 3) Investigate the influence of intra-operative prone position on intensive care length, postoperative mechanical ventilator requirement; 4) Observe the complication of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery.

Patients and Methods: The present study is a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial conducted in the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University from October 2018 to April 2019. Two group of patients were allocated into the study. All patients were divided into two groups: group PPT and group C. Patients in the intervention group (PPT group) received the prone position training (PPT) daily in the hospital, three times a day, and about 1 hours every times, for at least 3 days before surgery. Patients in the control group (C group) received standard perioperative care without any prone position training. The primary goal of the PPCs was the main measure in this study. It included pulmonary infection, atelectasis, pleural effusion, bronchospasm, respiratory failure, and unplanned intubations within 7 days after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were the arterial partial pressure of oxygen, oxygenation index, extubation time, peak airway pressure, and arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide.

This study focuses on the effect of AGE SELF CARE, a novel group-based program tailored to the social and physical needs of community-dwelling older adults. The investigators will evaluate preliminary evidence of the feasibility, acceptability, participation rates, and impact of this novel approach to healthy aging. The long-term goal of this project is to improve the quality of life in older adults aging with frailty and enhance efforts to move aging individuals toward the robust end of the aging spectrum. This project will increase understanding of the ways in which group-based, lifestyle-focused interventions may improve quality of life and functional independence in older adults with frailty. The investigators will utilize a novel 8-week multi-disciplinary group visit program targeted to those individuals pre-frail and living in their communities. The program will be evaluated using a self-report survey, quantitative frailty measures with objective measurements, and qualitative interviews with participants. This project addresses the need to implement, monitor, and adapt lifestyle interventions that can improve the quality of life and functional independence of older adults affected by frailty. In addition, the program will generate evidence critical for the effectiveness of the future implementation of community-wide programs for older adults. If effective this program will support healthy aging by empowering individuals to take a proactive role in leading active, engaged, and healthy lives.
By conducting a pilot study, we will be able to build a strong foundation for future trials. The proposed study will lay the groundwork for a larger randomized clinical trial (RCT) to further build momentum for this community-based behavioral intervention for healthy aging in older adults with frailty.
Eighty-five percent of the adult population over 65 in the United States lives in their homes. Individuals with frailty-the stage between robust and very old-have a higher risk of dying, functional decline, hospitalization, and institutionalization. Frailty occurs across the age spectrum, beginning as early as age 45 and progressing with age.
The goal of this program is to promote healthy behaviors of older adults to build resilience to the social and physical risk factors associated with aging.
Aims: The long-term goal of this project is to create an optimally formulated, high impact community-based group visit program tailored to the needs of older adults as they age with frailty. The investigators will conduct a pilot trial (n=12) of the Adaptation, Growth and Engagement; Socialization, Empowerment, Learning, and Function; and Community Activation for Resilience in Elderhood (AGE SELF CARE) group visit program for pre-frail older adults living in their communities. The investigators will recruit pre-frail adults aged 65 and older who reside in the community to participate in AGE SELF CARE. The following specific aims will be addressed to lay the groundwork for a future, larger multi-center randomized clinical trial (RCT).
                - Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a one-year multi-disciplinary group visit program for pre-frail older adults to inform future interventions for this population.
                - Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of AGE SELF CARE on self-efficacy, health behaviors, depressive symptoms, anxiety, sleep, physical function, and social connectedness by using a self-report survey and objective quantitative frailty measures with pre- and post-program assessments.

The majority of patients that are admitted to the hospital are older (>70 years), and some of them have been, or are being, admitted to Intensive Care Units. Many patients stay on the ICU/hospital for weeks. To get back to the highest state of functional independence, these patients will need specialised care and treatment, therefore Geriatric Rehabilitation (GR) will be very likely required. We know from the first lessons from Italy, that the rehabilitation process is difficult, and the course is capricious. Before being able to assure the best outcomes for older post-COVID geriatric rehabilitation patients, we will have to be informed about the specific clinical characteristics, treatment modalities, and outcomes of these patients. Therefore, we decided to conduct this study into usual care data on the course of functional and clinical outcomes in post-COVID-19 geriatric rehabilitation patients, in several large European countries."

Neck pain and associated problems are prevalent among cervical spondylotic patients, and it is the most common complaint made by patients with chronic neck pain. Different interventions have been tested for the treatment of neck pain in general and for cervical spondylosis in particular. Although the evidence is limited, physical therapy interventions appear to be beneficial for such pain. However, there is a need for high quality evidence using specific intervention protocols.
The upper fibers of trapezius muscle is considered to be a common cause of pain and disability of patients with cervical spondylosis. Stretching the upper fibers of the trapezius muscle has been suggested to improve cervical spine and shoulder range of motion, reduce pain, and improve function in patients with cervical spondylosis. However, there is very little evidence to support or refute the efficacy of this treatment. This study aims to compare the effects of trapezius upper fibers stretching with a control group, with respect to neck pain, cervical range of motion, neck disability, cervical kyphotic angle and cervical dorsal extension flexion angles between groups.
Fourteen patients will be randomly allocated to one of the two groups: intervention group (trapezius upper fibers stretching) or control group (control stretching).
Patients will attend to a rehabilitation center for 3 months for daily therapy with trapezius upper fibers stretching or control stretching. The intervention group will perform trapezius upper fibers stretching exercises three times daily, while the control group will perform control exercises three times daily. Each session will take approximately 30 minutes. The study therapist will closely monitor the exercises and assist the patients if necessary.
This study is designed to evaluate the effects of upper fibers of trapezius stretching on neck pain, cervical range of motion, disability and cervical mobility in patients with cervical spondylosis. We will also assess the feasibility of applying trapezius upper fibers stretching exercises in patients with cervical spondylosis."

Deep thermotherapy (heat applied to the skin in the form of radiofrequency, diathermy or electromagnetic devices that generate currents at high frequencies) has been traditionally used in rehabilitation for the treatment of muscle, bone, ligament and tendon injuries.
Recently, the increase of temperature has been observed in deep tissues during the passage of electrical currents. Based on this, Cret Therapy (Deep Tissue Capacitive Resistive Electrical Transfer, Tecar) is a new technology derived from the traditional use of superficial thermometry.
The aim of this study is to characterize a non-invasive therapeutic device based on the application of radiofrequency (TECARTHERAPY). The purpose is to assess the effects of this type of therapy on sportsmen, specifically on functional variables such as 30-meter sprint, maximal isometric contraction and jumps, in relation to their training load in a 1-month follow-up. It also aims to determine whether the effectiveness of this therapy is due to the increase in muscle temperature, increased blood flow, or increased cell proliferation."

In France, about 10 to 15% of couples wishing to procreate are affected by primary or secondary sterility, which most often leads them to resort to Assisted Reproductive Techniques (ART) including in vitro fertilization (IVF). Endometriosis appears as a major factor of infertility in women. Estimates show that about 20% of women who consult for infertility are affected by endometriosis, and that almost half of women suffering from endometriosis are infertile.
The pathophysiology of endometriosis involves the appearance of cells of endometrial origin (endogenous endometriosis) outside the uterus. When these cells penetrate through the peritoneal lining, they colonize the peritoneal walls, the surface of the ovaries and the internal surface of the uterus causing peritoneal adhesions and the appearance of cysts. Endometriosis often compromises ovarian function by inducing subclinical or silent inflammation. This inflammation and oxidation can compromise the oocyte quality and its competence to be fertilized and then develop in vitro.
It is important to underline the poor prognosis of women suffering from endometriosis but wishing to procreate: the rate of pregnancy is 10% lower in women with endometriosis in comparison to women without endometriosis with ART and the rate of live-birth is only 20% lower.
The main goal of this study is to investigate the link between endometriosis and cell free DNA (cfDNA) quantification in blood and follicular fluids.
Thus, the hypothesis of our study is that patients with endometriosis have a higher level of cfDNA quantification in their follicular fluids before IVF stimulation in comparison to other infertility causes. The level of cfDNA quantification in blood may be related to the number of oocytes retrieved, the fragmentation rate of these oocytes, the blastulation rate of embryos, and the number of clinical pregnancy before IVF stimulation."

Methodology: Design: Randomized clinical trial (RCT). Subjects' criteria: Fifty adult sickle cell disease patients who are aged more than 18 years with different socio-economic and educational levels. Patients with sickle cell anemia will be distributed into two groups. All personal data will be collected. Group-1: Twenty-five adult patents with SCD will receive a designed exercise program of physical therapy for relief pain and improve sleeping quality (experimental group). The designed exercise program will be distributed on everyone. The recommendations will be to train from 30 to 45 minutes, 3 days per week for 6 weeks in addition to walking daily 30 minutes on the ground surface. Group-2: Twenty-five adult patients with SCD will participate as a control group they will not receive exercise program. Assessment instruments: Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: The (PSQI) is a 19-item instrument created to measure different aspects of sleep quality and sleep disturbance (Buysse, Reynolds, Monk, Berman, & Kupfer, 1989). The scale reports quality of sleeping over the past month. The PSQI is divided into 7 subscale scores: subjective sleep quality; sleep latency (time of full sleep); duration; habitual sleep efficiency (proportion between total sleep time and time in bed); sleep disturbances (waking up during the night); use of medication to sleep; and daytime dysfunction (difficulty staying awake during daytime). The overall score ranges between 0 and 21, and a total score of more than 5 indicates poor sleep quality(Al Maqbali et al., 2020). WHOQOL-BREF: The World Health Organization (WHO) identified Quality of Life (QoL) as an individual's perception of his or her position in life, within the context of the culture and value systems in which they live, and in regard to his or her goals, expectations, standards and concerns . QoL is consist of multiple aspects, including psychological health, physical well-being, social relationships, and environmental conditions. Although health professionals are trained on attending to these aspects during studies, own QoL might decline during the years in medical schools(Bani-Issa, 2011). Visual Analog Scale: VAS: It is a safe, valid, and reliable measurement instrument used to evaluate pain severity. It was designed by Huskisson to quantify values that could not be measured in numbers. The most important advantage of the test is the lack of a language barrier and simplicity of application. The definition of the parameter to be assessed is written at the two ends of a 10 cm line, and the patient marks on the line the point that they feel represents their perception of their current state. The VAS score is determined by measuring in millimeters from the left hand end of the line to the point that the patient marks (Kazak and Ozkaraman, 2021, Crichton, 2001). Randomization type is blocking randomization. It will be taken by the main researcher using a random number generator by computer program software http://mahmoodsaghaei.tripod.com/Softwares/randalloc.html#Generate.

There is currently no way to prevent dementia. This study is a two-arm randomized pragmatic (non-blinded) trial to assess the effectiveness and usability of V-CST (tele-CST). We will offer all participants with the opportunity to participate in tele-CST.

The primary goal is to compare the outcomes between those who attend V-CST and those who do not. These outcomes will include cognitive decline (i.e. clinically meaningful cognitive decline, and clinically meaningful cognitive improvement), referral acceptance, attendance, and attrition of participants' at V-CST sessions. We will assess these outcomes at 6 months after baseline.

The secondary goal is to assess how tele-CST is perceived by the participants. A participant survey will explore the following topics: their experience with the treatment process, the technology used to conduct the tele-CST sessions, the content of the classes, and impact of COVID-19 on their ability to participate."

GERD is one of the most common gastroenterological disorders with a reported prevalence of 10% to 20% percent in Europe and the USA and less than 5% in Asia. GERD manifestas heartburn, regurgitation, retrosternal pain, cough, and in some cases dysphagia and holds the possible complication of a Barrett´s esophagus. Anxiety and depression have been reported to be independent risk factors for GERD and are associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and women are more likely to have these symptoms. Furthermore, the higher somatic symptom load is known to increase anxiety related to health issues, psychological distress and health care utilization. The modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms has been discussed as visceral hypersensitivity. Patients with GERD have a higher incidence of anxiety, depression and sleep disturbances than those without GERD, and GERD is considered to be an independent source of stress. The aim of the study was to assess anxiety and depression levels of patients with physiological as well as with pathological DeMeester scores. Furthermore, the modulation of anxiety on the severity of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia is examined. In evaluating the HADS scores were grouped into subscales of HADS-A and HADS-D of =8 and >8 as anxious and those on the subscale of HADS-D of 8 and over 8 as depressed. It is differentiated between mildly (HADS score on the subscale 8-10), moderately (HADS 11 - 14) and severely (HADS 15 - 21) anxious or depressed. The DMS was differentiated between negative (physiological) (< 14.72) and positive (pathological) (> 14.72). The positive scores were differentiated into mild (14.72 - 30), moderate (30 - 80) and severe (<80). The HADS score, GERD questionnaire and DMS scores showed significant differences between the group with NERD and the group with ERD in age, anxiety and depression. The DMS scores in the subgroup of patients with severe depression and anxiety showed the highest DMS scores. In both subgroups of patients with severe anxiety or severe depression there were significantly higher DMS scores and more pathological DMS scores than in patients with negative DMS scores or in those with mild anxiety or depression. Severity of the DMS is significantly associated with anxiety and depression. In conclusion, there are interdependencies between GERD, anxiety and depression. Anxiety and depression increases the severity of reflux symptoms and higher levels of anxiety and depression are associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Higher levels of anxiety and depression intensify the sensation of reflux symptoms such as fullness, heartburn and dysphagia. Furthermore, anxiety and depression show an interaction with the severity of reflux symptoms.

Background: 
The adenoma detection rate (ADR) is a validated screening criterion that is used to evaluate the quality of colonoscopy examinations. Routine colonoscopy using chromoendoscopy and cap-guided colonoscopy has demonstrated a superior ADR compared with standard colonoscopy (33.6%vs. 15.5%, respectively). However, these methods are expensive. The implementation of a new system based on artificial intelligence (AI) could be valuable for a better ADR.
Lynch syndrome is a genetic syndrome where mutated genes increase the risk of developing colon cancer due to the accumulation of somatic mutations. People with Lynch syndrome have an 80% risk of developing colon cancer during their lifetime, most commonly a proximal neoplasm. Accordingly, the American society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) guidelines recommend colonoscopy screening for Lynch syndrome from 25 to 35 years. The diagnostic method for Lynch syndrome is currently based on blood relatives or mutational analysis of MLH1 or MSH2 genes. However patients at risk may have a mutation of one of the other gene involved in the mismatch repair and for that reason it has been proposed to change the guidelines to include a screening colonoscopy at age 20-30 years by using new detection methods for colorectal polyps. 
In case of Lynch syndrome, the adenoma detection rate (ADR) using 0.1% or 0.4% indigo carmine is around 45%. However, with the implementation of 0.4% indigo carmine, the cost of the screening colonoscopy would be more important. As a matter of fact, each examination would required at least three doses and the cost would be at least 50% higher. Moreover, 0.4% indigo carmine may not be available in certain regions of the world and patients may not agree to its application. Thus, using artificial intelligence might be a more cost-effective approach to improve adenoma detection rates
Study design: 
The CAD EYE system is a fully automated computer-assisted recognition of polyp and cancer that uses deep learning to analyze the 2D colonic image and detect the presence of abnormal lesions. In this study, the investigator wish to evaluate the performance of CAD EYE for a better adenoma detection rate in Lynch syndrome. The aim is a prospective randomized controlled study (Phase 4), consisting of an evaluation of the CAD EYE system in patients diagnosed with Lynch syndrome undergoing screening colonoscopy with white light and CE (0.4%). CAD EYE system will be switched on for the Lynch syndrome's patients in the study arm. The investigator also want to compare the detection rates of typical and atypical serrated lesions in each group. For that purpose, the investigator will collect a subsample of polyps (10%of the total polyps resected) that will be analyzed according to the Villanueva classification. The investigator also want to perform a retrospective pilot analysis of the reect and discard strategy for polyps with low risk of malignancy, using CAD EYE prediction and endoscopist's prediction. 
The investigator hope that this study will provide the following evidence: 
to evaluate the effectiveness of the CAD EYE system in screening for neoplastic lesions in Lynch syndrome, in terms of sensitivity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value for the characterization (adenoma/hyperplastic) of colonic polyps and rate of resect and discard strategy, and compare it with the indigo carmin chromoendoscopy, the reference technique for the detection of neoplastic lesions in patients with Lynch syndrome."

Use of contrast-based protocols to assist in the management of pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO) remains poorly defined. We hypothesize that the use of water-soluble contrast protocols will reduce the need for operative intervention in this population.
At the start of the study, only 4 of 9 sites included had a contrast protocol for ASBO. During the course of the study, contrast protocols were developed and implemented at all sites. Study inclusion criteria were children 1-20 years diagnosed with ASBO on admission to the hospital by an attending pediatric surgeon and who underwent a trial of non-operative management. Exclusion criteria included peritonitis, suspicion of incarcerated or internal hernia, active intra-abdominal malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, <4 weeks since the most recent abdominal operation, pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, or known contrast allergy. If the attending surgeon made the decision to take a child directly to the operating room (OR) with no attempt at NOM, these children were excluded. Children under one year of age were excluded as the rate of successful NOM is lower in this age group.
The use of contrast agents is widely varied, no standardization exists regarding the use of contrast agents, protocols for administration, or timing of radiographs. Diatrizoate meglumine, with an osmolality of 1940mOsm/kg, was used preferentially at eight sites and ioversol (702mOsm/kg) at one site. Patients received 30-200ml (based on age or weight) of enteral contrast followed by X-rays at 8-12 hrs and 24 hrs after contrast administration. The investigators measured the need for laparotomy and overall success of non-operative management.
Logistic regression will be used to assess the association between need for operation and contrast. Subsequently, a subset analysis will be performed among patients who received enteral contrast. Comparisons will be made between those who received contrast and those who did not. In addition, based on volume and type of contrast agents used, a comparison will be made between those patients who received enteral contrast. Finally, a comparison will be made based upon contrast status between only those patients who were successfully managed non-operatively and then between those patients who required abdominal operation.
At enrollment, the enrolled patient population is small and this limits our ability to draw firm conclusions about the impact of contrast. Study recruitment will continue. Patient data will be collected and managed using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) software tool hosted at the University of Colorado. As of the time of analysis, 227 patients are enrolled into the study."

Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Cancer Institute (NCI), and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have set a 2021 deadline for 60% decrease in combustible cigarette consumption among all U.S. cigarette smokers and a corresponding, 81% reduction in the number of smoking-attributable deaths. The purpose of this multi-site, randomized, open-label, prospective observational study (Actual Use Study) is to assess the relative impact of availability of different ENDS (e-cigarette based) flavors on changes in cigarette consumption over eight weeks among US adult combustible cigarette smokers, who will have the freedom to use the assigned TNPs for ad libitum consumption during this period of time. By exposing combustible cigarette smokers to a range of e-products, from a standard tobacco flavor, to menthol flavors, non-tobacco/non-menthol flavor profiles and nicotine-containing formulations, insights may be gained into: the relative impact of different types of TNPs on cigarette substitution patterns; potential risk reduction benefits of these products (i.e. harm reduction); and consumer satisfaction with various TNP flavors.  The study has been designed to evaluate the impact of 6 different TNP flavor variants (13 total flavors), using 2 different nicotine levels (1.5% and 5%) within two tobacco flavors (tobacco and menthol) and four non tobacco/non menthol flavors (including three single flavor variants and one flavor blend variant) on cigarette consumption and the perceived product performance (including ease of use, flavor intensity and duration, and satisfaction levels) among US adult, current combustible cigarette smokers."

Background: Changing patterns in the gut-flora-microbiome have been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The microbiome is a composite of commensals bacteria that are both beneficial and harmful to health. Preclinical studies suggest that dysbiosis can contribute to the onset and persistence of inflammatory diseases. It is conceivable that early therapeutic interventions may offer a treatment option for IBD. Objective: Primary objectives of this study are clinical remission and endoscopic response (based on CDAI score <150 points and Simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease score ≤2) at week 26. Secondary targets are clinical remission at multiple time points and deep remission defined as absence of ulcerative lesions in the small or large bowel of those with endoscopically visible inflammation at baseline. Methods: This is a multicenter, open-label, two-arm prospective non-inferiority study. Moderate to severe Crohn's disease patients are treated with subcutaneous infliximab (IFX) 240mg at week 0 and 2 and then from week 4, 120mg s.c. The IFX monotherapy group starts with IFX 240mg at week 0 and 2 and then from week 4, 120mg s.c. EOW. The combination therapy group starts with IFX 240mg at week 0 and 2 and then from week 4, 120mg s.c. EOW. And 6mpt/MPA/TGN is started from week 0 at a dose of 12-25mg if the patient has not been treated before with an immunosuppressive. If intolerable, methotrexate is started. Clinical remission, endoscopic response, adverse events, IFX trough levels, anti-drug antibodies (ADA), histological healing is assessed at week 0 and 26. Endoscopy is performed at week 0 and 26 or if clinically indicated. Quality of life is assessed using EuroQol-5Dimension-5Level (EQ-5D-5L); the IBD questionnaire (IBDQ); patients with perianal disease are evaluated using the Fistula drainage assessment. Results of this study will help to design future studies. Prospective multicenter studies are required to establish this concept further in the future. Aim: A Multicenter prospective non-inferiority study to compare the efficacy (clinical and endoscopic response) by week 26 of induction therapy in IBD of subcutaneous Infliximab monotherapy with IFX and concomitant immunomodulators."

Background: Bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) is described as a lung disease characterized by obliteration of the small airways and subsequent loss of the affected lung volume. The true incidence and cause of BO is unknown, although there is an association between BO and previous infectious diseases, radiation or drug toxicity. BO presents as slowly progressive disease or pulmonary dysfunction leading to a reduced quality of life (QOL), especially when associated with chronic hypoxemia. According to the European Society of Respiratory Disease and the American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ERS/ATS) 2001 consensus document, the diagnostic criteria of BO are: The main diagnostic feature is a chest X-ray appearance, which is consistent with bronchiolitis but the degree of obstruction cannot be demonstrated by pulmonary function testing (PFT). The lack of response to corticosteroid therapy, and the radiological disappearance after repeated therapy, may be considered supportive evidence. However, BO has been reported to be associated with BDR.
Methods: The study arms consist of four groups: A healthy control group will serve as an internal control group. This group is deemed to be healthy and does not have any previous medical conditions that indicate any type of obstructive or restrictive lung disease. A chronic lung disease group which includes different types of ILD that may obstruct lung function. This group is deemed to have obstructive lung disease. A BO group which is composed of participants who have been diagnosed as having BO. The fourth group includes participants who have been diagnosed with other types of obstructive lung disease and may serve as another internal control group. These participants will serve as both an external and internal control group.
Our primary goal is to compare the bronchodilator response in healthy controls, individuals with obstructive, and restrictive lung disease, and individuals who have been diagnosed as having BO.
Significance: This study is important in characterizing the airway obstruction in the obstructed lungs of patients with different types (and severity) of lung disease, in comparison to the healthy lung. Additionally, it will be valuable in determining if there is any bronchodilator responsiveness in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans; as this may help in the management of this difficult disease."

The presence of sex, gender, and hormones influence pain perception and expression in healthy volunteers and chronic pain patients. Despite this, there is very little research on this topic, and we have no knowledge of how the pain experience (i.e., thresholds and tolerance) might be influenced by gender identity, hormonal status, and genetic sex. These factors interact in complex ways, and their contributions to pain sensitivity remain under-explored.
Transgenderism involves gender-affirming medical transition, and this has a well-documented impact on pain sensitivity. Transgender individuals experience a number of psychiatric and psychosocial difficulties, including anxiety, depression, poor body image and social support, and negative life events, including discrimination (i.e. perceived societal stigma and rejection) that may impact pain perception and expression. The hormonal changes (e.g., decreases in estrogen or increases in testosterone) that accompany medical transition can influence immune function, and, in turn, alter the response to acute and chronic pain. A better understanding of the role of gender identity in pain sensitivity is important in order to provide better pain management for this population.
It is widely accepted that sex differences are the result of a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal and environmental influences. Females have higher pain sensitivity and experience higher rates of chronic pain conditions than males, including fibromyalgia, tension headaches and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Conversely, males have higher rates of traumatic brain injury and chronic musculoskeletal disorders resulting from workplace injuries and sports-related injuries. While these sex differences may reflect actual biological differences, they may also reflect cultural expectations and gender-associated differences in pain report and treatment seeking behaviour, as well as differences in physical activity.
The primary goal of this study is to examine how self-reported gender identity and hormone levels affect endogenous pain modulation. We hypothesize that gender identity will impact pain sensitivity and will not be related to hormone levels or genetic sex. Our secondary aim is to examine the role of social and psychological factors (e.g., levels of sleep, depression, social support and perceived discrimination) as potential predictors of pain sensitivity in trans and cisgender individuals. The immune system is also affected by these variables and may influence how individuals respond to pain. Our third aim is to examine immune cell populations and their activity in order to understand differences between our groups. If differences in pain sensitivity are found, we also aim to identify a potential blood-based biomarker that would allow clinicians to predict pain sensitivity in transgender individuals.

The feasibility of technology enriched stroke rehabilitation for in-patients post acute stroke will be evaluated within the NHS setting at University Hospital Wishaw, in order to assess the practicalities of implementing this intervention within routine clinical practice. The study aims to test the acceptability of using technology to increase stroke rehabilitation activity and assess feasibility of the model; patient recruitment, adherence, feasibility of participant's/families using the technology, acceptability of the equipment and space, staff feedback, and acceptability of outcome measures among participants, families, and staff. It is hoped that this study will demonstrate the practicalities of implementing a scaled up technology enriched approach to stroke rehabilitation. If successful, the development of this feasibility study could support the development of a full-scale, multi-site trial powered to detect effects on functional recovery. Ultimately, it is our vision that this model of rehabilitation will lead to more rapid recovery for patients after stroke, improve health service efficiency and reduce costs, and lead to better outcomes for patients across Scotland and beyond.
The conditions we are focusing on are stroke, and we are targeting a specific population of adults (aged 18 and over) hospitalised with stroke who are deemed to be medically fit for rehabilitation by the multidisciplinary NHS team. Exclusion criteria are based on factors such as active delirium, excessive pain or tonal problems.
The intervention we are exploring is the technology enriched stroke rehabilitation model, which involves supported use of stroke rehabilitation technology such as robotic devices, virtual reality, and mobile digital devices (such as smartphones, tablets and wearable sensors) as part of routine care. Participants will be supported by NHS staff to use the technology under the supervision of therapy professionals, with the intention of enhancing standard NHS care.
The methodology of this study involves a feasibility phase, with both quantitative (time and movement repetitions) and qualitative measures being deployed to assess the intervention. We will recruit a convenient sample of inpatients into the study and will evaluate the acceptability, adherence and feasibility of implementing this care model in the NHS. We will be working in collaboration with UoS research and NHS occupational therapist colleagues."

In this study, 20 ALS patients undergoing treatment by NIV with persistent dyspnea are planned to be included. Patients will undergo the following tests: collection of sociodemographic data and data related to the disease (respiratory function tests, polysomnography) and the functional state (sclae of physical activity and fatigue, sclae of anxiety and depression). Then, patients will be randomized into two groups: one will be tested first by immersive virtual reality (IVR) and the other by music therapy (music). Each session will last 15 minutes. These interventions will be evaluated in terms of their effect on respiratory discomfort and preference of one treatment rather than the other. Finally, the effect of these treatments on the overall quality of life and the acceptability of immersive virtual reality (IVR) by the patients will be evaluated. The main outcome of this study is the decrease in dyspnea perception at rest evaluated by the Multidimensional Dyspnea Profile questionnaire in two dimensions: sensorial (QS) and affective (A1, A2)."

The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a selective reporting on broad-spectrum antibiotics consumption for women with E. coli urinary tract infection. Selective reporting consists in sending antibiotic susceptibility testing results for a population subset (those with E. coli susceptible to narrow-spectrum antibiotics) which, for the others (mostly E. coli extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) producer), only recommends the use of broader antibiotics.
The primary endpoint is the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing (defined as the rate of urine cultures associated with a prescription to broad-spectrum antibiotics in the period from 3 days before to 5 days after the antibiotic susceptibility testing result) among patients for whom antibiotics were prescribed.
The secondary endpoints are the rate of directed broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing, the antibiotic de-escalation rate, the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing as a function of the number of selective antibiotic susceptibility testings received per practice, as a continuous variable (dose-effect) and ordinal variable (threshold-effect), the characteristics of patients and general practitioners, and the E. coli antimicrobial susceptibility profiles.
The trial has the two-arms design: 1. The intervention group that will receive the selective antibiotic susceptibility testing and 2. The control group which will receive the usual antibiotic susceptibility report. The primary analysis will be the comparison of the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing in the control and intervention arms."

Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Currently, the effective treatment strategies of ischemic stroke are limited. It is of great clinical value and significance to explore effective neuroprotective medications besides reperfusion therapy. Sodium valproate is widely used in clinical practice, and its safety and tolerability has been confirmed. It is mainly used in the treatment of epilepsy, bipolar disorder, neuropathic pain and other diseases. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid has a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. The goal of this study is to test whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke. This prospective pilot study is intended to clarify whether the use of sodium valproate in patients with acute ischemic stroke can improve clinical outcomes, and to explore the mechanism: whether valproate could increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells. Patients with acute ischemic stroke included in the study will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline were given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. The investigators evaluate whether sodium valproate can improve clinical outcomes and increase peripheral CD177+ neutrophil levels."

Recent studies have demonstrated that patients with Ventral Hernia (VH) have high rates of obesity, with rates as high as 80% and morbidity rates from the initial surgery of up to 37%. Obesity is also associated with poor wound healing, increased risk of incisional hernia formation, higher rates of re-operation, and increased morbidity and mortality of any surgical intervention. Multiple attempts have also been made to decrease these poor outcomes with pre-operative weight loss, but with low compliance rates. Studies have demonstrated that a well-designed virtual coach is an effective tool to help patients adhere to weight loss recommendations and aid in weight loss while awaiting a primary repair for VH. With the advent of MyChart, an easy to use, free resource for most patients, a similar type of study can now be conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in the pre-operative setting of ventral hernia repair.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of utilizing MyChart enabled virtual coaches via a patient-centered app versus the use of standard pre-operative weight loss tools. There is little current data to suggest what the most effective measures are to promote pre-operative weight loss in patients with VHs. Recent data published by our own institution showed that only 37% of patients achieved weight loss (>10%) with standard weight loss advice, and few studies have ever demonstrated a significant impact of pre-operative weight loss in patients with VH. The primary hypothesis is that the virtual Coach will result in more weight loss in patients presenting for repair of VH compared to the control group. It is also hypothesized that patients in the virtual coach group will show significant improvements in satisfaction with weight loss compared to standard care measures. Ultimately, improved satisfaction may correlate with higher compliance rates.

Inclusion criteria: Subjects between 18 and 90 years of age with a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 30 and above and diagnosed with Obesity by the ICD 10 Code: E66.9 who have been evaluated by a surgeon and offered elective ventral hernia repair. Also, participants must have a complete medical record that allows for all statistical calculations to be performed.

Exclusion criteria: Pregnant females, patients with severe mental disorders, prescribed psychiatric medications associated with weight gain, a history of Substance Use Disorder, patients on long-term steroid therapy, and patients with insufficient medical records.

Participants will be randomized into two groups: A Control Group - where patients will receive standard weight loss tools. The control group will be provided with standard tools for weight loss (i.e. hand outs, pamphlets on healthy eating, advice from medical providers, etc.). A virtual Coach Group - where patients will utilize the newly designed MyChart enabled virtual coach to aid pre-operative weight loss. Based on the information provided above, write a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the provided clinical trial document that captures the key aspects."

COVID-19, also known as the novel coronavirus pneumonia, is sweeping the world. To date, there is no known effective drug to deal with COVID-19. Many countries and regions have adopted lockdown, isolation, and quarantine, in order to limit the spread of this disease. In recent years, there have been a number of clinical studies using stem cell interventions to treat infectious diseases including COVID-19. These studies have provided an alternative strategy to conventional therapies aimed at alleviating the complications caused by COVID-19. Therefore, in response to the current epidemic, this project proposes the clinical application of mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes for the treatment of moderate, severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. This is through the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of intracerebrally injected exosomes in combination with conventional COVID-19 therapy to achieve the goal of reducing disease progression and duration of hospitalization in COVID-19 patients, especially in severe cases. It is a multicenter, randomized controlled trial of moderate, severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients. Based on the current treatment plan, the experimental group will be treated with mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes, while the control group will be treated with a medical sterile saline solution. The time frame for this project is three months, and 300 cases are expected to be enrolled during this time. After the treatment, the condition of each patient will be compared with the clinical treatment guidelines formulated by various countries to evaluate their effectiveness. After the completion of this project, it will be easier for subsequent researchers to carry out advanced research in other directions, and the findings can be used in more in-depth clinical trials of MSC-exosomes for the treatment of COVID-19. The project has profound significance both for the promotion of basic research on stem cell technology and in the current fight against COVID-19.

One visit root canal therapy is one of the most accepted endodontic treatments and aims to achieve an immediate aseptic and painless treatment. Endodontic sealers are materials used to fill all root canals spaces after root canal preparation and obturation. Many types of endodontic sealers have been suggested, but calcium silicate-based sealer and Epoxy resin-based sealer are the most commonly used. Calcium silicate-based sealer can be used for emergency root canal treatment since it has biocompatibility and physiologic stability. However, Epoxy resin-based sealer can be used for routine root canal treatment since it has good working and sealing properties.
So the purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the two types of sealers; calcium silicate-based (White Mta) and Epoxy resin-based E-SEAL (Sybron Endo, USA) in one visit emergency root canal treatment.
Methods: A randomized clinical trial was carried out with the inclusion criteria of being patients referred for pain who received two-dimensional periapical radiographs and two-dimensional CBCT radiographs in the Department of Endodontic at the Faculty of Stomatognathic Science, Tay Do University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Vietnam National University. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: Epsiloy F group and White MTA group, where Epsiloy F was Epoxy resin-based sealer, and White MTA was Calcium silicate-based sealer. Both patients and observers were blindfolded to the treatment. After root canal preparation, root canal obturation followed by coronal sealing and temporary restoration was performed. The clinical outcomes were evaluated using Strindberg criteria, and patient pain was assessed using the VAS scale.
Results: A total of 154 teeth (154 patients) were included in the study, consisting of 156 Epsiloy F treated teeth and 158 White MTA treated teeth. The difference in the percentage of initial success and non-cultured success between groups was statistically significant. The average pain intensity (VAS) at the first 24 hours after treatment (p<0.05) showed no statistical difference between the two groups. In addition, there are no statistically significant differences in tooth pain at each follow-up assessment by VAS (p<0.05) and the tooth evaluation scores assessed according to Strindberg's criteria (p<0.05) between group Epsiloy F and group White MTA in the final assessment at 6 months.
Conclusions: The use of epoxy resin-based Sealer (Epsiloy F) in emergency root canal treatment does not lead to more adverse reactions than Calcium silicate-based sealer (White MTA). Therefore, Epoxy resin-based sealer can be used in clinical practice."

Research Background: Based on the new vaccine policy in China that focuses on reducing the risk of cervical cancer, the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine (Wozehui® and Cecolin®) was developed and approved for use in adolescent girls aged 9-14 years in 2016 years. The domestic bivalent HPV vaccine (Wozehui®) was granted a marketing authorization in July 2016 years, and the domestic bivalent HPV vaccine (Cecolin®) was granted a marketing authorization in August 2016 years. The domestic cervical cancer vaccines (Wozehui®) and international cervical cancer vaccines are the two most commonly used HPV vaccines worldwide. These two different HPV Vaccines have different antibody immune response mechanisms. In order to make the most of the policy and strengthen the use of local vaccines, it is necessary to confirm the effectiveness of the two domestic HPV vaccines, establish the immunological superiority of domestic bivalent HPV vaccines or domestic quadruple HPV vaccines, and finally determine the localization of HPV vaccines in the future. The study aims to: 1) Evaluate the immunogenicity of two different domestically produced bivalent HPV vaccines (Wozehui® and Cecolin®) versus imported HPV vaccines in adolescent females aged 13-14 years old; 2) Evaluate the immune persistence of two different domestically produced bivalent HPV vaccines (Wozehui® and Cecolin®) versus imported HPV vaccines in adolescent females aged 13-14 years old.

Follicular lymphoma (FL) and indolent lymphomas are generally characterized by relapsing disease, leading to treatment burden and potential morbidity. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulatory drug indicated for previously treated FL and indolent lymphomas and is often combined with rituximab. As lenalidomide-based regimens become standard of care and rituximab treatment is limited by inability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, it is important to find new treatment approaches. Recently a bispecific antibody against CD20 was developed, which can cross the blood-brain-barrier. This potential to target a tumoral lesion in the CNS has led to an investigation of the potential role of the bispecific antibody, odronextamab, an anti-CD20 x anti-CD3 bispecific antibody, in NHL that express CD20 and CD3. The safety and efficacy of odronextamab in combination with lenalidomide in subjects with R/R indolent lymphomas is being evaluated.
The investigators would like to compare the safety, efficacy and durability of response between OLYMPIA-5 and the OLYMPIA-3 trial evaluating the use of REVLIMID®(Len) + Rituxan (RR) in subjects with R/R indolent lymphomas and determine whether adding odronextamab to Len has an overall benefit in PFS over RR."

The Effect of Proliverenol Supplementation on Liver Function in Patients With Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) : Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common disorder globally, with a prevalence between 3 and 30%. NAFLD can progress to advanced liver disease including steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. There are no approved treatment for NAFLD. Although weight loss has been shown to positively impact on the course of NAFLD, the majority of patients with NAFLD are not obese and fail the conventional standard treatment with medical nutrition or dietary regimes. Thus, the search for a more specific targeted therapy is necessary to improve NAFLD treatment and long-term patient outcomes. There have been several potential therapeutic agents for NAFLD, but the most extensively studied drug for NASH to date has been Vitamin E. Several randomized placebo-controlled trials evaluating the use of high-dose Vitamin E for 12 months have been halted prematurely due to excess adverse events and risk of death in the treatment group. In this context, there is thus a need for alternative approaches to treat NAFLD. Proliverenol® (PLRN) acts as a hepatocyte growth factor receptor (HGFR) agonist, which is not affected by nutrients. In addition, PLRN has been reported to be non-carcinogenic in rodents and the liver is the main site of drug absorption, suggesting that PLRN would be absorbed in the liver. Based on this pharmacokinetic profile, we hypothesized that PLRN may stimulate liver growth and regeneration as well as improve the metabolic profile in patients with NAFLD. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate whether daily administration of PLRN supplements may lead to metabolic and functional improvement in patients with NAFLD and to assess the safety profile of PLRN during such treatment. For this purpose, we conducted a randomized, double‐blinded, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging treatment study to evaluate the efficacy of 2 different dosages (1 x 1 caplet twice daily vs. 2 x 1 caplet) of PLRN versus placebo in patients with NAFLD. The investigators plan to recruit 80 patients and they will receive the study medication for 12 weeks."

Periodontal disease is a common inflammatory disease that affects the connective tissue and alveolar bone that support the teeth. Non-surgical periodontal treatment is the first therapeutic modality in the periodontal therapy. Although periodontal treatment is an established procedure, a significant number of patients do not respond adequately and, at a long-term perspective, many patients may be relapsing after nonsurgical periodontal treatment.
As a consequence of disease progression or patient refusal to periodontal surgery, the periodontal supporting structures may not be restored, and long-term failure can lead to tooth loss. Despite the development of innovative therapies that can provide more predictable long-term results, periodontal treatment outcomes remain unpredictable, and relapses after non-surgical periodontal treatment remain a clinical challenge despite all efforts. Furthermore, non-surgical periodontal treatment is not an optimal treatment approach for individuals with a limited lifespan or for patients who refuse surgery due to the extensive number of surgical sessions. In these patients, non-surgical periodontal treatment may fail or the success of such procedures will be limited and short lived. In the last decade, new treatment modalities have been developed and tested to improve the outcomes of periodontal treatment such as ozone. Ozone is considered a non-pharmacologic, inexpensive, and safe alternative to conventional antimicrobial agents for periodontal treatment.
The investigators will use Ozone Generator for ozone producing, and 1/8 standard periodontal probe for probing pocket depth measurement. Patients will be categorized into two groups: (1) Group A: patients who will be treated by non-surgical periodontal therapy and ozone therapy. (2) Group B: patients who will be treated by non-surgical periodontal therapy only. Each treatment will be completed within one week. The effectiveness and impact of ozone application on periodontal therapy will be assessed using clinical parameters (pocket depth, bleeding index, and plaque index) and biochemical markers (proportion of bacterial species and levels of inflammatory parameters in gingival crevicular fluid in periodontal pockets at baseline, 1st, and 3rd month after therapy) and will be compared to the control group.
The null hypothesis: There is no additional benefit of ozone treatment when compared to periodontal treatment alone in providing better clinical responses and changes in the microbiome."

Epidemiological studies revealed that the incidence of Pterygium (ptt) increases with age and is affected by the level of UV exposure, especially in individuals with fair complexion and sunlight sensitivity.. For people whose lifestyle includes outdoor activities with high exposure to UV radiation, Pterygium is not only a disfiguring of the sclera but also a risk factor for visual loss.Pterygium is a proliferative disease, often bilateral, that has no age limit and is commonly seen in tropics. It is frequently a disease for which an invasive resection is requested for cosmetic appearance in young people, and as a measure to prevent visual loss in more advanced cases.. ptt is a common, benign, and proliferative lesion of the eye.. While the exact mechanism of ptt development is unknown, recent studies highlight the role of genetic factors and inflammation. Studies have also shown that the development and growth of ptt is driven by molecular pathways that have not yet been explored thoroughly, including the molecular mechanisms underlying the transformation from cell growth (proliferation) to the invasion and metastasis of cells in ocular tissues.In human corneal cells in culture, CD44 expression seems to be a regulator of cell proliferation, and the absence of the protein causes a significant reduction in cell proliferation, cell adhesion and migration.E-cadherin, a membrane glycoprotein found in many cell types, belongs to the cell adhesion molecular family that is related to the establishment of cell-cell adhesion connections by the interaction of cadherin molecules of the same cell with the corresponding ligands in a neighboring cell or tissue. The loss of E-cadherin leads to the dissolution of cell contacts and the invasion of tissues.
The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of cell membrane proteins in patients with pterygium, whose alterations are associated with cell invasion and increased motility. Immunohistochemical method to detect protein expression by tumor cells, and to evaluate the cell proliferative index of the pterygium. The main difference in these proteins in pterygium tissue compared to the conjunctiva control group will be determined quantitatively by the calculation of the index of optical density (IOPD)."

Aging is associated with loss of nasal T cells and an increased risk of infections. However, the underlying mechanisms and consequences of this loss are still unclear. Therefore, the proposed research focuses on the following two research questions: 1) Why do T cells leave the nose of aging individuals?
2) Do lost/absent T cells affect the ability of the nose to fight infections, thereby increasing the risk of respiratory infections for frail elderly individuals?
This research will be performed in a clinical-epidemiological study with 150 participants, consisting of a mix of age cohorts and frail status. We hypothesize age-mediated differential alterations in T cells that associate with the loss of T cells from the nose and that T cells and other immune populations in the nose may have a functional defect during an infections. The ultimate goal of this research is to identify T cell populations and their functions that are altered in aging individuals and frail elderly individuals to identify potential immunological markers that allow early detection of at-risk individuals. Once identified, it would be possible to test whether these nasal T cell populations are able to serve as therapeutic target (e.g., immunotherapy) and whether this improves the immune protection and reduces the susceptibility of nasal infections in (frail) elderly individuals."

Background: cirrhotic patients with ascites have a greater risk for bacterial infection because of loss of the normal intestinal barrier function that leads to accumulation of bacteria in their body, and this is called spontaneous infection of ascetic fluid (SIAF) or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). It has been reported that there is an increase in white blood cells that consist of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) and other white blood cells (monocytes, lymphocytes) and this mixture may help in predicting the severity of SBP and its prognosis. The study is to identify the platelets to lymphocytes ratio and monocytes to lymphocytes ratio as a predictor of response to treatment in cirrhotic patients with SBP. Methods: Cirrhotic patients with ascites who fulfilled our criteria were recruited and were randomized into two groups according to platelets to lymphocytes ratio (<5 and >or =5) and the monocytes to lymphocytes ratio (<2 and >or =2). The patients were treated by ceftriaxone and then tigecycline (2-3 g/day) according to the antibiotic sensitivity results of the isolated bacteria in ascetic fluid. The primary outcome is the percentage of sterilization of ascitis. Secondary outcomes are ascitic fluid bacterial eradication, 6-month rate of death, 90-day rate of death, and 90-day rates of hospitalization, re-hospitalization, 5-day hospital re-admission, and SBP re-admission. Patients who were non-sterility of their ascitic fluid were recruited for a second antibiotic therapy with tigecycline. The patients who responded in the second antibiotic therapy were continued with tigecycline as prophylactic therapy till the end of the study period and the other patients were recruited for a second antibiotic therapy with colistin when the ascitic fluid was not eradicated. The same patients were again treated with tigecycline 2-3 g/day if the ascitic fluid become sterile or become eradicated. Logistic analysis will be used to measure the variables in predicting the percentage of sterilization of ascitic fluid . SPSS program version 22 will be used for the data analyses. The investigators will compare the data between the groups and the variables that give significant results will help in increasing the patients' outcome in SBP."

Postoperative radiotherapy is widely practiced and highly effective in enabling breast conserving therapy in early stage tumors, and decreasing recurrence while improving survival in patients with advanced-stage breast cancer, the most common cancer in women. However, these benefits of radiotherapy are associated with a long-term risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in breast cancer survivors. The unintended cardiac radiation exposure due to the heart's proximity to the treatment target has been well recognized, particularly in left-sided breast cancer. Because there is no lowest safe threshold radiation dose level for radiation-induced cardiac complications, the dose to the heart must be kept as low as possible to reduce the complications risk. Recent advances in high-precision 3D conformal and intensity-modulated radiotherapy techniques have enabled better protection of the heart. Treatment in deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) is indispensable to realize these technological capabilities by taking advantage of the greater distance created between the radiotherapy target and the contralaterally and inferiorly displaced heart during deep inspiration. While many studies have demonstrated reduction of the heart dose with DIBH, challenges in decreasing heart dose to a minimum remain. Radiotherapy in DIBH requires active and complex cooperation from the patient, and its success critically depends on how well patients are capable to perform the prolonged extended deep breathing maneuver on a repetitive basis every day during their weeks-long treatment course. Both the physical demands and profound anxiety and stress, which are highly prevalent in breast cancer patients, additionally interfere with patients' DIBH performance. Anxiety is well known to directly adversely affect breathing patterns, thereby challenging patients' ability to perform DIBH optimally. Preliminary research explored the role of physical training and showed that targeted DIBH training improves patients' cooperation and the ease of the DIBH procedure, and reduces the radiation dose to the heart. However, while DIBH training regimens may improve patients' physical respiratory skill levels, they do not address their mental stress and anxiety. Relaxation techniques to alleviate anxiety and stress have been rarely used in complex radiotherapy procedures, particularly not in DIBH. Preliminary studies in diagnostic radiology procedures suggest that advanced communication and relaxation techniques, targeted to relieve anxiety and stress, improve patients' procedural performance, anxiety and comfort. The investigators hypothesize that implementing both, DIBH Respiratory Training and advanced communication and Relaxation Training (R&R), improve patients' DIBH performance skills and further reduce heart dose, while alleviating anxiety and stress and improving quality of life during and after radiation therapy. The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a clinical trial randomizing R&R vs. standard-of-care management in patients with radiotherapy in DIBH for left breast cancer. The investigators primary endpoint will assess heart dose (Dmax), and secondary endpoints include longitudinal anxiety and quality of life assessment and clinic workflow efficiency. The ultimate goal of this proposal is to develop a validated patient-centered training and integrative health regimen to further improve the success of advanced-technology-based cardiac dose reduction, and improve cardiac health in breast cancer survivors."

Background: Over the past decade, many new therapies (immunotherapy, targeted agents, and biologics) have shown clinical activity. Combination of these agents with established agents (chemotherapy) is emerging as a new treatment paradigm for cancer. This approach involves the testing of combinations of new modalities (immunotherapy or targeted agents) in the clinic with the goal of determining if the combination helps patients more than either therapy alone.
Cancer of the pancreas remains a difficult disease to treat by surgical removal. Despite advances in surgical techniques and therapies, only 10-15% of patients with pancreatic cancer are eligible for curative surgery. Those with early stages of the disease have the best outcomes; however, only 20% of patients are diagnosed at resectable stage. For those patients eligible and undergoing potentially curative surgery, the median overall survival (OS) is approximately 13 months due to the high rate of local and systemic disease recurrence. Although gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel (gemox) have made a significant impact on the treatment of pancreatic cancer, there is a clear and urgent need to develop improved therapies for this disease, and to use biology and immunotherapy research to help identify those with a pancreatic tumor that has the best chance of being cured by surgery. As a result, there is great interest from the medical community in learning more about how immunotherapy medicines and the drugs (like gemox) that are currently used to treat metastatic pancreatic cancer can be used prior to surgery.
Cancer Treatment Centers of America (CTCAE) have launched a national clinical trial that is exploring the use of nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and immunotherapy for patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer with the goal of determining whether the patient has an opportunity to have all of the tumor removed with a procedure called surgical resection. The CTCAE clinical trial is called ""A Phase IB Study to Determine the Safety and Tolerability of Canakinumab and Tislelizumab in Combination With Nab-Paclitaxel and Gemcitabine in the Neo-adjuvant Treatment of Patients With Pancreatic Cancer"".

Using Participatory Design and Community Partnered Participatory Research (CPPR), UCLA and UCR psychiatry research centers with Los Angeles Trust for Children's Health aim to: (1) Fully co-design (with youth, caregivers, clinicians and other stakeholders) an innovative mental health digital tool, called Connected for Wellness, to implement algorithmically supported mental health + social determinants, resiliency app based tools and navigation activities AND help support the clinical workforce within schools and primary care clinics (PCCs); (2) Study the implementation of mental health navigation models (family and youth navigation) plus the Connected for Wellness app, and their effectiveness for improving connecting and matching youth to the right level of care and supports. We will accomplish these aims through three strategies: (1) Use community participatory informatics to co-design a mental health digital tool called Connected for Wellness, to support mental health navigation, linking youth to a range of mental health services, evidence-based prevention resources referred via the app, and other school, clinic, community, and social supports; (2) Integrate mental health self-assessments and artificial intelligence (AI) in Connected for Wellness to individualize app resources, optimize engagement and recommendations for addressing mental health and social needs; (3) Using a stepped wedge design, test the implementation of the app supported by mental health navigation models (peer navigators, family navigators) for improving connections and access to prevention resources, mental health services and social supports, for youth and families. This project will be initiated with youth 13-22 years old and their family and community members across 10 Los Angeles County Schools and 10 Riverside County/University of California Riverside primary care clinics, which serve mostly Black, Latino, and Asian youth. A successful outcome of the project is a CPPR developed app-based intervention implementable in school-based and primary care services for access to wellness resources and improving mental health services access along the cascade of care. Outcomes are measured using the cascade of care model with the following key stages: (1) need identification, (2) referral to care/ linkage to resources, and (3) care initiation."

Cesarean section (CS) is the most common operation during childbirth. Worldwide, CS rates are increasing due to the improvement in maternal health care in modern societies. Because of the increase of CS rates, the number of cesarean hysterectomies (CH), due to primary CS-related complications such postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), have increased exponentially in the developed community. PPH is a common, life-threatening and potentially fatal condition of maternal morbidity and mortality that occurs after maternal birth either during or within 24 hours post-delivery. PPH is the main factor that prolongs hospitalization, causes obstetric complications and death in the mother. PPH is a major problem with potentially serious outcomes and is responsible for an estimated 5% of maternal mortality. Most CS are performed on women who have normal pregnancies and are in term pregnancy. PPH is defined as blood loss greater than 500ml after cesarean delivery while severe PPH greater than one liter with signs of volume depletion or hemodynamic instability PPH is a major public health problem and a major contributor to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. PPH could be estimated through various methods. Intraperitoneal blood estimation in (mg) during surgery is the most appropriate method and it's more acceptable by most obstetricians. The objective of this study is to compare and evaluate the safety of intramyometrial oxytocin injection with intra-myometrial tranexamic acid injection in reducing the risk of PPH after CS. It's a double-blind randomized comparative clinical trial. Two hundred primigravida women at term pregnancy, undergoing elective CS-will be allocated randomly in two groups. Group 1 (n = 100): women will be allocated to receive 5 cc of placebo 5 I.U of oxytocin (nonartis-egypt) injection. Group 2 (n = 100): women will be allocated to receive 5 cc of Tranexamic acid (kapron®, Amoun, Egypt). In both group, after fetal birth (10 minutes maximum), patients are allocated to the two groups by injecting in each uterine corn before the placental separation 5cc (2.5 cc/uterine corn) of either tranexamic acid or oxytocin according to the study group"

The vaginal microbiome plays a substantial role in the success of IVF treatments by influencing the establishment and development of the endometrium during the window period for pregnancy. However, there is a lack of knowledge how to address the negative effects of unfavorable vaginal microbiome composition on pregnancy rates and what kind of strategy a physician and patient should use. Therefore, we have identified the need for a tool that can measure and assess vaginal microbiome composition for IVF/ICSI and determine reproductive success.
In this investigator-initiated multicenter clinical study, called ReceptIVFity, we will test whether the ReceptIVFity microbiome profile in combination with the Shared Decision Making Model results in a higher pregnancy rate (≥ 35%) compared to not using the ReceptIVFity system. An additional benefit is an increase in knowledge about the influence of the vaginal microbiome on the establishment and development of the endometrium during the window period of implantation.
By testing the efficacy of a combination of ReceptIVFity and SDM we can provide the evidence to determine the use of the ReceptIVFity system as a diagnostic test in the clinic setting for IVF.
After recruitment of patients and randomization in a control group or an SDM group, all patients will get information about the influence of the vaginal microbiome on fertilization and implantation using the ReceptIVFity microbiome profile.
We want to analyze whether knowledge transfer improves reproductive success. Furthermore, we hypothesize that by using the SDM method we can offer personalized treatment, i.e. tailored to the patient's vaginal microbiome profile, increase the probability of a successful IVF treatment and reduce the number of cycles until a successful IVF treatment for the individual patient.
Patients in the control group will be offered frozen or fresh cycles in which randomization towards a SDM treatment in case of non-European vaginal microbiome profiles will be part of the intervention.
In the observational part of the study, the results will be used to identify potential personalized interventions aimed at favoring an establishment of an optimal endometrium profile to improve and support the efficacy of IVF/ICSI treatment.

Hyperlipidemia is characterized as the overproduction of very low density cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (i.e. bad cholesterol) and decreased high density lipoprotein (HDL) (i.e. good cholesterol). Amongst individuals with mild to moderate hyperlipidemia, lifestyle changes is the first treatment option, such as a healthy diet. Therefore, seeking to develop food-based approaches for hyperlipidemia therapy is a timely endeavour. Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive option, as it is a spice throughout the world which possesses medicinal properties in regulating human nutrient metabolism. In a recent review of the overall effects of fenugreek on hyperlipidemia in humans with diabetes and prediabetes, this analysis suggested that fenugreek has total cholesterol-lowering efficacy. The effects of fenugreek on triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol showed a trend towards reduction and an incremental trend for HDL-cholesterol but needed further confirmation. The effect of fenugreek in human subjects with hyperlipidaemia without diabetes has not been investigated. This research aims to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed consumed as a tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes over an 8-week intervention period. Changes in plasma microRNAs will be analysed to establish non-invasive therapeutic biomarkers of hyperlipidemia. Participants without pre-existing CVD or diabetes aged 18-70 years old will be included if they have hyperlipidaemia (plasma triglyceride level between 1.7 - 4.5mmol/l) not on any lipid-lowering treatment or on a stable lipid-lowering treatment (last six months) but still have confirmation of high triglycerides within the range required for study. 114 participants will be randomized into two groups (57/group) to receive either fenugreek seeds or control tea, respectively. Treatment allocations will be placed into sealed envelopes and this will be opened at the baseline study visit with the participant. Fenugreek seeds will be delivered at a dose of 5g/day, drunk as a tea (2.5g/per tea bag), p.o. twice a day at a 12-hour interval) for 8 weeks (56 days). The tea bags will be brewed in a cup (200ml) of boiled hot water for 10 minutes before drinking. This will be self-administered by the subjects, twice a day at a 12-hour interval. The rationale for choosing the dose and intervention time course were based on the previous studies where metabolic effects have been detected. Literature reports from 12 human studies on diabetic and pre-diabetic subjects gave doses of fenugreek seed ranging from 1 to 100g/day, with the median treatment dose being 6.3g/day, to the participants; the intervention time course ranged from 1 week to 3 years, with the median treatment time being 60 days. The dose and duration in this study was therefore designed as being similar to these studies where metabolic effects have been detected, and also, where participant burden will not be too onerous, at a dose of 5g/day, twice a day at a 12-hour interval for 8 weeks (56 days). For the control group, a control black tea (2.5g/bag), self-administered by the subjects, twice in a day at a 12-hour interval. Black tea is a type of fermented tea that has been found to possess much less cardioprotective and lipid profile improving effect compared to green tea due to the different manufacture process. Consumption of black tea has been found not associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease in the United Kingdom. Recruitment will be via outpatient hyperlipidemia clinics, primary care and advertisements. Study visits will take place at the Centre for Public Health at baseline, 4 and 8 weeks and will involve the collection of demographic information, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure and fasting blood samples."

This will be a prospective, randomized and open clinical study. From a sample of patients hospitalized for myocardial revascularization surgery, followed at the cardiac surgery outpatient clinic, 20 research participants, male, aged over 40 years, non-diabetic or diabetic with disease duration of less than 10 years, glycated hemoglobin <8% and non-user of NPH insulin, body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 34.9kg/m2 and glomerular filtration rate above 45mL/min who will be monitored at the Hospital de Clínicas/UNICAMP and randomized to receive pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day for 5 days before surgery. The amount of S1P in HDL at baseline (before surgery) will be assessed. This same measurement will be repeated on day 5 (coinciding with the day of surgery) after using pioglitazone hydrochloride 45mg/day. In addition, on the day of surgery, a saphenous vein fragment of approximately 2 cm and an internal thoracic artery fragment of approximately 1 cm will be collected, which will not impair the quality of the graft nor the extent of the material to be used as a graft, because in this case the vascular material is abundant. An aortic artery button and an atrial appendage button will also be collected, which will be discarded. In addition, the results of serum troponin levels in the first 24h post-SVR (6, 12, 24h) will be evaluated to estimate the extent of troponin release. Postoperative examination."

Panoramic imaging is an extraoral imaging technique used to visualise dentofacial structures. Over the years, dental panoramic imaging has become an essential clinical tool for diagnosing dental diseases and treatment planning. The quality of radiographic images is important for successful diagnosis and treatment planning. However, it has been shown that the quality of panoramic images is often compromised by patient positioning errors. These errors can affect all types of radiography, but they are most commonly seen in panoramic images, where as many as 80-95 percent of radiographic images may include one or more positional, patient movement errors or artifacts (Vadaparasa et al., 2019). One of the common mistakes is the tongue not being in contact with the palate, known as the Palatoglossal airspace (PGA) error, which is also the most frequent of these errors.
The palatoglossal airspace error causes a radiolucent band that obscures the image of the maxillary cusp tips and anatomical landmarks in the anterior area of the upper jaw, resulting in poor overall image quality. This image artifact can affect the diagnostic accuracy significantly, which can lead to delays in treatment, poor decision-making, and repeat imaging, resulting in an increased dose of radiation to both the patient and the operator. In addition, PGA can be confused with a fracture in the mandibular region.
The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of using celluloid matrix tape or strips of food material as simple, inexpensive, and effective methods to reduce PGA error. This is a randomized, triple-blinded study involving three groups: a control group with no intervention, a celluloid matrix tape group and a group using strips of fruit leather.
All data were analysed using the SPSS 26 software. Chi-square test was used to compare the qualitative variables. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the quantitative analysis. The intervention outcomes were evaluated using the logistic regression model. The differences with P<0.05 were considered statistically significant for all tests.
The results showed that in comparison with the control group, the PGA error in the celluloid matrix tape group and fruit leather group was significantly less (p<0.001). Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the two study groups (celluloid matrix tape group and fruit leather group) in terms of PGA error (p>0.05).
In conclusion, PGA error is a common mistake in panoramic imaging and has a negative impact on the success of dental radiographic imaging. Different methods can be used to overcome this obstacle, such as the use of celluloid matrix tape or strips of food material. In the present study, both methods were successful and reduced the PGA error effectively, with high accuracy and reproducibility."

Plantar fasciitis is widely used treatment methods; In studies examining the effectiveness of these methods, the effect of combined treatment in terms of plantar fascia flexibility is not known. The main aim of the study is to examine the effectiveness of combined treatment and the effect of this treatment on the flexibility of plantar fascia in patients with plantar fasciitis. Acute effect on pain severity and lower extremity functionality of the effect of kinesio taping (KT) and Extracorporeal Shock Wave Therapy (ESWT) in plantar fasciitis was compared with each other and with placebo ESWT. After the consent form was obtained, data were recorded and the patient was evaluated as the research group. Pain severity was evaluated with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), and Functional Status Evaluation was evaluated with Lower Extremity Functional Scale. VAS scores, lower extremity functional scale values, and plantar fascia flexibility were compared with the pre-treatment assessment before and after the treatment."

Background: Adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) frequently encounter interpersonal challenges to their romantic relationships. They often encounter a significant amount of distress caused by their partner's behavior, as well as difficulty expressing their views and feelings about the relationship.
Objective: The aim of this cross-sectional survey was to provide a preliminary investigation of the effects of a couple group therapy program on an adult couple, in which one person has either an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) diagnosis or above-average level of Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) Score.
Method: Twenty couples, which were either married or in a romantic relationship, of which one participant had a formal diagnosis of ASD, participated in 8-week couple group therapy. The assessment of the couples before and after therapy was conducted using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Autism Spectrum Quotient, Empathy Quotient, Quality of socialization questionnaire, and Social Responsiveness Scale.
Result: The couples that completed the therapy showed significant improvements in self-awareness and emotional expression. Furthermore, the couples that attended a higher number of sessions indicated superior levels of empathy towards the partner than the control group. However, no significant changes were observed with regards to the couple's levels of social isolation, social inadequacies, and quality of socialization.
Conclusions: Couples with either a history of ASD or high levels of AQ score can receive benefits from couple group therapy. Further investigations with larger numbers of couples are needed to establish the efficacy of the couple group therapy program."

This is a randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint study that aims to compare the efficacy and safety of intravenous tirofiban with standard antiplatelet therapy based on Chinese stroke guideline for the patients with acute branch atheromatous disease related stroke within 48 hours of onset. It includes 472 eligible patients randomly assigned into 2 groups with 236 patients in each group. The primary efficacy outcome is the comparison of the excellent functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score: 0-1) at 90 days. Based on the results of our stroke prevention trial (J.Lancet 2019; 394:1234-48) target trial level is 85%, type I error is 5%, and type II error is 10%. The time frame of outcome assessment is 90 days. Tirofiban is a second generation receptor antagonist that inhibits platelet aggregation by blocking the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa (GPIIb/IIIa) receptor. It is widely used in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome and acute cerebral ischemia in China, which may be a suitable drug for patients with branch atheromatous disease related stroke within 48 hours of onset. The standard antiplatelet regimen that recommended in the Chinese stroke guideline include aspirin and cloplicogrel. It can reduce the risk of stroke and is more cost-effective."

Background: Sinus node dysfunction is a significant cause of bradycardic patient symptoms, such as fatigue, shortness of breath, fainting, hypotension, and a slowed heart rate, especially in the elderly population. Current treatment relies on pacemaker implantation to achieve the desired heart rate of 60-75 beats per minute. However, increasing evidence has indicated that a lower rate than 60 bpm can also improve symptoms without adversely affecting hemodynamic performance.
Objective: To compare the effectiveness of a pacemaker at a rate of 60 vs. 75-80 beats per minute in improving quality of life among patients with sinus node dysfunction. A hypothesis is that a pacemaker rate of 75-80 beats per minute will have no different impact on the quality of life when compared to the pacemaker rate of 60 beats per minute, while a lower resting heart rate would reduce blood pressure fluctuations.
Design: Randomised controlled trial conducted in a single hospital site.
Criteria: Age requirement of 60 or more, resting heart rate of 60 bpm or less and patient-specific factors (i.e., patient willingness to participate in the study, understanding of the study) was obtained.
Methods: Patients will be examined after pacemaker implantation within three months to assess quality of life with 75-80 beats per minute or 60 beats per minute.

Background: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a breathing problem during sleep that can cause daytime sleepiness, sleepiness, depression, diabetes, cardiac events, accidents and death. OSA is very common. However, the overall awareness of OSA is quite low. OSA is often underdiagnosed and undertreated as well. OSA is now known as a major public health problem, and a growing public and professional health care cost. Treatment of OSA will improve the quality of life of patients, but it is expensive. Telemedicine technology can be used for remote diagnosis and remote sleep monitoring, and is very convenient. However, at present there are no randomized controlled trials to prove that remote diagnosis combined with OSA treatment is clinically useful for OSA patients who are prone to OSA symptoms. This randomized controlled study is expected to determine the feasibility, safety and efficacy of telemedicine technology combined with standardized Obstructive sleep apnea positive airway pressure (APAP) treatment in the management of Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients. Aims: The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness with telemedicine technology compared to normal treatment and to explore the differences in compliance and costs between the two. Telemedicine technology can save OSA patients a lot of time and travel expenses in remote areas, providing more convenience for patients, and improving the compliance of patients. The telemedicine technology can also achieve cost control for OSA cases. Methods: This research is based on a randomized trial. After patients with OSA symptoms confirmed by clinical experts, the sleep center randomly assigns them into two groups. One group is treated in the sleep center, which is called the outpatient treatment group, and the other group is treated remotely, which is called the remote treatment group. Telemedicine technology was applied to provide remote diagnosis, remote sleep monitoring, telemedicine follow-up, APAP treatment, education and training, so as to compare the effectiveness of telemedicine technology and traditional treatment in the management of OSA patients. During the treatment period, we will follow up the symptoms and changes in blood pressure rhythm of patients after remote treatment. We will measure the cost of the two groups, analyze the differences in compliance with the treatment in the two groups, the changes in blood pressure rhythm, questionnaire results, sleep patterns and costs of patients between the two groups. We will also establish an electronic subject database to obtain electronic medical record information. Investigators will determine the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine technology compared to traditional methods. Based on previous studies, the number of participants required for this research is 178, and the study period is 12 months. The main conclusions of our study can be achieved through this.

Elective cesarean sections under spinal anesthesia cause moderate to severe postoperative pain. Inadequate pain control can lead to undesirable effects such as low motivation to breastfeed, postoperative complications and sleep disorders.
Past research showed that non-pharmacologic methods are effective in the management of postoperative pain. Communication is an important non-pharmacological tool in pain management that have been found to be efficacious, however the nature of the communication was not specified in these studies.
Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to investigate how communication influences the efficacy of analgesics in patients following Caesarean section.
The study is conducted in a single center prospective, randomized, clinical trial. Eligible participants are female patients aged 18-50 who will undergo an elective caesarean section under spinal anesthesia. There are two study arms - study arm A undergoes a high communication style and study arm B undergoes the normal communication style.
The primary outcome is the effectiveness of postoperative analgesia - change in pain intensity - one hour after the administration of analgesics. The second outcome is change in the state anxiety level one hour after the administration of analgesics. These outcomes are assessed by the patients' self-evaluation on the 0-10 pain scale and a questionnaire, respectively."

This research is being conducted to help develop a better test to identify lung cancer in people aged 55-74 years old. This research is also looking at other medical conditions that could affect the results. We call these conditions comorbidities. Researchers hope that new tests can help reduce lung cancer deaths. The researchers would like to work with the general public to help develop lung cancer screening using the Combe Lung Health Check (TLHC) Programme. The information in this leaflet will help us understand what would be expected and what you need to know about any extra tests and/or samples you agree to take part in. When you have read, keep the leaflet and return it to the TLHC nurses if you agree to take part in this research study. It is completely your choice, based on the information you have been given, and you can change your mind at any time before, during, or after the research has taken place. It is important that the researchers get information from individuals who do not have lung cancer about factors that could make a difference to developing lung cancer. The researchers will be using data about blood pressure, body weight and lung disease history. In some cases, investigations such as scans and blood tests will be taken as part of routine TLHC clinical care. In other cases, researchers plan to repeat some of these tests (for example CT-scans). Your previous medical history and routine tests/ scans taken at visits 1 and 2 are already being used. If you agree to take part, the researchers will be using the scan images, blood samples, and measurements from these routine tests to analyse the results. They will be using this information for the period from your previous visit until the end of this study period, which is up to 5 years but could be for longer. Some people may have a further scan or blood tests as part of this study. These tests may help make screening tests more accurate and could help diagnose lung cancer by comparing images or looking for changes in the blood. The researchers think that it is necessary to collect information about smoking history, other medical conditions, and lifestyle factors from participants who are not able to speak English. This is important to help researchers test the ability of the screening test to work in a population where participants may speak other languages. The researchers also need to gather information about the family history of lung cancer. This will be gathered by asking participants to fill in a form or with the help of an interpreter. These forms ask questions about their family history of cancer over the last 80 years."

Hypertension is a public health problem and a risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and is also associated with cognitive, renal and metabolic impairments and with fractures in the elderly. In addition, one of the challenges for clinical practice among the elderly is the control of arterial hypertension and pharmaceutical care for treatment has proved to be effective.
Therefore, the objective of this study is to study the effectiveness of pharmaceutical care via telepharmacy and usual care on the clinical outcomes of patients with arterial hypertension in the elderly and to compare these outcomes with the pharmaceutical care in-person protocol. The secondary objectives are to study the clinical outcomes by socio- demographic and clinical variables; the factors that can positively influence the outcomes such as adherence to treatment, drug consumption; satisfaction and factors that hinder the progress; and to establish the clinical importance and the acceptability of the intervention.
The study will be conducted with elderly patients referred by the hospital pharmacy at the Geriatrics and Gerontology Hospital of the Federal University of Sao Paulo and will compare the data collected from patients submitted to pharmaceutical care via telemedicine to hospital pharmacy professionals and those who received pharmaceutical care in-person. Inclusion criteria are as follows: elderly patients with diagnosis of arterial hypertension according to the treating physician, controlled or uncontrolled systolic pressure of 140-159 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure of 90-99 mmHg and who meet at least one of the following: the patient does not know how to administer the medication correctly, does not understand the medication indications, does not have the medication in hand, does not need a new prescription, is not using the medication properly evidenced by the low prescription index and/or does not need to start a new medication or does not need to add or change the medication.
The sample size was calculated based on the prevalence of arterial hypertension among the elderly and considering significance of 5% and a statistical power of 80%, resulting in 135 patients. For the statistical analysis, inferential tests will be used and the normality of data will be assessed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.
Through this study, the investigators believe it is possible to strengthen pharmaceutical care and the use of telepharmacy in clinical practice in the elderly; contribute for health care teams and patients to have more alternatives with the best possible results that can be achieved with the tools available, making health care more rational and cost-saving; expand the knowledge about the effectiveness of telepharmacy in clinical outcomes of patients with arterial hypertension and evaluate the feasibility and acceptance by users."

ARDS is a condition associated with hypoxemia due to noncardiogenic causes with bilateral lung infiltrates on chest X-ray or CT imaging. ICU survival (30-day mortality rate) and 6 months mortality rate of survivors are higher than those of patients with sepsis. In other words, the mortality rate of ARDS is about 40%. Furthermore, the condition is associated with various disabilities, such as physical impairments, cognitive impairments, depression, anxiety, and PTSD. Patients with ARDS have many functional impairments even one year after discharge, and their ADL and QOL have also been impaired (Post Intensive Care Syndrome, PICS). Therefore, the development of effective strategies for patients with ARDS that take into account not only mortality but also functional prognosis is strongly needed. Recent studies have revealed that several treatments such as neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, noninvasive and invasive mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have improved outcomes, including mortality, in ARDS patients. However, the mortality rate of ARDS patients is about 40%. In addition, more than 50% of ARDS patients become PICS patients at 1 year after discharge. Recent studies have revealed that there are many factors that affect patients with ARDS after successful treatment such as ventilator weaning difficulty, pain, sedation, cognitive impairment, delirium, lack of patient activity during ICU stay and after ICU discharge . Adequate analgesia, sedation and rehabilitation in a prone position, SATs and SBTs have been reported to suppress the development of delirium, prevent long-term ventilator weaning difficulty, improve outcomes, and reduce the frequency of hospital admission. These are known as the ABCDEF bundle, and have been reported to improve outcomes of ICU patients, including ARDS patients worldwide. However, the implementation of the ABCDEF bundle in ICU patients, including ARDS patients, is too low. Patients with ARDS in ICU frequently receive mechanical ventilator therapy, and there are many reasons why the ABCDEF bundle cannot be applied: (1) Excessive sedation due to the use of sedatives and sedative antagonists (2) Excessive analgesia due to the use of opioids (3) Absolute bed rest for ventilation control (4) Routine use of muscle relaxants and benzodiazepine antagonists, (5) Use of restraints during ventilation control, and (6) Delay in SBT trials due to the risk of desaturation. As a result, the rate of complications such as delirium, ventilator weaning difficulties, and poor outcomes increases. Furthermore, there is insufficient evidence to determine the optimal content to be adopted in ABCDEF bundles for patients with ARDS, and the current results do not necessarily apply to all ICU patients. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the current epidemiology and treatment strategy given to the patients with ARDS after the recent epidemic event of new coronavirus, clarify the actual implementation rate of ICU care for ARDS patients who require ventilators at a high frequency, and evaluate how the implementation of evidence-based ICU care is associated with patient outcomes in order to assess the current status of ICU care for ARDS patients and improve the outcomes of ARDS patients worldwide.

Inclusion criteria: Patients on an invasive or non-invasive ventilator within 24 hours of ICU admission Patients who are expected to be on an invasive and/or non-invasive ventilator for more than 48 hours in total Patients who meet the diagnosis of ARDS according to the Berlin Definition within 24 hours of ICU admission Exclusion criteria: Patients who are younger than 16 years old Patients with terminal conditions at the time of ICU admission."

The consumption of two doses of the pomegranate extract Pomanox®P30 for 12 weeks improved significantly the skin melanin index but not the other hyperpigmentation indexes compared to control. The treatment with 700 mg of pomegranate extract Pomanox® showed a higher tendency to improvement in some of the indexes compared to the treatment with 367 mg. Pomanox®P30 improved the skin keratin and some of the characteristics related to the state of the skin such as elasticity, softness or shine. However, no correlations of all these parameters were found. Treatment with 700 mg of pomegranox®P30 was associated with a reduction in skin pore appearance compared to control. No significant changes in blood serum analysis or in the intestinal and skin microbiota were found."

Background: Gliomas are the most common cerebral tumors, constituting 33% of primary brain tumors. Among them, diffuse gliomas are a major public health problem. The classification of gliomas rests primarily on the histological aspect. In 2007, the World Health Organization published new classification criteria based on the genetic profiles of the tumors. The distinction between glioblastoma (GBM), anaplastic glioma (AGBM) and diffuse low-grade glioma (LGG) has become important. The identification of these genetic subtypes is based on the discovery and analysis of two biomarkers, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutation (gene) and 1p19q deletion (chromosome), responsible for the occurrence of glioma and metabolic modifications. IDH1/IDH2 mutations are associated with a better prognosis compared to IDH-wildtype (WT) tumors.
Objective: Describe 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) and cystahionine plasma concentrations measured by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) in patients with diffuse gliomas and to determine the impact of IDH mutational status (gene) on this. Then characterize for the first time the modifications of the choline MR signal and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in gliomas.
Eligibility criteria: Inclusion Criteria: Affiliation to a social security scheme (beneficiary or entitled) Signed consent informed and unanimous
Main exclusion criteria: Contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (IRM) Pace maker or stimulator neural, body foreign intraocular or intracerebral, cochlear implant, cardiac valve or vascular prosthesis incompatible maternal compatible with MR imaging, foreign metal body compatible with MR imaging, claustrophobia Pregnant or breastfeeding women Women of childbearing potential not using effective contraception Test of pregnancy in women of childbearing age (non-exclusion criterion).
Design and methodology: The study includes MRI examinations using MRS for the measurement of 2-HG, cystahionine plasma concentrations and DTI acquisition in 48 patients, including 36 newly-diagnosed tumors and 12 previously-treated tumors. Tumor progression will be objectified according to the criteria of the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) consortium. The results will be correlated with the results obtained from an analysis of the genetic profiles of the patients (IDH mutational status and 1p19q codeletion).
Statistical analyses: Normality of non-normally distributed data will be analyzed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Univariate and multivariate analyses will be performed using Student's t test, Wilcoxon (or Mann-Whitney) and Pearson chi-square test (or Fisher exact test).
Expected results: This study aim to evaluate 2-HG and cystahionine plasma concentrations in LGG and GBM patients. A high concentration of 2HG has previously been detected in patients with IDH mutation. We hypothesize that patients harboring the IDH mutation will have higher 2HG and cystahionine plasma concentrations as compared in patients without IDH mutation. Second objective is to highlight the changes of choline concentration and apparent diffusion coefficient in gliomas and the impact on their changes within the brain in correlation with the IDH mutation, 1p19q codeletion and treatment. This study will highlight how these noninvasive modalities could help the clinicians to predict and better differentiate these genetic subtypes and will be of great value in the stratification of populations for better management and therapies."

Beta-thalassemia is the most common genetic disorder worldwide, with an estimate of 180,000 patients in Turkey. The current medical protocol that can relieve many morbidities is the transfusion of erythrocytes (red blood cells) that contain hemoglobin. However, this treatment carries risks such as infections, iron overload, and iron deposition in the heart, liver, and pancreas. Hydroxyurea is widely used in the medical treatment of β-thalassemia patients, as it stimulates red blood cell formation in the bone marrow. Hydroxyurea has side effects such as myelosuppression, thrombosis, and teratogenicity. Since its use has been limited because of these side effects, new agents have been sought as a therapeutic option. Thalidomide is a drug that has been used successfully in the treatment of several neoplastic (cancer) conditions through the past few decades. There have been few reports on the therapeutic use of thalidomide with no adverse side effects in beta-thalassemia patients in the literature. This pilot trial is aimed at assessing long term tolerance and efficacy of combination thalidomide and hydroxyurea in beta-thalassemia patients and to test its effectiveness in relieving some of the morbidities related to the therapy, such as high transfusion requirements and iron overload."

The goal of this project is to create an application for virtual reality (VR) that uses an avatar to address poor prospective thinking skills in outpatients with stimulant use disorder (SUD). Impulsivity and related issues with delayed reward are associated with the development of early relapse. This research will test the effect of interacting with a virtual avatar on impulsivity and reward-related behavior to aid in the prevention of early relapse.
The study will be conducted at the Clinical Neuroscience Division (CND), which is an outpatient, academic facility located in the Brain Institute at UCLA. Subjects will be adults (age: 18-65) who meet criteria for current stimulant use disorder (SUD) and meet criteria for at least one additional psychiatric disorder (e.g., mood disorders, anxiety, etc.). In addition, subjects will be in outpatient programs of addiction medicine and/or psychoeducation and psychotherapy with a UCLA provider for a minimum of one month prior to initiation of the study and will receive these services for the duration of the study. This is a behavioral, phase-not-applicable study that will have two study arms (Experimental: Virtual Reality Avatar, Placebo Comparator: Treatment as usual). Participants will be randomized to receive the Virtual Reality Avatar experience.
Specific Aim #1: Use VR avatars to promote prospective thinking skills. The aim of this research is to use a novel VR approach to improve prospective thinking. By interacting with a virtual avatar, the intervention will target and train impulsive responses that have been shown to lead to relapse through improved planning of future events. This study will evaluate the impact of this intervention on prospective thinking skills, delay of reward decisions, and addiction-related health outcomes.
Study #2: Test the utility and cost-effectiveness of VR interventions to improve prospective thinking skills in SUD patients. This research will test if using this avatar-based intervention can be used and implemented in the clinical setting to aid in patient recovery. In summary, studies like this are essential to develop VR interventions that can be used in outpatient or inpatient settings for SUD patients."

Hematopoietic progenitor cell transplantation from haplo-identical donors remains the only available treatment for patients with hematological disease refractory or relapsed after standard chemotherapy.
Unfortunately, this treatment is often complicated by significant side effects. The main risk involved is the occurrence of Graft vs Host Disease (GVHD), an adverse event whose severity and toxicity are often increased with a haploidentical donor.
To prevent or attenuate GVHD, various strategies have been tried, with encouraging results. Among them, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) are among the most promising.
The aim of this study is to study the effect of injection of Wharton's Juxta-Chorionic membrane-derived Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (WJ-MSC) to prevent or attenuate acute and chronic GVHD in patients undergoing a non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from a haplo-identical donor. To define the optimal therapeutic dose of this treatment, three dose levels are proposed: 1.5x106, 3x106 and 10x106 WJ-MSC/kg (250ml) of patient body weight for three successive injections each 72 hours. For the first time, this study offers the possibility to define the optimal therapeutic dose of WJ-MSCs in this indication. This study aims to assess the feasibility, toxicity and efficacy of WJ-MSC in preventing or attenuating acute and chronic GVHD."

Background: Clinical deterioration occurs in approximately 5% of hospitalized adults. Delays in recognition of deterioration heighten the risk of adverse outcomes. Machine learning algorithms enhance clinical decision-making and can improve the quality of patient care. However, their impact on clinical outcomes depends not only on the sensitivity and specificity of the algorithm but also on how well that algorithm is integrated into provider workflows and facilitates timely and appropriate intervention. Preliminary Data: eCART has been built upon more than a decade of ongoing scientific research and chronicled in numerous peer-reviewed publications. eCART was developed at the University of Chicago by Drs. Dana Edelson and Matthew Churpek. The first version (eCARTv1) was derived and validated using linear logistic regression in a dataset of nearly 60,000 adult ward patients from a single medical center. That model had 16 variables in it and was subsequently validated in silent mode, demonstrating that eCART could alert clinicians more than 24 hours in advance of ICU transfer or cardiac arrest. eCARTv2, derived and validated in a dataset of nearly 270,000 patients from 5 hospitals, improved upon the earlier version by utilizing a cubic spline logistic regression model with 27 variables and demonstrated improved accuracy over the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), a commonly used score that can be hand- calculations by nurses at the bedside (AUC 0.77 vs. 0.70 for cardiac arrest, ICU transfer or death). In a multicenter clinical implementation study, eCARTv2 was associated with a 29% relative risk reduction for mortality. In further development of eCART, the University of Chicago research team demonstrated that upgrading from a cubic spline model to a machine learning model, such as a random forest or gradient boosted machine (GBM), could increase the AUC. In the most recent development - eCART v5 - the research team has advanced the analytic using a gradient boosted machine learning model trained on a multi-center dataset of more than 800,000 patient records. Now with 97 variables, this more sophisticated model increases the accuracy by which clinicians can predict clinical deterioration.

This proposal is to rapidly deploy a clinical decision support tool (eCARTv5) within the electronic health record of multiple medical-surgical units. eCART combines a real-time machine learning algorithm for identifying patients at increased risk for critical illness or death with clinical pathways to standardize the care of these patients based on a real-time, quantitative assessment of patient risk. The investigators hypothesize that implementing such a tool will be associated with a decrease in critical illness resource utilization, such as ICU length of stay, ventilator usage, and mortality among high-risk patients. This project will enable the investigators to test the clinical impact of eCARTv5 on clinically important outcomes, including mortality, length of stay, and ventilator use. The investigators also plan to describe the cost-effective of eCARTv5 implementation and to analyze barriers and facilitators to widespread implementation of new machine learning algorithms in the EHR.

Objectives: Primary Objectives: 
1. To implement eCARTv5 and other standard-of-care tools for identifying and managing clinical deterioration in patients admitted to participating hospitals, to test the clinical value of this tool in reducing critical resource utilization and improving clinically relevant outcomes.
2. To analyze barriers and facilitators to implementation in a multi-center setting and to estimate the cost savings from eCARTv5 implementation.

Eligibility: Patients admitted to participating medical-surgical units, who are 18 or older, will be eligible for inclusion in the eCART intervention.

Design: This will be a multi-center, observational study with a parallel assignment study design. All participating hospitals will have eCARTv5 deployed using a standardized ""train-validate"" methodology in the electronic health record.

Data Analysis: The primary analysis will be an intention to treat analysis comparing the pre vs. post-implementation data. It will focus on differences between the pre-implementation and post-implementation cohorts within the intervention hospitals, as well as the differences in outcomes between the pre- versus post-cohorts at control hospitals that do not implement eCARTv5. This will limit the analysis to patients who were ever elevated by the tool (patients were considered to have been elevated as long as they ever had an eCART elevation score of 6, 7,"

Mother's depression is the most common complication of the perinatal period affecting 10-15% of mothers. It negatively impacts maternal and infant outcomes and disrupts family functioning. AA women have a poorer healthcare experience and lower healthcare utilization compared to Caucasian women. A structured intervention focused on fathers who are the most direct influence on the family's adaptation and health can help supplement and support individual treatment for mother's depression. Moreover, the fathers can alleviate the mother's socio-environmental stressors. This pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) is designed to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of the ASSET-PPD intervention to improve maternal and infant health outcomes with the goal of promoting breastfeeding and parent-infant secure attachment in the African American population. Participants will be cohabitating or non-cohabitating fathers with AA mothers receiving individual depression treatment. Mothers will complete measures of depression, anxiety, parenting, perceived social support and other measures at baseline and 1, 3, and 6 months. Fathers who are assigned to participate in the 6-module intervention will complete a measure of depression, anxiety, stress, interparental communication, coparenting relationships, fathers' parenting self-efficacy and parenting stress before and after the intervention. We predict that fathers assigned to the intervention group (n=25) will provide better mental health and parenting skills support and show greater improvements in depression, anxiety, stress, interparental and coparenting relationships relative to the fathers not receiving the intervention (n=25). In addition, mothers in the ASSET-PPD group will be better adjusted and less depressed at 3- and 6-month follow-up. Based on the previous evidence, our preliminary goal for the current study is to enroll 100 participants and retain 70% or higher of eligible dyads. The results of this pilot RCT will be used to design a larger follow-up study to evaluate more robust treatment effects."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors face frequent emotional distress due to cancer diagnosis, treatments, and ongoing survivorship period. Identifying unmet psychosocial needs at the time of cancer diagnosis and survivorship care is important as it helps address psychosocial needs as early as possible and before problems escalate. Screening for depressive symptoms is critical to identify those who may benefit from additional clinical support or referral to mental health specialists.
Moodivate, a mobile app, utilizes a behavioral activation treatment approach and is being evaluated for its effectiveness in treating depressive symptoms among CRC survivors. Moodivate supports participants in identifying values and meaningful activities, provides guidance for completing activities, monitors progress on goals, and prompts reflections on mood throughout the day. Moodivate also connects users to social support from caregivers, friends or family, and to mental health specialists.
The study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a proactive depression screening process to systematically identify CRC survivors and deliver the Moodivate treatment to those with self-reported depressive symptoms. We also aim to evaluate participant interest and acceptance of the Moodivate app. Additionally, the study strives to compare the feasibility and outcomes of using Moodivate for mood management among those with depressive symptoms to usual care."

Objectives of the Study: The goal of this project is to retrospectively test the ability of computable algorithms to detect insulin suspension, simulating a fault related to insulin pump malfunction or failure. This goal is part of a larger effort of improving the safety of current artificial-pancreas systems. Our algorithm will be tested in real cases documented by the study team.
Methods: The study consists of three phases:
Phase 1: Preliminary Data Collection (Free-living data) In this phase, data related to glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions are collected from the patient's automatic insulin delivery system. This data is obtained from a download form the patient's artificial pancreas. The one-month session is designed to gather a substantial amount of patient-specific data to enable the algorithms to learn how insulin and meals affect the patient's glycemia as recorded by the CGM sensor.
Phase 2: Induction of Hyperglycemia The second phase involves the patient visiting the clinic, where, according to a specific protocol and a defined schedule, insulin infusion is temporarily suspended to simulate a pump malfunction. The resulting episode of hyperglycemia is closely monitored under medical supervision. At the end of the experiment, the study team assists the patient in restoring euglycemia before returning home.
Phase 3: Retrospective Data Analysis In this phase, the collected data is retrospectively analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in detecting insulin suspension, simulating a pump malfunction. The sensitivity of the tested methods is assessed as the fraction of insulin suspensions (simulating a malfunction) correctly detected by the algorithm. 
The uniqueness of this dataset lies in the controlled induction of malfunction, achieved by disconnecting the insulin pump and monitoring the resulting hyperglycemic episode. The presence of malfunctions in this data is certain and precisely characterized in terms of the start time and duration. The dataset resulting from this experimentation will be a valuable tool for the scientific community, enabling the retrospective testing of fault detection algorithms."

PMS is a debilitating condition that affects 80% of women in menstruating age. Premenstrual symptoms can negatively affect a woman's quality of life; these include depression, mood swings, irritability, fatigue, bloating, pain, and/or acne. Current treatments, such as exercise, diet modification, and hormonal treatments, have been shown to have limited efficacy. Therefore, many women are seeking alternative and safe forms of PMS relief.
Several research studies have discovered the use of herbal remedies - some containing anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and/or anxiolytic properties - as effective alternatives to treat PMS. While some are available in tablet or capsule form, many people prefer a daily snack to consume these remedies.
Ginger and cinnamon both contain anti-inflammatory properties, making them ideal to reduce menstrual pain associated with PMS. Acai berry, ginkgo, goji berry, and pomegranate are shown to have high levels of antioxidants, which may help reduce oxidation stress, one of the primary causes of acne. Lastly, Funk It Cycle bites contain a few other ingredients that can provide additional benefits. These snack bites have potential to treat several aspects of PMS, such as menstrual cramps and hormonal acne, without any side effects.
Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of taking Funk It Cycle Bites (a non-prescription, plant-based herbal snack) over the course of 4 months on symptoms related to premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in menstruating women. Hypothesis: Funk It Cycle Bites will significantly reduce the severity of PMS-related symptoms.
Design: This will be an open-label, single participant group study and participants will consume 1 Cycle Bite per day for 4 months. At the beginning of each menstrual cycle, participants will complete a survey that will assess their PMS-related symptoms, energy levels, mood stability, acne, and overall experience with the product.
Expected outcome: It is expected that participants will report improvements in these areas by the end of the study. Specifically, we anticipate participants experiencing a 25% reduction in PMS-related symptoms.

Childhood caries is one of the highly prevalent chronic diseases in children aged 2 to 5 years, which affect mainly the primary teeth. It is a serious public health issue that results in considerable pain, impaired growth and development along with poor quality of life for the children. Caries is a complex multifactorial disease caused by biological, behavioral, environmental and microbiological factors. A high rate of caries in Jordanian children has been observed in previous studies that emphasized the growing problem of early childhood caries that have significant implications on public health worldwide and in Jordan. Therefore, the aim of this study 1) is to report the prevalence of early childhood caries in children attending kindergartens in Jordan and its associated risk factors, and 2) to determine the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride (SDF) as a caries control material for children suffering from early childhood caries and its acceptance among parents of children with ECC. 2) Objectives of the study: 1. To determine the prevalence of early childhood caries and its associated risk factors. 2. To evaluate the effectiveness of silver diamine fluoride in caries control of children suffering from ECC. 3. To assess parental acceptance of SDF in a sample of randomized controlled trial. 4. To evaluate the long-term sustainability of the application of SDF in children with early childhood caries over an extended period of 1 year. 5. To determine the cost effectiveness of SDF as a caries control material for children experiencing early childhood caries. 6. To provide a strong foundation for implementing an ECC prevention program in Jordan. This study proposed a cross-sectional epidemiological design for obtaining data for a) prevalence of early childhood caries b) early childhood caries risk factors and c) early childhood caries prevention via single application of SDF and its long term sustainability. Consecutive sampling method was used as children were selected from kindergartens that represent different social and economic classes. Data collection was achieved through administration of questionnaires that covered basic demographic, socio-economic, social and behavioral questions on children and their parent. A total of 847 children were examined to detect incidence and prevalence of early childhood caries in Jordanian children. A number of 159 children (18.9%) were detected to have early childhood caries and were randomly assigned into a sample of a randomized controlled trial to receive SDF. These children were examined after 1 year to assess long-term caries control, caries arrest and parental satisfaction."

The Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a common cause of severe lower respiratory tract infections, especially among older adults. Although these patients are at increased risk of death and disability, there are limited treatment options available, and the best prevention strategy remains unclear. Vaccination is the most promising risk reduction approach, but the evidence for effectiveness is limited.
This study investigates the effectiveness of the ABRYSVO vaccine against RSV in older adults in a real-world setting. As one of the largest investigations to date on RSV vaccine effectiveness, this retrospective study will provide valuable insights to inform future prevention strategies and help better protect high-risk populations from severe RSV-related respiratory infections.
To conduct the study, the Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) Research Program will utilize electronic health data, including members' medical records, laboratory test results, and administrative data on reimbursement and utilization. The investigators will include 400,000+ KPSC members who are 65 years or older, who received the ABRYSVO vaccine between 2014 and 2022, and who had at least 1 year of membership prior to end of study period. This population allows the investigators to gather critical information about vaccine utilization and impact in a real-world setting.
The study will take place from 2015 to 2024 and will fall into two phases: Phase 1 and Phase 2. To identify potential cases (RSV-related LRTI hospitalizations), the investigators will use administrative claims data, while also collecting clinical data to confirm RSV testing and positive results.
To describe vaccine utilization, study investigators will focus on members' use of ABRYSVO, its timing (e.g., preseason vs. postseason) and frequency (e.g., once, twice, incomplete series, or never).
The key outcome of effectiveness will be based on the Test Negative Design (TND). TND combines a case-control study (CCS) with data from medical records, testing, and administrative claims. The TND will be conducted from November 1st of each study year (e.g., 2016 for 2016-2017 study season) until May 31st of the next year (e.g., May 31, 2017 for 2016-2017 study season) in 2 phases. The first phase will assess RSV-related lower respiratory tract infection hospitalizations during the 2016-2017 study season, and the second phase will assess these same events during the 2017-2018 study season.
We will also conduct an additional prospective cohort study (PCS), using KPSC medical record data and administrative claims data. The PCS will estimate the vaccine effectiveness against all-cause outcomes (hospitalizations and ED visits) to further describe the clinical impact of ABRYSVO outside of the traditional definition of LRTI.
Through this study framework, our team will provide estimates of vaccine effectiveness by studying: a) ABRYSVO-vaccinated vs. non-vaccinated members, b) the overall incidence of RSV-related ARI and LRTI for members at high risk vs. low risk, c) ABRYSVO safety and effectiveness across key demographic subgroups (e.g., frailty, comorbidity, age, sex, race, seasonality), and d) member characteristics that will inform future studies."

Music therapy is a non-pharmaceutical strategy that improves anxiety in several pathologies, and may help alleviate the anxiety and other related symptoms experienced by cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Despite its many advantages, the use and assessment of music therapy for anxiety reduction in the pathology of breast cancer has not been studied. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of music therapy on anxiety in breast cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. 
The protocol is a monocentric randomized, controlled and non-blind study. It is composed of three study arms: an arm of standard care (control group) and two arms respectively with music therapy before the first 3 sessions of chemotherapy (arm 1) and before the first session and before the end of chemotherapy (arm 2). The evaluation of the impact of music therapy includes biomedical evaluations (blood count, albumin, blood chemistry, and blood pressure) as well as the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for anxiety evaluation, questionnaires measuring quality of life and other symptoms, and interviews.
The hypothesis tested is that, in comparison to standard care, the effectiveness of music therapy to alleviate anxiety in cancer patients undergoing adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy is measured primarily by the reduction in anxiety in patients included in the study and offered music therapy."

A total of 179 patients with SAA received transplants, which was divided into two groups according to the different conditioning regimens. The Busulfan included group (Group A, n=88) included patients with high risk factors of mixed chimerism (age < 18 years old or pre-transplant ferritin level ≥2500ng/ml) received conditioning regimen with Busulfan and a total dose of 13.2 mg/kg (ranging from 12 to 14.2 mg/kg).The control group (Group B, n=91) includes patients with low risk factors of mixed chimerism received conditioning regimen with Flu/Cy/ATG or Cy/ATG, depending on the patient's risk factors of regimen related cardiotoxicity.The transplantation related toxicity, myeloid and platelet engraftment, incidence of mixed donors, incidence of CMV and EBV reactivation, incidence of graft versus host disease, and overall survival were evaluated by Kaplan Meier method and a two-sided log-rank test.The 1-year progression-free survival was 69%, 70% for CMT group and Busulfan group respectively (p=0.760).The 1-year overall survival was 81% for CMT group and Busulfan group respectively (p=0.653).The 1-year incidence of CMV and EBV reactivation was higher in Busulfan included group comparing with the control group (p=0.018).The transplantation related toxicity and graft versus host disease are similar between two groups (p=0.772, 0.978).In conclusion, the regimen with Busulfan and a total dose of 13.2 mg/kg could reduce the incidence of graft failure. The incidence of CMV and EBV reactivation was higher in Busulfan included group comparing with the control group. The myeloid and platelet engraftment were similar between transplantation group and control group.The results indicated that the conditioning with Flu/Cy/ATG in patients with low risk factors of mixed chimerism might be the preferential choice for HSCT in SAA."

Hemophilia A (HA) is classified as a mild, moderate severity, or severe congenital bleeding disorder due to a deficiency of factor VIII (FVIII). People with HA are at risk of experiencing bleeding episodes (of which about one third are joint bleeds), which can be a frequent occurrence. The introduction of Emicizumab Prophylaxis (EP) has been shown in Phase III studies of Hemophilia A (Coagulation Factor VIII Substitute-Bleeding [HEMO-Hemostatic Assessment, FXIII and Von Willebrand] Factor [FIX] Clinics Bleeding [FIXCAB] and Hemophilia European Research Society (HERS) Harmonization Study 7) and Phase 4 (Trial in adults with haemophilia treated in a real-world setting prior to prophylaxis), to decrease the frequency of bleeding episodes. Factor VIII (FVIII) activity was assessed at the beginning of the study as a measure of deficiency to help determine the severity of the condition.
In this study, Emicizumab Prophylaxis (EP) is being used as a treatment for a minimum of one year. This study will describe the safety and tolerability of switching from EP to fitusiran prophylaxis.

A total of 30 participants are planned to be enrolled in this study, which is an expansion from the planned randomized study population of 6 participants to address recent guidance from Health Canada. A subgroup of participants (n = 15) may also be enrolled during a separate dose expansion cohort period if they have previously participated in a fitusiran trial. The participant group/arm is a single treatment arm. The participants are adults aged ≥18 years with severe HA, regardless of their inhibitor status.
Procedures
Participants will receive on demand or prophylactic treatment with intravenous clotting factor concentrates (IV CFCs) or bypassing agents (BPAs) from Month -2 until Day 1. Starting on Day 1, participants will receive subcutaneous (SC) fitusiran prophylaxis once every 2 months (scQ2M) or once monthly (scQM) for 1 year from Day 1 until Month 18 + up to 14 months of extension period (Month 22). Fitusiran dosing period: From Day 1 until Month 18 of fitusiran treatment. Upon clinical need, participants may receive IV antithrombin concentrate (ATIIIC) during the fitusiran treatment regimen. Participants will be followed up until at least 60% of the pre-fitusiran AT levels are achieved (per Central Laboratory).
During this study participants will be followed up for 1 year to evaluate the safety and tolerability of switching from EP to fitusiran prophylaxis. Participants may receive a single dose of fitusiran (1,000 mg) to assess the safety and tolerability of fitusiran as an extension to the study. Subsequently the participants will be monitored after switching to fitusiran. The study will also assess the incidence of treated bleeds during the fitusiran treatment regimen; the severity of bleeding as measured by the Hemorrhagic Episode Assessment; the change in bleeding tendency over a time frame of 1 year, while receiving fitusiran prophylaxis; the change in hemophilia-related health outcomes over the study period, and the impact of switching to fitusiran on participants' quality of life, overall treatment satisfaction, pain intensity, and physical functioning. Following the completion of the fitusiran treatment regimen, participants will receive standard of care (SoC) treatment practices, which include receiving prophylactic treatment with FVIII or BPAs until the bleeding tendency is assessed to be insignificant or at pre-fitusiran levels, or 60% of the pre-fitusiran values have been observed during follow-up. For participants who do not have sufficient pre-fitusiran AT, SoC follow-up will also include receiving IV ATIIIC upon clinical need to help maintain AT levels until the bleeding tendency is assessed to be insignificant and no more than 66% AT levels are observed during follow-up.
Potential Risks and Side Effects: Based on the study, fitusiran prophylaxis was associated with bleeding tendencies and decreased von Willebrand factor function,"

The objective of this study is to translate and determine the validity and reliability of the Malay version of PDQ (PDQ-M) to screen patients with chronic pain, following the standard rules for cross cultural adaptation and validation.
Study Population: 40 male and female patients with neuropathic or nociceptive pain who meet the inclusion criteria of the study will be recruited from the tertiary pain center in Prince Of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong and National University Hospital, Singapore.
Study Design: In this cross sectional study, data of 40 patients will be collected and analyzed at once instead of separately by condition (neuropathic pain or nociceptive pain) and/or study phase.
Procedure: Patients with neuropathic or nociceptive pain diagnosed by clinicians will complete an initial questionnaire comprising 3 sections: socio-demographic data, PDQ-M and NRS. In the beginning of questionnaire administration, an information sheet will be given to all patient to encourage them in asking the investigator questions.
Inclusion Criteria: Patients who are male or female, aged ≥18 years, diagnosed to have neuropathic or nociceptive pain by clinician, stable disease condition, pain duration of at least 4 weeks. Exclusion Criteria: Acute illness, poor mental health status that prevents them from understanding or responding to the proposed questions. Subjects with cultural or language barrier in understanding the questions/instructions.
Design: Study was planned for neuropathic pain group and nociceptive pain group simultaneously. Each group will have 20 participants. Therefore, the total number of participants is 40 (20 in each group which is divided into 10 male and female).
Power Analysis: Based on previous studies, the sample size is 40 patients, which will be sufficient to establish the reliability of the PDQ-M.
Statistical Methods: For data analysis, data will be stored on a secure computer and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Science (SPSS) software version 18. Normality of the numerical data will be analyzed using Kolmogorov-Smirnov's test. Paired sample T-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be employed where appropriate. Spearman's rank correlation test will be used to examine the relationships between the PDQ-M score, NRS and socio-demographic data. Cronbach's Alpha and Intra Class Correlation Coefficient (ICC) will be calculated to assess the reliability of PDQ-M.
Expected Results: It is expected that the translation and validation process of the PDQ-M questionnaire will result in the PDQ-M questionnaire being an efficient tool to assess the level of neuropathic pain in participants with chronic pain. 
Public Health Implication: The use of PDQ-M questionnaire in patients seeking medical service in hospitals or clinics, can provide effective tool in screening patients with neuropathic pain to assist clinicians during the consultation. 
Ethical Approval: This study has received full ethical approval from the Prince Of Wales Hospital, Hong Kong and National University Hospital, Singapore. 
Confidentiality: Confidentiality of the data collected will be maintained at all times. Data will be processed by the Principal Investigator and research team. Results of the research will be summarized in abstract, tables and figures and will not contain any information that can be easily traced to specific individuals."

The liver is one of the vital organs in the body. It plays a crucial role in metabolism and detoxification. The liver has excellent reserve and functional capacity so diseases affecting the liver develop slowly and are generally slowly progressive. These changes may be so subtle that they can exist for years before being recognized. Acute liver disease (ALD) is defined as the presence of clinical jaundice accompanied by coagulopathy and altered liver enzymes. The main complications of ALD are hepatic encephalopathy and variceal bleeding.
Severe acute liver disease (SALD) is an umbrella term which includes acute liver failure (ALF) and acute on chronic liver disease (ACLF). ALF is defined by the presence of jaundice, coagulopathy and altered liver enzymes in a patient with no history of chronic liver disease. ACLF is the presence of jaundice, coagulopathy and altered liver enzymes in a patient with known chronic liver disease. ALF is a syndrome with a poor prognosis, a high mortality rate and limited or poor treatment options.
In-hospital and early six-month all-cause mortality rate in ALF is 70-80%.
The liver acts as a detoxifier to remove drugs from the body, in patients with poor liver function such patients are susceptible to adverse effects from drugs.
Studies have shown the effect of the use of prophylactic lactulose and rifaximin administration on the incidence of hepatic encephalopathy in the first days in patients presenting with ALF or acute on chronic liver disease.
The objective of this study will be:
• To determine the causes of ALD.
• To determine the complications of ALD in intensive care unit (ICU).
• To find the 30-day mortality rate.
• To assess the prognostic accuracy of models of mortality rate in ALD patients.

Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is clinically reversed for endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients to avoid delayed neurologic sequelae. However, it is unclear which NMB reversal method results in faster time for neurological assessment, which is important to avoid delayed neurological sequelae. This study aims to investigate the effects of using sugammadex for the reversal of NMB compared to using neostigmine, which is the current standard of care, for the time of onset of neurological assessment after endotracheal intubation in critically ill patients. This study will be conducted as a prospective, randomised, observer-blinded pilot study.

Inclusion Criteria:
Adult patients 19 years of age or older who are intubated after admission to the intensive care unit

Exclusion Criteria:

Endometrial cancer is the 5th most common cancer in reproductive-aged women. In some instances, women with endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer may undergo a hysterectomy, which affects fertility and leads to a decrease in the quality of life. There is a significant unmet need to identify effective, non-surgical treatments for these women to preserve fertility. The investigators aim to determine if a telemedicine cognitive behavioral weight loss intervention improves uterine preservation and results in better outcomes in women with endometrial hyperplasia or grade 1 endometrial cancer."

Athletes' psychological problems after serious injuries have been studied extensively in the last decade. In particular, psychological problems resulting from sports injuries such as anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) can delay physical recovery, affect the quality of rehabilitation, and eventually lead to problems or reinjuries in returning to sports. Re-injury anxiety, poor rehabilitation adherence, poor rehabilitation self-efficacy, and kinesiophobia are the most important psychological problems encountered in this research. Although various interventions have been proposed for the resolution of these problems, structured intervention protocol has not been presented yet. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of the Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) protocol enriched with virtual reality (VR) usage for the solution of psychological problems that arise after ACL operation. It is thought that a holistic protocol including virtual intervention that is tested for the first time in the literature and will be a novel contribution to the psychological problem arising from sports. In the study, which is planned as a 4X5 mixed factorial design model (groupsXmeasures) in a randomized control trial framework, the athletes will be filled with psychological assessment scales in order to collect the first data within the first week of entering physical therapy after surgery. The CBT+VR protocol, which includes 10 sessions in total once a week, will be applied to the athletes in both the experimental groups and the first intervention group. In the second intervention group, only the behavioral intervention part of the protocol will be applied in the VR environment. The CBT protocol will be applied without a VR environment for the third intervention group. In all the intervention groups and the control group, 5 sessions in total once a week will be applied. In addition to the scales to be filled by the athletes, the biofeedback system will be used to record the increase or decrease in anxiety levels in the VR environment at the end of the research."

The role of physical therapists in acute care hospitals in patients' post-acute care is currently inadequate. To improve this system, the investigators have developed a patient-level decision support tool, the Physical Therapy Frequency Clinical Decision Support Tool (PT-PENCIL) that facilitates referrals for physical therapy by identifying patients who may benefit from daily physical therapy sessions. The trial will assess the effect and feasibility of using this tool to predict risk versus benefit of physical therapy services.
A hybrid 24-week, stepped-wedge, patient-oriented randomized controlled trial with three phases, is being conducted: enrollment (Weeks 1-2), 24 weeks of implementation (Week 3-24), and follow up (week 24-26). During the enrollment and implementation periods, patients hospitalized on the participating units and meeting inclusion criteria will be eligible for enrollment. Only the inpatient physical therapist assigned to the patient care team responsible for the patient will have access to these data to guide their referral for physical therapy.
All inpatient physical therapists and patient referral sources including attending physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants will be eligible to participate in the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility measures. During the follow up period, a control cohort of patients with similar clinical characteristics to those treated with the PT-PENCIL during the trial will be examined to determine the effect of having the PT-PENCIL and BPA alerts available in the electronic health record.
The primary goal of this study is to show that the PT-PENCIL reduces the percentage of patients discharged to post-acute care rehabilitation at the 24-week mark. The secondary goals include testing the feasibility and acceptability of the trial and documenting the effect and feasibility of the system outside the study environment."

Background: The elbow being a highly constrained synovial hinge joint has a high propensity for degeneration and stiffness. There could be functional losses seen with even less severe loss of range of motion (ROM) at the elbow. The stiff or contracted elbow is defined as an elbow with a reduction in extension greater than 30 degrees, and/or a flexion less than 120 degrees. Although supination and pronation are often reduced as well, this will not be considered further as contracture of the elbow is not related to forearm rotation.
Objectives: The aim of this study is to establish whether there is any difference between the Maitland mobilization and the Post facilitation stretch in improving functional outcomes such as ROM and pain in post-traumatic stiff elbow patients.
Methods: This study was a randomized, controlled trial, conducted among post-traumatic stiff elbow patients. Sample size was 32 by using G Power Calculator. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group after a baseline assessment with a lottery ticket and an opaque envelope. All participants in both groups were evaluated on two occasions: (i) baseline (ii) After 4 weeks of intervention.
Results: The results of this study suggest that in the immediate terms, there is no difference between Post Facilitation Stretch and Maitland Mobilisation in terms of ROM and Pain in post-traumatic stiff elbow patients. In the long-term both the techniques can be utilized in clinical practice.
Conclusion: This is the first study of its kind, to establish whether there is any difference between the Maitland mobilization and the Post facilitation stretch in improving ROM and pain in post-traumatic stiff elbow patients.
Clinical Applications: This study provides new information to the clinician on the different interventions available to restore the ROM in post-traumatic stiff elbow patients. It was seen that PFS and MM has different immediate effects both in terms of ROM and pain. Further studies with a larger sample size are required for its conclusive results."

High-risk cardiovascular patients frequently go unrecognised and the diagnosis of heart failure is made late. We anticipate that the introduction of new cardiovascular risk factor assessments and the use of hand-held echocardiography with artificial intelligence (AI-echo), will improve the early detection of heart failure and optimise the use of guideline directed therapy.

The use of intravenous fluids is crucial in maintaining adequate volume status. However, the mechanisms by which intravenous fluids improve haemodynamic variables are often unpredictable. Recently, the use of LBNP as a model of central hypovolemia has been reintroduced. LBNP has been used for more than half a century and has been shown to be a good model for studying hypovolemia in human participants. However, there are few studies comparing volume effects following intravenous fluid bolus in LBNP compared to baseline. We therefore aim to compare two types of intravenous fluids following the use of LBNP. Intravenous fluids are necessary to ensure adequate extracellular volume status, however it is less known which type of fluid that best ensure rapid adequate volume expansion.
We have shown in our previous work that the use of LBNP (1 liter) reduces intravascular volume compared to baseline in healthy male volunteers, and the reduction is larger without intravenous fluids (no intravenous fluids) compared to the group with continuous Ringer´s Acetate infusion. Based on our previous findings we will conduct this randomized clinical trial to explore which type of fluid (Ringer´s Acetate) that best ensure adequate hemodynamic response during experimental central hypovolemia."

Perioperative pain is defined as pain from the time of surgery and before discharge or discontinue of analgesic. Perioperative pain requires a combination of analgesia and a method of analgesia to reduce opioid use to prevent postoperative nausea, vomiting and constipation. Ultrasound-guided interfascial plane block/erector spinal plane/lidocaine anesthesia has become the focus of research in postoperative analgesia, which is beneficial to reducing opioid use and other adverse reactions of systemic analgesics. However, there is still no strong recommendation for them. A series of clinical trials found that the incidence of adverse reactions of these three methods are not significantly improved compared with lidocaine anesthesia. Based on the above, this study mainly focuses on the application of three interventions in perioperative analgesia, and compares their effects on perioperative analgesia, postoperative complications and satisfaction of patients, and to provide scientific support for clinical analgesic techniques."

In some populations, pulse oximeters' readings may be inaccurate due to skin pigmentation variations. The investigators' novel device, the Wearable Melanin-Adjusted Biological Oximetry Sensor (MABOS), was developed to address this issue. It is a pulse oximeter that compensates for skin pigmentation variations of up to 10 shades of skin tone and could, in turn, save lives. The device has been granted clearance by the U.S. FDA. It is crucial to assess the device's safety, comfort, and accuracy. There is the chance that the device could harm participants, cause discomfort or not be effective. Therefore, this study aims to assess the safety of our novel pulse oximeter, including the possibility of causing discomfort or rashes, as well as its accuracy. The investigators will conduct the feasibility study in healthy individuals with differing levels of skin tone, such as those with skin tones associated with those of African or East Asian descent. Healthy individuals, defined as those with no significant medical illnesses and/or medications that would interfere with the study, will be recruited. Following approval of the study by the Institutional Review Board, participants will be asked for verbal consent and then asked to complete two surveys: one regarding safety/comfort and another regarding accuracy/performance. They will be informed that they have the option to quit, should they choose not to continue. To determine the effect of the device on skin integrity, participants will wear both the novel pulse oximeter and the FDA-approved device simultaneously on the same finger(s). Participants will not receive any personal benefit from this study, only possible satisfaction through an active effort towards a worthy, non-profit goal."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurs in approximately 10% of pregnancies, and postpartum persistence of hyperglycemia is reported in about a quarter of patients with impaired glucose tolerance at 6 weeks to 4 or 6 months postpartum. However, there is no clear understanding of the pathogenesis pathways of hyperglycemia or the mechanisms by which GDM increases the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) postpartum. This study attempted to establish a method to identify hyperglycemic women with GDM at high risk of postpartum abnormal glucose metabolism by performing a metabolomics analysis with lipidomics, amino acidomics, and glycerolomics. This is the first study to comprehensively analyze the differences in lipids, amino acids, and glycerol in the serum of GDM patients and non-GDM pregnant women. Additionally, the researchers searched for markers with significant statistical differences and strong correlations with postpartum abnormal glucose metabolism. In addition, the results are verified by a large number of data: 24-28 weeks of pregnancy or delivery, the results are verified by follow-up of 6-12 weeks. The results showed that the lipid profile, amino acid profile, and glycerol profile at 24-28 weeks of pregnancy were significantly correlated with the 2-hour blood glucose standard in OGTT at 6-12 weeks postpartum. These abnormalities can be used as early warning indicators for GDM at high risk of abnormal glucose metabolism. This study provides new ideas and research methods for the prevention and intervention of postpartum type 2 diabetes mellitus in women with gestational diabetes mellitus."

Patients hospitalized in intensive care unit are frequently interrupted during their sleep by procedures or by caregivers interventions which disturb their physiological sleep process and induce fatigue and adverse outcomes including delirium, myopathy, metabolic disorders and even death. Sleep disturbances of these patients lead to poor outcomes. The purpose of this project is to evaluate the feasibility and interest of a new method of sleep management by continuous EEG registration in critically ill patients in the medical intensive care unit (MICU) of the University Hospital of Tours. Patients may benefit from an algorithm that allows to differentiate sleep states from care needs and to provide non urgent cares when the patient is asleep and urgent care according to medical needs when the patient is either asleep or active but not under sedation. The primary objective is the improvement of sleep quality in this specific population by protecting sleep. Secondary objectives are the prevention of delirium, the improvement of weaning time from mechanical ventilation, the reduction of workload for caregivers and the improvement of patient compliance and satisfaction. The primary hypothesis is: ""In comparison with control condition, EEG guided sleep prioritization scheme will improve sleep quality of critically ill patients"". If it is confirmed, we will use this technique in daily patient management. Another hypothesis is that it may promote less anxiety."

The MaGIA IBC test is a qualitative rapid test designed for capillary but has been successfully adapted to veinous blood, serum and plasma. Such an adaptation could facilitate and improve the screening of HIV, HBV and HCV. Aims: To perform a monocentric, descriptive study in order to evaluate the performance of the MagIA IBC test in different matrices compared to standard laboratory test. To assess the safety of the MagIA IBC test in different matrices compared to standard laboratory test. Methodology: This study is opened without any limit of inclusion. It is a single arm study. The study performance includes 125 days maximum from the inclusion of the first patient to the inclusion of the last patient. On the day of the study, patients will be asked to give all necessary information and sign a consent form if they agree to participate to the study. A finger prick is taken to perform the MagIA IBC test and a safety venous blood sample for standard laboratory tests. Then, venous blood may be taken in a 6mL plastic tube approved for the test and in a second tube (6mL) for a standard laboratory test to confirm preliminary results. If there is no HCV, HBV or HIV infection, the patient will leave the study and will be contacted in the next month for a follow up. If the result is positive, an extended blood sample and an HIV, HBV and HCV genotype will be taken and will be sent to the laboratory for confirmation."

Endocalyx, the food supplement currently being tested, is developed for the daily supplementation of glycosaminoglycans. The primary objective is to 
1. Determine whether Endocalyx can reduce sodium and water excess in patients with chronic heart failure and 
2. Evaluate whether Endocalyx will improve physical limitations and reported symptoms of excess of fluid; quality of life; and patient-reported symptoms. The secondary objectives are to 
3. Determine working mechanisms of Endocalyx in heart failure patients and 
4. Evaluate whether Endocalyx can positively affect cardiac and vascular parameters, tissue sodium and hydration, body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, micro-vascular function and inflammatory status. Endocalyx is expected to safely reduce sodium and water excess in these patients, which has important cardiovascular consequences.

Background: Adhesive Small Bowel Obstruction (aSBO) is a common complication of abdominal surgery with an overall recurrence rate of 2.7%. The only definitive treatment shown to reduce the frequency of recurrence in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is operative adhesiolysis; however, the majority of patients presenting with aSBO can be treated non-operatively with a nasogastric tube (NGT) and fasting or total parenteral nutrition (TPN) until bowel function returns. Recently, a small study suggested that aSBO can be treated with a combination of NGT and water soluble oral contrast without the use of either fasting or TPN, however, this study was not powered for outcome analysis and only included eight patients. Objectives: The primary aim of this study is to compare the use of NG tube with versus without NG tube with water-soluble contrast in patients presenting with non-incarcerated aSBO. Additional aims include comparing the use of NG tube with naso-jejunal tube (NJ) with and without water-soluble contrast, assessing the effect of water-soluble contrast on recovery of gut function, determining the incidence of post-operative complications in aSBO presenting patients and determining the impact of water-soluble contrast on recovery of normal gut function, quality of life, and patient satisfaction in patients undergoing surgical treatment for aSBO. Study Design: This study is an international, multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of consecutive adult patients presenting with aSBO. Patients will be randomized into treatment with NG tube with water-soluble contrast (WSC = 100cc Gastrografin), NG tube and saline or NG tube alone. Patients randomized to the NG tube alone study arm will be followed prospectively.

Achieving sustained HBsAg negative rate in a single group of patients after nucleic acid analogues (NAs) based treatment is one of the major challenges in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) treatment. Immune therapy is another novel treatment strategy for CHB treatment. In recent years, many new drugs based on immune therapy have been investigated for prevention and treatment of HBV including immune checkpoint inhibitor, immune cell transplantation and immune agonist etc. Many researchers believe that immune therapy may increase the ability of NAs to achieve functional cure of HBV infection. At present, combination of these three methods is widely used in the clinic of hepatocellular carcinoma treatment, which may lead to a better effect on CHB. In this study, the efficacy and safety of sustained viral negative rate after NAs combined with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody and pegylated interferon(PEG-IFNα) in different regimens are investigated, which may provide a novel combination strategy for the treatment of chronic HBV infection and functional cure of HBV infection."

Children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), especially those treated for the disease with nusinersen or risdiplam, may still experience motor difficulties that lead to decreased physical activity and time spent in upright positions. The present study aims to learn more about the use of a portable, in-home body weight support harness system for these children. The long term goals of this project are to identify (and quantify) the benefits of such an intervention in this population, but first, to test the usability and practicality of using the harness system in the home environment. Our initial focus is on 3 key questions: (1) Can a caregiver use the harness system with their child(ren) with the appropriate supports in place? (2) Do children with SMA enjoy the use of the harness system? and (3) Does the harness system lead to more time spent in upright positions compared to a child who uses only physical therapy exercises?
We will use a variety of questionnaires and motor assessments to answer the previously mentioned questions. Families who participate will be asked to fill out a survey after each use of the system to assess their perceptions (perceived benefits, perceived ease of use, etc). We will also ask the participant and caregiver to record how often and for how long they use the harness system. Physical therapists will administer a variety of motor performance tests prior to, and after, the use of the system. We expect that families will be able to use the harness system at home and that this will lead to more upright, functional activities in affected children. With more research, we hope to develop and refine ways to use this or other mobility aids so that children with SMA can continue to move, play, and interact with the world around them."

Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common compression neuropathy. The main symptoms include pain and other unpleasant sensations in hand and wrist. In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and other muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of manual performance. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) remain the method of choice in diagnosing CTS. However ultrasonography (US) is increasingly used along with or instead of NCS. Most frequently, the increase of the cross-sectional area of the median nerve at the inlet to the carpal tunnel is regarded as the marker of CTS. A number of other measurements such as median nerve mobility, volar bulging of flexor retinaculum and others were also studied to increase diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. In this study the investigators aim to assess the utility of measurements made at the point of the maximal stenosis of the median nerve in the tunnel to diagnose CTS. So far, there were only few studies, which visualized the maximal nerve stenosis, which is the essential pathological feature of CTS. In general, the group of patients with CTS and controls will undergo NCS of symptomatic median and ipsilateral ulnar nerves and US of the symptomatic median nerve with measurements of the cross-sectional area, diameter and echogenicity at various points, including the point of the maximal stenosis. The location of the maximal stenosis with respect to external (distal crease) and internal (wrist and hand bones and thenar musculature) will also be evaluated. Subjects will also be asked to fill out the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) and a demographic questionnaire. US measurements will be compared between patients and healthy volunteers. US measurements, especially those made at the point of stenosis will be correlated among patients with clinical severity of CTS, reflected by the score in BCTQ and with the grade of electrophysiological severity as introduced by Padua et al. [1]."

Infertility is a worldwide epidemic. One common form of male infertility is severe oligoastheno-teratospermia (OAT), which is characterized by sperm concentrations of less than 15 million/ml and motility and/or morphology less than 40%. Another form of male infertility is male factor infertility with high sperm DNA fragmentation. DNA fragmentation is associated with lower fertilization rate, lower embryo quality and lower implantation rate. Infertile couples with OAT who are undergoing in vitro fertilization cycles have to use donor sperm or the technique of testicular sperm aspiration (TESA). TESA is associated with lower ovarian response rates. Another approach of sperm selection is based on the selection of sperm with the lowest DNA fragmentation. Here, microfluidics technology is used. The microfluidic devices used within one of these systems are called Zymot. Based on the observation that male factor infertility with high DNA fragmentation is responsible for more than 50% of all ICSI cycles, the investigators have started to evaluate the results of a single center, prospective, multicenter, non-interventional study (AOP_35_A). The aim of this study is to collect information from couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation undergoing TESA ICSI or zymot ICSI. From 10 study centers the following data will be collected: patients' age, sperm concentration, sperm motility, sperm morphology, sperm DNA fragmentation and endometrial preparation. Finally, clinical endpoints will be assessed in relation to the performed technique (TESA ICSI vs. zymot ICSI). Thus, the investigators will evaluate the outcome of the treatment in couples with oligoastheno-teratospermia and high sperm DNA fragmentation and compare the results of both techniques (TESA ICSI vs. zymot ICSI). This study will support the evidence-based decision on the sperm selection method for couples with high sperm DNA fragmentation."

Archery can be described as a comparatively static sport requiring strength and endurance of the upper body, in particular the forearm and shoulder girdle. Skill in archery is defined as the ability to shoot an arrow to a given target in a certain time span with accuracy. The discipline is described as a three-phase (the stance, the drawing and the sighting) movement. Shooting can be divided these phases into six: bow hold, drawing, full draw, aiming, release and follow-through. Each of these phases represented a stable sequence of movements and was ideal for studying the motor control and skill acquired during this voluntary kinematic process. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of stabilization and stabilization-related parameters on shooting performance at the cervical, lumbal and scapular levels in archery athletes. A total of 40 archery athletes aged between 10 and 18, who have been professionally engaged in archery for at least 1 year were included in the study. Demographic information and musculoskeletal system evaluations of the athletes were done. Performance of the athletes via Upper Extremity Closed Kinetic Chain Stability Test, Hand Grip Strength test; presence of scapular dyskinesia was evaluated via the Lateral Scapular Slide Test. Cervical region stabilization was evaluated via Craniocervical Flexion Test, scapular level stabilization was evaluated via Scapular Muscle Endurance Test, lumbar region stabilization was evaluated via Abdominal Drawing-in Test and Sahrmann's Core Stability Test. As the parameters related to stabilization, postures via Corbin Postural Rating Scale; balances via Stork Balance Test, Upper Extremity Y Balance Test; pain was evaluated via the Shoulder Pain and Disability Index. Shooting performances were evaluated with 72 target shootings and a total of 720 points."

The research question this study aims to address is: Can an artificial intelligence text chatbot enhance sexual health communication and contraceptive counseling between pediatricians and adolescent-mother dyads? The study has three specific aims in staged, qualitative and quantitative research. A mixed-methods design will be used for this purpose. Stage 1: Characterize communication content and styles of pediatrician-adolescent-parent triads on contraception discussions with 50 real-life clinical encounters using validated scales to describe overall quality of the interactions, communication (confidence, comfort, self-efficacy, confidentiality) and decision-making (perceived autonomy, ownership, and power). Stage 2: Upload de-identified and anonymized vignettes to an AI communication training tool to develop and refine the tool through prompt engineering and performance evaluation with adolescent, parent and pediatrician advisory boards to tailor the tool for the needs for adolescent contraceptive care. Stage 3: To compare evaluation results of 50 pre-training and 50 post-training real encounters to test if an AI communication intervention tool can improve reproductive health encounters and communication interactions with pediatricians, adolescents and mothers. This study aims to improve reproductive health encounters and empower adolescents and mothers by engaging all parties in the communication process (i.e. by training pediatricians to improve skills in contraceptive counseling with adolescent-mother dyads). The investigators will also evaluate how cultural and family factors influence the communication process. With a novel approach of using AI-assisted communication training, this research proposal has the potential to advance science by addressing the implementation needs for better contraceptive counseling and communication between pediatricians, adolescents and mothers."

Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder that causes patches of white or yellow skin. There is growing evidence to suggest that the burden of vitiligo may not be uniform across patient/public populations. We will analyse real-world data to determine the burden of disease for vitiligo in the UK population, and to investigate health disparities in this group.
The first aim of the study is to establish the lifetime risk of developing vitiligo, along with its associated sociodemographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity and deprivation). This work aims to determine if the risk of developing vitiligo is not equal.
The second aim is to understand any differences in mental health, healthcare utilisation and work-related impact between different patient groups.
By understanding if disparities exist in vitiligo care, patients and healthcare providers can tailor support plans to improve patient outcomes and quality of life."

Postoperative complications are frequent complications that follow surgical operations. Postoperative respiratory complications (PPCs) are among the most common surgical complications seen as postoperative complications. The need to protect the organs inside the thorax during surgical procedures, especially in abdominal and thoracic surgery, increases the use of artificial ventilation devices in the intensive care unit and increases the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Intra-abdominal hypertension can be seen due to abdominal hypertension at intra-abdominal pressure values of 15-20 mmHg in patients in the intensive care unit following major surgery. Abdominal compartment syndrome can be seen at intra-abdominal pressure values above 20 mmHg. The need to press the lungs inside the thoracic cavity due to the air space of the abdomino-pelvic cavity increases the application of high ventilation pressures to ensure mechanical ventilation. In the results obtained in the research published; increased mechanical force has been associated with increased in-hospital mortality and prolonged hospital stay and increased need for ICU follow-up. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of two different intra-operative intra-abdominal pressure levels applied to patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia; The mechanical power (MP) of the patients and to determine whether there is a difference between the mechanical power values when laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed using intra-abdominal pressure of 12 mmHg and 14 mmHg.
The investigators think that studying the effect of two different intra-operative intra-abdominal pressure levels aimed in laparoscopic cholecystectomy operations will contribute to the literature in this field."

The purpose is to evaluate the feasibility and stability of left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) with a conventional bipolar, active fixation pacing lead (Solia S lead) for ventricular pacing in symptomatic bradycardia patients. This is a prospective, single-arm, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study to investigate the feasibility and stability of LBBAP for ventricular pacing in symptomatic bradycardia patients with a conventional bipolar, active-fixation pacing lead (Solia S lead). This study aims to determine whether Solia S leads can provide both appropriate sensing and lead stability for LBBAP. The investigators also aim to evaluate the feasibility of the delivery system and compare the clinical outcomes at 12-months post-implant to those in previous clinical trials where LBBAP with other leads has been performed. At least 120 patients will be implanted with the Solia S lead and followed for 1 year. The main study endpoints will include implant success rate, intracardiac EG recordings, serial changes of echo data, safety, and pacing parameters. The average QRS duration, pacing-QRS interval, and intra-operative fluoroscopic exposure time will be included and analyzed. Other clinical outcomes such as procedural efficacy, device failure rate, and left ventricular systolic function will be monitored and recorded as secondary endpoints. Additionally, the potentials of the Solia lead for left bundle branch area pacing will be explored in further electrophysiological mapping studies and multi-center comparative studies for longer-term follow-ups."

Yogic breathing styles are practiced in yoga and are known to have an impact on the human body and brain. This effect is now assumed not to be limited to yoga and meditation but could also be elicited by everyday-life yoga-based breathing styles. In comparison to other breathing techniques like hyperventilation, the aim of this study is to investigate the effect of controlled yoga-based breathing styles on memory performance and to reduce the amount of distraction which may occur on a daily basis.
This study was designed to verify the hypothesis that yogic breathing styles can improve both the memory performance of learned visual information and the subjective stress level.
A randomized controlled trial on 60 healthy volunteers in three groups to improve their learning and memory performance and to reduce the subjective stress level during the learning process. The test measures performed in a memory test with the aid of neuroimaging.
After the initial measurements, the participants will take part in a memory improvement test. The results will be used as a first status of the cognitive and stress-related performance. During the two weeks of the test, group I will perform 5-10 breaths per day for 15 minutes using controlled nose-breathing, group II will perform 5-10 breaths per day for 15 minutes using controlled mouth-breathing and group III will not do any intervention. After the two weeks of training, the memory improvement test will be performed again.

Background: Burn injuries can lead to liver damage. Currently there is no recommended exercise program and physiotherapy for patients, who often suffer from liver disease. As a result, treatment approaches in the post-acute phase that include regular exercise have been proposed to counteract these negative effects. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) have also been recently used for the treatment of osteoporosis, arthritis, muscle soreness, and for the improvement of rehabilitation after orthopedic surgeries. The objective of the present study is to determine the immediate and long-term effect of calisthenics exercises program and PEMF therapy protocol on liver function after burn injury in comparison with other therapy protocols. Study Hypothesis: - Participating in a calisthenics exercise program and pulsed electromagnetic field therapy protocol will not have a significant difference on liver function. Methods: 90 burned patients will participate with equal distribution in the three groups.
Each group will consist of 30 burned patients who will meet the inclusion criteria: age ranges between 20-45 years, male and female patients, all patients have burns with BBSA about 30% to 50%, all patients enrolled on the study will have their informed consent.
All patients will be evaluated with serum biochemistries before recruitment and the same blood sample will be taken from the burned patients before starting calisthenics exercises program, pulsed electromagnetic field therapy protocol or placebo therapy protocol in the 3 groups.
Also in between in 3 months and at the end of the study in 6 months, a blood sample will be taken for the evaluation of liver enzymes.
Participators in the groups 2 and 3 will apply their own treatment protocols of calisthenics exercises program and PEMF therapy protocol and their physiotherapist will record the number of patient sessions.
Patients in control group 1 will apply placebo therapy protocol for the same periods of time as the other groups. All patients will follow a low calorie high protein diet of less than 2000 Kcal/day. Patients will be informed that they will be allocated to their own protocol groups randomly.
Data will present as mean ± standard deviation (SD). The two-tailed Student-t test (t-test) will be used to compare means between groups if the distribution was normally distributed. The Mann-Whitney test will be used in case of departure from normal distribution. The statistical significance will be considered as p < 0.05.
This preliminary study provides a novel alternative to the traditional methods of treatment, calisthenics exercise program and PEMF therapy, for the counteraction of liver damage of burned patients, and can be used as an adjunct treatment after burn injury.

Background: The investigators have previously hypothesized that high energy/high protein nutritional supplements may decrease protein clearance including drug clearance. This can be beneficial for increasing bioavailability of the immune checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Pd1 inhibitor) in patients with cancer receiving immunotherapy, leading to increased clinical efficacy of PD-1 ICIs as well as increased patient survival. This has not been studied in cancer patients before.
Objectives: The primary aim is to investigate the variability of clearance during a 12-weeks nutritional intervention period. The secondary aim is to investigate the feasibility for the subjects to comply with the study protocol. Lastly, the investigators aim to study the feasibility of gathering data on a number of exploratory parameters that may link nutritional intake to clinically relevant outcomes.
Study design: NutriCim is a feasibility study to gather information on NSCLC patient recruitment, data collection and compliance of patients receiving a 12-weeks nutritional intervention before and during their first treatment cycle of immunotherapy. Blood samples, questionnaires and faecal specimens will be collected on several time points during this treatment, to examine the effects of a nutritional intervention on the patient's nutritional, immune, and microbiome status with a primary focus on the anti-PD-1 ICIs' efficacy, immunogenicity, and patient outcomes."

The Investigators are designing a multifactorial study, called GAPsy (GliAma signaling in Anxiety and Protocadherins in depression for Psychiatry), to identify common molecular targets implicated in anxiety and depression disorders.
Investigators have recently discovered two novel markers of brain circuitry in psychiatric populations, protocadherin 9 (Pcdh9) and the integrin β3.
The presence of Pcdh9 has been detected in cortical networks involved in the generation of anxiety and depression in mice; integrin β3, instead, is highly expressed within the prefrontal cortex where it controls the number and morphology of excitatory synapses, and its activity is regulated by stress.
In preliminary studies, the investigators have discovered that Pcdh9 modulates the binding of integrin to the brain, and is downregulated in cells within the cerebral cortex of patients with MDD, in both acute and chronic phases.
In addition, a genetic variant of Pcdh9 has been associated with MDD susceptibility.
The Investigators also have recently shown the interaction between integrin β3 and Pcdh9 in brain cortical networks, and their association with anxiety and depressive symptoms that affect the daily life of millions of people in Europe.
The goal of the GAPsy study is to assess whether changes in glutamatergic transmission are specifically modulated by alterations of these two proteins.
The main investigator is planning a multicentric study, involving patients with MDD and anxiety disorders, as well as healthy controls.
The study, called GAPsy, will have two parts. 
In the first part of the project, the investigators will recruit 10 patients with MDD-AD and 10 HC.
Each participant will be evaluated by a team of experienced psychologists and clinicians, administering structured clinical interviews to assess the presence/absence of axis I and II psychiatric disorders (SCID-I and SCID-II) (first visit). Furthermore, in all subjects the degree of depressive/manic dysintomatology will be measured through the use of clinical scales and psychopathological tests such as"

The gut microbiome and human genes interact in multiple ways, involving complex regulatory mechanisms, such as metabolic and signaling pathways. Gut microbiota-encoded proteins (MEPs) are a class of host-microbe interaction proteins. Previous studies and our research team's own data have found that compared with the human genome, the gut microbes contain more proteins, many proteins are related to human diseases. The proteins of the human genome are involved in regulating the gut microbial composition; The proteins of microbial genomes are also associated with the development of human diseases. Combining clinical data with proteomic data, genomic data, and microbial composition data of human gut flora and cardiovascular-related diseases to study its pathogenesis mechanism in microbial regulation, and to seek early diagnosis and treatment options.
The cardiovascular and nervous system are closely related to each other. The gut microbes are expected to play a role in treating diseases of the cardiovascular and nervous system.
The investigators propose to set up research cohorts of cardiovascular and nervous system diseases and healthy controls, and collect blood and fecal samples. Based on the multi-omics detection results, the researchers propose to use machine learning methods, including multi-layer graph networks and artificial neural networks, to jointly analyze the big data of blood and bowel samples, and then to identify potential interaction pathways between the human genome and the gut microbial proteins, and then propose a multi-omics multi-dimensional model for early diagnosis of cardiovascular and nervous system diseases.
In order to verify the authenticity of the study results and to propose a targeted prevention and treatment method for cardiovascular and nervous system diseases, the research team proposes to use fecal transplantation technology (including oral and nasal transplantation) to test the effectiveness and safety of fecal transplantation.
This research plan aims to establish a multi-omics big-data database of cardiovascular and nervous system diseases, to establish human blood and gut microbiome proteome libraries, to find disease-related gene/protein/metabolic signatures, to conduct mechanistic studies based on biological and physical experiments, and also to verify the clinical diagnostic and treatment value of disease risk prediction models and diagnostic tools based on multi-omics big data. The study may have a broader impact in improving early diagnosis and disease prevention, and will provide new direction for the study of gut microbiota associated diseases."

Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is an area of active investigation for immunotherapy, and treatment decisions are more difficult for patients with a high tumor burden or extensive tumor involvement. In these patients, combination treatment provides the greatest benefit, but the definition of criteria for subsets of patients that can benefit from one arm or another remains a major challenge to researchers.
In the KEYNOTE-024 study evaluating pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥50%, the response rate in the pembrolizumab arm alone was 45%. This result led to the approval of pembrolizumab for first-line advanced NSCLC with PDL1 TPS ≥ 50%, which nevertheless represents only 22% of patients with stage IIIB/IV NSCLC. Early identification of biomarkers for patients unlikely to benefit from first-line pembrolizumab is therefore a crucial step in selecting suitable candidates. Furthermore, in cancer, genomic alterations in NFE2L2, KEAP1 and CUL3 result in constitutive activation of NRF2-dependent gene transcription, which promotes cellular resistance to oxidative stress, xenobiotic efflux, proliferation and metabolic reprogramming. Somatic mutations in NFE2L2 and KEAP1 are found in 3% and 12% of NSCLC patients respectively. NFE2L2 is a transcription factor that directs the expression of free radical defense genes that may interfere with radiation-induced DNA damage. KEAP1 is an adaptor protein that targets NFE2L2 for ubiquitination and proteasomal destruction as part of normal homeostasis. These new biomarkers are of clinical interest, as KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutations predict radiation resistance in patients with localized NSCLC treated with radiotherapy but not surgery. Some data also suggest a role for the KEAP1/NFE2L2 axis in response to immunotherapy. Establishing a predictive model for the presence of the KEAP1/NFE2L2 mutation would provide a tool for predicting survival (progression-free and overall), even before the patient starts immunotherapy. Proposed study: A multicentre prospective cohort study involving 150 patients. Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (stage IV; some stage III) with a programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) status ≥50%. Participants will receive a first-line treatment as defined by a multidisciplinary board. In addition, they will undergo FDG-PET/CT imaging as a routine assessment and radiomic analysis in order to generate data before starting their therapeutic treatment. The impact of radiomic analysis (derived features from conventional CT imaging) will then be evaluated to assess if it is a better predictor for patient prognosis than clinical-biological parameters alone. The same analysis will be proposed for KEAP-1 and NFE2L2 mutations.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) in the improvement of ankle dorsiflexion range in professional padel players. As a secondary objective of this research, the authors want to evaluate the effectiveness of eccentric exercises and electrical stimulation on improving the dorsiflexion range and jumping force, as well as the effectiveness of these exercises on pain improvement and preventing injuries.
This study will consist of two groups. One group will receive the PNF treatment and another with a protocol of eccentric exercises and electrical stimulation. Participants from group one will undergo stretching, as well as strengthening and relaxation techniques, while participants in group two will undergo eccentric exercises and strengthening currents. The authors will compare the values with pre and post tests to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of these techniques.
This research will have three phases: initial evaluation (week 0), follow-up evaluation (week 1 and week 2; 30 minutes after treatment) and final evaluation (week 3; 30 minutes after treatment). Participants will have to perform each treatment once a week on Mondays and Thursdays for 3 weeks. All participants were randomly assigned to the various groups. At the initial phase all participants were submitted to ankle circumference, vertical jump and ankle range of motion tests. At the follow-up phase (week 1 and 2) the tests were repeated, in the same order as before. During this phase, the eccentric exercises group will perform the stretching protocol, but they will not perform the strengthening and relaxation process. At the final test of the follow-up phase (week 3) the participants will be submitted to the same three tests before receiving the therapeutic stretching program and strengthening. The intervention will be repeated one more time for both groups on the last day of treatment and the final evaluation."

Background: There is a great need for community-based family support programs that are easily implemented in low-resource settings. These programs should be culturally-adapted and developed in partnership with the families they aim to serve. Moving away from existing models of care that are based on deficits and individual interventions, this study will develop a curriculum for parenting and children mental health skills, which is adapted for refugee families in Tijuana, Mexico and developed in partnership with refugee communities, using a participatory research design.
Methods: This study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the impact of a 4-week parenting intervention in two shelters in Tijuana for refugee families. Eight focus groups among shelter residents (n=96) identified priority domains for parenting skills. Via a community-based participatory research (CBPR) process involving leaders from the two shelters, the curriculum was then adapted using a Learning by Observing and Pitching In (LOPI) model. In a 2-arm RCT intervention and waitlist control group will participate in learning sessions 2 times a week for 4 weeks, following completion of the surveys and observations. Intervention groups will complete the surveys and observations at the conclusion of the baseline period. The waitlist-control group will also receive the intervention after the intervention group. Both groups will receive the same intervention. The primary outcome measure will be parenting knowledge using a tool translated from English. Secondary outcome measures will include child behavior and parental efficacy scales and qualitative observations of parent-child interactions and interviews. Follow-up assessments will occur 2 months after the intervention.
Impact: This project will provide an accessible parenting curriculum which could be integrated into many programs. By incorporating input gathered from refugee families in Tijuana, the intervention has the potential to be applicable to other low-resource refugee settings, increasing the accessibility of culturally-adapted community-based parenting interventions to address mental health disparities."

We have an excellent opportunity to further our understanding of the challenges faced by people with incurable head and neck cancer (HNC) and their families in the UK. Research shows that they experience significant adverse effects on daily living, mental wellbeing and quality of life, and more information is needed to identify how these adverse effects can be addressed. To date, little is known about the complex dynamics and the role of multi-professional healthcare services for this patient group. Through a qualitative observational study design, and a co-design approach with patients, carers and healthcare professionals, it is proposed to gather patient and professional experiences, and then collect views as to how the care received and future potential solutions might be improved. The team will use findings from patient and professional interviews and focus groups, to prioritise areas for future intervention development. Future interventions/solutions will then be developed and tested with end-users as a result of this research."

Introduction: With the accelerated pace of the global aging society, the prevalence of degenerative diseases is increasing. At present, spinal degenerative diseases caused by body degeneration have become the most common type. With the continuous deepening of the research on spinal degenerative diseases and the continuous development, update and promotion of minimally invasive surgery technology and instruments, minimally invasive surgery has attracted more and more attention of spine surgeons due to its advantages of rapid recovery, small trauma and fewer complications. The core of endoscopic spinal surgery is nerve root decompression. The procedure is centered on the nerve roots, which can be damaged with the slightest carelessness. According to statistics, the incidence of nerve root injury under spinal endoscope is 1.8-2.5%. Most of the injuries include the stimulation and edema of the nerve root during the operation, which may lead to postoperative sensory retardation and motor weakness, which will damage the patient's physical function and reduce overall satisfaction. The intraoperative nerve exploration is time-consuming and critical, and the variability of the patient's nerve anatomy will also add difficulties to the operation. A real-time auxiliary intraoperative nerve identification technology is necessary. With the progress of optical technology, fluorescent-guided surgery has shown considerable prospects in assisting in identifying nerves. Indocyanine green (ICG) is the only fluorophore approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intraoperative near-infrared imaging. It can emit near-infrared light after being irradiated by excitation light, which has the characteristics of high penetration depth, low spontaneous fluorescence and high sensitivity. At present, ICG near-infrared fluorescence imaging has been applied to clinical research of thoracic sympathetic ganglion, facial nerve, phrenic nerve and pelvic nerve.
In this study, the investigators will include patients who meet the indications of lumbar spinal endoscopic spinal surgery (lumbar disc herniation) and investigate the relationship between fluorescent imaging and nerve roots in endoscopic spinal surgery. Clinical trials with a single-arm design of ICG near-infrared imaging in identifying lumbar nerve roots will be conducted at the study site. The efficacy of intraoperative fluorescent imaging by ICG in the lumbar surgery of endoscopic spinal surgery will be evaluated by clinical outcomes. The study hypotheses are: 1) fluorescent imaging has a positive effect on lumbar nerve root exposure; 2) low doses of ICG will not have a significant effect on the visual quality of fluorescence and the quality of surgical vision of doctors; and 3) the low doses of ICG do not increase the incidence of side effects to the patient in the lumbar surgery of endoscopic spinal surgery.
Methods: The study is a multicenter investigator-initiated study. The patients received one dose of icg 0.5mg/kg/b.wt., 1 mg/kg/b.wt. or 2 mg/kg/b.wt. intravenous injection 5-10 minutes before the operation, and the surgical team used a spinal endoscopic fluorescence imaging system to assist with nerve root identification during surgery. The time spent for operation, fluorescent imaging rate of nerve root, fluorescent signal ratio, surgical complications, and patients postoperative pain and functional assessment, will be investigated and analyzed by statisticians blinded to the operation.
This study has obtained the approval of the ethics committee of Shanghai No. 1 People's hospital, and the patients will receive full explanations about the study. This research is conformed to the requirements of the Declaration of Helsinki, and the investigators will ensure that the study is conducted under GCP.
Discussion: With the continuous deepening of endoscopic spinal surgery, the surgical experience of surgical teams has undergone rapid changes. It is necessary to have real-time intraoperative lumbar nerve anatomical observation. The present study will investigate the potential role of intraoperative fluorescence imaging by near-infrared ICG to improve the intraoperative exploration of lumbar nerve roots. If the application of low-dose ICG fluorescence image to assist researchers to explore the lumbar nerve root can effectively improve the speed and quality, then it will have a practical application value in clinical application.

Background: In a Nordic-Baltic comparison study, it was found that parents with intellectual and developmental disability (IDD) in the Nordic countries reported low levels of access to support and less support overall compared to similar parents in the Baltic region. At the same time, parents in the Baltic countries reported less satisfaction with the support provided as well as lower levels of social support from their families and friends. Based on these results, it is reasonable to assume that parents with IDD and other cognitive disabilities in the Nordic countries lack the access to support that they need, and that there is a need for evidence-based treatment programs for these parents. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the Norwegian Parenting Young Children (PYC) home-based intervention program for parents with IDD and their children aged 0-9 living at home. PYC is part of the national support and service programme provided by the municipalities to parents with IDD and their children, including children with disabilities. The program is designed to focus on three primary components. First, to improve parenting skills. Second to improve the child's development, health, and safety. And third to reduce the burden on social services and caregiving services. The aim of the present study is to determine if the PYC intervention program improves children's development, health, and safety, as well as reduces the burden on social services and caregiving services in home settings for families with low-functioning parents with IDD and children aged 0-9 living at home, thereby contributing to a more cost-effective and efficient approach. Methods: We will conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial with a non-randomized (control group) sample of one in three participants. This means that all parents and their children will be recruited to the PYC intervention program, while half will be allocated on a randomized basis to a treatment or control group. Parents and their children (aged 0-9 years) with a main residence in the municipality of Oslo and its surroundings participate in the study, which is conducted in cooperation with Oslo municipality, a social service agency working with families with IDD, and several NGO´s working with parents with IDD and their children.

Background: 68Ga-NOTA-H006: A new PET/CT diagnostic agent with a positive response to PET/CT imaging, which can be used to evaluate the expression of 5T4 receptors on cancer cells, and the expression of H006 in tumor tissues can be used as a predictor of the efficacy before the first 2nd 5FU-containing chemotherapy. This research uses two types of PET tracers, 68Ga-NOTA-H006 and 18F-FDG, in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, colon cancer, etc.
H006 is synthesized with 68Ga-NOTA. 68Ga-NOTA-H006 was intravenously injected and scanned with Siemens Discovery 690 PET/CT. 68Ga-NOTA-H006 was synthesized with 68Ga- NOTA.
Objective: The purpose of this clinical study was to design an imaging system suitable for H006. Compared to 18F-FDG, the standardized uptake value (SUV) of tumor imaging in the body is calculated, and the SUV value can reflect the expression level of 5T4 in tumor tissue, which can predict the therapeutic effect before anti-tumor treatment. Thus, it can be used as a new PET diagnostic marker suitable for clinical diagnosis, evaluate the expression level of 5T4 in new and old lesions for lung cancer and pancreatic cancer patients, evaluate the diagnostic value of 68Ga-NOTA-H006 in new lung cancer patients and evaluate the tumor treatment response.
Methods: Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, colorectal cancer and other patients have undergone multi-detector spiral CT, PET and magnetic resonance imaging.
Results: The experimental results showed that the 68Ga-NOTA-H006 PET/CT imaging system could clearly show the anatomical characteristics of the tumor and normal tissues. The detection of 68Ga-NOTA-H006 on the lungs, kidneys, livers, gastric cavity, abdominal cavity, urethra and small intestine is good, and the detection is stable, the contrast between normal and tumor tissues is obvious, there is no false negative. Through quantitative analysis, it is found that there is a positive correlation between SUV value and the number of positive lesions. The accuracy of SUV in predicting 68Ga-NOTA-H006 expression status in tumor tissue is 87.5%.
Conclusion: 68Ga-NOTA-H006 can non-invasively detect the expression status of 5T4 in the body, and its accurate detection can predict the therapeutic effect of anti-tumor treatment after examination.
Economic Benefit: 68Ga-NOTA-H006 has a faster half-life than 18F-FDG (111 min vs. 110 min), and the cost per patient is lower, which is conducive to the popularization of PET/CT detection and the improvement of diagnostic efficiency in clinical application."

Heart failure is one of the deadliest diseases worldwide, with a high incidence of heart failure especially in the elderly. In patients with heart failure, the heart cannot pump a sufficient amount of blood to meet the body's metabolic demands. One common mechanism for dysfunction in heart failure is inefficient pumping, also called cardiac dyssynchrony. Dyssynchrony refers to an uncoordinated heart and results in prolonged electrical activation and contraction of the ventricles and dilatation of the heart chambers. Dyssynchrony can be alleviated with a pacemaker called cardiac resynchronization therapy, CRT. However, not all patients will respond equally well to CRT. We are currently performing a large clinical trial (STIR-HF) to determine why some responders to CRT better than others. We have found that the success of CRT depends on the severity of the dyssynchrony and the strength of the heart muscle. In a subgroup of patients the strength of the muscle can be predicted by measuring the force required to induce calcium release in heart muscle cells. In CRT responders, the force is generally very high, which means that they have a high energy requirement during the energy-consuming processes of the heart muscle. The high force requirements will affect the signaling pathways that regulate energy production, mitochondrial function, protein metabolism and cellular structure that are regulated by mitochondria. Therefore, we have started a new project, SIRC-HF, to study the underlying mechanisms of CRT response. Our hope is to find biomarkers that will help predict which patients will respond well to CRT and to unravel the signaling pathways that regulate cell function in heart failure.
Heart failure patients that receive a CRT will be biobanked for future studies of CRT response. We will focus on proteins, miRNA and red blood cell (RBC) properties from blood samples. Additional measurements will focus on cardiac structure/function, energy metabolism and contractility in the heart's biopsies. We will also study endothelial function. An endothelium is a layer of cells that cover the inside of all blood vessels. The endothelium has contractile functions and can also release substances that will regulate blood flow. Dysfunction in the endothelium is common in heart disease, and endothelial function can be measured non-invasively using peripheral vessels like fingers and toes. Patients in the control group will be followed with clinical examination, blood samples and echocardiography. This will give us the opportunity to compare patients who are treated with CRT with patients who are on medical treatment without CRT-devices. This will reveal what can be measured in heart failure patients treated with CRT and what distinguishes patients who respond well from those that do not respond well to CRT."

Care teams at leading cancer centers are struggling to implement PRO management tools, which may perpetuate disparities in patient-centered care. Addressing barriers to care team engagement is the foundation of this proposal, and leveraging behavioral strategies to facilitate patient-level PRO use is critical to the sustainability of any program. Informed by insights from pilot studies, this proposal will employ implementation science methods to conduct a pragmatic RCT with randomization across patients, clinicians, and practice levels. The goal of this proposal is to improve the adherence of patients to PRO monitoring and ultimately enhance the timeliness of clinician response to patients' symptoms and treatment experience. This will be accomplished through: (a) a stepped wedge design randomizing clinicians to a sequential roll-out of implementation strategies; and (b) randomizing patients to a parallel controlled trial comparing two PRO administration methods. This proposal aligns with the vision of a national cancer registry (CARAT) to promote data-driven improvements in patient-centered care."

Prognostic awareness among patients with life limiting diseases has been shown to be associated with less depression, better quality of care and earlier referral to palliative care. Early palliative care has become mainstream in the UK, but still, a large proportion of patients remains unaware that their disease is not curable. This is important as studies have shown that there is a discrepancy between what patients want and expect from palliative care (focusing on improved quality of life, support for physical and psychological symptoms) and what they actually get (focussing mainly on symptom control). A deeper knowledge of the factors and patient characteristics associated with prognostic awareness is an important first step to develop interventions to improve prognostic communication and thereby to facilitate the delivery of high quality ESC which can support patients to be able to make informed decisions about the future. This is necessary to improve care and quality of life in patients with advanced cancer in the UK."

Post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) is a highly debilitating headache, which represents a major concern for women who undergo pain management with epidural or spinal analgesia during labour or childbirth. However, the incidence of PDPH is variable, ranging between 0.5 and 10%, being probably related to the difficulty in interpreting some of the classical symptoms of PDPH that are reported only by a minority of affected women. PDPH is probably a consequence of the leakage of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that occurs into the epidural or subarachnoid space. The incidence of PDPH can be reduced by minimising the amount of CSF leaked during the insertion of epidural or spinal needle, as demonstrated by the use of epidural catheters in labour. However, this method requires an epidural needle insertion close to CSF level, making this technique difficult to perform as well as time-consuming. Recently, a novel method has been described, the use of a spinal needle to create a subarachnoid catheter in the epidural space. However, to our knowledge, this method has been never tested in order to reduce PDPH occurrence. 
The aim of this study is to compare the occurrence of PDPH in obstetric women who undergo epidural analgesia using either the classical method or the new method after a dural puncture, as well as their satisfaction of the labour pain and chronic headache or chronic low back pain occurring at 1 and 3 months after labour."

This research will evaluate the difference between sectional and circumferential matrix in achieving optimum proximal contact in class 2 restorations.
Class 2 restorations are the most common ones due to their great prevalence as carious lesions and restoring them with composite restorations is not the easiest task due to the difficulties in achieving a secure proximal contact.
The aim of this research is to evaluate the two different matrices used during indirect resin restoration.
A part of a previous study by Morsi and Nawari [7] in clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT03296253) was used as pilot study in order to evaluate the two matrices and to design this study with higher power and number of samples. 
A sample size of 40 patients divided in 2 groups was obtained. The samples were allocated randomly in each intervention: sectional matrix vs. circumferential matrix.
Proximal contact will be evaluated by applying tightness of proximal contact by unwaxed dental floss and proximal contact on restored teeth will be divided into three categories: optimum, tight, or open contact.
The results of this study should help clinicians to select a successful proximal contact method for class 2 restorations in clinical practice.

The participants will be assigned to one of two study arms: 1) County-paid Wraparound Services (WWS) tailored to the individual needs of the participant; 2) Usual County services. Study participants will receive a comprehensive package of wraparound services, including assertive community treatment, crisis intervention, medication management, substance abuse treatment, family and peer support, and coordination of all services. As a result of this tailored care, the investigators hypothesize that participants receiving WWS will be more likely than the participants receiving usual County services to: 1) Achieve their most important life goals; 2) Reduce the number of days spent in 24-hour psychiatric hospital settings, including State Hospitals, county contract hospitals and locked residential care programs; 3) Reduce the number of days spent in state and county prisons and jails; and 4) Reduce the costs of psychiatric hospitalization and incarceration.
In addition to these participant outcomes, the investigators will survey County mental health staff members to gather their opinions about the program, and also conduct focus groups with patients and families to examine their satisfaction with the program.
This study is important because it represents an innovative approach to improving care for people with severe and persistent forms of mental illness. The investigators propose to combine high-quality psychiatric care with traditional forms of care to help County residents whose mental illnesses have previously severely disrupted their lives."

Family Intervention (FI) and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) are among the most efficacious psychosocial interventions to prevent relapse in schizophrenia. However, there is limited evidence from low- and middle-income countries (LAMICs) that supports the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of delivering these psychosocial interventions to individuals with first episode psychosis (FEP) in LAMICs. We aim to determine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapy (CaCBT) and culturally adapted family intervention (CuFI) compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) in reducing overall symptoms of psychosis in individuals with FEP in Pakistan. The study will include 390 participants with FEP from psychiatric units of hospitals in ten centres (i.e. Karachi, Lahore, Rawalpindi, Hyderabad, Qambar Shahdakot, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, Peshawar, Quetta and Multan). Consented participants meeting eligibility criteria will be randomised in a 1:1:1 allocation to CaCBT + TAU, CulFI + TAU or TAU alone. Participants in CaCBT intervention group will receive 12-weekly one-to-one sessions. Participants in CulFI group will receive 10-weekly one-to-one sessions. Sessions will be delivered by trained psychologists who will receive regular weekly supervision to maintain fidelity. Assessments will be carried out at baseline, months 3, 6, and 12 by trained, blinded assessors. Process evaluation will help to build the implementation knowledge base for proposed interventions across study settings. We will conduct economic evaluations (i.e., the cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses) of the CaCBT and CulFI interventions, as add-on to TAU.

This study is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and clinical performance of IMPT-314 (axicabtagene ciloleucel) in participants with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (including diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, DLBCL arising from follicular lymphoma, primary mediastinal (thymic) large B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL), high-grade B-cell lymphoma with or without MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangement). The study consists of two parts. The dose escalation/estimation part (Part A) enrolls 20 participants in 2 cohorts (CAR T experienced, CAR T naïve) to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 (RP2) dose. The dose expansion part (Part B) enrolls 40 additional participants at the RP2 dose level to evaluate the safety, efficacy, clinical performance, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of IMPT-314.
For participants in Cohort 1, a single dose of IMPT-314 will be administered. Participants in Cohort 2 will receive lymphodepleting chemotherapy (in the absence of active CNS disease) followed by lymphocyte infusion. Up to 11 participants will be enrolled in Cohort 1 in dose level 1 or 2, and up to 9 participants will be enrolled in Cohort 1 in dose level 2. Participants who have previously received a genetically modified T cell therapy other than a product targeting CD19 with an FMC63-based CAR (e.g., axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel (YESCARTA®), tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel (KYMRIAH®), or lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel (BREYANZI®)) at any dose) will be enrolled into Cohort 1 based on dose level 1. Participants who have received a genetically modified T cell therapy targeting CD19 with an FMC63-based CAR at a dose level that did not result in any infusion related toxicities (including cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and/or neurologic toxicities (including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)) will be enrolled into Cohort 2 dose level 1. All other participants will be enrolled into Cohort 2 dose levels 2 or 3. Up to 27 additional participants who have received prior CAR T therapy (Cohort 2) will be enrolled as specified. For participants in Cohort 2, they will be treated with lymphodepleting chemotherapy (in the absence of active CNS disease) followed by lymphocyte infusion of the genetically modified IMPT-314 autologous T cells. Up to 27 additional participants (Cohort 2) will receive lymphocyte infusion in Part B at the RP2 dose level. For Cohort 2 participants who are 18 years of age or older and female and have childbearing potential, a pregnancy test is required prior to lymphodepleting chemotherapy and before cell infusion to confirm she is not pregnant and agree to use highly effective contraception for 30 days prior to cell infusion and to continue using highly effective contraception for 7 months after cell infusion. Additionally, participants must agree not to donate ova during the study for a period of 6 months post-infusion."

The aim of the present study was to examine whether individuals with Metabolic Syndrome (MetS), when all the components (waist circumference, fasting glucose, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol) were considered collectively, were more likely to have cognitive disturbance and a low level of physical activity compared to healthy individuals. Another aim of the study was to research whether the number of MetS component values and the severity of MetS were correlated with cognitive functions and physical activity. Participants were divided into two groups. There were individuals diagnosed with MetS in the intervention group and healthy individuals who did not have any problems in the control group. In the intervention group, individuals diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome by meeting 3 of the NCEP-ATP III criteria were assessed for clinical and physical performance and cognitive performance. In the control group, healthy individuals aged 10-40 years who underwent a general health examination within the last 6 months. The assessment consisted of anthropometric measurements, assessing the severity of MetS, collecting demographic data, determining cognitive functions, determining physical activity levels and the relationship between the number of MetS components and cognitive functions, and the relationship between MetS and physical activity was aimed. The physical performance of the individuals is evaluated with the Stroop Test TBAG Form, the Visual Reaction Test and the Pedometer. As a result, it was found that MetS had a negative effect on both physical performance and cognitive performance. It was found that individuals with MetS had a lower level of physical activity and lower cognitive performance than healthy individuals."

There has been an increasing interest in the use of binaural beats (BB) to improve sleep quality among people with poor sleep quality. In the present study, we assessed the effectiveness of an 8-week BBM music intervention on sleep quality and emotional wellbeing among older people with poor sleep quality in one particular long-term care institution. A total of 60 participants completed the study. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention (BBM) group or control group. In the experimental group, an 8-week binationally beats music intervention was conducted, while the control group received the same familiar music without BBM embedded. The intervention had no adverse events. The intervention group showed a significant improvement after the music intervention, and in comparison to the control group on depression severity, sleep disturbance, subjective sleep quality, and sleep latency. The intervention group had significantly higher subjective sleep quality after the music intervention in comparison to the score at baseline and as well as the scores recorded in the control group.
These findings suggest that a relatively short-term BBM music intervention may be a suitable and low-cost solution on improving sleep quality and depression in older adults in a long-term care institution (LTCI) setting, and the research provides valuable evidence on the benefits of music intervention for sleep quality among older people. Implications for future research and clinical practice are also discussed.

The hypothesis of this randomized study was that DEXMEDETOMIDINE-bupivacaine may provide a longer motor blockade after elective Caesarean section compared with neostigmine added to bupivacaine.
Dexmedetomidine is an alpha-2 adrenoceptor antagonist, the primary central nervous system sites of action being limbic, hypothalamic and periaqueductal grey matter. There are no reports of systemic haemodynamic or respiratory side effects of this drug. It blocks the release of stress hormones such as noradrenaline, which are known to accelerate the intra-operative rise in blood pressure during a spinal anaesthesia. Neostigmine prolongs the duration of spinal anaesthesia by increasing the concentration of spinal endogenous ACh thereby, increasing the concentration of endogenous ACh without adding any systemic effects.
An equal, statistically power of the two study groups was performed by the software package for computer generated allocation of subjects to test groups.
The primary end-point in the present study was length of motor blockade. Secondary end-points were duration of sensory blockade, time of recovery of sensory and motor blockade, onset of complete motor blockade, intra-operative and post-operative blood pressure values and heart rate.
Patients were placed supine on a standard operating table in the operating room, with their heads over the edge, which has been elevated by 25 degrees. The spinal anaesthesia was to be performed with the patient in the sitting position. Spinal anaesthesia was achieved in the sitting position with a 25-gauge, 10-centimeter-long Whitacre spinal needle. After sterilize the area with povidone-iodine (70%), the inter-spinous process was marked with a ballpoint pen, with a reference system 5 cm lateral to the midline and 2 cm caudal to the L2-L3 spinous process. A 25-gauge, 10-cm-long Whitacker spinal needle was advanced with the patient in lateral position (5 cm lateral to midline) through the vertebral space identified using a loss of resistance technique. The spinal anaesthesia was achieved in the sitting position, with the patient in the flexed position, then the patient was returned to the supine position. No epinephrine was added to the preparation solution of either drugs.
The spinal anaesthesia level was measured with a pin prick needle from caudal to cephalic direction till achieving T10. The T10 dermatome represented full extent of spinal sensory blockade for the purposes of anesthesiologists.
The time from the end of intrathecal injection till achievement of full sensory blockade was recorded as primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included length of complete motor blockade, duration of complete and incomplete sensory blockades, time to the recovery of complete motor blockade, maximum level of sensory blockade, any need for bolus opioid (fentanyl) as rescue analgesia, BIHS classification, time to the recovery of two-point discrimination test (T10 level), time to the return of bowel sounds and time required to first pass flatus, and time to the first oral intake. Heart rates and blood pressure values were recorded before spinal anaesthesia, immediately, at 15, 30, 45 and 60 minutes after spinal injection and every 5 minutes till 2 hours after spinal injection and then every 30 minutes till the end of operation. The study group was divided in 2 group,18 patients in each group, Group 1 were received 10 mg (2ml) hyperbaric bupivacaine and 0.1 ml (10 μg) DXM and 0.1 ml normal saline and Group 2 ( 18 patients ) were received 10 mg (2ml) hyperbaric bupivacaine and 0.1 ml (50 μg) neostigmine and 0.1 ml normal saline. Group 3 ( 18 patients ) were received 10 mg (2ml) hyperbaric bupivacaine and 0.2 ml normal saline. The primary end-point in the present study was length of motor blockade. Secondary end-points were duration of sensory blockade, time of recovery of sensory and motor blockade,"

White spot lesions (WSLs) and gingivitis are frequently encountered in patients undergoing orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. Oral hygiene can contribute to the onset and maintenance of WSLs and gingivitis in this context. The aim of this study is to evaluate if supragingival plaque control with air-polishing could provide benefit by reducing the development of WSLs and gingivitis. Therefore, patients undergoing fixed orthodontic treatment will be divided into two groups (test and control) for the application of air-polishing or ultrasonic scaling, respectively. The primary outcome will be the number of patients who will develop WSLs during the 2-years period of orthodontic treatment. The secondary outcomes will be the changes in gingivitis in both groups. The efficacy of oral hygiene will be evaluated with clinical and microbiological parameters. After 2 years, all patients will be treated with fixed appliances only and the appearance of WSLs and gingivitis will be recorded until the end of the active fixed appliance treatment, an average of six months."

Atrial fibrillation has a high burden of disease, associated with stroke, heart failure, and death. It is thought to be caused in part by the formation of fibrous scar tissue in the atria, including scar from prior heart surgery. Surgery to remove the left atrial appendage is the most common cardiac surgery associated with AF and is known to reduce this risk. This study will examine tissue from patients with and without AF, who are having surgery to remove a part of the lung or heart, to try and identify the differences in the scar tissue associated with AF development. This will allow better understanding of the role of scar tissue in AF and potentially help identify better treatments or preventative measures."

Aims of the study; In the light of the information obtained from the literature, many immunological events occur as a result of immune activation caused by various environmental factors such as ischemia-reperfusion injury, surgery, and immunosuppressive agents. It has been found that these factors stimulate the production of inflammatory cytokines, which in turn cause liver damage. On the other hand, it has been reported that various factors such as acute renal failure, infectious diseases and ischemia-reperfusion injury cause the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines in the body. In our study, some inflammatory Interleukin-2 , Interleukin-6, Interferon-γ, Tumor Necrosis Factor-α and anti-inflammatory Interleukin-4 and Interleukin-10 cytokine genes expressions and Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells-1, which contributes to the pathology of acute and chronic inflammatory diseases; Human Leukocyte Antigen-G5, which suppresses the immune response; the expression levels of transcription factor Forkhead box-P3 expressed in regulatory T-lymphocytes and Cluster of Differentiation (CD)14 genes, which are thought to be biomarkers in various infectious diseases and expressed in monocytes, will be measured from peripheral blood samples obtained from liver transplant patients before, 1 month and 6 months after the operation. In the light of the data to be obtained, it is aimed to find biomarkers with high predictive value for rejection and infection after liver transplantation."

Introduction: Geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a retinal condition characterized by the progressive loss of photoreceptors and supporting retinal cells, which leads to functional blindness and impaired quality of life in patients. While many therapeutics have been effective in treating early-stage of AMD, there are no approved specific treatments for GA.
Objectives: The purpose of this study is to determine how well BI 771716 is tolerated and what its effects are on geographic atrophy in a single rising dose (SRD) and a multiple dose (MD) study of increasing doses of the investigational drug administered by intravitreal injection monthly in patients with GA secondary to AMD for 4 months. An additional purpose is to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of a single and multiple intravitreal administrations of BI 771716 in patients with GA secondary to AMD.
Eligibility: Key inclusion criteria include: signed informed consent, males and females aged 50 or older with GA secondary to AMD in the study eye.
Design: This is an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center, sequential assignment study. Study drug BI 771716 will be administered by intravitreal injection in the study eye at increasing doses. Primary endpoints include the number of participants who experienced ocular Dose Limiting Events (DLEs) in the low dose single dose (SRD) part and the number of participants who experience drug related adverse events (AEs). Secondary endpoints include various PK measurements.
Patient benefits: This study will provide valuable information on how BI 771716 is tolerated in patients with GA secondary to AMD and help us determine dose levels to be evaluated in future studies."

Rationale: Fluid overload is present in the vast majority of acute heart failure (HFd) patients. Current guidelines recommend dehydration, aiming for a moderate negative fluid balance (NFB) (250 - 700 ml), on hospital daily fluid balance to ensure symptom relief and improve patient prognosis. The optimal timing and intensity of dehydration, however, remain unclear, with concerns raised on whether diuretics may cause acute kidney injury (AKI).
To date, no study has directly compared a protocol aiming for a lower daily (average) negative fluid balance (167 ml) with a higher daily (average) negative fluid balance (700 ml) during the first 3 days of hospital admission. Also, no prior study has compared continuous infusion of furosemide, aimed at reaching a moderate NFB (600 ml) without dehydration to standard diuretic treatment. We hypothesize that matched dehydration with continuous furosemide infusion, as opposed to matched dehydration with conventional diuretic treatment, is a more efficient way to diurese patients with acute HFd and overt fluid overload. Moreover, it may prevent acute kidney injury compared to the standard diuretic therapy.
Study Objectives: Our primary aim is to assess the rate of development of acute (AKI KDIGO) in acute HFd patients receiving matched dehydration during 72 hours of hospital admission, between furosemide infusion with the RenalGuard System and conventional diuretics. Secondary objectives are to evaluate fluid overload reduction, all-cause mortality and readmission at 15 days.
Study Design: All patients (both men and women) referred to the emergency department as part of the National Heart Failure Study (NaHF) who meet the criteria for acute decompensated HFd with peripheral fluid overload, estimated weight gain >4 kg, will be screened for the present protocol. All enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to diuretic treatment, either matched dehydration with conventional diuretics or matched dehydration with continuous intravenous furosemide infusion."

Around 70,000 children and adolescents visit emergency departments with chest pain each year in the United States. When idiopathic or functional in nature, chest pain has significant consequences on the child’s quality of life and utilizes significant health care resources. Children with chest pain are often subjected to unnecessary and expensive medical tests to exclude a life-threatening condition.
This pilot study addresses a gap in the literature by determining the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a self-guided mindfulness program. We hypothesize that the mindfulness-based intervention will help decrease the frequency of chest pain and improve overall quality of life.
The investigators will conduct a pilot feasibility and acceptability trial of N=60 children and adolescents who are diagnosed with idiopathic chest pain. The primary outcome is the feasibility of recruitment, retention, and program completion measured by participant recruitment and retention rates, intervention program adherence, and survey response rates. Secondary outcomes are feasibility of outcome assessments and acceptability of intervention adherence and completion. Chest pain frequency and intensity will be used to compare the treatment effects of the mindfulness and control groups.
The intervention involves a 4-week mindfulness-based intervention completed through the Headspace application. This program includes guided meditations, body-scanning meditations, and talks about the science of mindfulness and how to incorporate mindfulness into daily life.
The control group will follow the standard of care recommended by their cardiologist, which typically just includes reassurance that their chest pain is related to normal heart function. The control group will be asked to complete all outcome assessments.
The primary objectives of our study are to determine the feasibility of conducting research on mindfulness for pediatric chest pain and to document the effects of a self-guided mindfulness-based intervention on pediatric patients with idiopathic chest pain and determine if the intervention improves mental health outcomes and patient-reported outcomes of chest pain.
This is a pilot study; therefore, the statistical power and generalizability will be limited. We seek to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary effects of mindfulness on pediatric patients with idiopathic chest pain.
Study design and arms. A 2-arm, parallel-group, randomized control trial with each arm consisting of: 1) the intervention group using a mindfulness application on the phone and 2) the control group following standard medical recommendations. Participant Group/Arm: No Intervention: Standard of Care Control Participants in this arm will receive the standard of care. For patients with idiopathic chest pain, the standard of care is typically just reassurance of the benign nature of their pain. Intervention/Treatment: Mindfulness-Based Intervention Participants in this arm will partake in a 30 day mindfulness-based intervention on the mobile app Headspace. Behavioral: Mindfulness-Based Intervention * Participants in the mindfulness-based intervention (MBI) group will be asked to use the Headspace app to sequentially complete the Basics, Basics 2, and Basics 3 courses. Each of these courses lasts 10 days, and participants have the ability to choose how long daily sessions last. Participants can choose between 3, 5, or 10-minute sessions for the Basics course; 10 or 15-minute sessions for the Basics 2 course; and 10, 15, or 20-minute sessions for the Basics 3 course. These daily sessions are audio recordings that prompt users to engage in a variety of mindfulness techniques, including focusing on their body and breathing, as well as acknowledging thoughts and emotions in a non-judgmental manner."

COVID-19 vaccines such as those using the Novavax spike protein have the potential to address many of the limitations of mRNA-based vaccines, including cold chain storage, delivery via a more commonly used vaccine route (MNI/SCD) and the development of novel antivirals to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
This trial will test the non-inferiority of combination vaccination with the Novavax vaccine and the 20-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in adults aged 60 years or older by assessing the immunogenicity and safety of these vaccines when given at the same time. A total of 420 individuals in this age group will receive either combinations of NVX and PCV vaccines or placebos. Primary Objective: To demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of pneumococcal serotype-specific serum IgG Geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) for the NVX vaccine given in combination with the PCV20 vaccine, or the PCV20 vaccine given in combination with the NVX vaccine, at Day 28 compared with NVX (NCT04874131).
Secondary Objectives:
- To demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of pneumococcal serotype-specific serum IgG GMCs for the PCV20 vaccine given in combination with the NVX vaccine, or the NVX vaccine given in combination with the PCV20 vaccine, compared with PCV20 (NCT04449346).
- To demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of SARS-CoV-2 Serum IgG GMCs, SARS-CoV2 Binding Antibodies and Neutralising Antibodies GMTs for the NVX vaccine given in combination with the PCV20 vaccine, compared with NVX vaccine alone (NCT04874131).
Safety and reactogenicity: 
- To demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of Solicited Adverse Events (SAEs) for the NVX vaccine given in combination with PCV20 compared with NVX alone.
- To demonstrate non-inferiority in terms of Unsolicited Adverse Events (AEs) for the NVX vaccine given in combination with PCV20, or the PCV20 vaccine given in combination with the NVX vaccine, compared with NVX vaccine alone.
Participants aged 60 years or older (N=420) will receive either NVX or placebo according to a 1:1 randomisation followed by NVX or placebo via intramuscular injection according to a 1:1 randomisation. The first vaccine (NVX or PCV20) will be given via intramuscular injection in one upper arm. The second vaccine will be given at the same time in the other upper arm. If an individual experiences a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) at Day 30, or their clinical condition deteriorates (ie, the Investigator decides that the individual should receive additional treatment), they will be moved to another cohort to receive the alternate treatment in combination with the first one."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the prevalent metabolic disturbances of pregnancy. The prevalence of GDM is rising globally, in part due to the increase in the rates of obesity and obesity-related disorders in a reproductive age group. Studies have shown that suboptimal status of vitamin D may be associated with a high risk of GDM. However, the data is largely cross-sectional and there is a need for randomized controlled trials to confirm this association. Moreover, the investigators did not find any randomized controlled trial regarding the effect of vitamin D supplementation on GDM prevention among high-risk pregnant women. Therefore, the investigators aim to design and perform a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effect of vitamin D3 supplementation on GDM risk among high-risk pregnant women."

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with the known symptoms of a left MCA infarct. Cerebral angiography demonstrated significant 90% stenosis of the left M1 segment with distal occlusion of the left ACA and right ACA. The left ACA and right MCA have collateral vessels. The left MCA has patent distal vessels as well. The LAD was patent with no significant stenosis.There are several clinical trial options in this patient's case for both revascularization and medical management. Based on the patient's desire to undergo revascularization, the following treatment options would be appropriate: Cerebral Revascularization using Carotid Stenting1) Carotid Endarterectomy2) Cerebral Revascularization using Carotid Artery StentingThe most effective revascularization method and its time frame for this patient is unclear at this time and additional testing should be performed to more fully evaluate this patient's brain circulation, including either a TCD or a Cerebral MRI/CT Perfusion study with contrast enhancement. Once the patient is medically cleared for the procedure, and the patient is also psychologically prepared to undergo surgery, if warranted by the investigating physician, a specific treatment plan will be offered to the patient and his family for consideration. Once the treatment plan has been offered, the patient will have at least 24 hours to consider it and the patient's family will also be allowed to consult with their own physicians for further advice. If all testing results indicate that the patient will benefit from either carotid endarterectomy or cerebral artery stenting, and if the patient consents to undergo either of these procedures, then the patient will be offered these treatment options. If the patient elects to proceed with surgery, medical therapy including aspirin, clopidogrel, and statin therapy will be continued, as appropriate, in addition to the indicated surgical therapy."

The primary goal of this study is to test the feasibility and safety of a Nordic Walking (NW) intervention for community-dwelling older adults. The study will recruit fifty older adults, and they will be randomly assigned to either the NW intervention group or a control group. This will allow for a comparison between the two groups. The intervention group will receive supervised NW training, including group sessions and one-on-one training. They will also be taught how to practice independently. The control group will receive regular phone calls to discuss healthy lifestyle habits. Outcome measures include the number of participants who experience an adverse event, TUG Test, Four-Square Step Test (FSST), Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), and Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale. This study is necessary to help determine whether incorporating NW into standard care can be helpful for community-dwelling older adults."

Sexual and Gender Minority (SGM) youth are more likely to have depression, anxiety and related disorders (ADRDs) compared to their non-SGM peers. Evidence shows ADRDs onset early in adolescence, and that SGM youth do not routinely seek mental health treatment, including from specialized mental health providers such as psychologist, counselors or therapists. However, many SGM youth do go online to seek support around their mental health. In-person treatment and online treatments for SGM youths typically have different components that they engage with to provide help. The purpose of this research study is to generate a new online tool specifically designed for providing personalized and tailored messaging to help SGM youth seek mental health treatment."

Patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) has been used in the sedation and analgesia for short surgeries in recent years, and has been applied in anesthesia for colonoscopy. But there is not yet a reliable anesthesia method to ensure patients for colonoscopy are satisfied with the sedation and analgesic effect, and it is easy to make patients feel discomfort and anxiety during the procedure. According to the theory of PCA technology, we can set up the patient to give themselves some medicine according to their sensation when they feel discomfort. Compared with the general anesthesia method, patients can give some medicine before it is not necessary, reducing the drug's impact on patients and reducing the complications caused by anesthesia. Therefore, this study mainly evaluates the patient's satisfaction with the anesthesia effect and the patient's side effects under the two anesthesia methods, and then selects the appropriate anesthesia method for colonoscopy in the future."

Radiation induced acute intestinal injury (RAII) develops after radio-chemotherapy (NCRT) and can progress into chronic RAI after NCRT and radical surgery. According to the literature, the prevalence of chronic RAI was up to 24.2% after 12 months of follow-up. Unfortunately, there is no effective treatment for chronic RAI, which may lead to a decrease in quality of life, and even loss of intestinal function. Therefore, there is an urgent need to predict chronic RAI before radical surgery.
The main aim of this project is to create a prediction model of chronic RAI based on the expression levels of immune factors in tumor tissue. We found that the proportion of infiltrating CD4+FOXP3+regs in tumor tissue was significantly higher in RAI patients than in non-RAII patients. Moreover, the levels of CD8+T, CD4+T and tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) were significantly reduced in RAI patients. In this project, we will find a combination of immune factors that can better predict chronic RAI and then establish a prediction model. This prediction model can be used to make medical suggestions, and to reduce the number of patients to undergo unnecessary surgery."

Omicron has rapidly become the main circulating variant and is now the main variant of SARS-CoV-2 causing infections globally. As Omicron variant continue to evolve and become more immune-resistant from previous vaccination or previous infection, including the immune escape variant Omicron subvariant BA.2 and BA.4/5, developing vaccines against the Omicron, especially Omicron BA.4/5 variant, is urgent to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2, reduce severe cases and alleviate the pressure on medical services. Recombinant single-domain antibody or vaccines composed only of the antigen domain of the Omicron virus spike protein can enhance its specificity to the Omicron virus, while ensuring that it can neutralize other new strains caused by mutation. The S gene is the key gene of the spike protein; The recombination of BA.4/5 and delta virus is in the S gene, with the S protein sequence identity level of 99.98%, and the S protein immune escape points of Omicron and Delta are almost identical. The safety, tolerability and immune stimulation of the vaccine have been comprehensively evaluated. The vaccine may bring new options for preventing infection and further spread of Omicron BA.4/5 variant.
The Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells) based on the Omicron BA.4/5 strain, we hope it can provide a safe option for the prevention of Omicron-related new crown pneumonia. The study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary immunogenicity of the Omicron BA.4/5-Delta strain recombinant novel coronavirus protein vaccine (CHO cells) after vaccination.

We are commencing the evaluation of the safety and performance of the SEPIOLA closure device through a single-arm, non-randomized, prospective registry.
The study will be undertaken in the United States for the treatment of atrial fibrillation in subjects with at least two risk factors for thrombo-embolic complications. The risk is assessed using the CHA2DS2-VASc score. Subjects with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or greater, who are eligible or have an appropriate rationale for seeking a non-pharmacologic alternative to chronic oral anticoagulant therapy, are eligible for inclusion.
The SEPIOLA closure device intends to offer a viable alternative to traditional anticoagulant therapies by using an investigational device to mitigate the risk of blood clots forming within the left atrial appendage region (LAA) and moving into the bloodstream to potentially cause embolic events.
The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety of the SEPIOLA device.
The study design comprises an ongoing single-arm study population consisting of subjects treated with the SEPIOLA device in the LAA. All enrolled subjects contribute to the safety analysis.
The primary endpoint of SEPIOLA System safety will be evaluated by assessing device and investigational procedure-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in the full study population.
The assessment of safety and technical success are key to the overall goals and success of this study."

In this acute phase of psychotic disorders, patients often experience a poor therapeutic alliance and are reluctant to ad-here to psychiatric outpatient treatments. Motivational interviewing (MI) has been developed as an evidence-based method which increases patient's intrinsic motivation and should enhance treatment ad-herence in this setting. This study will assess whether patients in a psychotic state benefit from these therapeutic sessions.
                In the Swiss Society for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy treatment guidelines, psycho-education plays a central role in the acute phase. In the psychotherapeutic approach, which is recommended in the acute phase during in-patient stays, patients should be offered a psychotherapy with cognitive-behavioral background. Because the acute phase is characterized by a poor therapeutic alliance and only 28% of patients adhere to out-patient psychotherapy, this study aims at developing a psychotherapeutic concept especially designed for the acute phase which improves therapeutic alliance and treatment adherence. With this pilot trial the results from the first project phase (R01) have to be confirmed, which showed an increased therapeutic alliance in patients with acute psychosis treated with motivational interviewing during one-year-outpatient treatment. Therefore this study examines whether additional two sessions of MI have a greater impact on therapy adherence and therapeutic alliance in the acute setting of a psychiatric hospital.
                Consecutively recruited patients with a diagnosis of ICD-10/F2.x and good knowledge of the german language will be screened for eligibility by experienced clinical psychologist at the outpatient units of the psychosis section of the Psychiatric hospital Zurich. A total of 34 patients will be randomized into an intervention group (receiving 2 MI sessions and 2 supportive sessions) or an active control group (receiving 2 MI sessions). The interventions (MI or supportive sessions) will be carried out by professional clinical psychologists who have received several hours of specific MI training. As a measure of therapeutic alliance, we will use the German version of the Scale to Assess Therapeutic Relationship (STAR) which is rated by patients and clinicians at baseline and week 3 (or after 4 sessions of psychotherapeutic intervention. Treatment adherence is measured with an interview and the Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS). Additional measures include symptom severity (measured with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)), motivation and self-efficacy (assessed by the General Self Efficacy Scale).
                If our hypothesis is correct and motivational interviewing is superior to simple supportive conversations, we will develop an inpatient model of psychotherapy in the acute phase for psychosis which specifically increases intrinsic motivation, therapeutic alliance and adherence to psychiatric treatment in the acute setting. This concept will be essential to improve long-term out-patient adherence to psychiatric treatments."

CIN is a common genetic and epigenetic alteration that can lead to the development of malignant tumors. BileCAD is a technology able to detect chromosomal instability (CIN) related to cancer by detecting CIN from pathological specimens. In this study, the investigators will assess the sensitivity and specificity of BileCAD for malignant gallbladder tumors and cholangiocarcinoma compared with routine pathology methods. This study also intends to evaluate the consistency of the BileCAD microbial analysis results with clinical microbial culture results, so as to provide more reference for clinical diagnosis. Furthermore, the investigators also aim to detect any microbial infection in the biliary tracts of the patients, which can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of biliary tract cancers."

The aim of this study was to show whether the success of lumbar plexus block applied in lower extremity orthopedic surgeries can be evaluated by Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS), which is used to measure tissue oxygenation. A total of 70 patients who applied for elective lower extremity lower extremity orthopedic surgery were studied. Lumbar plexus block success was measured by regional oxymetry using NIRS non-invasively in the postanesthesia care unit for 1 hour. Intraoperative narcotic consumption, vital signs, sensory block level and oxygen saturation values were recorded. Surgical site NIRS device application showed success in 53 patients (75.7%) and failed in 17 patients (24.3%). NIRS values in the extremity to be operated on were comparable between the two groups after comparing all patients. When the NIRS value on the normal side of the operated extremity was accepted as a landmark, the NIRS values of the operated extremity of patients whose NIRS values were higher than this value were higher on the other side (p<0.000). In such a way, lower values were observed on the other extremity (p<0.001). In patients whose NIRS values were less than this value, lower values were observed on both extremities (p<0.001). Sensory block level was realized using algometry with an isoternic cold test. Comparing the sensitivity and specificity of NIRS in predicting the sensory block level obtained with the cold test, AUC of NIRS was calculated as 0.956 (0.968-0.944) and the specificity was calculated as 94.44% (81.78-97.75) (p<0.001). In addition, the sensitivity of NIRS was calculated as 97.75% (91.86-99.02) (p<0.001). We think that NIRS may be used as an indicator of the success of lumbar plexus block, or to make the block more successful in cases where the success is insufficient. NIRS can be added to postoperative follow-up protocols as a non-invasive marker of success, complication, postoperative analgesia and narcotic consumption."

To mitigate the impact of the COVID pandemic, the Indian Ministry of Health has approved a remote, digital implementation support system as part of its COPSI (Community care for People with Schizophrenia in India) program. The aim of this trial is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and implementation outcomes of using a digital platform for delivering training and ongoing support to the implementation team. This will include using digital videos to deliver the initial training to the Community Health Worker (CHW) team, providing on-demand support and feedback to the CHWs, and using a mobile application to support training, ongoing supervision, and monitoring. Digital training will reduce travel costs and time, increase flexibility to fit training around the daily activities and schedule of the implementation team, promote standardization of COPSI delivery, and potentially improve the quality of COPSI delivery. Digital on-demand supervision and feedback will further minimize the logistical burden on the implementation team and provide access to a wider pool of clinical support, as digital content can be shared with clinicians across multiple facilities. The outcome of this project will provide valuable data and insights that can be used to develop sustainable models of remote training and supervision for scaling up task shared psychosocial rehabilitation for schizophrenia in primary care in India."

Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a multifactorial pain disorder involving the muscles of mastication, the temporomandibular joints, and the teeth. Involved joints are synovial hinge-type joints whose movements are guided by a disk. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is associated with an increased production of inflammatory mediators. Cytokines can play a role in the pathogenesis of temporomandibular joint disorders. The aim of the present study is to examine the influence of the occlusal splint therapy on the level of inflammatory markers with a special focus on gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and blood. The hypothesis is that the use of an occlusal splint reduces the activity of inflammatory processes in TMD patients. A prospective uncontrolled study will be carried out. Patients with myalgia, arthralgia, headache attributed to TMP and painful disc displacement (with and without reduction) according to Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMP) will be assessed. A total of 20 patients will be recruited in the study. The inclusion criteria include signed informed consent and age 18 - 65 years. The exclusion criteria include degenerative joint disease and subluxation of the temporomandibular joint, head trauma orofacial pain not associated with TMD, patients with fixed or removable prostheses, patients undergoing orthodontic therapy, and patients using occlusal splints during data collection. Participants will be asked to complete self-assessment questionnaires: Graded Chronic Pain Scale (v2); Jaw Functional Limitation Scale-20; Patient Health Questionnaire-9; General Anxiety Disorder-7; Patient Health Questionnaire-15; Oral Behaviors Checklist; Oral health Impact Profile; and Perceived Stress Scale-10. Occlusal splints will be made from hard acrylate resin by the same dental technician in the dental laboratory. The GCF will be collected with paper strips at baseline, immediately after adjustment, and after three months of therapy (after one month of wear). Cytokines levels will be measured in gingival crevicular fluid and whole blood with the use of special multiplex assays. The level of inflammatory markers will predict treatment outcomes and provide insights into potential new treatment options for TMD."

This study offers digital training on an evidence-based, individual treatment known as Community Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT), for counselors working with families affected by Opioid Use Disorder (OUD). Participants will be offered three levels of digital training, including a tutorial of an overview of CRAFT, tailored digital training modules, and feedback and coaching. If shown to be effective, this scalable and cost-effective approach has the potential to dramatically impact the lives of those families impacted by OUD. This training and coaching program is designed to give counseling care-providers the tools, knowledge, and skills necessary to implement evidence-based individual treatment (CRAFT) to help them get their clients with OUD into treatment and help them stay there. CRAFT (Community Reinforcement and Family Training) is a short-term outpatient treatment that helps those dealing with loved ones who have OUD, and in its most recent form, helps those struggling with SUDs (Substance Use Disorders). It uses a combination of motivational enhancement therapy, information about substance use disorders, substance-free activities and rewards to help families cope with the impact that substance use has on their lives and the life of their loved one. This study, like a study we completed on the effects of the same digital tutorial (T) for CRAFT on CRAFT knowledge in counselors, will evaluate the effects of three levels of digital training on the content knowledge of counselors in CRAFT skills, as well as their ability to engage treatment seeking loved ones of individuals with OUD in treatment entry and treatment. This study will not include the CRAFT family member.

Inclusion criteria: The study is recruiting licensed counseling professionals in the U.S. who work with affected families who have people in their lives with OUD. Participants must not have been trained in CRAFT and they must work with or be planning to work with at least 5 clients each week.

Design: This is an experimental clinical group study with a pilot randomized clinical trial on the effects of three levels of digital training on content knowledge of counselors in CRAFT skills.

Training: Participants will receive either an overview of CRAFT or the full training series or access to both, with and without a coaching component of this training.

Following 3-months of training, participants will complete an assessment including questionnaires, interviews, and an assessment of their skills in treating patients with OUD, by using recorded audio or video sessions of meetings with patients.

After training, participants will complete questionnaires every month until the 3 month marker. Following the 3 month marker, participants will complete questionnaires every 3 months for 1 year.

This study will follow a research design known as a parallel assignment. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the three training levels. This is done by using a computer randomization process and an internet survey vendor to create an allocation key. Using this allocation key, the system will randomize participants to one of the three training groups. Participants will be told which training program they are assigned to upon completing the assessment of their pre-training knowledge. Blinded assessors will not know who is in which training group.

Cardiac transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is an infiltrative cardiomyopathy with an inexorably progressive clinical course and poor prognosis. The disease is caused by misfolding of the liver-derived precursor protein transthyretin as a result of an acquired wild-type variant (ATTRwt) or as a hereditary mutant variant (ATTRm). Application of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides greater anatomic resolution, enabling the assessment of amyloid burden within individual left ventricle segments. This study aims to describe the pattern of regional myocardial distribution of 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanedicarboxylic acid (DPD) SPECT uptake among patients with ATTRwt and ATTRm. It will investigate the clinical, biochemical and echocardiographical, including left ventricle longitudinal strain profile in ATTRwt and ATTRm. Moreover, we will evaluate the presence and extent of DPD cardiac uptake among asymptomatic ATTRm variants carriers. This is a prospective multi-center observational study. The study, after obtaining prior written informed consent, will include consecutive patients who have Grade 1-3 cardiac DPD retention in scintigraphy. In addition, first-degree relatives of patients with ATTRm are going to be enrolled. Patients are going to undergo TTR gene sequencing to assess the presence of pathogenic variants associated with ATTRm. Both planar scintigraphy, SPECT and speckle-tracking echocardiography will be reviewed and interpreted using visual and quantitative approaches. The collected data will be analyzed statistically to verify research hypotheses. Approval from the local Bioethical Committee will be obtained before carrying out the study. All procedures performed are going to be in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments, or comparable ethical standards."

The aim of the long-term study of the Post COVID syndrome in children is to identify postcovid-19 symptoms in children, to identify and monitor biomarkers for the presence and development of postcovid-19 syndrome in children, to determine the prevalence and dynamics of the disease, to identify the effectiveness of non-pharmacological methods of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation of post-covid patients in children. The study will be carried out in children aged from 6 to 18 years. Research will be conducted with a control and study groups. All children who have had a New Coronavirus infection will be divided into 2 groups: the study group, children aged from 6 to 18 years, with a confirmed New Coronavirus infection by laboratory studies, with the postcovid-19 syndrome, and the control group, children aged from 6 to 18 years, who had a New Coronavirus infection under the guise of a common viral respiratory infection or COVID-19, asymptomatic or atypical signs (fever, loss of appetite, headache, body pain, weakness) were not detected. Based on the data obtained during the study, the effectiveness of preventive measures (taking into account medical records, data on the quality of life, patient satisfaction) is planned to be evaluated. To study the early post-covid syndrome will be conducted daily monitoring of the dynamics of all symptoms, the level of stress before and after the development of post-covid-19 syndrome and other laboratory parameters, questionnaires and a physical examination of children of different age groups during 14 days after the detection. In addition, for the effective prevention and rehabilitation of Long COVID in children, the proposed study may reveal new aspects of the pathogenesis of this syndrome, and also contribute to the discovery of new biomarkers of the disease and its relationship with clinical and laboratory manifestations of the post-covid-19 syndrome in the future."

Rationale: Falls are common in older adults after total knee replacement (TKR). One reason is that older adults often lose muscle mass and strength in their lower extremities after knee joint replacement owing to an extended period of inactivity and muscle disuse. This muscle weakness places them at an increased risk for slips and trips, that can result in loss of balance and falls. We propose to address these deficits with the use of a perturbation training device to mimic tripping or stumbling and to provide older adults with task-specific training that will enhance the safety of the postoperative period.
Method: We will recruit 374 older adults who are scheduled for primary (elective) unilateral total knee replacement and will undergo a baseline assessment that includes both clinical and objective measures of upper and lower extremity function. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group (training) will receive a brief training program on balance disturbances delivered on a treadmill. The other group (control) will receive written materials on fall prevention. Following the randomization, participants will undergo a follow-up assessment at two weeks, six weeks, and six months after their initial assessment. All assessments will be in-person except for the phone assessment, which will be made at two weeks, six weeks, and six months to monitor for falls during these periods.
Expected Results: Compared to the control group, the training group will have better upper extremity function at two weeks, six weeks, and six months, better lower extremity function at two weeks and six weeks, and fewer falls one year after total knee replacement. The improvement in upper extremity muscle function and greater reduction in postoperative fall rate will reflect the effectiveness of the perturbation training program in addressing the fall risk that may arise from lower extremity weakness after total knee replacement. These findings may be applicable to other surgeries (e.g., hip-replacement surgery) and to age-related decline in mobility.
Importance: This research has potential to dramatically reduce fall rates and improve outcomes for older adults undergoing total knee replacement. These patients present to their orthopedic surgeon's clinic before their scheduled surgery to discuss the risks of postoperative problems like deep-vein thrombosis or pneumonia. However, fall risk is rarely discussed with most orthopedic surgeons considering falls to be an inevitable consequence of knee osteoarthritis rather than a modifiable problem. Our proposed study will change this perception to encourage more physicians to consider modifiable factors such as muscle weakness and balance difficulty before the patient undergoes knee-replacement surgery. Improving postoperative training will provide a model for addressing other functional deficits after knee replacement, such as quadriceps muscle weakness and decreased function in the operated knee. Furthermore, the strategies employed in our study (perturbation training; postoperative assessment and monitoring for falls) may be useful in reducing the fall rate of older adults who do not wish to undergo knee-replacement surgery for hip-related osteoarthritis or hip replacement.

Hypotension is very common during surgery, and appears to be significantly linked to a greater chance of death within a month after surgery, but this association remains uncertain because most prior studies do not have accurate blood pressure information or sufficient numbers of older, frailer people with dementia who have hip fracture. This study will quantify the actual prevalence, depth and duration of this hypotension in those who have received surgery for hip fracture. Outcomes will also be correlated with recorded demographic, clinical and procedural factors, including mortality and length of inpatient stay.

A post hoc analysis is planned, to further improve the cohort. The investigator will extract data from the electronic anaesthetic records of people (over the age of 18 years) who have received surgery for any fracture (other than traumatic hip fracture) at Princess Royal Hospital, Brighton under low dose spinal anaesthesia (1.3mls 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine, following fascia iliaca block + sedation) between February 2019 and January 2020. This will allow evaluation of broader applicability by including data from people who have had hip fracture surgery as well as many other fracture types, whilst remaining consistent with the primary analysis by focusing on this specific procedure and anaesthetic."

The investigators hypothesize that malaria, intestinal parasitic diseases, and vitamin A and folate/B12 deficiency may result in enhanced or tolerogenic innate immune responses that decrease the risk of symptomatic COVID-19. On the other hand, these conditions and deficiency in these micronutrients may decrease the acquisition of vaccines, or may increase the risk of viral re-infection in humans exposed to malaria, intestinal parasitic diseases, and vitamin A/folate deficiency. The research team will test these hypotheses using the data collected in this protocol, by evaluating the innate immune phenotypes, antibody responses, and immune memory that differentiate uninfected Malawians from well matched Western controls, and whether those responses correlate to SARS-CoV-2 transmission and development of symptomatic COVID-19. The team will also evaluate how these innate immune responses respond to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination compared to the well-matched control groups, and will explore whether early treatment with corticosteroids affects the development of neutralizing antibodies and SARS-CoV-2 transmission in household contacts and vaccinees."

Background: 
Postoperative urinary retention (PUR) can develop after any surgical procedure. This complication is more common in elderly male patients, trauma, and emergency cases. The prevalence of PUR in orthopedic surgeries varies between 6-40% in the literature. The application of hot and cold to muscles, tendons, and joints is very common in orthopedic surgeries. This practice has a significant impact on the physiological activities of the bladder muscles. As nurses, it would be useful to determine the effect of this application applied to the bladder on the prevalence of PUR in orthopedic surgeries. 
Objective: 
The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of hot and cold application to the bladder on postoperative urinary retention in orthopedic surgery patients. The secondary purpose is to evaluate the hot and cold application applied to the bladder in the management of postoperative urinary retention.
Study Design and Methods: 
The prospective, randomized, single blinded study was conducted at the Physiotherapy and Rehabilitation Service of a university hospital affiliated to the Ministry of Health. The population of the study was composed of individuals between the ages of 18-60. The sample of the study consisted of 105 individuals.
Descriptive statistical methods will be used to evaluate the data. Independent sample t test, Mann Whitney U, chi-square test, and McNemar test will be used as the parametric test for comparison between groups. The level of significance for the study was p<0.05.
Conclusion: 
It is thought that studies will contribute to the increase in the awareness of nurses and the literature about the effects of hot and cold application on postoperative urinary retention in orthopedic surgery patients."

Pancreatitis is a multifactorial disease of the pancreas, characterized by inflammation and necrosis. Acute pancreatitis (AP) is an acute exacerbation of the pancreatic parenchyma, which is manifested by a persistent or episodic abdominal pain, accompanied by elevated serum amylase or lipase concentrations. Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a pathological process of chronic relapsing or persistent inflammation of the pancreas. 
Acute pancreatitis is a highly heterogeneous disease with a wide range of clinical prognosis and severity. It can progress from mild gall stone pancreatitis to severe acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) with rapid progression, multi-organ failure and mortality. Severe ANP is typically characterized by local complications, such as pancreatic necrosis and peripancreatic inflammatory changes, systemic complications, such as multiple organ failure and severe infection, or by persistent organ failure that lasts more than 48 hours, which may extend to 1 year or more. The current global incidence of acute pancreatitis is estimated to be about 25 per 100,000 people, of which about 20% have moderate or severe acute pancreatitis, leading to high morbidity and mortality.
An important subgroup of adult acute pancreatitis (aAP) is gall stone pancreatitis (GSP), which represents about 30% to 40% of aAP; It usually has a good prognosis and high recovery rate, often requiring non-specific conservative treatment. However, aAP is often considered as a heterogeneous disease, with the risk of recurrence after its remission, which may lead to recurrent pancreatitis, permanent organ dysfunction and chronic pancreatitis. In recent years, with the continuous improvement of medical treatment technology, the survival rate of acute pancreatitis has increased year by year, but the overall burden of the disease has been increasing. Studies show that 10% to 15% of adult patients with acute pancreatitis during hospitalization have recurrent pancreatitis, and the mortality rate can reach 10%. In addition, some patients with severe pancreatitis may develop into long-term complications, and even have a higher risk of organ failure and mortality.
Studies have shown that at least 14% of patients with acute pancreatitis have multiple events of recurrent acute pancreatitis. According to relevant reports, the recurrence rate of acute pancreatitis is different at different stages of the disease. The recurrence risk of acute pancreatitis within 24 to 48 hours after the first onset is extremely high (about 35.8%). The first recurrence during hospitalization is high, with a recurrence rate of 15%, and the recurrence rate reaches 20% within 1 year after the first onset. The overall recurrence rate of patients with moderate acute pancreatitis is 25%, and the recurrence rate of severe acute pancreatitis is as high as 50%.
The recurrence of acute pancreatitis imposes a significant burden on patients and society. According to reports, the risk of pancreatitis within 5 years after the first episode was 28%, and the cumulative risk of recurrence in 30 years after the first episode was 41%. Therefore, how to predict and control the recurrence of acute pancreatitis is an urgent clinical problem, which is also an important aspect of the follow-up care of acute pancreatitis.
Traditional clinical risk factors and imaging data have a shortage in predicting acute pancreatitis. On the one hand, traditional clinical risk factors only consider the prognosis and development of acute pancreatitis through the characteristics of the disease itself and the complication rates associated with the disease. On the other hand, the evaluation of pancreatic morphology and function through imaging data provides only a general qualitative assessment, which is limited by the quantification and prediction of the disease.
Radiomics feature (RF) refers to the set of quantitative and semi-quantitative features that were extracted from the imaging data. This feature includes a large number of continuous features, which are more comprehensive, accurate and quantitative than the traditional qualitative image features. At present, radiomics has been applied to the prediction of prognosis in diseases such"

There are not currently any drugs that reduce the number of red blood cells (polycythemia) of individuals with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The number of red blood cells in OSA patients is increased. Sleep apnea leads to intermittent hypoxemia, which can increase the formation of red blood cells. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment improves sleep apnea and night-time hypoxemia, but its effect on the number of red blood cells in these patients is unclear. The investigators believe that CPAP treatment may reduce the number red blood cells in OSA patients by reducing night-time hypoxemia. To determine this, the investigators will compare the number of red blood cells in OSA subjects between those treated with CPAP and those treated with usual care. The investigators will also study the relationship between CPAP treatment and daytime sleepiness and quality of life."

This study aims to compare magnetic resonance imaging images (MRI) in three different surgical methods (lateral suspension by mesh, pectopexy, and sacrospinous ligament fixation) in patients undergoing surgical treatment for apical prolapse. This study is planned with the hypothesis that these three different surgical methods will not give significant difference in the changes in the vaginal axis, which is a significant reason for the recurrence of these surgeries.
The main objective of the study is to compare the vaginal axis change after the three different prolapse surgeries. The secondary objectives are to assess whether the surgery selected causes a change in the patient's pain level, patient-perceived prolapse symptom severity, and the quality of life of patients undergoing any surgery to correct the apical prolapse.
If the surgical procedure provides a change in the vaginal axis, this may lead to a decrease in the recurrence of symptoms. However, if the changes in the vaginal axis do not vary significantly among the three different surgical methods, it is possible that all three procedures can be used to correct the apical prolapse with the same efficiency. When it comes to pain control and improvements in sexual experience, the study is expected to provide results with a low probability of Type I error."

To evaluate the effectiveness of scenario-based standardized patient simulation training and electronic fetal monitor management of midwifery students, the participants in the study will be exposed to electronic fetal monitor management and patient care activities in theoretical lessons for 5 weeks; the theory lessons of the participants in the experimental group will be applied only with high, realistic scenario-based standardized patient simulation training. The control group will be given theory lessons, while in the experimental group, only high realistic scenario-based standardized patient simulation training will be given. In addition, the satisfaction of the students from their own simulation training experiences and their ability to perform a specific task when given a task they have never tried before will be evaluated with their own self-efficacy scales (Self-efficacy Scale in Monitoring and Management of Electronic Fetal Monitoring)."

Background and Rationale: Prolonged mechanical ventilation with respiratory failure has become an increasingly common problem in the ICUs. The prevalence of mechanical ventilation (MV) is relatively constant at between 30-40% of admissions. Among critically ill patients that required invasive mechanical ventilation (MV), an average of 75% of patients required prolonged mechanical ventilation. These patients consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources and clinician time. There are no specific criteria for discharge from MV. The discharge criteria are based on the decision of the attending clinicians. However, the length of MV stays is quite variable among ICUs. The decision to discontinue MV is often influenced by the availability of long-term care for patients. Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy require a different level of care for which the family or caregivers require training to provide appropriate care. Several studies reported prolonged weaning period, multiple failure and reintubation, and a poor long-term outcome of patients undergoing prolonged mechanical ventilation. Patient with prolonged weaning failures have up to 10 times higher mortality risk than those with uneventful or straightforward weaning. The prevalence of multiple hospitalization days is higher in those requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Many patients undergoing prolonged MV face the need for long term care (long term oxygen therapy (LTOT), home care, or rehabilitation) and are associated with increased family burden and costs. There is a variation in prolonged mechanical ventilation between different parts of the world. Thus the duration of MV varies from five to seven weeks in the United States and 16-21 days in European countries. In a retrospective chart audit of 12150 ICU patients from 40 UK intensive care units, 16% patients required ICU length of stay (LOS) more than 19 days. Prognostic factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation: Several studies reported the prognostic factors for prolonged mechanical ventilation are age, gender, underlying diseases, initial severity of disease, the number of life support devices used, length of stay in ICUs, acute organ failure, the number of ICU re-admission, and the need for re-intubation. Objective of the study: The investigators plan to compare the clinical outcomes in patients with and without severe organ dysfunction using prolonged mechanical ventilation. To study the clinical outcomes and predictors of death in critically ill patients undergoing prolonged MV. To determine the frequency of re-admission to the ICU with prolonged mechanical ventilation. To study the long-term outcome of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. To assess the family needs and resource availability in providing care for patients following prolonged mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy. To develop a training package for health professionals with the help of tracheostomy patients and their caregivers."

Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor represents the standard of care for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, in ACS patients undergoing PCI, more potent P2Y12 inhibitors (namely, prasugrel or ticagrelor) are preferred over clopidogrel based on results of large-scale clinical trials. Nevertheless, such ischemic benefit occurs at the expense of increased bleeding compared with patients receiving DAPT with clopidogrel. However, accruing evidence from recent studies propose the use of pharmacodynamic guided therapy to reduce bleeding complications without jeopardizing ischemic efficacy. Such bleeding reduction approaches include 1) DAPT de-escalation (the switch from potent P2Y12 inhibitors to less potent agents with clopidogrel while maintaining aspirin) and 2) potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy (i.e., the maintenance of potent P2Y12 inhibitors with prasugrel or ticagrelor while dropping aspirin). The purpose of this study is to compare for the first time these two strategies in ACS patients undergoing PCI treated with DAPT with at least one month with prasugrel or ticagrelor. We hypothesize that the 30-day thrombus formation in patients treated with potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy is non-inferior to that seen with DAPT de-escalation."

Increasing age is associated with a decline in the number of larger, HDL subparticles that are primarily responsible for removing cholesterol from the arteries.  This is a major risk factor for heart disease.  Eggs have been shown to increase HDL particle size, and we hypothesize that higher intakes of eggs, especially egg yolks, can improve HDL function in older adults.  To determine the effect of diet on large HDL subparticles, we will enroll 65 (32 young and 33 older) participants in a 10-week crossover study in which we will measure immune and lipid responses to a run-in period of 2 weeks without eggs, followed by 4 weeks of whole egg (n=21), egg white (n=21), or egg yolk (n=23), which will be provided as a liquid egg supplement.  The supplements will be followed by a 4-week washout and then the participants will consume a different type of egg for another 4 weeks in random order.  The primary focus of the research is on larger HDL subparticles, which are more effective at removing excess cholesterol from the body and are declining with age in both men and women.  In addition, we will measure markers of immune function and the effect of egg intake in these sub-groups.  The findings of this research will provide valuable information for public health recommendations regarding the role of eggs in preventing disease, improving longevity, and optimizing health outcomes."

Background: Prosthetic myoelectric control can provide patients with greater functional autonomy and prosthesis independence. However, it is typically accompanied by increased time for upper limb function as amputees need more time to plan their movements, select the correct movement, and initiate and control the prosthesis. Therefore, upper limb amputees require substantial motor learning and re-learning effort to operate myoelectric prostheses. One strategy to improve this process is functional task training, in which amputees have an opportunity to practice operating myoelectric prostheses in real-world tasks. However, clinical-level myoelectric prostheses that offer such realistic training experiences are typically cost-prohibitive. Augmented reality (AR) offers an opportunity to create a high-fidelity simulation of the prosthetic myoelectric control process in a lower-cost manner; furthermore, an AR simulation can offer additional opportunities for visualization and training. To address this gap, the purpose of this study is to improve the functionality of individuals with upper limb amputations using a patient-driven AR simulation. Methods: 25 unilateral trans-radial amputees will be recruited for this study. Participants first complete baseline assessments, which take the form of a detailed evaluation of everyday activities with a Certified Prosthetist and a clinical assessor (ACMC). They are then randomized to one of two conditions: experimental or sham control. Sham Control will receive motor imagery (imagining performing tasks with their missing limb) while experimental participants will complete functional task training using the MyoTrain AR system. In addition, both groups will undergo functional task training to improve their capacity for control (CFO) with their current prosthetic control strategy. Outcome measures will assess both lower limb function (walking and standing performance) and upper limb function (capacity to control a prosthesis and perform real tasks). Assessments will also explore the impact of augmented reality training on the patients’ prosthetic use and motivation to use the prosthesis.

The primary objective of this multicenter prospective randomized controlled study is to evaluate whether electrical stimulation of the stomach is able to reduce the incidence or duration of postoperative ileus in patients undergoing extensive oncological surgery including or without hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) as in the appendiceal neoplasm. The investigators will include approximately 109 patients (55 randomized to both the intervention and sham-control group).
Cytoreductive surgery in the treatment of advanced gastrointestinal tumors is often combined with intraperitoneal chemotherapy (IPC), which results in reduced quality of life by ileus and ileus-related complications that result in prolonged hospital stays and delayed initiation of systemic chemotherapy.
The investigators will evaluate whether or not the electrical stimulation of the stomach is able to reduce the need for naso- or naso-gastric tube insertion in postoperative period from an average of 21, 6 days to a maximum of 8-9 days. In total, the investigators will include 109 eligible patients. The investigators will evaluate the time to a first passage of stool.
Cytoreductive surgery of patients is associated with an increased risk of ileus. The risk factors for ileus are often related to patients´ anatomy and the extent of the surgery. Postoperative complications as in ileus lead to a prolonged hospital stay (average 23 days), need for postoperative interventions (24- 30 %) and delayed initiation of systemic adjuvant chemotherapy (10-13 days). 
The investigators believe that electrical stimulation of the stomach and thus facilitating bowel motility postoperative can reduce ileus by shortening the time to a first stool passage, reducing complications (length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, surgical site infections (SSI), ileus-related complications including aspiration pneumonia) and length of hospital stay and the risk of ileus-related complications.
This randomized controlled trial will examine whether electrical stimulation of the stomach (electrical pace maker) initiated within 48 hrs after surgery can reduce the risk of postoperative ileus and subsequent complications.
Inclusion criteria: Patients planned for elective cytoreductive surgery due to either colorectal or appendiceal cancer or with peritoneal metastases or due to pseudomyxoma peritonei will be evaluated for eligibility. Other conditions may be included on the principal researchers discretion. If inclusion is possible, the patient will meet for oral and written information and written and oral informed consent. Patients aged > 18 years.
The intervention group will receive electrical pacing of the stomach via a gastric electrical pacemaker (Gastric Electric Pacing, GEP) initiated within 48 hrs after surgery
The sham control group (SCG) will receive a placebo GEP initiated within 48 hrs.
The investigators will collect patient registry. Data on gender, age, comorbidities, reoperations, surgery type, time for ileus, antibiotic prophylaxis and complications will be collected via electronic medical records (EMR). The investigators will collect information through the GEP-app.
The investigators will use a daily patient diary with information on stool, flatus and bowel movements."

Patients will be admitted to the palliative care service at the hospital and 20 patients will be included in the study and data will be collected. The research is planned as a randomized controlled trial. The individuals in the research group are divided into four groups as music group, aromatherapy group, music and aromatherapy and control group. The patients in the experimental group will listen to music with headphones for 20 minutes for three consecutive days. The music group listened to specially composed MusiCure® compositions in soft rhythm, including melodies with harp, cello, strings and natural sound elements (eg rain, bird, forest sound). The patients in the aromatherapy group will inhale lavender oil. The investigators evaluated the effect of aromatherapy, music and their combination on the pain, anxiety and vital parameters of patients. To compare the pre and post pain and anxiety levels in the music and aromatherapy group, pain, anxiety and vital parameters were recorded before the intervention and at the end of the intervention with data collection tools.

- This is a randomized controlled study.
- No adverse events were observed in individuals who applied music and aromatherapy.

Conclusion: Listening to the relaxing music group and aromatherapy group significantly affects pain and anxiety status in patients with palliative stage cancer. Using music and aromatherapy together can improve these parameters. Further Studies need to involve larger samples of participants and more diverse music and aromatherapy interventions."

Amputees experience reduced feedback and sensitivity from the lower limb, which contributes to falls and instability during activities of daily living. The Somatosensation Device (SD) aims to improve feedback and sensation in the residual limb for amputees experiencing sensory deficits. The goal of the SD is to provide improved somatosensory input to subjects, in order to promote and maintain gait stability in the absence of proprioceptive feedback. This project is the first step in developing an effective neuroprosthetic device to prevent falls in lower limb amputees. We will be testing the effectiveness of the SD in improving functional balance and gait through a repeated measures, crossover design, where participants will have the opportunity to wear the device and perform a series of gait tests at different time points.
By wearing the Somatosensation Device, participants will engage in a three-minute walk at baseline (no device), post-intervention (with the device), and one month follow-up (with the device). Gait parameters collected include walking speed, stride length, time in stance phase, and more.
The Somatosensation Device consists of a waistband electrode unit providing electrical stimuli to the skin and dura over the lumbar region, which are designed to increase the excitability of dorsal root ganglia neurons, promoting input through the spinal cord. In addition, tactile stimulators in the sleeve of the device provide inputs to the skin and dura over the lower limb(s).
By increasing somatosensory input from the lower limbs for subjects with unilateral or bilateral sensory deficits, the Somatosensation Device has the potential to benefit the target population by reducing gait instability in everyday activities and maintaining independent ambulation."

This study is a proof-of-concept study that utilizes a new, lightweight, self-contained, non-invasive OtoBand (experimental device) that has received a Therapeutic Breakthrough Device designation by the FDA that is designed to provide temporary relief within one hour of starting use of an episode of vertigo. This study will be conducted in multiple groups and arms will be determined by data collected during the two week baseline phase of the study. 64% of the participants will be randomized in moderately worse condition (MoW) groups and 36% will be randomized in high vertigo symptom (QoL) groups. Participants will each receive either the OtoBand (experimental device) or sham. The purpose of this study is to determine if the OtoBand provides temporary relief for vertigo in participants with vestibular vertigo, a highly prevalent condition which is one of the 10 most common medical problems. Participants will be enrolled in a virtual manner, and will complete a one day enrollment meeting and an approximately 14 day Baseline Phase. After the Baseline Phase, participants will be placed in one of two groups Moderate or Worse (MoW) or Quality of Life (QoL) groups based on the data collected about their vertigo during the Baseline Phase. Participants will then be randomized within their assigned group (MoW or QoL) at a 2:1 ratio to an active arm or sham arm to begin the Treatment Phase of the study. Participants will be sent a study device to use when they have a vertigo episode. Participants that enroll in the study are expected to participate up to 49 days with virtual meetings at the approximate intervals: MoW Group: Day 21, Day 24, Day 31, and Day 42 QoL Group : Day 16, Day, 24, Day 36, and Day 49 Participants will be required to complete the DHI (Dizziness Handicap Index), VSS (Vertigo Symptom Scale), Global Impression of Symptoms, and Global Impression of Change questionnaires."

BACKGROUND: Chitin-Glucan dietary supplement has been proven to be a good alternative for the management of active Ulcerative Colitis and Crohn's disease in the absence of specific therapy, but its effects on abdominal pain, bloating, quality of life, and inflammation in Crohn's patients in remission under a stable medical therapy are still unclear.
An increasing body of evidence suggests that there is a substantial overlap between Crohn's disease and Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome often suffer from debilitating symptoms and a low quality of life. In some cases, these patients may be difficult to differentiate clinically from Crohn's patients, even under the assumption of having a normal bowel endoscopy.
HYPOTHESIS: In Crohn's patients with IBS-like symptoms during a stable maintenance therapy, the inclusion of a daily chitin-glucan supplementation may reduce subjective symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, and dyschesia, while improving functional and emotional aspects of patients' daily lives.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:
It consists of a 10-week randomized double-blinded crossover trial using BK003 (chitin-glucan) as an investigational product and Placebo as a comparator (1:1), at a single center in Lille, France. Thirty four Crohn's disease patients will be included in this double-blinded trial. The inclusion criteria are: Adult patients ≥ 18 years old and ≤ 75 years old, Clinical remission (according to the investigator), Absence of inflammatory markers at Visit 1, Presence of IBS-like symptoms according to Rome IV criteria, Likert scale ≥ 3 for abdominal pain at Visit 0, Patient with correct and complete reporting of the study questionnaires and scores during the run-in period (≥ 75% completion). Patients who will agree to use acceptable methods of birth control (oral, transdermal, systemic contraception, intrauterine device, condom) for the duration of the study. Patients capable of communicating with the investigator, replying to the questionnaires, and understanding the requirements and constraints of the study protocol, Possession of a digital device (i.e., smartphone or tablet), Patient willing to adhere to the study visit schedule and able to understand and comply with protocol requirements and product administration. The primary objective is to compare the effect of BK003 on the subject's global assessment (SGA) of relief responder rate. Secondary objectives include weekly change from baseline in mean 7-point Likert scale for each of the symptoms, 7-point Likert scale for individual stool symptom for each patient, BSS score, number of stool per day, IBS-related quality of life score, Anxiety and depression, serum CRp, fecal calprotectine, alpha diversity and the relative abundance of bacterial, viral and fungal taxa in stools, and occurrence and severity of adverse events. The assessment will be performed for 7 days before the randomization visit, during the 6-weeks intervention period and for 3 weeks after the crossover, representing a total follow-up period of 10 weeks.
68 patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either BK003 or Placebo 1:4:4, corresponding to a 60% chance of each patient receiving both BK003 and Placebo period during the crossover period. Patients will be instructed to take a daily dose of 3 grams of BK003 or Placebo during randomization visit, with one week of wash-out before switching to the other treatment during period II. The outcome assessments will be performed during this 2-times 6-weeks period."

In a previous study by our center, we demonstrated the value of a novel personalized chimera DNA as a liquid biopsy for the detection and monitoring of HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Our findings implied that the DNA released from HBV-infected liver cancer cells is more abundant than its HBV-coding DNA. We proposed to capture and quantify these non-coding DNA fragments as a tumor-specific biomarker. The investigators now plan to explore a new type of chimera DNA, the HBV-human junction DNA (vh-DNA), as the potential biomarker using the next-generation sequencing (NGS), and ddPCR technology. In order to generate the vh-DNA, viral genomic DNA integrates into the host genomic DNA at many positions during HBV replication. The investigators expect that vh-DNA can be generated exclusively from the original hepatocellular cancer cells and is different from DNA released from normal liver or regenerated cancer cells after transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), which is crucial for early evaluation of treatment response and post-radiotherapy recurrence/metastasis. Since vh-DNA are from individual patients, it has the potential to be considered as personalized liquid biopsies reflecting the clonality of HCC. To confirm whether this novel vh-DNA provides a more potent biomarker than previous traditional ctDNA, the investigators will analyze 100 HBV-related HCC samples, collected from patients who have undergone curative-intent liver-directed therapies. The investigators will further prospectively study the clinical value of this biomarker in 270 patients treated with radiotherapy. The investigators aim to explore the value of pre- and post-RT changes of vh-DNA in predicting the response of anti-tumor therapy and prognosis of the patients. The investigators will collect 6-12 samples at the 1st, 4th, and 7th month after RT, and at recurrence or metastasis up to 6 years. In 54 recurrent or metastatic tumors, the investigators will correlate clonality assessed with vh-DNA with the pattern of failure as the original or a de novo one, and explore the genetic changes associated with the development of recurrent/metastatic tumor. These findings will be the basis for the establishment of a new clinical trial involving combination treatment. In summary, the investigators hypothesized that vh-DNA could predict treatment response better than contemporary images, and it may serve as a personalized biomarker for the evaluation of treatment response, prediction of prognosis, and differentiation of clonality at tumor recurrence/progression. The investigators will collect the blood samples at routine follow-ups to explore the novel use of this biomarker and its impact on clinical practice. The investigators expect that the novel biomarker of personalized vh-DNA would allow earlier evaluating the therapy response and detect early recurrence/metastasis, which is crucial for individualizing the treatment for HBV-related HCC patients."

1) investigate nutritional intake, nutritional status, and physical activity level in rehabilitation after a major dysvascular lower limb amputation (LLA)
2) assess the impact of LLA on nutritional intake, nutritional status, and physical activity level
3) explore the association of nutritional intake, nutritional status, and physical activity level with LLA outcomes/complications (e.g., mortality, wound healing, health-related quality of life)
4) provide evidence-based nutrition advice for this population."

This prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover, proof-of-concept study assesses the feasibility and efficacy of a decentralized clinical trial employing remote continuous remote data collection for monitoring treatment effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin after the addition or substitution of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist finerenone in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus and proteinuria. The feasibility of conducting a personalized, remote data collection study is assessed from three perspectives: The patient's perspective, the usability of remote monitoring devices (capillary blood pressure, body weight, and urinalysis), and the logistic and administrative aspects. Data will be collected at the screening visit and from the baseline and end of the treatment with empagliflozin +/- finerenone (4 weeks treatment, 4 weeks follow-up, with a one-week washout) study phase. The total study period is 13 months. Participants will continue the treatment with empagliflozin +/- finerenone until their personal target is reached or until they develop unacceptable adverse events or if they are unable to continue the treatment on the grounds of study completion criteria.

The study is a prospective, randomized, controlled, open-label, crossover, proof-of-concept study on 60 participants, with 30 participants randomized in arm A receiving empagliflozin 10 mg once daily with or without finerenone (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day) for 4 weeks, and with 30 participants randomized in arm B receiving empagliflozin 10 mg once daily with or without finerenone (10 mg/day or 20 mg/day) for 4 weeks. After the initial phase, both arms receive a 1 week wash-out and subsequently the treatment groups will be switched and administered the alternative treatment for 4 weeks. Primary outcomes are feasibility (determined by patient acceptability, monitoring device usability, and logistic feasibility), and treatment effects (determined by changes in UACR, systolic blood pressure, body weight, creatinine clearance, and fasting plasma glucose from the start to final visit). Secondary outcomes are the treatment effects measured after an additional 4 week period.

Participants are screened based on a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory values. Inclusion criteria are as follows: aged ≥18 years; treatment with empagliflozin for at least 3 months prior to inclusion; confirmed diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes mellitus; screening UACR between 55 and 330 mg/g Albumin:Creatinine Ratio (UACR); estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD-eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening; treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg (10 mg once daily or 10 mg twice daily) during the study according to the respective label recommendation; treatment with finerenone 10 or 20 mg once daily. Exclusion criteria include pregnancy, known hypersensitivity to finerenone or empagliflozin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (MDRD-eGFR) <30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening, and current treatment with oral antidiabetic drugs (with the exception of metformin) in addition to empagliflozin during the screening visit.

Participants are randomized in stratified fashion, with random allocation for each participant based on the presence of micro- or macroalbuminuria. Randomization is done centrally using a computerized randomization procedure. Treatment allocation is balanced across study groups on the basis of sex and initial microalbuminuria. Treatment groups are assigned sequentially after stratification and after informed consent has been signed by the participants. The full study arms are disclosed by the study staff after randomization. The intervention model is a prospective, open-label, crossover trial, and the participants will not be masked for the treatment. All participants undergo a one-time run-in period of 8 weeks with the administration of empagliflozin (10 mg once daily or 10 mg twice daily) prior to randomization at Visit 3. Afterwards, based on stratification and randomization, the participants will be allocated to one of the study groups (Arm A or Arm B) for 4 weeks treatment with empagliflozin and finerenone, followed by"

The purpose of the study was to test the effectiveness of the training method by intervening in the selective fitness, skills, and tactical performance of college students using a high-intensity interval training method on the ice. The study consists of two groups, with 20 students in the experimental group and 20 students in the control group, to compare the differences between the two groups. The study selected ice hockey players from the undergraduate college of a sports teacher training school in Hubei Province as the research objects, and the experimental group was trained using a high-intensity interval training method, while the control group was trained using the training method. A variety of sports skills were used for high-intensity interval training, including repeated sprint training, sprint interval training (on-ice 45-s shift length conditioning drill), a long-pass tracking drill, and a chase-the-rabbit tracking drill. The control group used varied-pace skating (1 minute accelerated skating, 2 minutes even pace), dribbling and shooting drill (30 m), passing and catching training (20 m), and 2 on 1 offensive drill (full rink). As in the experimental group, the same three phases were used to gradually increase the intensity."

Oral morphine equivalents (OMEQ) consumed during the first 6 weeks after hospital discharge are 45% lower in patients following accidental injury who have a PAC-plan compared to patients in the control group. OMEQ consumption, pain, depression symptoms, perceived injustice and quality of life are reduced and physical activity is increasing, for participants with a PAC-plan compared to the control group. No major impact is seen on substance use. No other serious negative outcomes are reported, and there are no indications of increased risk for addiction. No major impact if any on time to recovery, readmission, costs, and overall mortality and morbidity is seen. The findings indicate that a PAC-plan provides a feasible, safe and effective intervention to reduce opioid use, and to improve health-related outcomes for patients after accidental injury. The results of the present study, and from other studies on the use of PAC-plans in patients undergoing surgery for a variety of different reasons, can help increase safe pain management as well as a reduction in the overprescription of opioids. Further studies on the use of PAC-plans, its development and implementation, should explore the perspectives of health care providers, patients and their next of kin.

Study Abstract
-----------------
Introduction: Ischemic and bleeding events always occurred during antiplatelet therapy. It is crucial to optimize the antiplatelet treatment to improve the clinical outcome. Intracranial aneurysms (IA) are at risk of rupture, bleeding events that occur during antiplatelet therapy significantly increase mortality. Intracranial stent-assisted coil embolization (SCE) and flow diversion (FD) are effective treatments for IA, but they are associated with more antiplatelet drug use. The purpose of this study is to explore the appropriate dosage of antiplatelet drugs in patients with IA after different types of antiplatelet therapy. The study was performed as a cluster randomized controlled study design was used in multiple hospitals, with the LTA of patients with IA after SCE and flow-diverting treatment as the basis for guiding the dosage of antiplatelet drugs.
Method: In this study, we will use a cluster randomized controlled cohort study, 180 patients need to be screened to enroll 160 patients per study arm who meet the inclusion criteria. All patients underwent intracranial stent-assisted coil embolization and flow-diverting treatment for intracranial aneurysms after 2021.06.01.00. A cluster randomized controlled study design was used, 9 hospitals were selected and divided into control and test groups, with cluster randomization allocation. In the control group, continuing to use dual antiplatelet drugs (aspirin 100mg/d + clopidogrel 75mg/d) is a standard antiplatelet treatment scheme. The test group adjusts aspirin and clopidogrel (clopidogrel overdose: 37.5 mg/d; ticagrelor overdose: 60 mg/bid; ticagrelor resistance: adjustment 90 mg/bid), then test the LTA of patients again (48 hours after adjustment) and re-adjust the antiplatelet drugs if necessary.
Ethics statement: The study was approved by the Medical Review Institute of Guangdong First Military Medical University (0821655), and informed consent was obtained from patients and families.

This is a multi-method clinical and brain-imaging study examining the effects of the dopamine D2/3 antagonist sulpiride on working memory gating, learning, motivation and striatal activity. Based on previous results, the investigators will examine whether sulpiride enhances the ability to selectively input- and output-gate working memory, which is important in the selection and updating of relevant information in the environment and leads to better task performance. The investigators predict that sulpiride will have enhanced effects on working memory gating. Furthermore the use of a pharmaco-fMRI (magnetic resonance imaging) protocol allows the investigators to identify whether stimulating D2/3 dopamine antagonist leads to an enhanced recruitment of striatal BOLD response and a better behavioral outcome and to identify the underlying neurobiological, pharmacological and motivational substrates of these relationships."

This study focuses on adolescents to gather important information and identify the prevalence of hypertension in this age range. The researchers plan to recruit a total of 2,000 adolescents from different high schools in different parts of Italy, ranging in age from 13 to 19. During the 2009/2010 school year, 1,500 adolescents aged between 13-15 years will be included in the ""Cross-sectional study"" and then followed-up after 2009/2010 school-year to carry on the ""Longitudinal study"". The aim is to investigate whether specific genetic polymorphisms found in certain genes may affect the propensity of adolescents to develop high blood pressure. The researchers hypothesize that the selected genes might play a role in the development of high blood pressure among adolescents. Furthermore, they aim to study the following:
1. Determine the prevalence of obesity and hypertension (HT) in a cohort of adolescents.
2. Perform genetic studies to determine a link between specific polymorphisms of Adducins and EO-related genes with the prevalence of HT and genetic factors associated with cardiovascular risk factors.
3. Explore whether urinary sodium excretion and urinary markers of inflammation and oxidative stress are linked to the prevalence of HT and selected cardiovascular risk factors.

The students will be provided with a full explanation of the study, including the aim, the procedures involved, and the possible risks and benefits. Once the student has received all the explanations, s/he will be given a written and verbal consent form and an information leaflet. If the student is willing to participate, they will be required to bring back the signed consent form the next day. For the purposes of this research, a blood test to measure blood pressure will be performed at the school, either in the morning between 8:00 and 10:00 am, or in the afternoon between 2:00 and 4:00 p.m. The students will be asked to wear their normal clothing (e.g. jeans, T-shirt, etc.) on the day of the visit. They will be instructed to empty their bladder, sit in the chair, cross ankles and lean forearms on a table to rest their arms on it. They will be measured twice and the average of the two readings will be taken. The investigators are unable to measure blood pressure during lunch or gym hours, and hence school hours are used. At the study visit, students will be asked to complete two validated questionnaires (Questioniario del Nutrizione Italiano - ONI-V e QOLMIS 99). Moreover, students will be provided with a urine cup to collect a first (or second in cases of large discrepancies) early morning urine sample to measure the presence of specific inflammatory and antioxidant markers, which are likely to affect blood pressure. A further test to measure the specific inflammatory and oxidant markers will be conducted in a subgroup of adolescents. Finally, after the urine sample is collected, the students will be advised about the importance of hypertension and cardiovascular risk factors, and how lifestyle modifies the risks.

The EPIVA Study is a feasibility study exploring the epigenetic and metabolic changes in children undergoing anaesthesia for hypospadias surgery. Hypospadias is a congenital disorder where the urethral opening is not in the right position of the penis. Anaesthesia for hypospadias surgery is typically performed through one of two methods (inhalational or intravenous) that are currently routine anaesthetic clinical practice in the NHS and around the world.
This study aims to explore the molecular changes (epigenetics, biochemistry, redox) caused by anaesthesia and surgery in children and to compare whether the two methods of maintaining anaesthesia have different effects.
Children presenting to the paediatric surgical out-patient clinic at Liverpool Women's NHS Trust with an indication for the diagnosis and/or correction of a hypospadias lesion using anaesthesia will be assessed for age eligibility (6 months - 3 years). The participants will be randomised to receive either intravenous or inhalational anaesthesia for surgery and they will not know which form of anaesthesia they have until the results of the trial are available. Parents/guardians of all participants will be asked to provide written informed consent before their child is included in the trial. The child will be included in the trial if their parent/guardian provides written consent, and the legal representative (parent/guardian) consents. If the parent/guardian refuses consent, or the child is not suitable for the trial, the child will not be eligible to enter into the study.
The participants will be seen in the outpatient clinic, and if eligible, their parent/guardian will be provided with a copy of the participant information sheet. Informed consent will be obtained from the parent/guardian of the child if they are deemed eligible, and a screening visit booked with the clinical research team. A legal representative for a child is the person who has been given the responsibility by law to make decisions on behalf of that child. This is usually the parent/s or guardian/s. The child will be seen in the outpatient clinic by a clinical research nurse (usually in addition to having a standard outpatient clinic consultation with the surgeon). A brief clinical screening check will be performed, and the participant information sheet given to the parent/guardian for a period of one month to allow for consideration. When the legal representative of the child is happy and ready to proceed, they will enter the trial in agreement with the consultant surgeon and anaesthetist."

Patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc) are at increased risk of severe infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Indeed, immune dysregulation occurs in systemic sclerosis contributing to severe lung fibrosis. It is assumed that immunization in systemic sclerosis patients can be more effective if the immune system is rebuilt by autologous hematopoietic stem cells transplantation (AHSCT). To date, no study has addressed the issue of COVID-19 vaccine effectiveness in these patients and the influence of previous AHSCT and immunoglobulin replacement therapy on vaccine efficacy.
The objective of the study was to compare the rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in subjects with systemic sclerosis (SSc) previously treated by AHSCT versus non AHSCT SSc patients."

The aim of the multi-year, multi-site study of the eHealth implementation intervention, called Chez NICU Home (CNH+), is to address two fundamental barriers to the provision of Family-Centered Care in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) for extremely preterm or small born infants: (1) low-income and families from disadvantaged backgrounds often are unable to enroll in traditional NICU Family-Centered Care Support; (2) the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated drastic changes in the delivery of neonatal care. The investigators hypothesize that offering parents of infant(s) who are eligible for enrollment in the CNH+ intervention with a choice of home delivery or having their infant transferred to a nearby centre with the use of a Virtual Prenatal Suite (VPS), will increase parental engagement, parent self-efficacy, maternal and infant mental health, and improve parent satisfaction. The investigators will measure impact through the implementation goals: parent uptake, retention of support, and overall caregiver satisfaction of the intervention. At the 1-year follow-up (infant 1 month corrected gestational age), the investigators will measure improvement in infant physical, neurodevelopmental, and mental health outcomes.

The investigators will carry out an integrated implementation science-randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing CNH+ to standard NICU practice through a parallel, multi-centre, mixed-methods, RCT design. This design enables the investigators to assess if the CNH+ intervention can increase enrolment and engagement in parent caregivers of low-income, premature or small for gestational age (fetal growth retardation), infants. The primary goal of the study is to compare the effectiveness of the CNH+ intervention on caregiver outcomes (including engagement in care of the infant at the NICU, parent presence during care and care provision, parent satisfaction, and parent mental health). The secondary goal is to assess the impact of the CNH+ intervention on infant-related outcomes (including infant physical, neurodevelopmental and mental health outcomes). The study will examine the feasibility of the CNH+ intervention, focusing primarily on recruitment and enrolment processes. This will be addressed through preliminary work with the development of an Implementation Committee (IC) and through the measurement of implementation impact."

Osteoporosis causes physical weakness, which significantly reduces the quality of life. Exercise is a non-pharmacological method of increasing muscle mass and physical fitness, reducing the risk of falls and fractures. Studies conducted with this subject in the literature have been conducted in older age groups, but there is a lack of evidence in the postmenopausal period due to hormonal changes occurring in the postmenopausal period. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a specific exercise program on physical fitness parameters, functional fitness age and quality of life in women at medium-high risk of osteoporosis in the postmenopausal period. Eighty women aged 54-73 at medium-high risk of osteoporosis have been evaluated. The patients were divided into two groups as Experimental: Otago Exercise Program and Control Group. The Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Women (OST) was used to calculate the medium and high risk levels of the patients. Physical fitness parameters were evaluated with the Senior Fitness Test before and after the treatment. According to the results, it was observed that both groups were significantly improved in terms of lower extremity strength, upper extremity strength, cardiovascular endurance, agility, and upper extremity flexibility. After the training program, the control group's agility was lower than the experimental group. It was observed that the experimental group's agility increased compared to the control group. Additionally, the functional fitness age and Quality of Life for Osteoporosis Questionnaire (total score) were significantly improved in both groups compared to pre-treatment. In conclusion, it was thought that an individualized exercise program can be applied to the individuals at medium-high risk of osteoporosis due to its significant impact on functional fitness ages and increase in the quality of life, especially in terms of lower extremity strength, upper extremity strength, cardiovascular endurance, agility, and functional fitness age.

This proposal is for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a digital-based diet quality intervention in adolescents with overweight or obesity. The study aims to determine if using text-based technology to address diet quality in adolescents with overweight or obesity is feasible and can improve diet quality and blood glucose control. Improving diet quality is an essential component for the management of adolescent obesity. However, low levels of diet quality persist, and little is known about how to improve it in a sustainable and scalable way. Few digital-based interventions targeting diet quality have been tested in a population at-risk for obesity, and the use of nutrition recommendations in a clinical setting is time-consuming. One strategy to increase nutrition recommendations is through text messages, and adolescents and young adults are receptive to text-messaging interventions. Therefore, this pilot RCT will evaluate the feasibility of testing a personalized digital-based intervention for diet quality targeting adolescents with overweight and obesity using an iterative multi-stage optimization strategy pilot RCT (MOST-RCT). Using data generated from a series of pilot studies and qualitative studies, we will target five evidence-informed themes to develop a digital-based intervention: a personalized goal, meal timing, nutrition skills, home food environment, and engagement strategies. The primary goal of this pilot RCT is to determine if the digital-based diet quality intervention is feasible and acceptable. The secondary goal is to determine if the intervention can improve diet quality and blood glucose control among an adolescent population at risk for overweight and obesity. The study will enroll a convenience sample of 14 adolescents at risk of poor diet quality and have a history of overweight or obesity (aged 14-17 years). Participants will be randomized to either the intervention or control arm. The intervention will consist of 5 evidence-based and feasible themes: 1) personalized goal, 2) meal timing, 3) nutrition skills 4) home food environment, and 5) engagement strategies. The control arm will receive usual care. Data will be collected in two clinical settings and three surveys. In the home setting, continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data as well as two 24-hour diet recalls will be collected at baseline and follow-up. CGM has been shown to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes and adolescents with type 1 diabetes. In the research setting, one additional 24-hour diet recall will be collected, as in the home setting, and the first void of morning urine will be collected. The outcome related to feasibility will be calculated and compared between groups. All other outcomes will be compared between groups and analyzed as a one-tailed t-test to evaluate changes between groups from baseline to follow-up. A pilot RCT is an excellent way to determine feasibility, improve acceptability and usability, and prepare for larger trials. Findings will assist in tailoring the intervention to adolescents at risk for overweight and obesity and improve intervention acceptability and usability."

In the United States, cancer is the second leading cause of death (American Cancer Society 2021). People who are not diagnosed with cancer but instead care for someone diagnosed with cancer (e.g., family and friends helping out with tasks of daily living, transportation, assisting with meals, and keeping the person company during medical appointments) are often called caregivers. The impact of being a caregiver is not trivial. Caregivers often experience a heavy burden from the stress of knowing that at any moment their loved one may face challenges related to their medical condition. Caregivers also have to take on extra roles to help keep their loved one healthy. Despite their efforts, caregivers often struggle to cope with the burden of caregiving. For example, caregivers may experience high levels of psychological distress from anxiety, depression, or other types of distress. Other negative impacts may include physical symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbances and pain) and social impacts (e.g., reduced social participation, loneliness, and social isolation). Caregivers often report feeling that no one understands their burden and find it difficult to balance their caregiver role with their own responsibilities and interests. Thus, it is not surprising that there is a need for supportive interventions that reduce the negative impacts of caregiving.
One type of supportive intervention that has shown promise in reducing the negative impacts of caregiving has been expressive writing (EW). Although there are many different techniques used to help people cope with stress, EW is an option that can be done easily wherever there is a computer or paper, a writing tool, and a little bit of time. It has been recommended for people going through difficult times. In general, EW involves writing about a traumatic event or personal problem on a regular basis. The specific approach to EW has been tested in groups of people that have dealt with physical and mental illnesses such as Cancer and PTSD, and chronic pain. Writing about personal emotions and experiences in a private setting has allowed many people to have improved mental and physical well-being, and feel less alone and isolated.
However, EW has not been tested with cancer caregivers, and research has not explored the different ways that caregivers can benefit from EW. The present project aims to provide a group-based, videoconference-delivered writing intervention for caregivers of persons diagnosed with cancer.
Using a randomized wait-list control design, 240 caregivers of persons diagnosed with cancer will be recruited over a 12-week period. Participants who are interested in the study will complete two brief video chats to confirm eligibility. Participants will be randomized to one of two study arms; the intervention group will receive the videoconference-based expressive writing intervention. The control group will wait 4 weeks before being entered into the intervention. The intervention itself consists of four video-conference-delivered expressive writing sessions. Each session will last 60 minutes and include: (a) 20 minutes of expressive writing, (b) a 20-minute group-led discussion of the writing content, and (c) a 20-minute debriefing. During the writing sessions, caregivers will be assisted to write about the burden of their caregiving role. This will be done based on the participant's understanding of their stressors and the themes that typically arise when caregivers process their experiences. At the beginning and end of the 4-week intervention, study participants will be asked to complete online surveys that measure changes in emotional well-being, physical well-being, and quality of life.
The overall study aims to: 1) Examine the effects of a group-based video-conference-delivered expressive writing program in improving the emotional, social, and physical well-being of informal caregivers of persons diagnosed with cancer, 2) Identify social and linguistic mechanisms by which participation in the group-based expressive writing intervention leads to improved psychological adjustment. This is important to better understand the processes that create positive outcomes related to self-expression, 3) Test whether certain variables (e.g., age, gender identity, relationship to the patient, and baseline social constraints) moderate the effects of expressive writing in a way such that some people may benefit more or less than others, and 4) Test whether the expressive writing intervention can have a positive impact on the quality of the care provided by caregivers to their loved ones, including improved communication and shared decision-making about medical treatments, symptom management, and overall well-being. By addressing these aims, this project will provide important insights into the use of EW for caregivers, as well as inform future efforts to test the efficacy of expressive writing with"

The overarching goal of this study is to investigate the use of IV TXA in Gender Affirming Mastectomy (GAM). The hypothesis of this study is that IV TXA will be effective in reducing blood loss, the risk of postoperative hematomas and seromas, and the time to drain removal. This study will evaluate the primary outcomes of hematomas, seromas, and drain output in patients who undergo GAM with or without IV TXA. The secondary outcomes will include thromboembolic events and surgical site complications. This study will assess the impact of IV TXA on postoperative outcomes in this unique population. The primary outcome are the following: 1) Hematoma: Blood that accumulates outside of blood vessels. The definition of hematoma will be developed for this study and will be assessed through routine physical exam and ultrasound. A hematoma will be defined as a collection of blood outside of the vasculature that requires intervention such as aspiration or surgical drainage. 2) Seroma: Fluid accumulation occurring after surgery. The definition of seroma will be developed for this study and will be assessed through routine physical exam and ultrasound. A seroma will be defined as a collection of fluid that accumulates in the surgical site after mastectomy. 3) Total Patient Drain Output: The volume of drainage will be recorded by patients daily. Drains will be removed per standard practice at our institution which is when they have produced < 30cc/day for at least 3 days. 4) Time to Drain Removal: The time between mastectomy surgery and the time of drain removal. These measures will allow us to evaluate if IV TXA improves postoperative outcome markers. The second outcome measurements will be the incidences of thromboembolic complications and surgical site complications. It is well-documented that IV TXA in total joint arthroplasty reduces the risk of deep vein thrombosis. In this study, the incidence of DVT, DVT and pulmonary embolism, and other thromboembolic events will be recorded through routine patient care. The occurrence of surgical site complications will also be recorded through routine patient care."

This project seeks to evaluate a one-year version of the Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP) (PCAP-1) in preventing the need for foster care and promoting reunification. PCAP is a three-year, intensive case management intervention for pregnant and postpartum individuals who have used substances during their current or most recent pregnancy. PCAP provides mothers with a case manager with whom they meet biweekly, in the home or in other community settings. Case managers coach mothers in setting their own goals and taking steps to achieve them, provide practical assistance, serve as role models, and offer emotional support and encouragement. They connect mothers to community resources and recovery supports tailored to the participant's needs and goals. On average, case managers carry a caseload of 16 mothers/families, receive at least biweekly individual clinical supervision by a master's-level clinician, biweekly group supervision, and individual consultation with their supervisor whenever needed. Case managers work with the mother and the child with prenatal substance exposure and other family members in support of the participant's goals and recovery. The investigators now theorize that the most significant changes happen within the first year, and a one-year program may be a better fit for many clients, especially those who are child welfare-involved. A shorter duration may also serve as an external motivator to clients in completing their goals, as they will know they have a one-year time frame during which they will have assistance, and they will sooner begin anticipating the post-intervention period. A one-year intervention is also indicated under the parameters of the FFPSA as the FFPSA provides matching funds for one year of evidence-based in-home services to child welfare-involved families to prevent the need for foster care. The specific objectives of this project are to:"

Eye care professionals recommend the use of optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans for assessing the lens position in eyes with cataract and pseudophakia. This test measures the eye shape but requires manual segmentation. Other optical biometers measure the same shape but are faster than OCT. The FDA approved these biometers for measuring the position of the iris, but not for measuring the position of the lens.
This study will establish how well these instruments measure lens position."

Thoracotomy is one of the most morbid procedures associated with moderate to severe pain that persists for several weeks after surgery. Traditional methods of pain management in thoracic surgery are insufficient to satisfy patient's needs. This study will compare the effectiveness of continuous thoracic serratus anterior plane block (SAPB) with epidural analgesia. SAPB is a new peripheral nerve block (PNB) that was introduced recently for treating post-operative pain especially after breast cancer surgery. SAPB is performed under ultrasonographic (US) guidance and provides sensory-only analgesia by injecting local anesthetic solution into a subcutaneous plane between the serratus anterior and the latissimus dorsi muscles at the level between the 3rd and 9th thoracic ribs ,This study aims to compare the continuous Serratus anterior plane block with epidural analgesia in patients with thoracic oncology surgeries to determine if the serratus anterior plane block provides satisfactory analgesia.
Thoracic SAPB is a relatively new regional analgesic technique in which a local anesthetic solution is injected into the interfacial plane between the latissimus dorsi muscle and the serratus anterior muscle via a 22G, 135 mm Tuohy needle under US guidance. The purpose of the current study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SAPB compared with thoracic epidural analgesia as a routine pain modality for patients undergoing thoracotomy.
The primary outcomes of this study are to compare the effectiveness and safety of SAPB and thoracic epidural analgesia in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. The secondary outcomes will assess the effectiveness and safety of SAPB compared with thoracic epidural analgesia in terms of the following outcomes: Intraoperative fentanyl requirement, time to the first analgesia requested by the patient, pain scores according to the visual analogue scale (VAS) score, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), patient satisfaction, and the total dose of additional analgesics (fentanyl and morphine) required in the 6 hours after discontinuation of thoracic epidural analgesia or SAPB.
Our study will determine whether patients with thoracotomy surgery can achieve satisfactory analgesic outcomes by using serratus anterior plane block as a pain modality."

In this study, the investigators compare two engagement methods, Design Thinking (DT) and Focus Groups (FG), to gather input on the facilitators and barriers to accessing therapy for autistic children. The study focuses on Hispanics and Latinos, a growing group of autistic children for whom therapy resources are limited. The investigators' long-term objective is to improve the functional skills and health of Hispanic/Latino autistic children and their families by improving access to an evidence-based intervention called Occupational Therapy/Ayres Sensory Integration (OT/ASI), which is used to improve daily living skills, socialization, and quality of life. Outcomes are evaluated following each step to understand the most effective method of engaging Hispanic/Latino stakeholders. The study results will help improve access to therapy for autistic children, which can help reduce disparities in health outcomes, such as lower school readiness, higher rates of school suspension, and lower rates of employment and independence for Hispanic/Latino autistic children."

Background: While the best method for smoking cessation is to stop smoking completely, it is estimated that less than 8% of smokers quit on their first attempt without the use of assistive methods such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Unfortunately, when NRT fails, some smokers have turned to novel tobacco products to try to quit smoking. While newer ""alternative nicotine"" products are often used in an attempt to quit smoking completely, a growing body of literature suggests that these products may serve as a less harmful alternative to combustible tobacco when NRT fails. This study will evaluate one alternative nicotine product (e-cigarette) and one oral nicotine product (pouch) compared to remaining on NRT, in adults who do not quit tobacco smoking with NRT alone.
Sites and Design: Study centers will be located at the University of Medicine & Dentistry of New Jersey, the University of California at San Francisco, the University of Southern California, the University of Buffalo, the University of California at Davis, and the University of Kansas. This will be a randomized clinical trial with subjects randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of the arms. It will compare 4 different arms of treatment. There will be 4 treatment groups: 1) Group A: NRT responders that will remain on NRT at their discretion, 2) Group B: NRT Non-responders that will switch from NRT to an oral nicotine product (pouch), 3) Group C: NRT Non-responders that will switch from NRT to an e-cigarette (electronic cigarette), and 4) Group D: NRT Non-responders will remain on NRT.
Participants: Up to 500 participants will be enrolled in the study. Inclusion criteria include regular tobacco smokers who have failed to quit using NRT during the first 4 weeks of the study and report a preference for trying an alternative nicotine product. The first 10 participants will be placed randomly into the groups. After the first 10 subjects, subjects will be assigned to a group based on non-inferiority margins for abstinence. It is anticipated that 220 subjects will serve as the NRT responders, 100 subjects will serve as the NRT non-responder controls, 100 subjects will serve as the oral nicotine product group, and 80 subjects (NRT non-responders) will serve as the e-cigarette group.
Intervention/Treatment: The study involves a 5 week transition from NRT to one of the alternative nicotine products. Study products include: 1) NRT products, 2) an oral nicotine product (pouch), 3) Electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and the corresponding control groups."

Hypertension (HT) is a public health problem that involves more than a third of the population worldwide. The main objective of the study is to analyse and compare the effect of a MCT programme versus a CVT programme on BP levels in adult hypertensive subjects. The study will consist of a controlled, randomised, longitudinal and prospective clinical trial, with several simultaneous study branches. These branches will involve exercise control, exercise continuity and exercise change (MCT vs. CVT). Hypertensive patients (n = 180) with different risk factors involved in HT, regardless of the antihypertensive medications and treatments they may receive, will be included in the intervention programme. The MCT will consist of two daily training sessions, EMC (15 minutes) and CEV (15 minutes), for 12 weeks (3 months), divided into two weekly training units; the first will be applied in a gym and the second in an educational sports hall. Within EMC a total of 10 exercises will be applied, with 6 focusing on strength training, using 2 free weights and 4 in the machine. On the other hand, the CEV will only be carried out with a treadmill, without load. The intervention will be based on a model of exercise change with an immediate changeover (changeover 0) (MCT vs. CVT) and will last for 12 weeks (3 months), with a frequency of 2 sessions per week and a duration of 60 minutes per session. Throughout the programme, strength testing will be carried out to estimate the 1RM of the bench press and squat, progressing from 50% to 85% 1RM, and cardiovascular testing through a clinical test on a cycle ergometer, increasing the intensity every 4 weeks between 50% and 89% VO2peak.

Background: Many Appalachians die more frequently and at younger ages from obesity-related conditions than those living elsewhere. High prevalence of overweight, obesity, and extreme obesity in Appalachian children increases the severity of diabetes. In rural Appalachia, the diabetes mortality rate is 11% higher than the national rate. The purpose of this research project is to test the effects of the Mentored Planning to be Active (MPBA)+F intervention on physical activity and health outcomes among rural Appalachian 7th grade children suffering from overweight and obesity. The MPBA program has previously been successful in reducing BMI in overweight to obese 7th grade children in a 2-year trial.
In rural Appalachia, high blood glucose levels and diabetes are growing concerns as rural populations suffer from the highest rates of overweight, obesity, and associated conditions (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2020). In rural Appalachia, the death rate from diabetes is 11% higher than the national average (CDC, 2015). Overweight and obesity in youth places children at risk of becoming obese adults. Adult obesity is a risk factor for chronic diseases, including: type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CDC, 2017). Adolescent obesity is associated with numerous medical problems, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, asthma, and sleep apnea (Kumanyika, et al., 2005; Wylie-Rosett, et al., 2007). The physical health problems of these rural Appalachian children places a high burden on tax payer-funded medical care for a chronic disease that is largely preventable.
Recent research has shown that physical inactivity contributes to 20% of all-cause mortality (Sallis et al., 2013) and that obesity exerts a far more powerful influence on premature death than does smoking (Lakka et al., 2002). The U.S. Healthy People, 2020 initiative has set a national goal of making regular physical activity more culturally accepted, more accessible, and more conveniently available to a person of any age, gender, or health status.
The study is a community-based randomized controlled trial which aims: 1) To test the effects of the Mentored Planning to be Active + Family (MPBA+F) intervention on physical activity and health outcomes among rural Appalachian 7th grade children suffering from a body mass index (BMI) above the 85th percentile. The 24-month intervention is delivered during the 2021-2022 school year in southeastern Ohio counties, and; 2) To evaluate the process of disseminating the community-wide disseminated intervention through peer mentor recruitment and delivery."

Background: To evaluate the effects of virtual reality (VR) and ice massage on labor pain, duration of labor and birth satisfaction of primiparous women in the active first stage of labor. Method: This is an obseratonal study applied between April 2019- November 2019 to primiparous women who applied to the gynecology and obstetrics department. The sample of the study consisted of primiparous women whose cervical dilatation was 0-3 cm and who gave birth vaginally, and who agreed to participate in the study. Primiparous women were randomly divided into three groups: Group 1: Ice massage group, Group 2: Virtual Reality group, Group 3: Labor without intervention group. Pain of primiparous women was measured by Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) I. Birth Satisfaction Scale-Revised (BSS-R) were completed immediately after delivery. The data were evaluated using SPSS version of statistical program.
In the literature, there are studies that have implemented ice massage during delivery, but in the present study, it was not found to be studied in terms of ice massage.
In conclusion, the virtual reality animation to be used in the present study is expected to be effective in reducing the labor pain in the first stage of labor for primiparous women. It is concluded that further studies are needed for the validity of the results and to use it in clinical practice.
Significance: The study results are valuable for clinical practice and academic purposes .(Copyright © 2019 Suleyman Sah University Faculty of Health Science)

The application addresses the formidable treatment gap for cognitive rehabilitation of spatial neglect (SN), defined as asymmetric orienting, perception, and responding to left space after right brain stroke, causing functional disability. Despite treatment for spatial neglect, patients remain functionally impaired and the care gap remains huge, with a half-life of 5 years or longer. The Veteran population is especially at risk for SN, with 28% of right brain stroke survivors having severe SN and functional problems associated with this. Spatial neglect contributes to poor functional recovery after stroke, longer lengths of stay in rehabilitation, and increased reliance on others for activities of daily living. Patients with spatial neglect require 3x as much caregiver supervision after returning home, and have increased fall risk and health care encounters compared with similar right brain stroke survivors. A personalized approach to spatial neglect rehabilitation is not available in Veteran-specific systems of care, and a validated biomarker would allow a more personalized approach to spatial neglect care. In 180 patients, the investigators will define and validate biomarkers in blood markers, brain imaging and brain physiology, along with behavior, predictive of spatial neglect type. The investigators will determine if adding behavioral predictors (such as fatigue and impulsivity), to biomarker predictors (such as brain imaging biomarkers) accounts for additional variance in the trajectory of functional recovery. These studies will identify a biological parameter that can be used to routinely identify patients with right brain stroke who are the best candidates for spatial neglect rehabilitation. Armed with a validated biomarker-based algorithm, the investigators can then carry out a large clinical trial of prism adaptation therapy (PAT), to personalize spatial neglect rehabilitation, eliminate clinician uncertainty, reduce reliance on specialized SN assessment, facilitate Veteran-centric care, and improve stroke care efficiency.
This project is significant to a large cross-section of healthcare providers and patients because spatial neglect occurs in 1 in 5 right brain stroke survivors, and the investigators have previously found that the PAT treatment is the only treatment that reliably reduces the symptoms of spatial neglect. Spatial neglect may last for years and causes patients to have difficulty carrying out their daily self-care activities independently, including bathing, dressing or using stairs. Spatial neglect also disrupts family functioning, and contributes to healthcare use among stroke survivors.
Because the investigators discovered that people with SN related to damage in parietal brain regions respond best to PAT, the investigators will identify biomarkers predictive of whether PAT improves their functional independence. The goal of the investigators' research is to determine if biomarkers that predict functional improvement are associated with the specific parietal region implicated in their studies of spatial neglect, and whether these biomarkers will improve the prediction of PAT treatment response. The investigators also expect these clinical findings to expand the scope of application of the investigators' biomarkers to other brain diseases that involve parietal lesions, including Alzheimer disease.
The investigators will recruit 30 stroke survivors without spatial neglect, 15 stroke survivors with the subtype of spatial neglect that does not respond to PAT, 110 stroke survivors with the subtype of spatial neglect that responds well to PAT, 30 stroke survivors who have recovered from spatial neglect, 30 healthy people who have never had a brain disease but might be at risk for stroke and develop spatial neglect due to predisposition to develop parietal damage, and 30 healthy controls that have never had a brain disease or spatial neglect. Brain imaging biomarkers predictive of aiding spatial neglect in response to PAT will be examined in the participants' first fMRI testing.
The investigators' study is significant to the field of stroke neurorehabilitation because it will determine if a biological parameter can be used to assign right brain stroke survivors to treatment with PAT. Identifying brain biomarkers that can be used by clinicians will change the paradigm for spatial neglect care, allowing for early referral to intensive treatment, reduction in reliance on specialized SN assessment, and reduction in clinician uncertainty about SN diagnosis and appropriateness of PAT. Armed with a validated biomarker-based algorithm to personalize spatial neglect rehabilitation, the investigators can then carry out a large clinical trial to test the efficacy of prism adaptation therapy (and other treatments) for Veterans with spatial neglect after right brain stroke.

Gliomas are a complex group of tumors with no curative treatment. Their diagnosis is currently made by conventional clinical studies based either on the presence of contrast-enhancing abnormalities on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
However, these brain lesions can simulate the appearance of other types of lesions as brain lymphoma or a large number of inflammatory lesions, making the diagnosis difficult. Currently, biopsy of the surgically removed tumor is the only reliable option to confirm the diagnosis, but this is not always possible due to: an increased risk for patients with tumors located in specific eloquent regions (including the brain stem) or involving large volumes of functional cortex.
Liquid biopsy, which detects and quantifies circulating DNA (ctDNA) fragments of tumor cells, opens up an alternative option to obtain tissue samples and avoid the risks involved in the conventional biopsies.
This technique was developed in liquid tumors (lung, prostate or ovary cancer) and has been proven to be more sensitive than conventional methods in detecting tumor cells and/or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) even 2 years after treatment.
ctDNA can be detected by different genotyping methods, including real-time PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS). The ddPCR technique is the most used worldwide due to its precision, sensitivity and cost.
ctDNA detection, compared to the conventional diagnosis that involves biopsies, has as an advantage a higher sampling, thus increasing the number of potential cells for analysis, as well as a higher level of sensitivity in diagnosing the underlying tumor and its possible evolution. As a result, the diagnosis achieved would be more accurate and provide real-time information, being essential for the prognosis and therapeutic decision making.
The main aim of the study is to analyze the blood samples obtained from those patients with brain lesions in the resonance images compatible with a glioma-type tumor, to detect and quantify the circulating DNA of tumor cells on it. The circulating free DNA will be extracted from 5 ml of whole blood drawn of the patient. The ctDNAs will be analyzed in the department of pathological anatomy using ddPCR, which allows the quantification of the tumor ctDNA at the molecular level if present.
It is important to note that the study focuses on a homogeneous sample of patients with a previous diagnosis of glioma, and who are hospitalized for surgery.
The investigative team, in view of the potential importance of their results, are committed to completing this prospective, observational study within one year of the first blood draw."

Background: Pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the most rapidly lethal solid tumors, and surgical resection is the only potentially curative intervention. However, less than one-third of resections can be accomplished, and surgical resection alone does not provide an adequate overall cure rate due to locally advanced (LA) or borderline resectable (BPR) disease. Currently, systemic therapy is not recommended as a standard of care before surgical resection in either setting because of relatively poor response rates to chemotherapy and high systemic toxicity. Zimberelimab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the expression of cluster of differentiation 73 (CD73) using the WBC-14 platform, has demonstrated tolerability and has shown promising anti-tumor activity in patients with solid tumors. Furthermore, in a human xenograft model of pancreatic cancer, zimberelimab has induced a significant increase in cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) activation by targeting CD73 to allow antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) to occur. The use of quemliclustat, an oral cyclin dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK-4/6) inhibitor, as a monotherapy did not result in an increase in CTL activity. In combination with oxaliplatin and either irinotecan or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), CDK-4 blockade resulted in increased CD8+ T cell activation, decreased regulatory T cell numbers and increased CD73 expression, while also modulating the tumor microenvironment (TME) and increasing PD-1 expression. Based on these findings, the investigators propose that combining quemliclustat, an oral CDK-4/6 inhibitor, with the anti-T cell-co-stimulatory ligand CD73 inhibitor, zimberelimab, and anti-tumor therapy, will induce more specific CTL activations that will improve the TME to result in better treatment results in patients with locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Objectives: 1) Demonstrate the safety, tolerability and the number of patients with adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) of zimberelimab when administered in combination with quemliclustat, and modified FOLFIRINOX (mFFX) chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced (LA) or borderline resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 2) Demonstrate objective response rate to combination treatment with zimberelimab, quemliclustat and mFFX in patients with LA or BPR pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 3) Demonstrate the percent increase in absolute number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells/tumor size and the percent reduction in absolute number of tumor infiltrating regulatory T cells (Treg) after at least 6 weeks of combination treatment with zimberelimab, quemliclustat and mFFX in patients with LA or BPR pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 4) Demonstrate the effect of combination treatment with zimberelimab, quemliclustat and mFFX on CD73 expression in tumor tissues after 6 weeks of treatment in patients with LA or BPR pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 5) Demonstrate the change in PD-L1 immunostaining and PD-1 expression after at least 6 weeks of combination treatment with zimberelimab, quemliclustat and mFFX in patients with LA or BPR pancreatic adenocarcinoma. 6) Assess the concordance of pathology reported by the study pathologist with the pathology reported by the Clinical Laboratories Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified pathology laboratory in the same patient in patients who are subsequently assessed by resection for BPR or for tumor down-staging following LA pancreatic carcinoma. 7) Assess the concordance of pathology reported by the study pathologist with the pathology at an independent reference laboratory for patients who are subsequently assessed by resection for BPR or for tumor down-staging following LA pancreatic carcinoma.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the consumption of 1 g MIYAIRI 588(Nisshin Bio Sciences Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) daily for 3 months reduced depression scores in maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients and improves risk factors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Also, it explored the correlation between depression score, inflammatory factors, and CVD risk factors in the whole study population. This study was conducted in the form a randomized 3 months open, controlled study. A total of 106 subjects who were diagnosed with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and maintained HD more than 3 months were recruited. These were randomly divided into two groups: the intervention group and the control group (1:1). After baseline assessment, the intervention group was given MIYAIRI 588 (each package contains 1g per meal), while the control group was given a placebo. The primary outcome, the change of depression score, was evaluated with Beck Depression Inventory score (Chinese version 2.0). The serum inflammatory markers, endothelial activation markers, and biomarker of bone and mineral metabolism, were quantified by ELISA or chemiluminescence techniques. BMI was calculated as the weight in BW divided by the height in meter squared. All subjects were followed up for three months after baseline. The result demonstrated that the consumption of 1 g MIYAIRI 588 for three months significantly decreased serum C-reactive protein level (5.65±0.94mg/dlvs 2.71±0.42mg/dl，P<0.001), E-selectin (10.37±0.54 ng/mlvs 57.49±2.20pg/ml，P<0.001), interleukin-6 (11.19±0.56pg/mlvs 48.37±1.89pg/ml，P<0.001), TNF-α (23.91±0.74ng/mlvs 11.59±1.0ng/ml，P<0.001)，and decreased depression score (15.56±0.57vs 10.23±0.43，P<0.001). The consumption of 1 g MIYAIRI 588 for three months could improve depression score (r=-0.30, p<0.001)，decrease serum C-reactive protein Level (r=-0.39, p<0.001)，E-selectin levels (r=-0.29, p<0.001), increase serum high-density lipoprotein level (r=0.21, p<0.001)，and decrease serum TNF-α level (r=-0.19, p<0.001). Additionally, there was a negative correlation between depression score and high-density lipoprotein level (r=-010, p<0.05), but a positive correspondence between depression score and triglyceride level (r=0.09，p<0.05). The result suggest that the consumption of 1 g MIYAIRI 588 daily for 3 months is an effective way to improve risk factors of CVD and depression score in maintenance HD patients. Since previous studies have shown significant differences of inflammatory response in depressed patients with CVD, further study should be explored to confirm the intervention effects on depressed HD patients with specific outcomes.

The purpose of this project is to develop CM-PST (PST integrated with CM) and test its feasibility and acceptability in college-going young adults with mild-moderate AUD over a 9-month period. We hypothesize that CM-PST will (i) result in high acceptability and feasibility, (ii) significantly reduce alcohol-related negative consequences assessed by Rutgers Alcohol Problem Index (RAPI; average RAPI score decreasing from 25 at baseline (range = 8-45) to 17 on average at 6-month follow-up), and (iii) significantly reduce alcohol use assessed by total number of drinks (15 drinks on average per week on weekdays, 43 drinks on average per week on weekends at baseline, 10 drinks on average per week on weekdays, 22 drinks on average per week on weekends at 6-month follow-up). Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either CM-PST or CM in the R00 phase. Eligibility is based on AUDIT and AUDADIS scores, plus completion of written informed consent, and baseline screening study visit including a medical history/physical exam, urine alcohol screening, and fMRI. The study design takes into account the following considerations: (i) the high demand for college-based CM treatment, (ii) the need to assess the feasibility and acceptability of adding PST to CM, and (iii) CM-PST will likely be most effective for individuals with lower AUD severity, but it is difficult to detect a difference between less severe alcohol users and moderate-to-severe AUD. After K99 funding, we will move forward with the R00 Phase, which will help us address the following research questions. We will also continue to seek funding for additional projects such as a pilot efficacy study (R21) and a larger 2-arm RCT (R34).

Inclusion Criteria: Eligible participants must be (i) male and female young adults aged 18-24 yr with current alcohol use at 1 day/week via phone screening), and meet criteria for (past year) mild, moderate, or severe AUD on the AUDIT and AUDADIS surveys. (ii) English-speaking, (iii) able to provide informed consent, and (iv) willing to comply with screening/baseline and follow up assessments and urine drug and alcohol screens, and receive CM-PST or CM treatments. Exclusion criteria include: (i) current severe AUD, (ii) past 6-mo. participation in AUD or substance use treatment, (iii) current use of medications used to treat AUD (e.g. naltrexone), and (iv) lifetime DSM-5 diagnosis of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorder, current use of psychoactive drugs, or conditions that could interfere with fMRI indices of reward. Eligible participants will be invited to our clinical lab at University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) for informed consent, baseline self-report measures, and fMRI/screening, and then randomized to either CM-PST treatment group (42 participants) or CM only control group (42 participants) for up to 8 sessions of treatment. All participants will complete follow-up assessments at 3 and 6 months from their baseline visit, with blinded outcome assessors."

The aim of the study is to examine the effects of two different simulation application methods (high fidelity simulation and high fidelity and virtual reality-based simulation application) on the simulation learning experience, reflective thinking skills for problem solving, and therapeutic communication skills of second-year nursing students in terms of their nursing care and health education skills on patients with diabetes mellitus. The effect of these methods on students in terms of self-knowledge, problem solving and communication will be examined. To this end, students who meet the inclusion criteria and have volunteered to participate in the research will be approached. Face-to-face information will be given to the participants who will be included in the research. The students will be randomly divided into two groups (experimental and control groups) according to the block randomization method with a control group (Experimental: High fidelity simulation, Other: Virtual reality, N=38) and a high fidelity and virtual reality-based simulation application group (Control: High fidelity simulation, Other: High fidelity and virtual reality, N=38). After being informed, they will be asked to fill out the Personal Information Form, the simulation-based learning evaluation scale, the reflective thinking skill scale for problem solving, and the therapeutic communication skills scale for nursing students in order to complete the PRE-TESTS. Following the completion of the Pretests, participants will be assigned to one of two groups, Group-1 (high fidelity simulation application) or Group-2 (high fidelity and virtual reality-based simulation application), according to the block randomization method to be carried out in a computerized environment. Evaluation of Data The data obtained from the research will be evaluated by transferring it to IBM SPSS (Statistical Packages for the Social Sciences) Statistics 23 program. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum) will be used for continuous variables and frequency distribution will be used for categorical variables. Differences between categorical variables were evaluated using Chi-square test and Fisher Exact test, numerical variables were evaluated using Chi-square test and Fisher Exact test. The relationships between them will be evaluated with Spearman Correlation Analysis. The suitability of the data for normal distribution will be evaluated with the Shapiro Wilk normality test and Q-Q graphs. Accordingly, if the parametric test assumptions are met, the Significance Test of the Difference Between Two Means is used to compare independent group differences; When parametric test assumptions cannot be met, the Mann-Whitney U test will be used. In dependent group comparisons, if parametric test assumptions are met, Repeated Measures Variance Analysis and Significance Test of the Difference Between Two Spouses; When parametric test assumptions are not met, Friedman Test and Wilcoxon Paired Two Sample Test will be used. In all analyses, a p value of ≤0.05 will be considered statistically significant."

During hemodialysis (HD), the blood of the patient passes an extracorporeal circuit that contains a dialyzer for rinsing and a venous chamber (air trap) to prevent from air embolism through the return blood into the patient. However, air traps in clinical use have limited capacity to prevent from microemboli of air to enter the return bloodline and deposit as emboli in the body such as lungs, heart and brain. The Investigator developed the air trap Emboless that was patented in Europe, USA and India. In vitro studies showed significantly better reduction of microemboli contaminations than air traps compared to that in clinical use. The present clinical trial (cross-over design (as pairs), 2 x 30 min, two different air traps used by the same patients) compares two different air traps used by the same patients in a cross-over design (as pairs) using the Emboless compared with the Fresenius 4008/5008 (F5008). The safety committee will evaluate if sufficiently less air emboli appear especially with the Emboless. During HD the microbubbles will be counted by a GAMPT ultrasound device using two probes. One probe is set at the inlet side of the air trap and the second at the outlet side. The outlet side represents data of microbubbles in the blood that is entering into the patient. Comparative non-parametric paired analyses are performed between the air traps. Monitoring of the study is performed."

The aim of this study is to use a novel non-invasive brain stimulation intervention using Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) to improve postural control and injury risk biomechanics following athletic trauma (e.g., Mild Traumatic Brain Injury). The researchers will investigate the influence of brain stimulation on postural control by manipulating two cognitive tasks during the task: performing Serial 7s or keeping attention on the task. The researchers will also manipulate the repetitive TMS conditions (sham, experimental) by applying the magnetic stimulation to the left side of the head in the presence of an interfering cognitive task (serial subtraction). By combining the effects of repetitive TMS and cognitive tasks on postural control, this study will provide an innovative approach to injury risk reduction and prevention."

Laparoscopic pancreatic duodenectomy (LPD), also known as Whipple procedure, is the operation of choice for resectable pancreatic head cancers. During operation, the pancreatic neck transection, the crucial procedure for LPD, can decrease the chance of pancreatic leakage. The conventional pancreatic neck transection (CPNT) is to transect the pancreatic neck at 1-2mm behind the pancreatic neck root. A recent prospective randomized trial has demonstrated that the extended pancreatic neck transection (EPNT) at ≥5mm beyond the left side of the portal vein is associated with low chance of pancreatic leakage.
The study aims to clarify the outcomes of EPNT and CPNT during laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenumectomy. We hypothesize that EPNT can improve postoperative outcomes by the pancreatic neck transection level."

The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of two types of concurrent training (traditional and dance-fitness) with older adults aged 65-75 years. Sixty sedentary and frail individuals will be included in the study. The main hypothesis is that both training programs will be effective in decreasing the fall risk by increasing muscle strength and quality of life in older adults.
In relation to physical activity, older adult have a tendency to be inactive, which places them at risk for morbidity and mortality. Exercise training can reverse the reduced functional capacity associated with physical inactivity or sedentary lifestyle, and a better level of physical capacity may reduce the risk of falls.
Research and training in sports and exercise medicine has shown that older adults are able to take part in various physical activity programs. Several studies suggest that older adults who are sedentary can participate in different exercise programs, including combined training programs in order to increase their physical capacity.
Recently, dance training for older adults has been studied and its benefits have been demonstrated. In addition, it has been shown that the dance practice have positive effects in the cognitive domain in frail and sedentary adults.
This proposal is the first to compare the effects of two types of concurrent training in sedentary and frail older adults. Given the fact that falls and decline in cognitive function are the main problems for sedentary/frail older adults, it is necessary to know which training modality has a greater effect on functional performance and cognition."

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a Virtual Reality-based intervention to prevent delirium in intensive care units (ICU).
Delirium is a common health problem in ICU patients. Around 27-60% of ICU patients are diagnosed with delirium. The ICU environment and treatments make patients vulnerable to developing delirium.
Patients with delirium are also at increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. They also tend to have prolonged length of hospital stay, poor functional outcomes, and higher mortality.
Therefore, it is important to find a way to prevent delirium. Sensory stimulation with music and videos in ICU patients has been found to reduce delirium incidence and improve patient outcomes. However, these interventions can be cumbersome for the staff and often require the same stimulation repeatedly. Also, patients may have some preferences in the types of stimuli they like.
Virtual Reality (VR) is an innovative and popular technology that may improve patient engagement with sensory stimulation. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of 14 days of VR-based sensory stimulation in preventing delirium in ICU patients.
Participants will be screened for eligibility and randomized to either the VR-based intervention group or the usual care group. Patients in the intervention group will receive the VR-based sensory stimulation. Patients in the usual care group will receive routine clinical care. Patients in both groups will be followed up for 6 months to assess the long-term effects of this intervention.
This study will assess the effectiveness of this intervention in preventing delirium and evaluate its impact on patient outcomes and quality of life. The study will also examine whether the intervention reduces the risk for developing PTSD, anxiety, and depression in ICU patients."

Introduction: Stress is an adaptive response to a physical, psychological or social stimulus. Stress exposure can impact the immediate, short-term and long-term functioning of the body. The physiological stress response is typically measured objectively via neuro-endocrine (i.e., saliva cortisol) and cardiovascular stress markers. The aim of this study is to compare the physiological stress responses elicited by three different laboratory stress tests (MMST, TSST and control): In a population of healthy participants:
Examine the psychobiological responses to a) the MMST (a computer based psychological stress test), b) a traditional TSST protocol (consisting of a simulated speech task in front of a panel consisting of two observers), and c) a Control test (a 60 second quiet rest period).
The primary hypothesis is that: i) The MMST and TSST induce acute physiological stress responses, whereby stressors elicit the release of saliva cortisol and heart rate acceleration; ii) The psychobiological responses will be independent of the specific laboratory stress test conditions. 
Design: A sample of 60, healthy, physically active recreationally active male and female adults aged between 18-35 years with varying levels of trait anxiety (low STAI-trait scores <40 or high STAI-trait scores ≥40) will be recruited and invited to the Biological and Exercise Sciences Building at the University of Sydney Camperdown to complete a short physical test, before taking part in the experimental session.
The experimental session will occur between 10 AM to 3 PM. Participants will complete a questionnaire related to their menstrual cycle (females only), their daily food, drink and exercise levels, and anxiety levels.
Participants will then complete a control test (a period of quiet resting), followed by either the MMST or the TSST. The TSST or MMST protocols will be randomised in a cross over design within the limits of 48hrs. Each participant will complete 1 of the 2 tests on day 1, and then the alternate test the following day (i.e., Day 2), on average 24 to 72 hours respectively. Participants will first complete a baseline test (5 minutes pre-stress test), before completing a stress test of either the MMST or the TSST. For the MMST or the TSST, participants will be asked to perform the computerized laboratory stress tests while lying comfortably on a bed in a quiet laboratory room, and will have a small camera placed at the foot of the bed, and a chest strap to measure heart rate. During the MMST or the TSST, participants will be exposed to standardised acoustic and visual stressors over a 20-minute period. Following the completion of the TSST or MMST protocol the participant will be asked to perform the same baseline test (5 minutes pre-stress) under the control conditions (lying on the bed without stressors). Following, the participant will be asked to lie down on the bed for a 110 minute period to assess any post-stress test outcomes.
Saliva samples will be collected by asking participants to swallow, and when comfortable to salivate into a small sample container. A member of staff will stand next to the participant to ensure compliance and monitor any swallowing or production errors. For the MMST, saliva samples will be collected before (5 minutes pre), during each 5 min test period (pre, 5 min 1, 5 min 2, 5min 3, peak post) and post-test (10 minutes post-test, 40 minutes post-test, 100 minutes post-test). For the TSST, saliva samples will be collected pre-test (5 minutes pre), during each 5 minute test period (pre, 5 min 1, 5 min 2, peak post) and post-test (10 minutes post-test, 40 minutes post-test, 100 minutes post-test). Saliva samples will be collected using a Salivette device which has a 2ml saliva sample collection.
All collected saliva will be immediately stored in 2ml cryotubes and stored at -20°C until analysis, in the Biological and Exercise Sciences laboratory at the University of Sydney. Saliva samples will be analysed for free cortisol using ELISA, as well as for alph-amylase concentration.
Measures: The primary outcome will be to assess the impact of laboratory stress tests on saliva cortis"

Aim 1: To examine the effectiveness of VR plus standard medical therapy in reducing the experience of pain in patients 6 to 21 years with sickle cell VOC who present to the emergency department (ED), compared to historical standard medical care alone.
Aim 2: To examine the effectiveness of VR plus standard medical therapy in reducing hospital admission rates for patients 6 to 21 years with sickle cell VOC who present to the ED, compared to historical standard medical therapy alone.
Participants with sickle cell VOC will be invited to trial during their emergency department visit and will be randomized to either receive VR along with standard medical care, or standard medical care alone. The primary hypothesis is that patients who receive VR in addition to standard medical therapy will report lower pain severity when compared to historical control patients who received standard medical therapy alone. The second hypothesis is that patients who receive VR in addition to standard medical therapy will have a decreased rate of hospital admission compared to historical control patients who received standard medical therapy alone. Secondary hypotheses related to impact of VR on length of stay and time to ED disposition will be examined."

The main objective of this study is to evaluate speech function after pharyngeal flap surgery in children with cleft palate using both patient- and parent-response outcome measurements. The children will be assessed by CLEFT-Q, speech intelligibility in context scale, and questionnaires about feeding problems, quality of life, speech handicap, and emotional problems.
The investigators hypothesize that speech function and intelligibility after pharyngeal flap surgery in children with cleft palate will be positively correlated with improvement in quality of life and the parents' rating of their child's speech intelligibility compared to preoperative speech function.
To investigate the relationship between speech function, quality of life, and caregivers' rating of the child's communication, the investigators plan to recruit 100 children with cleft palate, who will be evaluated before and one year after pharyngeal flap surgery."

Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is a severe psychiatric disorder, and probiotics have been reported to be feasible and effective for the treatment of AUD. This study aimed to address the limitation found in previous studies concerning study type, the quality of the experimental probiotics, the absence of specific control group, sample size, and the lack of data on acceptability and effect size. The study is a three-armed, parallel-group, single-blind, randomized control trial. A total of 120 AUD male volunteers will be recruited from the hospitalized AUD patients admitted to the Hospital of the People's Liberation Army 244 Hospital and XX Hospital in China and assigned into 2 intervention groups and an inert placebo group. All subjects will be given the fecal collection tube and rice paper and be asked to collect their feces before the baseline measurement. The researchers will collect serum samples from all subjects through the procedure used for blood donation. The probiotics or placebo group will undergo daily probiotics or placebo administration for 12 consecutive weeks. The other group is the acceptance and commitment therapy group, where the subject will meet the therapist for one 1-hour session weekly, for a total of eight sessions. The primary clinical endpoints are alcohol consumption, alcohol craving, and the severity of alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The secondary clinical endpoints are depression, anxiety symptoms, ERP in the EEG monitoring, and fecal microbiota analysis, the modulation of the serum immunological parameter including TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-1 beta, and the gut microbiota."

The purpose of the experiment is to study the vaginal cuff complication within 30 days after total laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) using barbed absorbable suture (BAS) or standard suture.
A prospective, randomized and single-blinded study was conducted at Institut Aster. The study population consisted of fifty women aged 18 years and more who underwent an elective total laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign pathology. All patients were included in the study by a dedicated member of the team who had no relationship with the intervention. After completion of data collection, the randomization sequence was computer generated by one physician unrelated to the study.
After total laparoscopic hysterectomy, the vaginal cuff closure was then performed by the investigator unaware of the allocation of the surgical specimen. The patient group was not aware of the type of suture used for colporrhaphy. The use of both BAS and the standard suture on the same patient allowed to perform a comparison within the same patient. The colporrhaphy was performed according to the international Consensus of the vaginal cuff in total laparoscopic hysterectomy. The choice of one standard and one special suture (BAS) has been made according to the data collected in the literature for the current situation
The vaginal cuff complications were recorded within 30 days and 90 days after surgery. The follow-up was conducted by the surgical team at 2, 3, 6 and 9 months. The main objective was to compare the number of vaginal cuff complications within 30 days between the two types of suture. The secondary objectives were to compare the morbidity, length of hospital stay, operating time, blood loss and sexual function.

Gambling addiction is a psychiatric disorder characterized by aberrant patterns of gambling behavior, leading to adverse consequences for personal, family, and social life. It remains a major public health concern affecting more than 2% of the adult population worldwide. Despite important progress in developing effective treatments, gambling addiction remains stubbornly resistant to most of the currently available therapeutic strategies. The proposed project aims to address this issue by developing two new therapeutic targets, one based on cognitive dysfunction, another on the overconsumption of alcohol and other drugs. To do this, we will design, in a collaborative effort between research organizations and the gambling industry, novel clinical trials in a large population of gamblers with a variety of comorbidities. These studies will test, in a first step, whether existing cognitive or addictive treatments can be used to enhance the treatment outcomes of gamblers. In a second step, our team will test the efficacy of innovative treatment strategies, including cognitive-behavioral therapy for gambling addiction, interventions targeting alcohol and other substance use, and brain stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).
The clinical studies proposed here will be built on a novel theoretical model of gambling addiction, which combines the concepts of impulsivity, addiction, and reward processing dysfunction, as well as individual differences in social motivations that are likely to affect relapse. This theoretical framework proposes a radical re-conceptualization of the neurobiological model of gambling addiction, and can be summarized as follows: the excessive gambling behavior of gamblers is caused by (1) deficits in reward processing, which lead to (2) deficits in impulse control. These deficits interact with (3) socially mediated risk factors, such as social expectations and peer modeling, which are likely to explain why gambling addiction is more prevalent in some sub-populations of gamblers. By combining the concepts of impulsivity, addiction, and deficits in reward processing, this model can shed light on the complex and heterogeneous nature of gambling addiction.

Obesity is a widely spread and rapidly developing disease with increasing incidence worldwide. Adequate weight reduction in the adult population cannot be achieved with dietary and drug measures.
The most effective method is bariatric surgery, which is performed by laparoscopic technique with a low mortality rate.
As different methods are used in different centers, it is therefore necessary to make a standardized approach to obtain the best possible result.

Currently, the investigator team is working on a new imaging system for bariatric operations and has already used several methods (2D vision with HD quality and 3D imaging). These systems are currently not the standard for bariatric surgery in Germany. In addition, they have no clear advantage for the surgeon compared to the 2D, HD laparoscopic visualization system currently standard in Laparoendoscopic surgery in Germany.

It was therefore decided to carry out this controlled prospective randomized trial to objectively assess the advantages and disadvantages of each system in a prospective, controlled study in a large patient population. The investigator's clinical experience suggests that the new systems have a similar effectiveness, but offer the surgeon additional possibilities. There is a high degree of subjective acceptance. It is therefore to be expected that due to the advantages of the new imaging systems, more surgeons will use these methods in the future.
In this prospective controlled study, the investigator tests the safety and performance of the new systems in a blinded, randomized and controlled study. All procedures are carried out by the three operators involved in the study. This procedure allows for an optimal comparison of the new methods with the standard procedure. The results of this study are expected to improve the quality and safety of bariatric care."

The aim of this study was to investigate whether exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is present following exercise in patient after total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and if so, if it changes with exercise intensity.
Patients were randomized into two groups. Sixty-five patients were enrolled in this study, however the mean age of patients were 57,4±6,4 years and their BMI 31,4±4,2 kg/m2. Exclusion criteria were: Medically stable patients who used glucocorticoids or strong analgesic drugs, Patients with medial collateral ligament insufficiency, patients had severe contracture and loss of range of motion, patients were diagnosed with chronic pain condition.
An exercise program was applied to patient groups to see if EIH appeared. Before exercise the baseline values were determined. Pain severity was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS; scored from 0, no pain, to 100, the worst pain ever) and pressure pain threshold (PPTs) was measured over quadriceps and biceps brachii and muscles immediately before and after exercise. Pain severity decreased in both exercise groups but EIH was not found. Pain of TKA patients increased with exercise intensity which was in parallelism with increasing muscle pain. Pressure pain threshold was not significantly different from the both sides.
The EIH phenomenon was not demonstrated in patients following TKA but increased muscle pain was associated with increased pain with exercise intensity. These findings can contribute to the rehabilitation program, but further studies are needed to conclude about EIH phenomenon in post TKA patients.

INTRODUCTION:
Sarcopenia is a process that occurs in elderly with low muscle mass or strength. It is a clinical syndrome which related to physical performance and increased fracture risk, hospital stay, and mortality. As a multifactorial problem, it is associated with protein metabolism disorders, hormonal changes, chronic diseases leading to muscle damage, and nutrient deficiency including the micronutrient zinc.
Ophiochepalus striatus is a plant native to Indonesia that contains a protein source called VipAlbumin. VipAlbumin is a protein with rich leucine content, thus it has a high ability to increase muscle mass as a result of protein synthesis. Leucine in VipAlbumin is involved in the regulation of IGF-1 in the body. IGF-1, a growth factor, has an important role in regulating muscle development, repair, and maintenance.
O. Striatus extract (VipAlbumin) is a source of micronutrient zinc. Zinc is involved in the synthesis of proteins and IGF-1. Zinc is also involved in gene expression for muscle development. Recently, studies have revealed that serum inflammatory markers such as IL-6 is associated with muscle mass and physical performance in elderly.
Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of O. Striatus extract on serum IGF-1 and IL-6 levels in elderly patients with sarcopenia. 
RESEARCH DESIGN:
This study is a randomized, controlled, double masked, parallel designed study. A total of 65 elderly patients who suffer from sarcopenia, diagnosed based on AWGS criteria will be recruited in this study. The study will be divided into two groups, intervention and control group, with 34 subjects in each group using parallel assignment. The intervention group will receive dietary supplementation with Ophiochepalus striatus extract, 2x5 grams a day for 14 days. Meanwhile, the control group will receive placebo, 2x5 grams a day for 14 days.
Sociodemographic data will be collected through simple questionnaire, the participants will undergo nutritional and muscle strength evaluation, as well as measure for SARC-F score, to evaluate the severity of sarcopenia. Blood samples will be taken at inclusion and 2 weeks after supplementation, to analyze the serum creatinine, estimated GFR, serum zinc and vitamin B12 levels, as well as IGF-1 and IL-6 levels.
All analysis will be done using SPSS statistics software version 22. Data will be presented as mean score ± standard deviation. The comparison between post test intervention and control groups will be analyzed using Student t test. A p < 0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.

The feasibility design of a clinical feasibility study is important for the design of a long term clinical effectiveness study. The investigators have proposed a 2-arm randomized control feasibility study to evaluate the 2Morrow Chronic Pain Self-Management Program (an app that delivers a digital therapeutic). Specifically, the investigators will conduct a 2-arm randomized control feasibility study to evaluate: 1) the feasibility of using the mobile app and an optional activity tracker, 2) the feasibility of conducting a 2-arm trial, and 3) estimate the effect size for planning for a larger efficacy trial based on primary outcomes. The intervention arm will test the feasibility of the use of the mobile app which is designed to help people reduce pain interference who have chronic pain. Patients who enter the study will be randomized to either the active treatment arm or a treatment as usual control arm. Participants in the intervention arm will have access to the digital therapeutic, which aims to utilize Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) based activities to improve a patient's pain self management, in addition to access to a coach through texting."

Robotic intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction is a valid oncologic approach for the treatment of muscle-invasive bladder carcinoma with a relatively low morbidity. However, it is still burdened by relevant rates of mid-term complications. In the literature, 45% to 72% of patients postoperatively develop complications, with a median incidence of 20% to 50%, mainly of the urological type. Uretero-neobladder anastomosis (UNA) and stented vs stentless configuration could have influence both on the success of neobladder creation and on postoperative complications.

In the context of the robot-assisted radical cystectomy and neobladder reconstruction, UNA represents a critical point for the surgeon. The presence of a long, tension-free anastomosis was shown to be correlated to bladder-emptying issues. In addition, uretero-neobladder anastomosis remains the last step of a long procedure with the potential to induce ureteral tissue damage.

We hypothesize that 2 different steps of the surgical process could influence the outcomes of reconstructive surgery: the technique for neobladder configuration and if the ureteral anastomosis is stented vs stentless.

The novelty of our hypothesis is constituted by the aim to compare the stentless vs stented technique in robot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladder creation, focusing also on uretero-neobladder anastomosis complications.

Objectives: Describe and compare our experience of stentless Florence Robotic Intracorporeal configuration compared to stented configuration in terms of complication rates and incidence of postoperative complications.

Inclusion Criteria for patients are:
- Patients with diagnosed Bladder Cancer with clinical stage T1-T4N0-N1M0
- Patients who were amenable to radical cystectomy with eligible to orthotopic neobladder reconfiguration, curative intent and FloRIN reconfiguration were included.
- Patients were randomized in two group: Stentless Florence Robotic Intra Corporeal Neobladder configuration and Stented Florence Robotic Intra Corporeal Neobladder configuration.
 
- Exclusion Criteria:
- Presence of one or multiple tumor metastases at preoperative staging
- Histopathological confirmation of bladder tumor at the level of prostatic urethra;
- Treatment without curative intent (cT4b, salvage or palliative cystectomies);
- Presence of urethral stricture.

Design:
An observational study will be performed on consecutive patients submitted to robot-assisted radical cystectomy, with or without intracorporeal neobladder reconstruction. Patients are divided into 2 groups: the stentless-florence uretero neobladder group and the stented-florence uretero neobladder group. All patients in both groups underwent the same surgical steps with the exception that in the stentless group the ureteral anastomosis was performed directly while mono J ureteral catheters were employed in case of stent placed in the stented group. Comparison results will be evaluated in terms of complications rate up to 6 months since surgery.

The investigators propose a study to test a new model of continuity of nutrition care across settings with malnourished older adults who are discharged from acute care hospitals.
Malnutrition is a prevalent condition in older adults. Malnutrition adversely affects their physical, social, functional and economic well-being. Malnutrition is also associated with increased risk of death from any cause. Hospital and community meal provision organizations, when working collaboratively, can provide needed nutrition care in the community at low cost. This is particularly important for older adults who are malnourished at discharge from the hospital. This proposed study seeks to examine this new model to determine if a more coordinated approach to nutrition care results in improved food security, improved outcomes for malnutrition and higher referral to meals programs.
Altered food environments, reduced cooking capacity, declining financial resources and declining income may all lead to food insecurity and malnutrition in older adults. Malnourished older adults (60 years and older) 1.5 million each year, with higher rates in specific populations. In the US, malnutrition is more prevalent in older adults in the following population groups: women, individuals with mental health or cognitive impairment, individuals who smoke, individuals with mental health and/or cognitive impairment and individuals with high health care use. Malnourished older individuals can have higher rates of hospital readmission. When older adults enter the hospital, they are typically managed for the medical conditions for which they are admitted. While in the hospital, they receive the appropriate nutrient support, but after discharge, the patient may not have adequate access to the required nutrients needed to maintain their physical well-being, leading to a higher likelihood of adverse outcomes such as re hospitalization, decreased quality of life, increased risk of death from any cause, increased risk of falls, reduced ability to function independently with activities of daily living. Currently, hospital discharge personnel and community meal providers are not required to have nutrition care provider staff to support those who leave the hospital. There is a paucity of research which examines the continuity (or lack thereof) of nutrition care between the hospital and the community. As such, when patients are discharged from the hospital and their nutrition problem has not been addressed, there is no structured mechanism for the continuity of nutrition care to ensure health and wellness post discharge.
The investigators propose that an enhanced continuity of nutrition care for adults 60 years and older discharged from the hospital with malnutrition improves food security, food intake and quality of life. The goal of the investigators is to improve food security, increase access to nutrition care and meals, and improve outcomes for malnourished older adults.

This study is to investigate the effects of increased levels of ketone bodies (3-OHB), in particular a ketone-like molecule called 1,3-butanediol (1,3-BK), on cardiovascular hemodynamics in patients with chronic heart failure. It is anticipated that these molecules will lead to improvements in blood flow to the heart as well as to the body, and that there will be effects on blood pressure control, endothelial function, and energy metabolism. The hypothesis is that 1,3-BK will increase cardiac output by up to 1 litre/minute through the stimulation of sympathetic drive to the heart. This change will be independent of any changes in stroke volume or venous return, which will be measured non-invasively using standard cardiovascular measurements.
This is an investigator-initiated, randomised, counter-balanced, double-blind, crossover intervention study. The proposed sample number 12 in each study, 4 in each blood pressure category (hypotension, euthyroid and hypertension) will allow significant effects to be shown for a statistically significant difference of the mean outcome variables. Each patient will participate in three separate study sessions (each lasting >1day) 6 weeks apart.
Inclusion Criteria:
Inclusion criteria include all patients with chronic symptomatic heart failure who had been referred to cardiology clinic for worsening symptoms secondary to LV systolic dysfunction. These patients present across the BP groups and cover the wide spectrum of heart failure symptoms and severity, thus ensuring they are representative of patients seen in out-patient clinic. Exclusion criteria (as below) are necessary to avoid potential confounding effects.
Exclusion Criteria:
Patients with significant cardiac valve disease, severe stable angina pectoris (Canadian Heart Association [CHA] cardiac functional level II-IV) or severe comorbidity are excluded from the study because these patients would require different management strategies that may confound the interpretation of study results. A more definitive exclusion is diabetes and/or poor glycemic control, as patients with diabetes may require different medical support. Patients with very low cardiac output may be excluded from the study in case they are too unwell to cope with the intervention or suffer side-effects. However, patients in the euthyroid (high-normal BP) group will be offered participation.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of using subpectoral bupivacaine in adolescent females undergoing reduction mammaplasty on pain control outcomes and recovery after surgery.
Reduction mammaplasty is a common surgical procedure performed on patients with excessive breast heaviness or macromastia. The procedure aims to reduce the size of the breast to improve the symmetry of the breast and/or to improve the appearance of sagging breasts. Reduction mammaplasty is typically performed in an outpatient setting under general anesthesia. Many adolescent females who undergo this surgical procedure require narcotics and extended recovery times with delayed return to full activity and school.
The current study is a pilot study performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subpectoral bupivacaine as well as the feasibility of conducting a larger multi-center prospective trial. The subpectoral bupivacaine is injected into the fascia below the pectoralis muscles to provide analgesia for up to 48 hours in the immediate post-operative period.
This will allow patients to have decreased pain for the first few days after surgery, which will translate into reduced narcotic use, shorter duration in the post-anesthesia care unit and out of the hospital.
The primary outcome measure will be comparing the difference in post-operative pain score between the two groups of patients who receive either saline or subpectoral bupivacaine.
The overall objective is to determine if the administration of subpectoral bupivacaine provides effective analgesia for up to 48 hours post-operative in this patient population with decreased narcotic use."

Introduction: The most effective way to cope with a chronic problem is to be proactive in adopting new lifestyle habits and routines that will prevent or alleviate the condition.
Purpose: This study will investigate the implementation strategy, in terms of feasibility and the possible benefits, of a free online Zoom t'ai chi and qigong gentle movement and meditation program to reduce back pain and improve sleep and quality of life among those with chronic back pain.
Study Design and Methods: The study will be a prospective, randomized controlled trial with two groups: a t'ai chi and qigong exercise (treatment) group and a waitlist control group. The waitlist control group will simply be a comparison group. The study team will conduct a single-centered, single-blind, parallel design, randomized controlled trial with 300 participants randomly allocated to one of two arms: a waitlist control or a 12-week, twice per week, T'ai Chi and Qigong exercise. Consent for participation in the t'ai chi classes and completion of the baseline and three additional surveys will be included in the Survey. The Informed Consent for participation in the study will be prompted before the start of the initial Survey in Qualtrics. Potential participants of the t'ai chi classes cannot advance to the survey or participate in the t'ai chi program without accepting consent for participation. In the event consent is declined, the survey is prompted to end.
Feasibility Outcomes: We will assess attendance and retention rates among participants throughout the 3-phase of the study: (phase I baseline; phase II 4-weeks after completion of class; phase III 4-weeks later).
Primary Outcomes: We will conduct telephone interviews with a number of participants in the t'ai chi classes who completed all 12 classes. A post-intervention Survey will also be completed by all individuals, with assessments conducted immediately after completion of the 12th class, at 4 weeks post-class, and at 4 weeks post-Study Baseline. The following measures are the primary outcome measures for this study:
1. Change in ODI 3 months after intervention. The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is a commonly used outcome measure for individuals with low back pain. The ODI includes 10 questions about pain intensity, personal care, lifting, walking, sitting, standing, sleeping, sex life, social life and traveling, each based upon a 6-item Likert scale. Each section is scored on a 0-5 scale, 5 representing the greatest disability. If a respondent does not answer all 10 questions, then average scores and levels of disability are adjusted to account for skipping. If all 10 questions are answered, then the maximum score possible is 50 (10 x 5). We will measure the change in ODI levels from the pre-survey baseline survey (Phase I) to the post-intervention survey immediately after the completion of the final class.
2. Change in VAS back pain. The visual analog scale (VAS) is a validated, subjective measure of pain that is commonly used in research. The VAS measures pain intensity on a scale of 0 to 10, with 0 representing no pain and 10 representing the worst pain imaginable. We will measure change in back and leg pain from Phase I to Phase III.
3. Change in VAS leg pain. The visual analog scale is also used to assess leg pain intensity with a scale of 0 to 10.
4. The SF-36, Short Form Health Survey questionnaire. The SF-36 is a widely used tool for assessing Health-Related Quality of Life. The SF-36 assesses eight scales: (1) Physical functioning, (2) Role limitations due to physical health, (3) Role limitations due to emotional problems, (4) Energy/fatigue, (5) Emotional well-being, (6) Social functioning, (7) Pain, and (8) General health. We will measure change in these eight scales from baseline to follow up.
5. 19-Item Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven component scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. We will measure change in these seven component scores from baseline to 4-week and 8-week follow up.

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) during the application of direct electrical current (DC) for accelerating the retraction of upper anterior teeth in a randomized controlled clinical trial.
                Patients with class II division 1 malocclusion will be randomized into two groups. Group one, the traditional retraction group, will undergo retraction of upper anterior teeth using 250 g of force per side from NiTi closed coil pre-activated springs, and the force will be monitored using a force gauge at every appointment for 3 months. Group two, the accelerated retraction group, will receive both direct electrical current applied on the upper anterior teeth area by a removable intraoral device containing a small electrical circuit beside the retraction using the same springs system.
                Patients will be informed about a scale from 0 to 100 measured by visual analog scale (VAS) that is used to evaluate the following PROMs: perception of pain, discomfort, burning and swelling in the upper anterior teeth area, chewing ability, speech ability, analgesic consumption, satisfaction with orthodontic treatment, ease of the procedure, the possibility of repeating the procedure, and a recommendation of the procedure. PROMs will be evaluated one day before the placement of the mini-implants (T0), at the end of the first, second, and third months of the retraction of the upper anterior teeth (T1, T2, T3). PROMs will also be evaluated at the end of the retraction period after 3 months (T4), and at the end of the fixed appliances treatment (T5)."

Study Purpose: This study was conducted to support diabetes children and their parents by increasing their health literacy. Turkey, according to the WHO (2016) Global Report on Diabetes, is also in the high-risk group in terms of diabetes incidence. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2015, it is stated that the number of people with type 2 diabetes is increasing every year in the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 2019 Turkey Report published, Turkey is among the top ten countries with the highest number of diabetic individuals. In the world, children aged 8-12 years constitute a substantial portion of the diabetic population according to the data of 2019. In a study conducted in Turkey and published in 2016, it was determined that there are approximately 250,000 children under the age of 18 diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes in Turkey (Tuncer et al., 2016). Type 1 diabetes in children is a chronic disease in which the immune system attacks the pancreatic cells. These cells are responsible for producing insulin. Therefore, children diagnosed with type 1 diabetes have to inject insulin at least 8 times a day. According to the Diabetes Foundation, Type 1 diabetes is diagnosed most frequently between the ages of 5 and 18, with the peak rate of diagnosis between the ages of 6-9 (Diabetes Foundation, 2020). Children cannot continue their normal activities after diagnosis, even during routine check-ups for other health issues. According to the findings of the research conducted in Turkey and published in 2016, children diagnosed with diabetes between the ages of 8-12 can have problems such as depression, anxiety, stress, and eating disorders due to diabetes and its complications (Tuncer et al., 2016). Children are exposed to a variety of social problems because of these problems. At this stage, it is essential that the parents of children who will be diagnosed with diabetes within the scope of the research are educated in order to make them more effective, and that children are made more effective in order to manage the disease on their own. In the study, it was determined that there are not enough studies in Turkey on health literacy and diabetes in children. In a research conducted by Demir et al. (2019) in Turkey, a scale was created to determine the diabetic health literacy of children. The research determined the validity and reliability of the scale within the scope of the research. In the literature review, it was found that many researchers use games as educational tools for children to improve health literacy. Today, educational games are preferred more in educational environments (Aydemir & Demir, 2018). In addition, children gain knowledge and solve many problems related to their health problems by observing and playing with them by using games. Therefore, it is aimed to develop a board game in line with the social learning theory by combining the experiences of the expert researcher and the expert clinical advisor, and to determine the Turkish validity and reliability of the literacy scale in Turkey.
Inclusion Criteria: 
-Diabetes age is 1 year or more,
-Attended the hospital's three-month regular outpatient clinics,
-Absent any other disease accompanying the diabetes (Celiac Disease, Hypothyroidism. Depression, Epilepsy, Autism),
-7-year-old children (8-12 years old).

Design and Methodology: In this study, it is planned to examine the effect of intervention on children with diabetes aged 8-12 years and their parents. This is a randomized controlled study. First, a face-to-face meeting will be made with the participants through a telephone interview. A total of 300 patients between the ages of 8-12 diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in the Family Medicine Polyclinic at the Family Health Center of Akçalık University will be included in the research. In this research, 100 children will be included in the experimental group and 100 will be included in the control group. It is planned to meet with the experimental group 3 times in total. In the first interview, Diabetes Child Diagnosis Form, Diabetes Health Literacy Scale for Acute Complications of Children will be applied to the experimental group. The intervention group (experimental group) will also play a designed diabetes health literacy board game. These children will be trained as a board game in a quiet, bright environment, with tables and 4 chairs arranged in the room. The interviews will"

The purpose of this study is to test if lavender oil scent can alleviate dental anxiety and reduce the amount of local anesthetic needed, in children who need their primary molar extracted. The study includes three different groups: a control group which does not receive any intervention, and two experimental groups which inhale different kinds of scents (rosemary oil and lemongrass oil) right before dental extraction. After anesthesia the dentist will extract the targeted primary molar. The results of the study will show whether inhaling rosemary oil scent can reduce the pain felt by the children during the procedure, their fear (anxiety) and the need for extra doses of local anesthetic. The findings will provide evidence whether using scents can help patients with moderate to severe fear during an invasive procedure, and whether it can reduce the amount of anesthetic needed and minimize the associated discomfort of local anesthetic injections and the use of the local anesthetics."

Smartphones are the technological devices of our age that are constantly developing and their use is becoming more widespread every day. Smart phones, which make positive contributions to daily life, attract great attention by individuals of all age groups, especially young people. According to Newzoo's report, the number of smartphone users, which was 3.5 billion in 2020, is expected to reach 4.1 billion in 2023. Smartphones, which are preferred by almost everyone for reasons such as being easily portable, providing fast access in transactions, ease of use and sometimes a status indicator, can pose a risk for addiction when used uncontrolled. Smart phone addiction, although not yet clearly defined; It can manifest itself with symptoms such as constantly checking the phone, feeling restless when staying away, withdrawing, mood changes, not being able to control the duration of use, disruption in daily life due to problematic use, constant desire to use and pleasure from use. As in all risky behaviors that threaten public health, the public health nurse provides consultancy services to the society as a requirement of education and consultancy in smart phone addiction and informs the society about the problems that may arise with the trainings it will organize. Based on all this information, the reason for the selection of nursing students in the research universe; To raise awareness among students and contribute to public health, since nursing students are candidates to provide health services to the society, they are role models for the society with their healthy lifestyle behaviors, they interact with individuals from all parts of the society in business life, and there are institutions that provide service on addiction among their work areas. This study, which was planned to determine the effect of Transtheoretic Model and motivational interview-based online intervention program on smartphone addiction and sleep quality levels in nursing students who are in the risk group for smartphone addiction, was carried out. The study included 119 nursing students in the risk group for smartphone addiction. Among the participants; 88% were female and 12% were male, 60.8% were first-year students, 27.5% were second-year students, 6% were third-year students and 5.9% were fourth -year students. The groups were randomized through randomization method using a randomization list. The motivational interviewing group, which was trained on smart phone addiction, was provided a motivational interviewing program based on the Transtheoretical Model. The final data of the participants were collected and evaluated before the intervention and at the end of the intervention using the smart phone addiction scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and classification of stages of change scale. The scores obtained from the Smartphone Addiction Scale (P = .003), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (P = .003) were found to be significantly different in the analysis of variance. It was observed that students' smart phone addictions and sleep quality were positively affected by the motivational interviewing program. In this study, it was determined that the motivational interviewing program based on the Transtheoretical Model had a positive effect on the smart phone addiction and sleep quality levels of nursing students in the risk group for smart phone addiction."

Hypothesis: Cerebral metabolic alteration can represent a sign of neurodegenerative disease even in an early stage.
The presence of these modifications could have a diagnostic or prognostic value for neurodegenerative diseases and Head trauma.
For this purpose, the investigators will carry out a retrospective review of the FDG-PET images previously acquired at PET-CT of University Hospital of Modena. From the image of the FDG scan, a diagnostic test based on the evaluation of cerebral metabolic patterns was done.
Moreover, the investigators will carry out a comparison between normal patients and those with neurodegenerative diseases to identify the brain areas of hypo or hyper regional metabolism and to identify the differences between the disease specific metabolic patterns and the typical signs of Head trauma."

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease with an estimated incidence of 1 in 900-1000 among UK Caucasians. This disorder is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that encodes a multifunctional protein that helps maintain balance of salt and water within the body. The most commonly cited symptoms of CF are coughing and sputum production, a build-up of thick mucus, severe breathing problems, salt imbalances, and malnutrition and stunted growth. Although 90% of pwCF in the UK are treated with a combination of enzyme replacement therapy (ERTh) to correct intestinal malabsorption and inhaled medications, including antibiotics (e.g. tobramycin), the life expectancy for people with CF is on average only about 50 years. In addition to pulmonary complications, CF patients are at risk for bone damage, digestive issues, hormone deficiencies, cancer and other health problems. Given the increasing availability of COVID-19 vaccines, it is now paramount that we understand the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on pwCF and how they develop protective antibody responses. Despite the importance of these studies, no robust study data are currently available for CF patients with regards to SARS-CoV-2 immunity in the CF population, who may have underlying factors that affect vaccine responses or COVID-19 infection outcomes in populations without CF. It is anticipated that such studies will contribute to the knowledge base in relation to immune responses and potential clinical complications in pwCF post SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Thus, the investigators aim to conduct the first prospective study to provide comprehensive insights into the magnitude and nature of immune responses to natural COVID-19 infection and COVID-19 vaccines in pwCF. Through the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies (SARS-CoV-2 Seroprevalence) and detection of changes in COVID-19 related clinical outcomes such as clinical symptoms, clinical complications and death rate, the investigators will describe the antibody responses following natural infection in pwCF. The study will also assess any differences in antibody responses and clinical COVID-19 outcomes by age, vaccination history and geographic location. Furthermore, the investigators will investigate the proteomic and genetic responses of pwCF, who are SARS-CoV-2 seropositive and seronegative. This will provide valuable information on the complex interplay between the innate, adaptive immune and proteomic responses in pwCF. Ultimately, the data generated by this study will enhance our understanding of the immune responses in pwCF to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination."

The purpose of this study is the evaluation of symptomatic convergence insufficiency in patients with myopia.
All consecutive symptomatic (dizziness, headache, fatigue, eyestrain, reading difficulties, double vision, blur vision and trouble with accommodation) or asymptomatic myopic patients who will be diagnosed by convergence insufficiency will be enrolled. The patients will be screened in the department of Pediatric and adolescent Medicine. If convergence insufficiency is found the patient will be applied to the department of Ophthalmology with symptomatic treatment of optical correction of glasses (monocular distance and near glass) and near training of one eye. The training group received visual training in hospital. And then the quality of life of patients before and after the treatment (optical correction and near visual training) will be evaluated by EuroQol 5D-5L(EQ-5D-5L) and Short Form 6D(SF-6D). And the visual performance of patients will be assessed in terms of accommodation, convergence, sensory and motor functions.
Myopic patients with symptomatic convergence insufficiency should be seen in terms of disease severity and quality of life. After the diagnostic evaluations to be made by optometrist, myopic patients will be divided into two groups according to Near Point Convergence (NPC) (NPC<6cm, the patient will be applied to the treatment group and the patients with NPC≥6cm, the patients will be applied to the control group). Control group had not received visual training. Then EQ-5D and SF-6D questionnaires were used to evaluate the quality of life scores of myopic patients before and after the treatment (optical correction and near visual training) of the patients."

Vulvar cancer is a cancer of the vulva, which is a woman's external genitalia. Most vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) which tend to stay localized and can be cured. However, the localized tumor of SCC can spread or metastasize to the lymph nodes in the groin (inguinofemoral lymph nodes) which can worsen the prognosis of SCC. An operation to remove the tumor and some lymph nodes in the groin (lymphadenectomy or pelvic lymph node dissection) is the standard way to treat SCC that has spread to the lymph nodes, but it is not always needed for patients' early-stage cancer based on their lymph node mapping. Sentinel lymph node mapping and biopsy (SLN mapping and biopsy) can help identify the sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) that are likely to be involved with the cancer. The SLN mapping and SLN biopsy are usually done during surgery. Patients can have fewer long-term side effects if they do not have surgery on the lymph nodes (lymphadenectomy) because the surgery can cause complications such as lymphedema and leg swelling.
This pilot study will evaluate blue dye and ICG dye methods currently used for SLN mapping and compare the sensitivity and accuracy of these two methods in vulvar cancer. A blue dye (patented commercial blue dye) has been used routinely for over 20 years, while indocyanine green (an FDA-approved drug) used for SLN mapping has been used for other cancers but only for a small number of women with vulvar SCC. We want to study the effectiveness of these two methods.
This study is an observational study and will provide initial results on the use of ICG dye to detect and remove vulvar cancer that may spread to the lymph nodes. By comparing the effectiveness of these two methods, we hope to make it simpler for women with vulvar cancer to have SLN mapping and less unnecessary surgery without compromising staging and oncologic outcomes. This study will also help us understand if ICG dye combined with blue dye can be more accurate, less costly, and more convenient for patients if proven to be effective. This study also involves testing the Spy-Phi handheld camera. By doing this test, we hope to collect data to guide future clinical trials.
This study will only be done to see if the ICG dye combined with blue dye methods are effective. The results from this study will not directly benefit individuals involved in it except for improved knowledge. This study does not offer new or promising benefits to the patients. It only tries to provide a different method for sentinel lymph node mapping. The results from this study might help patients by offering less invasive or surgical options in the future or might change how the procedures for SLN mapping are done in the future.
The study participants include women with early stage vulvar cancer and clinically negative inguinofemoral lymph nodes. Before being enrolled in this study, we will test if an individual has early-stage vulvar cancer that has not spread to the lymph nodes. The purpose of this study is to improve our understanding of ICG dye combined with blue dye. Participants will have a one-time procedure, which will include having a sentinel node biopsy using both blue dye and ICG dyes, possibly during a surgery for treating early stage vulvar cancer. This procedure involves using blue dye and ICG dye as a diagnostic test and a physical exam with a special camera without exposing participants to additional risks."

The aim of the study is to determine the effects of a Lactate and Ketone Body Esther (LaKe ester) on insulin sensitivity and the regulation of eating behavior.
The study will be done as a randomized crossover study with a 4-week feeding of the LaKe ester or a matched isocaloric placebo. The participant will be recruited from the general population with a BMI 30 - 40 kg/m2 and an HbA1c level < 48 mmol/mol. All participants will undergo an initial screening consisting of: medical history, examination of vital signs, physical examination, blood test, ECG.
The primary outcome of the trial will be the change in insulin sensitivity, measured by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp. This procedure involves an intravenous infusion of insulin together with a dextrose solution to keep blood glucose constant.
The secondary outcome measures include measurements of body weight, composition and lipid metabolism, gastric emptying rate, cardiac output and function, levels of hunger, satiety, fullness, energy, and desire to eat in response to consumption of the LaKe ester, as well as tests of mood and cognitive function. Additionally, safety endpoints will be measured, such as blood chemistry and clinical tests of kidney function, echocardiography, and blood pressure.
All measurements will be taken before and after the four-week feeding of the product and an additional three times during the feeding of the product (week 1, 2 and 4). Thus, all measurements will be performed a total of four times. The participants will serve as their own control. For each study day, participants will come to the laboratory around 8.00 am when they will, for example, provide a spot urine sample, have a blood draw and undergo a measurement of body weight, composition and fat oxidation."

The aim of this trial is twofold. First, to assess the impacts of personalized lifestyle instructions based on both genetic data and lifestyle data (such as diet or exercise habits) on mental and physical well-being. The World Health Organisation (WHO) Well-being Index is used to assess psychological health and overall well-being. Second, to explore how users perceive both their genetic results and the personalized recommendations they receive. The perception will be captured using questionnaires with a rating system, alongside semi-structured interviews to understand how these pieces of data are being perceived by healthcare staff. The final aim of the trial is to assess whether the benefits seen by participants continue beyond the 3-month mark, which will be determined by a follow-up questionnaire.  A 6-week long trial will be conducted to explore the impact of FitnessGenes' platform, with a follow-up after 3 months. NHS staff will be recruited to partake in the trial. Following consent to partake in the trial, participants will be asked to complete a pre-trial questionnaire which will explore health and wellbeing interests and motivations, alongside taking a baseline measure of mental and physical wellbeing using the 5-item World Health Organisation Well-being Index (WHO-5) which has been clinically validated. Participants will undertake a DNA test provided by FitnessGenes, free of charge. Following consent participants will be asked to spend a week exploring this upgraded information. A feedback questionnaire will be completed, 3 weeks after receiving the results, to assess participant's experiences of the platform and their results. At the 3-month follow-up, after the baseline measures were taken, a final questionnaire will be completed to assess whether the platform has had any long-lasting impacts on participants' health and wellbeing. This will be done using the 5-item World Health Organisation Well-being Index. Participants will also be asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire, exploring the perceived value of the product. Semi-structured interviews may also be conducted."

It is often difficult to accurately diagnose and treat cases of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, which is an infection where the fungus Aspergillus colonizes in the lungs after reaching the bloodstream during immunodepression. Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is often a highly lethal medical condition - the case-fatality rate may reach 90% in patients with acute leukemia - but its specific signs and symptoms in the body are variable and nonspecific. Therefore, it can be difficult to detect early on. Currently, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is diagnosed only if a microbiology culture or a specific marker (such as a d-galactomannan serum test) proves an active infection with the pathogen. These diagnostic methods, however, are costly and time-consuming, and thus pose an obstacle in the timely treatment and management of patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Other methods, such as CT scans, may show characteristic lung lesions in cases of active aspergillosis, but no characteristic sign can be relied upon to rule out the disease."

Hip pathology will be responsible for 480,000 arthroplasties in 2012 and 600,000 in 2018 in France. In 25% to 50% of cases after total hip replacement surgery, ilio-psoas complications occur due to the ilio-psoas sheath. These complications are responsible for a delay in physiotherapy, a decrease in patient compliance with physiotherapy and consequently an extension of hospitalization and a high rate of rehabilitation. The objective of this study is to develop an effective and reproducible technique for the performance of psoas tenotomy under ultrasound. This technique could change the practice of hip replacement by avoiding the occurrence of this complication and improving the success of early postoperative rehabilitation. The investigators propose to compare the following 3 groups: Group A: Patients who are having a psoas tenotomy under ultrasound. This new group will include 20 patients in whom the psoas tendon will be tenotomized. The psoas tenotomy in the new surgical technique does not involve cutting tendons of the iliopsoas muscle complex, it consists in cutting its sheath using a hook blade. Group B: Patients randomized to have a psoas tenotomy with a standard surgical technique under general anesthesia (group B +). This group will represent the current standard of care for tenotomies of the iliopsoas tendon. Group C: Patients for whom a psoas tenotomy is not performed (group C +) and are randomly assigned. The study will be carried out immediately after obtaining informed consent from the patient and approval from the competent ethics committee, the Commission de l'Investigation en santé (Nantes and Rennes). It is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, open-label, non-comparative, mono-center, retrospective and prospective study, with a follow-up on the day of surgery, and at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after surgery, and will involve a total of about 70 patients."

Background and aims: Multiple sclerosis is a disease characterized by focal or multifocal demyelination, causing both motor and sensory deficits. It is the most common cause of neurological chronic disability in young adults. Fatigue is one of the principal symptom in this disease. Fatigue is prevalent in the MS population and is a significant health problem, negatively impacting activities of daily living, ability to work, social life and quality of life.
                In recent years much has been studied fatigue in multiple sclerosis and have developed a complex neurobiological network that can explain its development but also some of the therapeutic interventions to reduce and treat this problem. It is known that a variety of factors play a role in the etiopathogenesis but, as often happens in complex diseases, there are no precise causes that justify it.
                Several studies have shown that the vibratory treatment of the musculature would favor improvements in the movement control and postural. Moreover, there are some studies demonstrating how the use of vibrations can induce positive effects on the mobility of patients with MS.
                For all these reasons we believe it is essential to study the effects of the vibratory treatment on patients with multiple sclerosis because the therapeutic techniques adopted in rehabilitation, especially for a subject in an earlier phase of the disease, could lead to improvements that would improve their quality of life.
                The purpose of this study is to verify how the use of vibrations can induce positive effects on the mobility and postural control of patients with MS, as well as reduce fatigue.
                The study is an interventional type. The subjects are undergoing to baseline examinations (T0) including 3D gait analysis and a battery of neuropsychological assessments. Subsequently, eligible subjects are undergoing to intensive multidisciplinary training for a total of 5 sessions per week for 4 weeks, with a total of 20 treatment sessions. The experimental group receive additional vibration treatment. At the end of the treatment cycle (T1), the patients will undergo the same evaluation tests as at baseline.
                The Clinical and instrumental exams used for this study (as per normal clinical practice) are: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Modified Fatigue Impact Scale (MFIS), Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions (FSMC), Borg scale, Medical Research Council Scale (MRC), 6 minutes walking test, Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life-54 (MSQOL-54), Beck Depression Inventory-II, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE)."

Transbronchial cryobiopsy is a new technology to obtain lung tissue in patients with chronic lung diseases. Lung trancarpal lung cryobiopsy (TBCB) can obtain more sample tissue in different parts of the lung, helping early identification and early intervention of lung injuries after transplantation, especially the early detection of lung transplantation rejection. The purpose of this study is to verify the diagnostic efficacy of TBCB for lung transplantation complications, and to explore the sample size of TBCB. The study also aims to explore the correlation between the sample size of TBCB and the number of lung samples obtained through transbronchial lung biopsy with biopsy forceps, and to analyze the incidence of complications of TBCB and its influence on the success rate of obtaining lung samples."

Selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) in monochorionic twins can result in a poor prognosis with a substantial risk of intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal morbidity, and impaired neonatal development. Current diagnostic classification based on three different umbilical artery flow patterns is not sufficient; it does not cover a continuum of reduced fetal-placental circulation and does not take into account other ultrasound parameters. Furthermore, predicting fetal deterioration is crucial for an adequate management of sFGR.
An international, prospective, multicenter observation study (TiME-sFGR) has been designed in collaboration with several experts in the field of perinatal medicine. The main goal is to improve the diagnostic- and outcome-management of sFGR by focusing on the predictive power of diagnostic and ultrasound parameters. TiME-sFGR combines state-of-the-art ultrasound modalities, a large patient set, and detailed placental analysis.
TiME-sFGR is a prospective, longitudinal, international observation study on women with monochorionic twin pregnancy (diamniotic/dichorionic) complicated by selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) defined by the absence of fetal thrive for at least two consecutive ultrasound scans prior to 28+0 weeks of gestational age (GA), irrespect of Doppler flows. Women are eligible if they meet the above mentioned inclusion criteria, have signed informed consent, and their partners have signed informed consent as well.
Mothers may have a 5-year follow-up when their children are 2-7 years old. 
Fetuses may have a 3-year follow-up when they are 1, 3, and 5 years old."

Background: Suicide rates have increased for transgender and gender-diverse (TGD) individuals across gender identity. Lack of access to appropriate mental health care contributes to high rates of suicide and self-harm (e.g., NSSI) among TGD youth. We propose that providing TGD adolescents and their caregivers with an interactive educational platform will improve access to information, improve levels of mental health literacy, and facilitate communication between health-seeking TGD youth and their caregivers, reducing mental health distress, NSSI, and suicidal ideation. Methodology: 500 TGD youth and 500 caregivers will be recruited into TransHealthGUIDE (THE GUIDE), an 18-month randomized control trial that assesses the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of THE GUIDE, a web-based and mobile platform. THE GUIDE is an evidence-informed digital platform that allows youth to access evidence-based content to improve knowledge, skills, and strategies to care for themselves, navigate families and the community, and communicate with health professionals. The intervention is currently in development and informed by a literature review and expert stakeholder focus groups. Data collection, data management, ethical considerations, and an a priori data monitoring plan will be employed to assess feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of THE GUIDE. At each data collection point (baseline and at every 3-month interval), 10% of the sample will be invited to participate in in-depth qualitative interviews to explore key reasons behind successful versus unsuccessful adaptation. This will provide insights for the development of a user guide and the optimization of the intervention for scale."

The researchers will assess changes in levels of alcohol and cannabis use during a 12-week treatment period. Participants in both the alcohol and cannabis groups will have the option of 12 weeks of group psychotherapy and have the option to receive evidence-based medications for addiction. Additionally, they will collect biological specimens (blood and saliva) from participants in this study to better understand the biological processes involved in the development of alcohol and cannabis use disorders. The research team will also conduct interviews and psychological assessments to better understand why individuals develop problems with alcohol and cannabis and how they influence each other. Finally, brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used to create 3D ""maps"" of the brain that might help identify the brain changes in patients with alcohol and cannabis use disorders."

Background: The term contextual effect has been used to reinforce the view that the placebo effect should be understood as an effect related to the therapeutic context, and not restricted to the use of inert treatments. Thus, the placebo effect is inherent to any therapeutic context and also can be used to enhance the effects of treatment with active components. There is evidence of the effectiveness of manipulative therapy in the treatment of chronic low back pain (CLBP), however, for most physical therapy interventions, its effect is small. Thus, strategies to enhance the effects of this therapy, such as through the use of context factors, may contribute to better therapeutic outcomes. The literature describes that positively induced expectations can trigger a placebo effect. There are previous studies that investigated the effect of different speech on SMT in patients with chronic neck pain, but there is no study in CLBP. In addition, no previous study investigated further the perceptions of patients regarding the content and perceptions of the videos. The objective of this study will be to identify the short-term impact of positive, neutral, or negative speech on pain intensity (primary outcome). The secondary outcomes assessed will be the global perceived effect of improvement, patient's expectations regarding spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) intervention, and perception of empathy in the therapeutic encounter in patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP) Methods: it will be a randomized controlled trial with a blinded assessor. It will be investigated the effect of the use of a hidden conditioning procedure and the induction of positive expectations on pain intensity after the administration of a manipulative therapy approach. This is an exploratory randomized clinical trial. The three groups will receive one session of SMT after watching the video proposed for their group. First participants will be assessed for pain intensity, low back pain disability, psychosocial aspects, and expectations related to treatment. Secondly, a researcher not involved in the recruitment of patients will randomly allocate the participants into three different groups (G1- group submitted to positive expectation speech, G2- group submitted to neutral expectation speech, and G3- group submitted to negative expectation speech). After the allocation, the participants will watch a short video (no more than 3 minutes) delivering positive, negative, or neutral messages regarding SMT. And finally, a physiotherapist will administer one session of SMT and participants will be re-assessed to investigate the immediate effect of the videos on the pain intensity, global perceived effect of improvement, and expectations. Ultimately, patients will be submitted to a semi-structured interview in which their perceptions about the videos will be investigated. It will help to understand if the content of the videos actually causes an impact on the expectations of the patients. The main hypothesis of this study is that the group submitted to the positive expectation speech will have a higher hypoalgesic effect, greater perception of improvement, and higher expectations regarding SMT than the other groups immediately post-treatment. Outcomes will be assessed just immediately after one SMT session."

Diabetes is a risk factor for atherosclerotic ischaemic and/or intracranial vascular disease. There is a higher degree of ischaemic stroke in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Diabetes has been shown to be associated with alterations in the vascular structure and function of the brain via changes in blood-brain barrier permeability, microvascular function and neuroinflammation. Therefore, it is important to identify treatments that may reduce blood-brain barrier permeability and improve micro-vascular function. There is evidence to suggest that improving microvascular function may be associated with a reduction in stroke incidence. The investigators propose to conduct a one-year, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled MRI study to investigate the biological basis of the observed stroke reduction with glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 Ra) with two separate groups of T2D patients receiving either GLP-1 Ra or placebo. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the mechanism through which the new treatment class (GLP-1 Ra) improves intracranial blood flow condition and blood-brain barrier permeability in patients with T2D. The secondary purpose is to examine whether the improved cerebral vascular conditions results in stroke reduction in patients with T2D, and thereby validate the results from our previous clinical trial, which showed that treatment with T2D lowering drugs is associated with significant reduction of ischaemic stroke incidence. The investigators hypothesize that treatment with GLP-1 Ra improves the cerebral micro-vascular function and reduces blood-brain barrier permeability. A reduction in cerebral micro-vascular dysfunction and improvement in cerebral blood flow condition can potentially result in a reduction in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), thereby reducing the risk of stroke. The investigators will perform imaging with contrast-enhanced MRI to evaluate the effects of the intervention on cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier permeability and will follow up the subjects for 12 months to evaluate the long-term effects of the intervention on the risk of stroke."

The research question of the study is to compare the outcome of a screw tent pole technique to the standard gold standard of bone augmentation using intraoral bone block. This study aims to assess the amount of bone gain of both techniques over a period of 6 months. The study design is a randomized controlled trial, with two parallel arms: tent pole technique versus autogenous bone block technique. The primary purpose of the study is to examine the bone gain between both techniques, while the secondary purpose is to evaluate the bone quality through core bone biopsy. This study evaluates the screw tent pole method and its ability to provide adequate bone gain, which will ultimately be used for implant placement. By following through with clinical and radiographic success of patients who use the two methods, this study will provide valuable information about whether the screw tent pole technique is a viable alternative to autogenous bone block technique in patients with atrophied anterior maxilla."

This study is a part of a global initiative to establish optimal algorithms for the evaluation if a CD4/CD8+ Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) is suitable for the monitoring of tuberculosis (TB) treatment in high burden countries. This project of the WHO is called the Evaluation of IGRA as a Component of TB Treatment Monitoring: Global Registry of Cohort and Cross-sectional TB Treatment Studies. This work will be conducted in a cohort of patients with confirmed pulmonary TB (PTB) and at least one negative sputum smear and/or M. tuberculosis culture.
The main specific objective of these studies is to assess if the CD4/CD8+ IGRA response to M. tuberculosis specific antigens improves over time and to what extent the change in IGRA response correlates with culture conversion in the cohort of drug-sensitive PTB patients. In a small number of patients culture conversion will be compared when the IGRA is performed against M. tuberculosis specific antigens in the CMT of the IGRA and against purified M. tuberculosis derived (PPD) antigens.
In a subsequent arm of the study, a limited number of TB patients with at least two negative sputum smear and/or M. tuberculosis culture and good response to treatment will be monitored with the IGRA and culture at different points during the course of treatment.
In this study both healthy and TB patients will complete a brief questionnaire and a blood test will be taken for further analysis. For the purpose of this study, blood will be collected up to four times during a 9 months time period. At a specific time-points all patients will complete a brief questionnaire and blood will be collected. This means that each patient will have the opportunity to contribute to the study over a period between 6 - 9 months.

In the aftermath of traumatic brain injury (TBI), the brain of the injured patient is susceptible to further damage from future hits. In some patients, this is attributed to an abnormal increase in fluid in the space surrounding the brain (subarachnoid space) with no obvious evidence of damage to blood vessels, known as traumatic meningeal injury (TMI) or meningeal enhancement (TME). This fluid causes a sloshing of the brain, which can damage the blood vessels in the brain and may contribute to prolonged recovery. The current study proposes to measure this fluid using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and a novel device called the MR Elastography (MRE), which measures the motion of the brain relative to the skull. The MRE images can be used to define the biomechanical coupling of the brain and skull (S-BI). Although this has not been previously described in patients with TMI, we predict that there will be a higher degree of motion and lower coupling of bone and brain in TMI patients. Understanding the S-BI could reveal new strategies for treatment and protection of the brain after TBI. In this study, our goal is to use MRE to compare the S-BI in three groups; 25 mild TBI patients with a history of TMI, 25 mild TBI patients without TMI, and 35 healthy volunteers. We anticipate that patients with a history of TMI will have lower S-BI when compared with patients without TMI and healthy controls. Although a small study with only 80 participants, the study requires a 2-year study period to enroll and perform the imaging analyses. However this will allow the study team to explore a new aspect of neuroimaging to develop protective measures that will lead to improved outcomes after TBI."

Inadequate soft tissue thickness has a detrimental effect on implant treatment in terms of the loss of implants and the development of inflammation, pain and discomfort, and decreases aesthetic satisfaction of patients. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the aesthetic and clinical effects of the transplanted graft and xenogeneic collagen matrix as a graft of connective tissue on the soft tissue thickness of the alveolar ridge around prosthetic implants. 60 subjects with an implantable defect in the lower jaw were included into prospective randomized controlled study within the Clinical Center for Specialist Medical and Surgical Providers of the East Ural Scientific Center of Russian Academy of Sciences in Oral Surgery and Implantology Department. Subjects were randomly assigned into 2 groups each with n=30. The first group underwent soft tissue augmentation and implant placement using the free connective tissue graft obtained from the maxilla tuberosity area. The second group underwent soft tissue augmentation and implant placement using the xenogeneic collagen matrix Fibro-Gide. Clinical evaluations included the measurement of vestibular soft tissue thickness, the evaluation of pain severity using a visual analogue pain scale, the evaluation of the volume of edema in the early period postoperatively, the assessment of anesthesia quality, the evaluation of complications, and the evaluation of implant survival at 90 and 180 days postoperatively. 31 subjects completed the study protocol in the study group and 31 in the control group. Results of the study indicate that the transplanted graft and xenogeneic collagen matrix provided significant soft tissue thickness gain with a mean value of 1.32 mm and 0.6 mm, respectively. Further, it was established that both methods improved pain reduction, quality of life and implant survival. The authors concluded that both methods are effective for increasing soft tissue thickness around dental implants."

Depression is a leading cause of the global disease burden. The World Health Organization's (WHO) mhGAP interventions advocates the use of brief psychological therapies, such as behavioral activation (BA) or antidepressant medications (ADM) as first-line options for the treatment of moderate to severe depression in primary care settings. But they might not work for all patients. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not. This study aims to generate a precision treatment rule (PTR) based on patients' characteristics and to evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a PTR on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either HAP (based on BA, a brief psychological therapy) or ADM (fluoxetine). The investigators will assess whether patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will have a higher chance of remitting and recovering compared to patients who are not. The investigators will also determine the cost-effectiveness of this approach compared to the existing standard of care that does not take treatment-specific responses into account. The project will be carried out by a team of multidisciplinary investigators from Harvard Medical School and Harvard School of Public Health who will collaborate with colleagues from Harvard University, the University of California, Davis Health System, and the WHO Secretariat for Mental Health and Substance Use. Primary and secondary analysis will be carried using an intention-to-treat approach, with no interim analysis."

Background
Pulmonary hyperinflation with neutrophil and macrophage invasion and T cell depletion are common features of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), but it remains to be elucidated whether the T cells in the lungs of patients with ARDS are hyperactivated and/or exhausted, and to which extent this contributes to neutrophil invasion and thus lung tissue destruction. Furthermore, the pulmonary microbiome has shown a reduction in diversity and interactions in ARDS, which may be important for normal T cell function. At present, immune cell-microbiome interactions and their relation to disease severity and progression have not yet been studied in ARDS.

                Our overarching hypothesis is that the composition of the pulmonary microbiome and the immune cell composition and function is altered in ARDS compared to non-COVID-19 ARDS, and these alterations is an essential pathogenic mechanism in the development of pulmonary dysfunction, and that these derangements can be predictive of the severity of lung dysfunction and mortality in the critically ill COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 ARDS patient population.
                We have previously shown that the pulmonary T cell dysfunction can be improved by repletion of T regulatory cells (Tregs), which may be a novel therapeutic approach in patients with ARDS. Furthermore, the pulmonary microbiome and its interaction with the immune cells have recently been implicated in several respiratory and systemic disorders. Thus, the overall aim of the present study (ILLUMINA-1) is to investigate the impact of the pulmonary inflammatory and microbiome composition on immune cell dysfunction and disease severity.

In 20 mechanically ventilated patients with none-to-mild and 20 with moderate-to-severe non-COVID-19 ARDS according to the Berlin definition an endotracheal aspirate (ETA) and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from separate lung segments will be obtained. Furthermore, an oral and nasal swab and blood samples will be collected. This will be done within 72 hours after intubation, and again after 7-10 days if the patient is still intubated. Patient's electronic health record The following is obtained after inclusion: diagnosis codes and medication (type and dosage, including vasopressors and sedatives), and smoking history (current/previous/never smoker; pack years); admission time; blood pressure, heart rhythm and heart rate, temperature, ventilator settings, supportive care (dialysis, ECMO), blood tests results at admission and on the study days (blood cell counts, coagulation parameters, renal, liver, and electrolyte panel; arterial and mixed venous blood gases); clinical scores at admission and on the study days (SAPS3, APACHE II, SOFA), death within 30 days Blood sampling Arterial blood samples are drawn from the patient's invasive arterial catheter (inserted at ICU admission for clinical purposes: for continuous invasive blood pressure monitoring and repeated arterial blood gas collection) immediately before BALF collection. Bronchoscopy with BALF collection This procedure is performed in a standardized fashion according to current clinical guidelines. Immediately prior to the procedure, an oral swab, nasal swab and an endotracheal aspirate (ETA) are obtained. FIO2 is then increased to 1.0, and the bronchoscopy procedure is performed using a disposable videoscope with an outer diameter of 5.0 mm). Three successive 50-ml aliquots of prewarmed (37°C) isotonic saline are instilled in the medial segment of the right middle lobe, aspirated immediately with low negative suction pressure (< 100 cm H2O), and pooled into a sterile glass container on ice to obtain a BALF specimen. Afterwards a mini-BAL is performed in the upper and lower lobe of the right lung with a single installation of 20 ml isotonic saline in each lobe with immediately aspiration into a sterile container. Measurements The composition of the immune cell population, as well as the function and differentiation of various cell lines will be investigated by single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) on selected immune cells from BALF, ETA, and blood, and this will be supplemented by bulk RNA sequencing with sample barcoding and multiplexing, giving"

Lateral abdominal wall defect is very common, and 20% of abdominal wall incisional hernias develop a recurrence of the hernia following repair. However, according to various reports , the rate ranges from 5% to 30%. In a study on incisional hernias in Chinese patients, the recurrence rate was as high as 22%. Patients with incisional hernias have more complications compared with patients without incisional hernias, the quality of life is reduced to the same degree as malignant tumors. Studies have shown that recurrent incisional hernia may be related to changes in pulmonary function before surgery. As chronic inflammation is associated with recurrent hernia and pulmonary dysfunction.
Recurrent incisional hernia requires additional surgical treatment, and after surgery, the patient's pulmonary function is further damaged. Recurrent incisional hernia can occur within 7 days after surgery to a few years. To reduce the rate of recurrence, the investigators believe that improving preoperative pulmonary function is one of the strategies to reduce the recurrence rate of incisional hernia. As patients with recurrent incisional hernia generally have chronic inflammation with pulmonary dysfunction.
However, the investigators focus on whether there is a difference in pulmonary function between patients with primary and recurrent incisional hernia, and hope this difference can find a target for intervention, improve the incisional hernia surgery to reduce the recurrence rate. In this cross-sectional study, the investigators collected the clinical data of primary incisional hernia and recurrent incisional hernia patients who underwent incisional hernia repair during the same period in our hospital, including clinical data, preoperative pulmonary function data, postoperative pulmonary function data, and follow-up data on recurrence; The investigators hope that this study will provide evidence for improving the quality of life of patients, reducing the burden of recurrence, reducing the cost of reoperation, and providing new ideas for the clinical treatment of incisional hernia."

This is a non-interventional study in a single center to evaluate patients presenting with an intermediate and high risk of coronary disease following a calcium score and a PET scan.
The inclusion criteria are: age strictly above 45 and strictly below 80 years old; having provided informed consent; presenting with no coronary history consulting for suspicious chest pain; patient discharged with a diagnosis of unstable angina, stable angina, effort ischemia or coronary stent placement. The exclusion criteria include: patient undergoing pregnancy, breastfeeding or of child bearing age unwilling to use a reliable method of contraception; patients with cognitive disorders; patients with claustrophobia or unwilling to undergo investigations; patient wishing to initiate therapy for coronary primary prevention.
There will be three groups following calcium score determination: group I with no atheromatous plaque; group II (intermediate risk) with calcium score above 0 classifying the patient below the 40th percentile of a similar population; and group III and IV with calcium score classifying the patient equal or above the 40th percentile and less than the 65th percentile and more than 65th percentile, respectively. The calcium score is a simple non-invasive scanner which measures coronary calcifications and estimates the patient's percentile classifying the patient in high and low risk. In addition, 18F-Na PET will be required to identify the plaque(s) prone to change in patients of group III and IV presenting an intermediate and/or high risk profile. 
The investigators will evaluate the number of patients having received the follow-on tests for these intermediate risk patients, number of signs of progression of coronary involvement, and number of persistent symptoms that increase and lead to the implementation of a secondary prevention type treatment. The investigators will also compare the study cohort with an historical local cohort with respect to the number of new tests and/or signs of persistent coronary symptomatology increasing and leading to the implementation of a secondary prevention type treatment. Additionally, the rate of occurrence of these events will be compared.

This research proposal focuses on exploring the relationship between the shape of white matter hyperintensities and neurodegenerative pathology. The investigators will determine if the amount of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) shape in the brain, as assessed by MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging), can provide additional valuable information about the severity of dementia and can predict future risk of cognitive decline. Dementia with cerebral small vessel disease often involves white matter changes on MRI. It is known from autopsy studies that white matter changes are closely related to small vessel lesions in the deep white matter. In the brain, there are many blood vessels that are especially vulnerable to the aging process. These small blood vessels are found in the deep white matter of the brain. If these blood vessels show abnormalities, this is then called cerebral small vessel disease. When this happens, these small vessels lose volume and become wider, resulting in more fluid in the brain (e.g. leaking or leaks), damage to the neighboring white matter and nerve cells. This process is also known as leukoencephalopathy or cerebral small vessel disease. This disease can also lead to dementia with cognitive decline, which can progress very rapidly. The investigators think that a more complex shape of the white matter could possibly be an important feature of the disease. This shape could be visualized with MRI by the investigators and this information can be linked to the degree and speed of cognitive decline over time. The investigators can also analyze the white matter shape for other important features of the disease. In this way, the researchers want to achieve more insight into the cause of the disease by combining clinical data, MRI data and genetic data. The researchers also want to investigate whether certain proteins, for example beta-amyloid and tau, play a different role in different types of white matter hyperintensities that shape will reveal. In order to achieve this, the researchers will perform blood tests for the detection of beta-amyloid and tau, study the genes of the participants and evaluate several biomarkers on MRI. White matter hyperintensities have previously been shown to change independently of general cognitive status. By focusing on both, they hope to be able to identify whether complex or irregular shapes of white matter hyperintensities can better predict the development of cognitive decline."

Esophageal gastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJA) is a common tumor of the esophagogastric junction (EGJ). With the development of endoscopic technology, endoscopists can obtain a lot of information for the diagnosis of EGJA through endoscopic examination, which is of great significance to the treatment effect of patients. However, the incidence of EGJA diagnosis is still not high, and accurate examination is relatively low. Accurate diagnosis has a great influence on the prognosis of patients. In recent years, the development of artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence) technology has gradually attracted attention and is expected to improve the diagnostic accuracy of EGJA. Due to the small amount of clinical data, the performance of endoscopic images is not ideal for training the artificial intelligence (AI) model. 
Therefore, an artificial intelligence detection system based on deep learning technology was established using the large data of the gastric section of the EGJ anatomical site in the database. Through the training of the model, the accuracy of the model in the detection of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma is higher than that of endoscopists, which has a high application value for clinical endoscopic diagnosis.
In this study, we will conduct a prospective, randomized study on patients with EGJA admitted to the Department of Gastroenterology of the Second Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University from October 1, 2018 to December 1, 2019. In the case group, EGJA patients underwent endoscopic examination, and endoscopic images were sent to the deep learning diagnostic system for detection. At the same time, the diagnostic results of endoscopists were compared with the diagnostic results of the deep learning diagnostic system, and the sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value and accuracy were evaluated. The investigators also recorded the pathological type, tumor size, invasion depth, differentiation degree, and treatment methods. In the control group, patients without EGJA underwent endoscopic examination or biopsy, and endoscopic images were sent to the deep learning diagnostic system. The investigators also recorded the age, gender, lesion size, location, and diagnosis of the lesion. From the results of this study, the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness and reliability of the deep learning diagnostic system in the detection of EGJA."

Tolerance and acceptability play a crucial role in the utilization of music therapy in palliative care populations. The study investigates differences in acceptance of music therapy live versus versus a recording. The aim of music therapy in palliative care is to facilitate the alleviation of emotional distress. 
The investigators intend to recruit twenty palliative care patients at the University Hospital Zurich. All patients will receive two identical music-therapy sessions, each lasting for 40 minutes, at a weekly interval. The research protocol is separated into two consecutive study arms. During the first study arm, the intervention session will proceed in two consecutive parts: music played by a music therapist live, followed by a musical recording of the same selection played to the patient. In the second study arm, the intervention session will also proceed in two consecutive parts, but in reverse order. Patients will start with a music selection played to them from a recording, followed by music played live. The study arms are randomized in order to ensure that the order of occurrence of the two modes of listening to music is different from patient to patient.

Background: Cataract surgery, especially phacoemulsification, produces greenhouse gas emissions and waste. Alcon Infiniti and Alcon Centurion are among the phaco machines having the smallest carbon footprint of 5.9kg and 10.9kg of carbon emissions for every cataract surgery, respectively. The Aravind Eye Care System (AECS), a charitable and private sector organization with operations in India, has performed 12 million cataract operations at an affordable cost without compromising surgical quality. According to the most recent reports from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the National Health Service in England, and the CDC in the United States, topical Moxifloxacin is used as intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis. Despite being frequently used, the optimal regimen for intracameral antibiotic prophylaxis remains inconsistent. The Aravind Eye Care System in Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India performed 1.8 million consecutive nonpenetrating cataract operations with no report of toxic anterior segment syndrome or endophthalmitis.
In AECS, endophthalmitis was 0.02% despite the observation that cannulas, irrigation/ aspiration tubing, gowns, surgical gloves, irrigating bottles, as well as topical and intraocular drugs, are normally recycled to cut cost and waste. On the other hand, health care plays a key role in climate change, as well as financial and environmental waste. Furthermore, the recycling of gowns, gloves, and surgical dressings should be addressed, as well as the optimal use of anesthesia, antibiotics, surgical instruments, and other supplies, such as cassettes, cannulas, and tips of the phacoemulsification machines.
Objective: This study sought to examine if reusing gowns, gloves, and other supplies, such as cassettes, cannulas, and tips of the phacoemulsification machines, will increase infection after cataract surgery and increase the financial cost of the operation.
Methods: This prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in a single eye center in Egypt in 2016. A total of 89 patients undergoing phacoemulsification cataract surgery from January 2016 to August 2016 were randomly divided into two groups, each with 44 cases. Group one had no change in gowns and gloves between cases and included 44 cases (22 males, mean age of 62.6± 10.64 years). The other group had a change in gloves only between cases, and the same gown was used for all cases (22 males, mean age of 62.34 ± 10.2 years). Both groups followed the same protocol of injection of intracameral antibiotic (ofloxacine 50ug) diluted with normal saline, 0.1 cc. All the patients had routine laboratory tests as well as full preoperative examination. Preoperatively, all patients underwent routine systemic examinations, such as blood pressure and blood glucose level measurements, ECG, and hepatitis markers. No preoperative topical antibiotics prophylaxis was described for all patients. Retrobulbar and peribulbar anesthesia were used for all patients. While performing the anesthesia, a drop of topical anesthesia, a drop of povidone-iodine 5%, and a drop of Moxifloxacin (Vigamox) were installed in the conjunctival cul-de-sac immediately prior to the surgery. Topical povidone-iodine was utilized immediately prior to the surgery in order to prepare the periorbital area (10%). After opening the face drape, a drop of povidone-iodine 5% was also installed in the conjunctival sac and washed thoroughly before starting the operation. Topical Gatifloxacin (Tymer) and Prednisolone (Optipred) drops were instilled four times daily in the first 10 days following the surgery. Additionally, a topical combination solution of Ofloxacin, dexamethasone (Dexaflox), and a lubricant (Systane) was used three times daily for the next four weeks. Hand sterilization of the surgeon and the assistant was done once before starting the first case with povidone-iodine and alcohol. In one arm of the study group, the surgeon changed the gown and the glove between each case"

This study will evaluate the performance of tissue-based diagnostic assays for patients with advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer who are receiving targeted therapies or immunotherapies. Patients will undergo a biopsy from a lesion and provide 40 millilitres (mL) of blood before commencing their new line of therapy. Blood samples and tissue samples will be used for further processing (DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, immunofluorescence characterisation and cell culture experiments) to discover novel predictive biomarkers that can guide treatment decision making. Blood and tumour cell samples will be cultured in a biomimetic hydrogel within Pear Bio's organ-on-a-chip system and exposed to approved therapies or immunotherapies. Images will be recorded and analysed using Pear Bio's artificial intelligence system to establish predictive accuracy. By conducting the necessary research, we aim to establish a functional dose for each commonly used FDA approved therapy, improve overall survival prediction accuracy, establish the positive predictive value of Pear image-based biomarkers, and discover the right drug combinations for optimal treatment efficacy.

The American Heart Association recommends that children consume no more than 4% of calories from added sugars and less than 10% of calories from added sugars for long-term health. However, little information is available on the effect of reducing intake of added sugars to < 10% of energy on physiological risk in adolescents who are overweight or obese, who are at high risk for developing diabetes. The World Health Organization recommends avoiding the use of low calorie sweeteners in foods, instead they advise eating whole foods and vegetables, and limiting sweetened beverages and foods. In the U.S. in the year 2011, intake of water decreased, and consumption of added sugars in beverages and sugary foods have increased since 1988. Sarc and colleagues found that in adolescents, there is a strong correlation between the high carbohydrate intake that is a major contributor to risk of the adult T2D. Based on the premise that substituting a non-sweetened beverage for sugar sweetened beverages (SSB) will reduce high carbohydrate and energy intake, the current study proposes to demonstrate whether substituting sparkling water for SSB has benefits for in vivo physiological measures of glucose metabolism while maintaining flavor acceptability to adolescents who are at risk for diabetes. The investigators will substitute sparkling water for flavored and sugar-sweetened beverage consumption among overweight/obese adolescents living with diabetes or a family history of diabetes and find whether there is a change in sweet taste perception. Sweetness perception is the perception of sweetness in response to a stimulus in the oral cavity, and previous studies in adults show that taste perception changes when energy consumption declines. T2D in youth occurs with increasing frequency, and the rates of youth-onset diabetes are disproportionately high in overweight and obese adolescents who consume high amounts of added sugars. Replacing SSB with sparkling water could have the added benefit of reducing added sugar intake without increasing caloric intake via artificial sweeteners, and this could be an important strategy to reduce diabetes and cardiovascular risk in adolescents, as well as in adults who have lost their sweet tooth.
The proposed study is a before and after cohort study that is prospective. All enrolled participants will reduce their SSB consumption by > 50% by substituting unsweetened sparkling flavored water. Study participants will complete three visits to the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at St. Jude. During the third visit, participants will be screened with a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and continuous glucose monitoring system, and will have measurements of blood pressure, glucose control (Hemoglobin A1c), body composition (dual energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and cardiac function (Electrocardiogram). In addition, at each visit, the participants will rate the sweetness of beverages using a visual analog scale. Finally, all participants will be asked to bring a list of the sparkling water brands and flavors they have tried to date, and any new beverage tastes they have tried during the last month."

Background: When evaluating the early wound healing after the utilization of NOVOSYN® Quick monofilament suture material (Sinogut/NoviGut, Johnson & Johnson, USA) in resective periodontal surgery (RPS) in the presence of monofilament suture material, Monosyn® Quick (Braun, Germany), clinical signs of re-epithelization (CSR), haemostasis (CSH) and inflammation (CSI) in patients with moderate to advanced generalized chronic periodontitis and/or localized aggressive periodontitis (LAP) undergoing resective periodontal surgery was assessed. The aim of this study was to verify if the utilization of NOVOSYN® Quick could result in faster wound healing compared to the already well-known monofilament suture material, Monosyn® Quick.
Methods: a monocentric, randomized, double-blinded clinical trial (RCT) was performed in patients undergoing RPS. 40 participants were enrolled in the study, and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either NOVOSYN® Quick (control group) or Monosyn® Quick (treatment group). The primary end point to evaluate the primary objective of the study was the determination of the early wound healing score (EHS) according to CSR, CSH and CSI. Data were collected before surgery and 10 ± 5 days post-operatively, and consisted of clinical signs of wound healing and of the assessment of the handling of the suture material. Additionally, bacterial contamination of the thread and the number of systemic complications were both determined 10 ± 5 days post-operatively.
Participants and results : 40 patients underwent RPS (Novosyn: 21 and Monosyn: 19). For Novosyn and Monosyn, the mean age was 43.5 ± 10.0 years and 43.7 ± 12.5 years, respectively. The mean age range for the participants was 30 (lower quartile) to 60 years (upper quartile). The mean EHS for the NOVOSYN® and Monosyn® group were 8.10 and 8.64, respectively. The 95% Confidence Interval (CI) for the mean EHS for the Novosyn® group was 6.92 - 9.28 and for the Monosyn® group 8.07 - 9.20, showing no relevant differences between Novosyn and Monosyn. Additionally, no relevant difference concerning the assessment of systemic complications could be found between the two groups.
No relevant differences were found in terms of the pain assessment and satisfaction of the patient between the two groups.
For the handling of the suture material, only a few differences between the two groups could be observed with regards to 'first throw knot holding', 'knot security', 'knot tie-down smoothness', the overall handling of the suture material and the knots. Intra-operatively, 85.7% of the participants noted that with regards to ease of passage through the tissue, 90.5% of the participants considered the Monosyn® thread to be excellent and 69.2% the Novosyn® thread. 47.6% of the participants found Novosyn® as being more difficult to handle than Monosyn®, and 17 participants considered both suture materials to be equally difficult to handle. A fray to be observed at the ends of the thread, more frequently in the Monosyn® suture.
Conclusion: Within the context of this pilot RCT, no significant differences in terms of wound healing score have been noticed between use of NOVOSYN® Quick and Monosyn® Quick, after resective periodontal surgery. A significantly lower satisfaction of the participant regarding the handling of Monosyn® suture material can be observed as well as a slightly lower degree of fraying observed at the ends of the Monosyn® suture. The results of bacterial colonization of the suture material, the number of systemic complications and assessment of clinical wound healing parameters were also in accordance with the study hypotheses regarding the absence of differences between the two groups."

Sudden deafness is a common otolaryngology disease that seriously affects the hearing rehabilitation effect and social economic development of patients. According to previous studies (Zinevich et al. 2014; Yang Yuan et all. 2016), the pathogenesis of sudden deafness is not clear, and it is closely related to various factors such as blood flow in the inner ear, blood supply to the cochlea, and metabolism and apoptosis of the cochlea.
NAD+ is an important coenzyme to maintain intracellular metabolic balance and mitochondrial aerobic metabolism. Studies have found that it is a crucial neuroprotective factor involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ATP generation (Cassidi BJ, Waller GD, Chappell BA. 2006; Mills JY, Rufino E, Liptak G. 2001; Mills JY. 2016; Mills JY, Waller GD, Rufino E. 2014). Due to the special anatomical structure and unique microcirculation mechanism of the inner ear, the lack of efficient vasoactive substances in the inner ear makes the inner ear prone to local ischemia, hypoxia damage, and the decline of oxidative phosphorylation, but there are many studies that found that NAD+ is also involved in local blood supply and oxidative phosphorylation of the inner ear .
When the NAD+ in the inner ear was depleted, the blood supply of the cochlea was decreased (Hsu KL, Chen CC, Chung HC, Chiu WY. 2014). Some researchers believed that this is due to the lack of vasoactive substance and metabolic substance (Yang Yuan et al. 2016; Yin Zhiqiang et al. 2014; Wang Xiaoqin et al. 2016). Therefore, the lack of NAD+ may be one of the mechanisms of sudden deafness.

Sodium NAD+ solution is a new noninvasive drug. According to recent studies, intravenous injection of NAD+ solution can relieve the symptoms of sudden sensorineural hearing loss, increase the blood flow volume of the cochlea, and enhance the phasic and tonic response of the inner ear, which can improve the hearing loss caused by sudden sensorineural hearing loss (Yin Zhiqiang et al. 2015; Yang Yuan et al. 2016). At present, there is no consistent drug intervention protocol in the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. The current common drug intervention protocol is mainly general treatments, such as: corticosteroids, antiviral drugs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and so on (Tanaka Y, Otsuki T, Nakauchi T. 2005; Kimura S, Chiba T, Uchida T, Shimizu K. 2005; Chang YJ, Lu CC, Shieh ST. 2005; Liu H, Wang D, Xie J, Liu G. 2006; Shu J, Zhang KR, Hou J, Guo ZF. 2013; Zheng CH, Li SH. 2017).

However, there is still a lack of relevant data on the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, this study wants to test the feasibility and effectiveness of NAD+ (0.5mg/ml, 1mL, im) in the treatment of sudden sensorineural hearing loss through a small and randomized sample size clinical trial. The study expects:
1) The treatment group has a better hearing recovery effect than the control group 3 months after treatment, the hearing improvement rate is greater than 5db, and 1 month after treatment, the tinnitus disappearance rate will be significantly higher than that of the control group.
2) The treatment group has a better disappearance of tinnitus than the control group.
3) The treatment group has a higher improvement rate of hearing and tinnitus than the control group 1 month and 3 months after treatment.
4) The treatment group has a higher recovery rate of ear fullness compared with the control group.
5) The application of NAD+ is feasible and has a good safety profile.

Newborn screening (NBS) can detect over 40 diseases that are severe or with the potential to be severe. In addition, there are approximately 40 disorders that, although there is no specific therapy currently available, NBS could prove to have a high positive predictive value. An improved selection of treatable genetic diseases is based on new findings and technological progress. These include the eligibility, i.e., the fact that patients affected by these diseases can be treated at an early stage. Based on an updated NBS guideline, the criteria for eligible diseases will be supplemented and existing criteria will be reviewed and updated. The aim of this new German guideline is to increase the reliability and accuracy of the selected diseases and thus improve the benefit-risk ratio, and subsequently to improve the scientific basis and, if possible, to extend or establish NBS for additional diseases in Germany.

A first pilot project was carried out for NBS on cystinosis. This proved to be feasible. In the population screening, the prevalence of 1:100,000 could be confirmed, and it could be shown that the disease can be diagnosed within a week of birth and immediately treated. It is very important for the affected newborns that they are diagnosed and cysteamine treatment initiated shortly after birth, in order to achieve the best possible disease course. This must be compared with the diagnosis and initiation of therapy when the disease becomes clinically visible, which usually occurs in the 2nd or 3rd year of life. By the end of the last reporting years (2017), there were 22 NBS centers in which genetic NBS was performed, which is sufficient to continue NBS for cystinosis in a routine manner.

In addition, molecular-based NBS is increasingly feasible. DNA can be extracted from a dried blood spot and can be analyzed by NGS (NEXT-Generation Sequencing). The high accuracy of the genetic screening has already been demonstrated in two pilot projects in German NBS laboratories. Both studies also showed the high acceptance of the parents for genetic NBS. In addition to the genetic screening for cystinosis (Molecular based NBS II.1), molecular-based NBS for PH can be established based on the scientific basis of the first pilot project.

Therefore, this further pilot project is intended to lay the scientific basis for introducing a genetic NBS for PH. A further focus is to compare the outcome of the affected children after screening with those diagnosed after manifestation. Based on the results obtained, we intend to continue with the introduction of molecular-based NBS for cystinosis and PH, as well as to establish a further genetic NBS in this pilot project. These diseases, as well as other NBS-suitable diseases, will be included in the German NBS system."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential of using modern diagnostic techniques to distinguish between different subtypes of breast cancer, known as intrinsic molecular subtypes, and to determine which breast cancer patients benefit most from new targeted therapies. This study takes data from routine clinical practice and applies this in a new, scientific way to explore patterns and relationships in subtypes of breast cancer that may lead to new treatments and better outcome for patients.
Participants in the study will be divided into different subgroups for their specific type of breast cancer, and they will be given either a standard treatment or targeted therapy based on the subtype. Some of the participants will be given standard chemotherapy plus hormone treatment, and some of the participants will be given targeted therapy, a newer treatment that works in different ways, including attacking the tumor through the immune system.
Participants will be asked for a small amount of blood and excess tumor tissue from their operation. The information collected from blood and tissue samples and the outcome of their cancer treatment will be used to build up new knowledge about the best treatments for each subtype of breast cancer.
It is hoped that this study will improve the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by providing more information about each subtype and helping to match new treatments to women whose cancers have specific genetic features.
Participation in the study will begin at participating hospitals. Participants are contacted by their doctor or at one of the hospitals participating in the study. After the initial consultation meeting, each participant joins a subgroup for their specific breast cancer subtype. This group is determined by the pattern of genetic variations in their cancer cells. This step is called molecular profiling.
Next, if the initial consultation does not uncover specific reasons to change treatment after molecular profiling and discussion, the participant will be randomized to different study arms based on the subtype of their breast cancer.
Depending on which breast cancer subtype the study arm is for, the woman and her doctor will choose a treatment from the group of treatments available for that subgroup. Some of the treatments are standard chemotherapy plus hormone treatment, and others are targeted therapy. The targeted therapy will be given by a vein (through an IV) and is not for people with lung or breathing disorders.
Participants then join the group of specific study arms according to their breast cancer subtype, and they can start the treatment of their choice for their specific breast cancer subtype, including the standard chemotherapy plus hormone treatment or targeted therapy.
When the treatment has finished, the participant again visits one of the hospitals. The patient's clinical notes are reviewed, and she completes another consultation with the doctor. After the end-of-treatment visit, the patient will be followed up periodically by telephone over a five-year period. The purpose is to discuss recurrence of the cancer and new treatments.
The results of the study are expected to improve the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer by providing new information about the different types of breast cancer and the most appropriate treatments for each subtype. The study will investigate many aspects of a tumor's behavior, including how a tumor is likely to respond to therapy. In future, these findings could lead to further improvements in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer."

The purpose of this prospective double-blinded random controlled study is to compare the effects of the propofol and sevoflurane on the prognosis of primary brain, liver, lung, or ovarian cancer patients undergoing elective thoracoabdominal surgery to detect the differences in survival between the groups and to determine the mechanisms by which they have different effects. A total of 100 patients undergoing elective thoracoabdominal surgery for the treatment of cancers diagnosed as primary brain cancer, primary brain, primary liver, primary lung, or primary ovarian cancer will be performed. Eligible patients with primary brain, liver, lung, or ovarian cancer treated within 1 month of surgical treatment will be randomized to undergo either total intravenous anesthesia with propofol or the same dose of sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia intraoperatively. The main endpoint of the study is overall survival, and the secondary endpoint is the presence of disease progression detected by various examinations such as brain CT or abdominal CT, MRI, and chest X-ray, as well as serum tumor markers (CEA, CA-125, CA 19-9) within 30 days after surgery. Furthermore, postoperative complication, hospital days, and 6-month, 1-year, and 3-year Karnofsky performance status (KPS) will be evaluated."

One of the significant issues that hinder the application of VATS and RATS to most early-stage NSCLC patients is the difficulty of recognizing lung nodules located deep in the lung parenchyma and, consequently, not visible on the surface of normal, uninvolved tissue. Several approaches have been developed to enhance the localization of indeterminate lung nodules and decrease the time to diagnosis and rate of conversion to open surgery. Nevertheless, none of these is 100% sensitive or without complications, also of severe grade. Numerous pre-operative methods are being employed, including percutaneous CT-guided placement techniques, encompassing the use of microcoils, hook-wires, and spiral-wires. These devices can support nodule localization during minimally invasive lung procedures; nevertheless, they could be easily displaced during patient transport and positioning, intraoperative atelectasis, single lung ventilation, and surgeon manipulation."

The additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment after pancreatoduodenectomy is undetermined as evidence reported conflicting results regarding infectious complications. Prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis might reduce the rate of surgical site infections in patients with a high risk for contaminated bile (predominantly patients with preoperative biliary drainage). In a multicenter randomized controlled trial, we will compare a strategy with perioperative antibiotic treatment versus a strategy with perioperative antibiotic treatment followed by five postoperative days of antibiotic treatment. Patients at risk for contaminated bile undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy are eligible for this trial. The rate of clinically relevant organ/space surgical site infection between patients with perioperative versus prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis is the primary outcome. This trial will clarify whether prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis after pancreatoduodenectomy is beneficial to patients at risk for contaminated bile."

This is a Phase 2 interventional basket trial targeting patients with advanced solid tumors who have the KRAS G12C mUtation and who have a clear indication for a first-line treatment with anti-cancer therapy according to the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the Korean Society of Medical Oncology (IASLC and KSMO). The participants will voluntarily enroll in the KRAUS trial after receiving the diagnosis of advanced malignancy with the KRAS G12C mUtation in a medical institution participating in this clinical trial.
In recent years, the KRAS G12C mMutation has been identified to be closely related to the development of cancer and has been reported as a major independent cause of poor prognosis. In patients with lung cancer and colorectal cancer, drugs targeting the KRAS G12C mMutation are being actively developed and have been reported to be effective in inhibiting tumor growth.
As sotorasib is a novel drug of this class that has a different mechanism from existing EGFR inhibitors and TKIs, it will be possible to predict a therapeutic effect at an early stage of tumor progression. The current study investigates the safety, efficacy, and potential biomarkers, including the mutation status of the KRAS gene in solid tumors that show efficacy after treatment with sotorasib.
In this study, we plan to determine the safety and efficacy using sotorasib as an anti-neoplastic drug for patients with advanced solid tumors who carry the KRAS G12C mUTation."

Purpose of the study The investigators conducted nutritional risk screening for patients with gastrointestinal tumors, gave different nutritional support methods to patients with different nutritional status, and analyzed the changes of various nutritional indexes of patients before and after nutritional intervention.
Methods: Totally 302 consecutive patients with gastrointestinal tumors admitted to First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University from July 2021 to June 2023 were divided into an intervention group (NRS2002≥3 and PG=SGA≥4, n=204) and a control group (NRS2002 < 3 or PG=SGA < 4 ), n=98) by random assignment. The patients in the intervention group received different nutritional support methods, and the patients in the control group received traditional nutrition support. Nutritional risk screening, dietary supply, anthropometric measurements, grip strength, walking distance, and other indicators were studied. After propensity score matching, different nutritional support methods were given to analyze the changes of nutritional risk screening, grip strength and walking time, dietary energy, dietary protein, nutritional energy, nutritional protein, and other nutritional indexes before and after administration between the two groups and their effects.
Outcomes: This will provide a scientific explanation for individualized nutritional support for patients with gastrointestinal tumors, improve the ability of patients to tolerate resection surgery and postoperative recovery quality, reduce postoperative complications, and minimize the financial burden of patients and their families. The results of the study are of great significance to improve the efficiency of clinical treatment and the overall situation of patients with gastrointestinal tumors."

Non-invasive blood flow monitoring of arteries is typically done with transcranial Doppler (TCD), a device that needs to be inserted into the temporal bone. Due to the insertion, it may be difficult for the patient to participate for an extended period of time. Recently, a new method of monitoring blood flow in the brain has been developed using a conventional method of ultrasound. It requires a small patch worn behind the ear and is called a wearable ultrasound patch. The purpose of this study is to compare the blood flow measurements from this method with a conventional transcranial Doppler device in a group of individuals with a broad range of physiological parameters. If the agreement between the devices is good, this new method may open up a new era of monitoring brain blood flow in people who are unable to participate in TCD studies for extended periods."

Study Overview
=================
The incidence of liver cancer is increasing worldwide. HCC is highly associated with chronic liver disease caused by hepatitis virus infection, metabolic disease and alcohol abuse. Liver transplantation (LT) is the best curative treatment for HCC, but the 5-year cumulated rate of developing new tumors after LT was 24.8%, and the 5-year cumulative rate of overall mortality was 19.0%. In addition, the 5-year recurrence rate of HCC at high risk of recurrence after LT was significantly high, reaching about 50%. Multiple previous retrospective studies have suggested that postoperative adjuvant treatment with regorafenib, sorafenib, lenvatinib or bevacizumab may significantly improve RFS in patients with HCC at high risk of recurrence after LT, which provides some valuable evidences for the survival of patients after LT. However, there are no prospective clinical studies that confirm the efficacy of postoperative adjuvant treatment. As the best curative treatment for HCC, LT has become a research hotspot, but the recurrence rate of HCC after LT is still too high. This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multi-kinase inhibitors in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of HCC at high risk of recurrence after LT, to provide a high-quality randomized controlled trial for the development of postoperative adjuvant treatment, and to provide reliable evidence for the improved management of postoperative adjuvant treatment.

Inclusion criteria:
1. Age and sex: Age ≥ 18 years, no gender limit.
2. Pathology and criteria for LT: Conform to Milan criteria and meet at least one of the following criteria for liver transplantation after LT, HCC patients included in this study are all patients at high risk for recurrence after LT:
   - Pre-operative imaging or post-operative pathological confirmation of HCC exceeding Milan criteria, with at least one of the following characteristics: a) Pre-operative imaging or post-operative pathological confirmation of the presence of MVI . b) Imaging evidence of vascular invasion or abdominal lymph node metastasis (liver-specific lymph node metastasis, such as the left portal vein, the abdominal inferior vena cava adjacent to the liver, the right diaphragm near the liver, abdominal lymph node metastasis). c) Pre- or intra-operative pathological confirmation of HCC with a tumor size (longitudinal or transverse diameter) ≥ 5cm. d) Pre- or intra-operative pathological confirmation of HCC with 3 or more tumor nodules. e) Intra-operative pathological confirmation of HCC with high incidence of MVI. f) Imaging evidence of tumor extension into the hepatic vein, right and left hepatic arteries, and retrohepatic inferior vena cava of the liver.

Study investigators and collaborators of ILBS have reported that decompensated cirrhosis has a deranged coagulation profile as evidenced by deranged prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen and Thrombelastogram (TEG) in such patients. The aim of the study was to study the effect of human albumin on coagulation parameters and other surrogate markers like inflammatory markers, endothelial dysfunction, echocardiography, pulmonary function, renal function in patients presenting with decompensated cirrhosis. It was a prospective single-center randomized placebo-controlled trial, where 53 patients with decompensated cirrhosis were divided into two groups according to randomization. To begin with, serum Albumin level was measured in all patients. The patients in Group A received human albumin infusion, at a rate of 1 g/kg body weight if their serum albumin level was 3.0 g/dl or less to maintain the serum Albumin levels above 3.0 g/dl. The patients in Group B were given conservative treatment, i.e. standard treatment. After randomization, serial investigations like hematocrit, liver function tests, renal functions, ABG, coagulation parameters, fibrinolytic markers, inflammatory markers, echocardiography, pulmonary function test and 2D ECHO were done in both groups. In group-A , Albumin increased from 3.0gm/dl +/- 0.8 to 4 gm/dl +/- 0.94 (mean +/- SD) (P<0.001). It was noted that though clotting time was prolonged in both the groups, but the prolongation was significantly more in the group-B (p=0.04). The same is true for clot formational time (p=0.02), clot maximum (p=0.006) and fibrin generation time (p=0.16). The mean change in clottability as measured by Riet-veld units of alpha value was significantly more in group B ( p=0.03) as well as coagulability as measured by clot formation time and clot maximum. The mean inflammatory markers (ESR,CRP,IL-6 and TNF-alph), Endothelial dysfunction (vWF, ADAMTS-13) were also significantly higher in Group-B as compared to Group-A. Ejection fraction was found to be significantly lower in group A as compared to group B (ejection fraction 69% +/- 6 vs 71% +/- 6). Pulmonary function test showed reduced DLCO in group A as compared to group B. There were no adverse effects of Human albumin infusion in the study.
In conclusion, Human albumin infusion to patients with decompensated cirrhosis improved coagulation profile of the patient. Human albumin infusion also results in lowering of inflammatory markers, improved ejection fraction and higher rate of oxygen delivery to the tissues."

Lung cancer is a common disease in the world, causing the most deaths among malignant tumors. The 2017 World Health Organization cancer research institute data suggest that the occurrence of lung cancer ranks first in men and women. The number of new patients with stage Ⅲ non-small cell lung cancer (stage Ⅲ NSCLC )accounts for about 35% of the total incidence of the disease. Surgery is currently the most effective treatment for stages ⅢA, ⅢB. However, due to the invasion and metastasis of lung cancer, 47% of patients are positive for para-axillary lymph node metastases or mediastinal lymph node metastases in the middle group of stage III, which cannot be removed by surgery, and the total resection rate is only 20%.
Currently, the prognosis and overall survival (OS) of patients with NSCLC in stages ⅢA, ⅢB have significantly improved, but patients with different N stages in stage Ⅲ still have significant differences in prognosis. To explore the risk of lung cancer recurrence after surgery, the research of the clinical target lesion (CTV) volume and the impact of the clinical target lesion (CTV) on the lung cancer recurrence after surgery is the focus of NSCLC research. This clinical study is a prospective multicenter observational study. It is an intra-operative study, in which the lung cancer in the stages ⅢA, ⅢB confirmed by histology or cytology has potential surgical opportunities and has not been identified by driving gene EGFR/ALK mutation, which is carried out for a long time: 2016 - 2019.
Study enrollment and intervention/treatment:
1. Group 1: Group 1 patients were those who underwent complete resection. After complete resection, patients were treated with immunotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. It is expected that the total number of patients is 59 in the operation group, and the follow-up duration is at least 2 years. They collected patients' baseline puncture tissues, peripheral blood samples from multiple nodes after new adjuvant treatment, surgery, adjuvant treatment, and follow-up, and carry out for 1021-MRD analysis through tumor-informed personalized monitoring MRD test kit, so as to analyze the patient's recurrence status and the correlation of clinical data, treatment response and patient's prognosis.
2. Group 2: Group 2 patients were those who underwent concurrent radio-chemotherapy. After concurrent radio-chemotherapy, patients were treated with immunotherapy alone or chemotherapy combined with immunotherapy. The expected number of patients is 35, and the follow-up duration is at least 2 years. It is for the analysis of MRD status and correlation of treatment response and prognosis of patients with concurrent radio-chemotherapy.
3. Group 3: The expected number of patients is 39, and the follow-up duration is at least 2 years. It is expected to analyze the MRD status and the correlation of treatment response and prognosis of patients with surgery in stage III NSCLC.
4. Group 4: The expected number of patients is 39, and the follow-up duration is at least 2 years. It is expected to analyze the MRD status and the correlation of treatment response and prognosis of patients with concurrent radio-chemotherapy in stage III NSCLC, and then guide the individualized treatment scheme for the patient through the MRD status and the correlation of treatment response and prognosis."

Axillary hair is a common concern among Brazilian women, and different physical methods are used to remove or decrease its density and quantity. In general, physical techniques of hair removal produce more visible result in the short term and can be costly. Thus, this study aims to compare the effect of intense pulsed light (IPL) versus diode laser therapy on axillary hair, being their effectiveness and safety as a function of the energy delivered on the dark body hair and the color and thickness of the hair in relation to the skin. Fifty patients (volunteers, n= 50; age ranging from 38,6 ± 3,8 to 44,6 ± 4,3 years) will be recruited. Participants are assigned into two groups, IPL or diode laser in parallel for the duration of the study. IPL and diode laser sessions will be 25 minutes and one session per month will be given, totalizing four sessions of IPL and diode laser for each female patient selected for the study. Treatments will be carried out through a four-hour window on an average of forty patients per day, being completed in approximately two months. Assessments will performed at the first procedure (S0), four weeks after the first procedure (S1), four weeks after the third procedure (S3) and approximately six weeks after the last treatment (S4), that is, at the end of the fourth session. Secondarily evaluations will be performed at 24 weeks after the end of therapy (S5). Hair count (%) and hair thickness (µm) obtained through photographs in a 4cm² quadrant in the central axillary region will be evaluated. Evaluation of global aesthetic improvement scale 5% reduction and quality of live will be performed by two independent and blind evaluator. Visual analogue scale of pain will be assessed as self-esteem scale and satisfaction level score."

Ischemic stroke remains a leading cause of death and long-term disability worldwide,1 despite major advancements in reperfusion therapies.2,3 While neuroimaging modalities have expanded patient eligibility for reperfusion therapies by estimating ischemic core and salvageable tissue,4-7 their assessments are mostly single-timed. Currently available clinical algorithms lack the capacity to continuously track the dynamic evolution of how the primary core progresses to a final infarct, which, however, is a major determinant of functional outcome.8-10 Monitoring infarct trajectories could support therapeutic decision-making in patients with large vessel occlusion stroke and unveil determinants of stroke progression, aiding in patient selection for trials evaluating cytoprotection11 and targeting clinically ineffective reperfusion.12 Previously studied blood-based biomarkers such as Neurofilament Light Chain (NfL),13 neuron-specific enolase (NSE),14 glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP),15,16 and S 100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B)17 either failed to capture the extent of brain injury within the acute phase of stroke or lack specificity. Plasma levels of brain-derived tau (BD-tau) were recently found to show high value for monitoring brain injury in patients with acute ischemic stroke: In 502 patients with acute IS, plasma BD-tau was associated with imaging-based metrics of brain injury upon admission, increased within the first 24 hours in correlation with infarct progression, and at 24 hours was superior to final infarct volume in predicting 90-day functional outcome.18 While informing on the relation of BD-tau with imaging-based metrics of brain injury, this large cross-sectional study was restricted to BD-tau assessments upon admission (median time from onset: 4.4 hours) and at day 2 (median time from onset: 22.7 hours) and could not inform on key characteristics of the evolution of plasma BD-tau, including when exactly it starts to rise, how long it continues to rise, and how it is determined by infarct characteristics as well as comorbidities. That knowledge would be of great value to determine the responsiveness of plasma BD-tau to brain injury after onset and to evaluate whether BD-tau plateaus at different time points after onset indicating no further infarct progression. PROMISE-BD-100 will thus assess BD-tau levels every hour from admission to 48 hours from stroke onset in patients that present with the clinical diagnosis of an acute ischemic stroke due to a large- or medium-vessel occlusion within 9 hours from symptom onset."

Thyroid nodules are common diseases among patients. Ultrasound is often used to detect thyroid nodules. But there are some limitations, such as the high incidence of thyroid nodules, various manifestations of thyroid nodules, low sensitivity of thyroid ultrasound, poor interobserver agreement in ultrasound features etc, so it is necessary to improve the accuracy of thyroid ultrasound examination.
Imaging Reporting and Data System (THYRADS) was proposed as an important tool for thyroid ultrasound examination. In 2018, THYRADS v2.0, the American Royal College of Radiology (RCR) proposed a new standardized thyroid ultrasound reporting system, which is more comprehensive than the traditional THYRADS. The RCR standard is currently used internationally.
The main defect in the RCR standard system is that it is necessary to master the features of all thyroid nodule benign and malignant characteristics and to accurately summarize various features in a text description. Although THYRADS has many advantages, the standardization of ultrasound reporting by RCR is too simple, and it is difficult to learn in the early stage of training.
Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) have been confirmed to be useful in evaluating thyroid nodules and have been widely accepted. The results of previous studies have found that RCR standardized ultrasound reporting system is simpler than the contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) reporting system, but it also has some limitations, such as the inability to use ultrasound artifacts, poor interobserver agreement and limited application value.
The aim of this study is to improve accuracy of THYRADS standardized ultrasound reporting system, reduce the level of learning of the THYRADS standardized ultrasound reporting system in the initial phase of training, and improve teaching quality through AI assistance."

Neural prosthetic devices allow electrically stimulated patients with severe vision loss to see phosphenes with electrical stimulation. Phosphenes are patterns of flashing lights that appear as the electrode-nerve interface detects light or electrical currents. The neural prostheses (NP) rely on algorithms (that process electrical signals from electrode stimulation) that encode and decode scenes, often based on edge detection. There are no known computational models that accurately predict and control the appearance of perceptual experiences in response to these artificial devices. The investigators hypothesize that different encoding/decoding algorithms will result in different visual experiences. For example, a scene containing a light blue box on a dark green background might be detected and decoded by an edge-detection algorithm, but it will more accurately be detected and decoded by a machine learning algorithm that is specifically trained to detect and decode objects. The investigators aim to test this hypothesis by asking patients to view an artificial vision display (screen or monitor) from which stimuli are projected onto their natural eyes, and ask them to report the appearance of the objects displayed. The investigators expect that patients will be better able to identify objects, perceive their salient features, and describe the objects when their retinal or cortical prosthesis responds to images that are machine-computed. This study will provide a novel opportunity to test different scene-encoding/decoding algorithms (including machine learning) and test whether these algorithms provide more accurate visual experiences. The investigators hypothesize that different encoding methods will give rise to different perceptual experiences. For example, a scene containing a light blue box on a dark green background might be detected and decoded by an edge-detection algorithm, but it will more accurately be detected and decoded by a machine learning algorithm that is specifically trained to detect and decode objects. Therefore, the investigators will ask patients with visual prostheses to view an artificial vision display (screen or monitor) from which stimuli are projected onto their natural eyes, and ask them to report the appearance of objects displayed.

Adenoid cystic carcinomas (ACCs) of the sinonasal tract (SNT) are rare neuroendocrine tumors derived from pluristratose neuroepithelial cells that make up the epithelium of the sinonasal mucosa. They are typically slow growing and locally invasive tumors of the sinonasal tract, and frequently metastasize to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. Due to their indolent nature, ACCs are often diagnosed in an advanced stage, which can complicate the management of these tumors. Patients with ACCs are typically followed long-term due to their risk of recurrence, and their prognostic factors are still unclear. There is limited literature regarding the overall survival and disease-free survival (DFS) for patients with ACCs of the SNT treated over the past 20 years. The investigators propose an observational retrospective study of patients with primary ACCs of the SNT treated in the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Sinus Center from 2003-2019, as well as a retrospective cohort study of patients with ACCs of the SNT and other sinonasal mucosal sites treated in the MGH Otology and Neurotology Department from 1985-2019. In addition the investigators propose evaluating the effectiveness of surveillance with MR/CT and clinical examination in the postoperative period compared to traditional follow up. The investigators also propose using a retrospective database of patients treated in the Ear and Hearing Institute of MGH to evaluate the effectiveness of radiotherapy versus surgical resection.

Gastroesophageal Reflux (GER) is one of the most frequent gastrointestinal disorders in children, characterized by the reflux of gastric acid and gastric content from the esophageal sphincter and into the esophagus. Although in most cases the clinical manifestations are non-specific or minimal and in which GER is defined as functional gastrointestinal disease (FGID), the term inadequately characterized GERD (iGGERD) includes children who develop more severe symptoms and who are at risk of developing complications of esophagitis or aspiration. The diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux is usually made by endoscopic or radiological examinations, but these techniques have limitations, are invasive and uncomfortable for the subjects studied, and are often associated with poor tolerance and difficulties for the parents or caregivers, especially for infants. For this reason, the use of non-invasive diagnostic methods would be of particular interest for infants, as well as for the parents and caregivers. The presence of GER or GERD can lead to a number of symptoms. Symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, vomiting, irritability, and sleep disorders are more frequently observed in infants with GER. It has been shown in literature that the salivary analysis of pepsin and sodium, together with the measurement of pH, can provide valuable data for the diagnosis and differentiation of GERD and other causes of reflux, so that it has a role in determining the presence of GERD and in managing the treatment of GERD and GER. No studies have ever investigated the circadian variation of salivary pH and the content of salivary pepsin, pepsinogen and sodium in infants with gastroesophageal reflux. The hypothesis that led to this study is that salivary pH and the pepsin/pepsinogen ratio have circadian variation and that it is possible to detect a change in saliva parameters during the circadian day cycle that could identify different patterns of reflux in infants, and that these parameters could be particularly useful in identifying patterns of reflux in infants with various symptoms. GERD SYMPTOMS: In 2008, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) established the first pediatric panel on GERD in infancy, reporting that a prevalence of GERD of 47.3% should be used as an estimation for the use of pH-metry in the diagnosis of GERD in infants <1 year old. In the literature, the prevalence of true GERD in infants is between 10 and 40%, while non-specific or minimal symptoms of GERD are between 24 and 60%. It is reported in the literature that the detection of GER does not correlate with symptoms severity and even in infants with minimal or no symptoms, GER does not necessarily progress to GERD.

NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, and it is associated with increased risk for cardiovascular complications and mortality. Obesity, dyslipidemia, and type 2 diabetes mellitus constitute the most important risk factors for NAFLD. There is insufficient data regarding the efficacy of the novel, non-insulin glucose-lowering medications in NAFLD. The investigators hypothesize that the two GLP1 agonists, Dulaglutide and Empagliflozin will be effective in improving liver fat fraction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and NAFLD, and they want to compare their effect on liver steatosis. The investigators will measure improvement of liver fat fraction by Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Percutaneous Fat Quantification, as well as by comparing the change in the Fatty Liver Index (FLI), the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), as well as the Aspartate Aminotransferase to Platelet ratio Index (APRI) and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS). The investigators will also compare the effect of Dulaglutide vs. Empagliflozin in glycemic control improvement and weight loss."

Canine impaction affects the development of the dentition and has various negative effects on the patient's occlusion and the esthetic outcome. Canine impactation rate is around 2.1-3.6%.
In this study the investigators developed a technique to assist surgeons in locating and removing the palatally impacted permanent canines with minimal damage to the neighboring structures. The investigators hypothesize that using a surgical template in the extraction of palatally impacted canines will lessen the duration of the exposure procedure, reduce the amount of bleeding, lower postoperative pain, and improve treatment efficiency.
The investigators designed a surgical template based on the Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine (DICOM) data of the pre-operative cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) reconstruction by fusing it with the digital impression of the patient's maxilla. This approach allows for the creation of a custom surgical template for each patient. On the day of the surgical operation the fit of the template is checked by the surgical operator who then uses a surgical laser to uncover the tooth using the template as a stencil. The impacted canines are exposed under local anaesthesia during an appointment, which lasts around 10 minutes. After removing the overlying mucosa the tooth is bonded with an orthodontic attachment to allow for the extrusion of the tooth.
Canine impaction has a variable prevalence rate, therefore, the investigators designed a prospective two-armed single-centre randomized clinical trial with a pre-defined primary purpose to assess the application of surgical templates for the surgical exposure of impacted canines. The investigators hypothesize that using the template will increase the accuracy of the exposure protocol, shorten the time required for the surgery, and reduce postoperative pain. The investigators will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness of this approach in an intra-country setting.
The investigators conducted a pilot study comparing the standard procedure with the surgical template technique on the exposure of 5 palatally impacted upper canines under the supervision of experienced orthodontists in July 2017 without the involvement of a surgeon from Semmelweis University Department of Periodontology. To date 6 more patients are included in the study.
The main study variables are the success of the surgical intervention, the duration of the surgery, postoperative pain on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), complications, and time frame for the eruption of the impacted canines to its correct place. The investigators also investigate the excess costs of the design and manufacture of the surgical guides using Euro on a total of 20 patients.
During the trial the investigators will evaluate the time, costs and the accuracy of the exposure technique using a surgical template in comparison to the standard free-hand surgical protocol. The investigators expect that the trial will contribute to the development of new surgical techniques for the orthodontic correction of canine impaction.
The investigators plan to conduct this trial from September 2017 to August 2018 and the outcome of the study is to submit the results to a scientific journal for publication."

A high incidence of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) is evident in Asians with significant impact on health and quality of life. Women with a history of gestational diabetes have a high risk of developing T2D later in life. Lifestyle and behavioral changes can reduce the risk of T2D. This study aims to test the impact of the LvL UP APP - a holistic lifestyle digital intervention (including diet, physical activity, sleep, and mental well-being) on glucose regulation amongst women with prior GDM. The intervention also aims to improve metabolic health and decrease metabolic risk factors in both the women and their children. Women in this study will be randomized to either the intervention or control group, followed up for 3 years. Health data collected will be monitored over 3 years. This study will focus on (1) the impact of the holistic lifestyle digital intervention on glucose regulation amongst women with prior GDM. Additionally, the study will investigate the impact of the intervention on the health and well-being of their children, and the impact of the intervention on reducing the risk of T2DM and metabolic diseases later in life. The study will also assess the cost-effectiveness of the intervention and examine the potential influence of gut microbiota and epigenetics on metabolic outcomes.

The safety of the treatment will be determined by assessing the alterations of the ERG and B-scan evaluation. The retinal function will be tested through serial ERG examinations to monitor for signs of ischemia on the outer retinal layers. Any findings considered abnormal will be documented using the International Reference Group for Electroretinography (IRG-ERG) criteria. The ERG examinations will be performed on the same day in the same place as the B-scan ultrasonography, according to participants' preferences. Each ERG will include a background check, a dark adaption of 5 minutes, and photopic and scotopic stimulations. B-scan ultrasonography is a diagnostic test conducted by specialized physicians and is the gold standard imaging technique for choroidal melanomas. The procedure is carried out by trained ophthalmologists with expertise in ocular ultrasound scans. The examinations are performed in a comfortable supine position under topical anesthesia (tetracaine) and will be done on both eyes to compare pre and post-treatment imaging. The initial scan will be performed in the enrolled eye only, and subsequent B-scans will be performed on both eyes for comparison purposes."

LSS patients are often instructed by their care providers to limit physical activity that increases symptoms. However, this often puts them at an increased risk of physical deconditioning. This trial focuses on older LSS patients who have symptom improvement with continuous flexion posture. Patients in this trial will be given tools to maintain flexion posture (a back support wedge and knee scooters) and will receive training in how to adjust their posture using DME as part of their treatment.
The aim of the study is to demonstrate feasibility of the intervention. The study uses actigraphy and mobility assessment to see if patients continue to maintain the necessary flexion after the 6-week pilot trial. This will demonstrate the acceptability of the intervention and the ability of LSS patients to self-manage.
This study has an estimated enrollment of 30 patients, who will be recruited from the Spine Clinic at the VA Palo Alto campus, San Francisco, CA. Each 6-week patient will have 3 study visits - baseline, week 3, and week 6.
Patients may find their self-management of pain and activity improvement and therefore may wish to participate in future studies on this intervention for a greater duration and at multiple medical sites.
Patients will be referred to participating therapists or physical trainers who will be trained to instruct patients in flexion and assist LSS patients in using knee scooters. In Phase 2, the investigators will work closely with Rehabilitation Research & Development Service to assess the need for a therapist or physical trainer for each participant.
In-home measurements of walking will be utilized to evaluate differences between treatment groups. The investigators will use 4 actigraphs (worn on the head, wrist, thigh, and calf) to capture frequency of walking, distance of walking, frequency of sitting and duration of sitting. During Phase 2 an interviewer will call patients 3 days after completing the 6-week period to address questions or concerns.
Data analysis will be compared between the treatment and control group, to assess the feasibility of DME-supported self-management using a continuous flexion posture for relief of symptoms."

Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second and third cause of cancer-related death in men and women, respectively. For the detection of lesions in the mucosa (premalignant and malignant), colonoscopy has been considered the gold standard. Lately, published data evaluating the AI-assisted polyp detectors has demonstrate high sensitivity, specificity, and interobserver agreement. Due to the importance of CRC diagnosis and prompt treatment and taking advantage of the newly introduced DiscoveryTM AI system the investigators aim to assess the real-world effectiveness of this system in clinical practice and compare the results between expert and non-expert endoscopists. The study is a single-center crossover trial design. In this way patients will be submitted to 2 diagnostic colonoscopies, a conventional white light colonoscopy followed by a white light colonoscopy assisted by an AI system (DiscoveryTM). The first procedure will be performed by an expert or non-expert endoscopist. The second procedure will be performed by an operator with the same-level-of -expertise in comparison to the initial procedure and blinded to the results of the previous intervention. The diagnostic performance of the AI-assisted system will be assessed by sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values (PPV and NPV) and observer agreement. The ADR and PDR will be determined by every new colonoscopy, the ADR will be determined by at least one adenoma histologically proven/NBI NICE classification, and the PDR will be determined by at least one polyp."

Pregnant people with epilepsy and their healthcare providers have concerns about the effects of certain anti-seizure medications (ASM) on the growing fetus. Epilepsy-related complications increase the chances of a difficult birth, and some ASM can be toxic to the developing fetus. In particular, the use of anticonvulsants (like Depakote) in some cases can be very dangerous and lead to fetal demise. However, seizure control and ASMs are essential for both maternal and fetal safety as well as preventive long-term neuropathological effects. The goal of this study is to investigate the feasibility and tolerability of initiating a low glycemic index (LGI) diet in pregnant people with epilepsy in the first half of pregnancy. The LGI diet is a popular and flexible diet that has proven to be effective for treating seizures in people with epilepsy when compared to the Mediterranean diet. The LGI diet is also associated with a decrease in fasting insulin, HbA1c and blood pressure, as well as the reduction of the risks of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes. People with epilepsy who follow a low glycemic index diet before pregnancy show improvements in glycaemic control, which is a positive side effect that we hope to recreate in pregnant women with epilepsy who follow the diet through pregnancy. Participants will choose to go on the low glycemic index diet or to remain on their standard diet. All participants will fill out diet questionnaires throughout the intervention and provide a maximum of three stool samples and three blood samples. Dietary intervention will end when pregnancies end, and stool and blood samples will be collected for up to three months postpartum. Outcomes will include diet tolerability, seizure frequency, gut bacteria composition, and metabolite alterations. Our findings will help us predict the tolerability of the low glycemic index diet in pregnant people with epilepsy and provide a potential non-pharmacological option for a healthier pregnancy."

Pancreatic cancer is the ninth most common cancer worldwide with incidence rates of 2.2/100,000 and mortality rates of 4.1/100,000 (8). About 330,000 patients were diagnosed with PDAC, and the mortality rate was over 90% in the same year (9). PDAC usually presents with metastasis, and the main sites of metastasis are the liver, peritoneum and abdominal lymph nodes. Neoadjuvant therapy can improve overall survival (OS) and the rate of R0 resection in borderline resectable (BR) and resectable PDAC (4). According to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guideline (11), neoadjuvant therapy is recommended before surgery for patients with stage IB and II A-B PDAC. The most effective treatment for PDAC with low tumor burden is surgery. However, most patients are diagnosed at a very late stage of the disease. This emphasizes the importance of developing effective non-invasive treatments to increase resectability of PDAC.
This feasibility study will investigate neo-adjuvant MSLN-targeted CAR-T therapy in patients with borderline or resectable PDAC. The investigators would like to examine whether the neo-adjuvant therapy can improve the rate of R0 resection, downstage the tumor, and increase the proportion of negative margins or other indicators of pCR after neo-adjuvant CAR-T therapy. CAR is a technology for gene editing, and CAR-T cells expressing chimeric receptor can target specific antigens on tumor cells. Mesothelin (MSLN) is a transmembrane antigen that is highly expressed in PDAC, ovarian cancer, lung cancer and other tumors. In a current randomized control trial of PDAC (NCT02466964), third-generation MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells have proven to be safe. Based on promising result of the trial, the investigators propose a pilot study to examine the safety and efficacy of endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)-guided injection of MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells in PDAC patients with borderline resectable or resectable PDAC. The investigators will include a total of 50 patients as a first cohort. MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells will be injected using EUS (Endoscopic Ultrasound) on PDAC. The investigators will evaluate the tumor response 4 weeks after MSLN-targeted CAR-T injection and the safety and feasibility of MSLN-targeted CAR-T therapy by follow-up for 1 year. After confirming the safety and feasibility of neo-adjuvant therapy with MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells, the study will be further expanded into second cohort and conduct a formal Phase II trial which will enro 100 patients with PDAC to examine the safety and efficacy of the EUS-guided MSLN CAR-T.
The overall outcome of the trial may help us to determine the role of neo-adjuvant therapy before surgery in PDAC patients.

Background: Children with Down Syndrome have a specific neuromuscular pattern with high prevalence of static quadriceps muscle hypertonicity and weakness of abdominal, trunk, and pelvic muscles.
Down syndrome children demonstrate decreased proprioceptive sense and muscle strength which leads to poor postural control in the weight-bearing position including standing and walking. Core stability exercises play an important part in training posture and maintaining balance. The current gold standard of core stability exercises is the Jaffrey Core Stability exercise.
However, there is concern that children with Down syndrome cannot follow the instructions given in a core stability training program, and children with Down Syndrome prefer more physical activity-oriented exercises. For this reason, the aim of this study is to compare the effects of Weight Bearing Exercises with Jaffrey's Core stability exercise training programs in 25 children with Down Syndrome on functional balance and trunk muscles strength.
Methods:
45 children with Down Syndrome were recruited from a state-funded elementary school in Sivas city, Turkey and assessed for the study. Children were randomly allocated into 3 groups. There were children in Group Jaffrey (25 children) and Group WBE (25Children) who were trained and Group C (25 children) who received no training for a 4-week period.
After the pre-tests were completed, the training program was began. Group WBE received weight bearing exercises training and group Jaffrey received Jaffrey's core stability exercises training. The children were evaluated at the end of the program (at 4 weeks).
The Berg balance scale, Pediatric balance scale, and Trunk control Measurement Scale were used for balance and trunk control assessments. The Berg balance scale is a widely used assessment tool of balance in children with Cerebral Palsy. The Pediatric balance scale is used to assess functional balance skills in school aged children. Trunk Control Measurement Scale is a clinical tool to measure trunk control in children.
Statistical analyses
After the normality of the data was evaluated with the Shapiro Wilk test, the descriptive statistics of the variables were calculated. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal Wallis analysis of variance (for non-parametric data) were used to compare the groups. If the significant difference was detected by the main effect of the group x time, post-hoc analyses using Tukey test for the parametric data and Friedman test for the non-parametric data were performed. p<0.05 was considered significant.
Results:
There were no statistically significant changes in dynamic balance at the end of the program, despite of the statistically significant increase of Berg balance scale scores with weight bearing exercises and Jaffrey's core stability training programs. Pediatric Baalance Scale scores did not show statistically significant increase in both groups. However, in the group WBE, there was a statistically significant increase of Pediatric Baalance Scale scores. Trunk Control Measurement Scale scores showed statistically significant increase in both groups, with greater statistically significant increase in the Group Jaffrey.
Conclusion:
As a conclusion, 4 weeks of training on weight bearing exercises with or without Jaffrey's core stability exercises did not affected the dynamic balance, however 4 weeks of training with Jaffrey's core stability exercises may effectively increase the trunk control in children with Down Syndrome."

Dialysis patients are at a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and bone fractures. Some of the risk factors for this include uncontrolled blood pressure, high lipids and high uric acid and a pro-inflammatory state. Some studies have shown that melatonin reduces cardiovascular risk factors such as blood pressure and inflammation. However data on its effect on lipids, oxidant markers, renal markers and patient quality in dialysis patients are limited. The aim of this clinical trial was therefore to investigate the effect of melatonin on glycemic parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, markers of renal bone metabolism and patient quality in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients over a period of 10 weeks.
In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, 120 CAPD patients were randomly assigned to melatonin (group M) or a placebo (group P). Outcome measures included biochemical parameters assessing fasting glucose, lipids, kidney and bone markers, quality of life, depression and sleep quality questionnaires.
In group M patients had lower levels of markers of cardiovascular and kidney damage, reduced insulin-resistance and inflammation compared to the placebo group. Quality of life scores improved in the melatonin group compared to baseline. Melatonin had no effect on markers of bone metabolism or sleep quality.
Melatonin improved several markers of cardiovascular risk in CAPD patients and may reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Improved quality of life in patients receiving a dietary supplement of melatonin. Long term studies are required to determine the role of melatonin in CAPD patients."

Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common postoperative complication in cardiac surgery. Despite some improvements in the management of the hemodynamic status under cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), the incidence of AKI remains high (up to 40%). Furthermore, AKI has significant adverse effects on both morbidity and mortality, and it is associated with significant increase in postoperative hospitalisation costs. In our tertiary centre, we recently initiated a strategy that aims to optimize oxygen delivery under CPB to better understand its impact on the incidence of AKI. However, this hemodynamic management strategy remains very complex and is not currently integrated into routine clinical practice. The objective of this pilot study is to design and develop a patient-level decision support system that uses optimization strategies for oxygen delivery in patients undergoing cardiac surgery under CPB. This system will help to individualize oF DO2 to prevent the incidence of AKIS. This study is focused on patients with cardiac disease submitted to cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass. The clinical utility of this new system will be tested in a future multicenter randomized controlled trials and should be used as the basis of a clinical decision support system. The objective of the project is to design and develop a system integrating optimization strategies for oxygen delivery in patients undergoing cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass.
This pilot study will be developed in three phases.
The first phase starts with the systematic review of the related literature to provide the basis for oxygen delivery recommendations. This phase will end with a set of recommendations about oxygen delivery under cardiopulmonary bypass.
Subsequently, we shall develop a software to calculate oF DO2 in real time, using both hemoglobin and CPB output as inputs. This program will be used off-line in a database to compare real-time oF DO2 values with recommended oF DO2 values defined during the first phase.
The second phase starts with the construction of our database, consisting of cardiac surgery cases with cardiopulmonary bypass in our hospital. This database will include hemoglobin values, CPB output and oF DO2 calculated in real time, using hemoglobin and CPB values.
We shall design a database using real-time oF DO2 values and defined oF DO2 recommendations using offline data during the CPB procedure in cardiac surgery without AKI. The objective of this phase is to assess the accuracy of the defined guidelines in this database.
After this phase, we shall develop a decision support system to calculate oF DO2, in real-time, and the software will help to reach our defined guidelines using all the data of the database.
In the third phase, we shall evaluate the decision support system on a database including 294 cases with cardiac surgery under cardiopulmonary bypass and the incidence of postoperative AKI. This will allow us to assess the effectiveness of our oF DO2 recommendations in reducing the incidence of AKI.
We anticipate the development of this decision support system can be performed in two years.

The auricular acupressure procedure on specific regions is a simple, non-invasive and low-cost method applied to prevent diseases and accelerate healing. In addition to being an alternative medicine method, it is one of the methods preferred for rapid healing. It was emphasized that pain relief in the treatment of painful problems and postoperative pain reduction were observed in clinical trials. In a study evaluating the effect of auricular acupressure on the lumbar region in adults, it was observed that the pain in the lumbar region was significantly reduced after 5 minutes of auricular acupressure in the first and second groups. In another clinical study, it was observed that the average heart rate and body temperature increased at a single auricular acupressure point and decreased at another point. It was determined that the heat released by the body as a result of auricular acupressure at certain acupoints is an indication that it was effective in many diseases (Acupuncture).
This study was planned to evaluate the effects of auricular acupressure and sham auricular acupressure on temperature and skin conductance values in the lumbar region. The objective is to determine whether changes in core body temperature occur during auricular acupressure."

Over the past decade in Europe, the number of young people drinking has decreased. However, some university students still engage in risky drinking practice (binge-drinking). The MyDéfi app has been recently designed as a tool to help these individuals reduce their alcohol consumption. This study aims to investigate whether MyDéfi is effective in reducing alcohol consumption compared to usual care.
The study will be conducted in first-of-a-kind, randomized, controlled, with an interventional design on a national scale. It will consist of three measurement points (at Day 1, Day 3 months and Day 6 months). The primary study hypothesis is that MyDéfi will have an acceptable effect on weekly standard drinks compared to usual care.
The study will be conducted in accordance with national legislation and the provisions of the European Directive on clinical trials (2003/94/EC). It has been approved by the French National Agency for Data Protection (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertés) and by the Committee of Ethics in Research in France (Comité Consultatif en"

Background: Hyperglycemia continues to be a substantial factor related to diabetic complications. Recent evidence shows that type 2 diabetes is also a consequence of intestinal microbial dysbiosis in addition to obesity. One factor involved in the complex pathophysiology of obesity is the A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1). Dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota may be associated with increased levels of serine protease tryptase (SPT) and its activating protein A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1) in the bloodstream.
A-kinase anchoring protein 1(AKAP1) is a serine protease that has been shown to increase insulin resistance.
Objectives: 1. Evaluate the effect of the intervention with Nitazoxanide (NTX) on glycemic control and insulin resistance of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus; 2. Determine the effect of the intervention with Nitazoxanide on lipid profile.
Material and Methods: This is a pilot study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). All participants must attend an in-person visit and will be instructed on the proper use of the 2 week-diaries. Glycemic control will be assessed with fasting blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. Serum insulin levels with HOMA-IR calculation will be used to evaluate insulin resistance. Blood lipid levels (total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, and HDL) will be measured. Serum levels of A-kinase anchoring protein 1 and asprosin will be determined.
Results: Preliminary data after 2 months of intervention with nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily show an improvement in glycemic control and a decrease in serum levels of A-kinase anchoring protein 1(AKAP1).
Conclusion: The current study could provide helpful insights into the potential beneficial effects of nitazoxanide supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Larger and longer-term studies are necessary to evaluate the effectiveness and long-term impact of nitazoxanide supplementation."

The overall prevalence of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is increasing worldwide, and it affects about 1% - 1.5% of children. The pathogenesis of ASD is multifactorial and there is a role for environmental, genetic, and microbiome factors. This project aims to investigate clinical risk factors of autism such as the dietary history, maternal use of medications, obstetric, and birth history and then investigating the microbiome and metabolome of autistic and their siblings. 16S rRNA genes sequencing and the non-targeted comprehensive analysis by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC)/time of flight-mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) will be perform to identify possible dysbiosis and microbiome changes related to autism. This project will provide a good insight into possible clinical microbiological risk factors of autism and their possible relation with the severity of ASD.

Many individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) are at risk of poverty due to a number of reasons: lack of employment opportunities, a high prevalence of financial exploitation, and social isolation or stigma. Financial insecurity may contribute to a state of uncertainty and anxiety that can hamper recovery. Hence, intervention to improve participant’s ability to achieve financial security may help prevent poverty-related poor outcomes and promote recovery. Currently, there are very few intervention studies for people with severe mental illness that focus on providing individual-level financial self-help, to address the high rate of poverty in this group. This study will evaluate the effectiveness of an internet-based intervention model for improving incomes, financial self-efficacy, and well-being among adults with SMI. With a randomised controlled trial design, we will compare the intervention with a wait-list control."

Currently, endobronchival valves (EBV) can be placed in up to 70% of patients with emphysema and collateral ventilation, and have improved exercise tolerance, dyspnea, quality of life and reduced frequency of acute exacerbation in the previous study. The hypothesis is that these improvements are associated with changes in the function and morphology of the diaphragm. The main objective of this study was to evaluated the effect of endobronchial lung volume reduction (ELVR) on diaphragm function and morphology in patients suffering from COPD and hyperinflated lung areas. Inclusion has been done on patient with COPD with bilateral hyperinflation and with an unequal distribution of bronchial and interventional anatomy (difference of >20% of volume). It has required the realization of computed tomography (spiral and 3D) and bronchoscopy with measurement of diaphragmatic pressure in order to study: the evolution of the diaphragmatic pressure after placement of the EBV, the evolution of the diaphragm conformation by measuring the 3D morphology of the diaphragm and the assessment of diaphragmatic dysfunction through transdiaphragmatic pressure measured at the functional residual capacity after phrenic magnetic stimulation. 66 patients were included. At the inclusion, the mean diaphragm pressure was around 5 mmHg and the mean diaphragm cross section area was 51.75 cm2. In 80.3% of patients, the pressure has increased 6 months after EBV setting, regardless of collateral ventilation. The measured 3D diaphragmatic morphological parameters have not significantly changed after treatment. Endobronchial lung volume reduction is associated with diaphragm reinforcement but no morphological change. The hypothesis that the diaphragm pressure after EBV increasing is explained by the reduction of lung volume is strengthened by the fact that there was no change in diaphragmatic cross-sectional area neither in 3D diaphragm morphology. A limitation of this study is that the 3D measurement of the diaphragm has been done in a small number of patients.

Inclusion Criteria : Valves insertion
The study population will be patients suffering from COPD with hyperinflated lung areas. These patients (39 in our work and 69 in the reference series) have an unequal distribution of bronchial and interventional anatomy (difference of >20% of volume).
Hyperinflation and interventional anatomy.
The presence of collateral ventilation will not be required as it is a prognostic criterion in terms of improvement of exercise tolerance and health status after an intervention of ELVR, but also due to the difficulty of quantifying collateral ventilation in clinical practice and with CT scan.

Atrial fibrillation has been regarded as a major social health problem in Hong Kong in view of its rapid progression, high health expenditure and poor prognosis12. Compared to the general population, paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients have a higher risk of heart failure and stroke, and atrial fibrillation is associated with poorer quality of life36. The present study is based on the conceptual framework of the self-regulation model proposed by Lazarus and Folkman78, which emphasizes individuals' subjective perceptions and response strategies to challenges. Self-regulation theory focuses on subjective perception of illness as well as an individual's perceived cognitive resources and response strategies to cope with illness13. Illness perceptions are the ways in which individuals construe an illness and its impact and implications, including the perceived causes of the problem, its duration and impact, and the extent to which the person feels able to manage the symptoms of their conditions and have some control over them13. In coping with the uncertainties presented by chronic health conditions, individual characteristics, social factors and the nature of the disease are influenced by individuals' perception of their illness, including their cognitive appraisal, emotion, health care resources and social support29. At present, no study has been designed to study the interventional factors associated with the quality of life of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The investigators proposed to study the following possible factors affecting the quality of life of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients: illnes perceptions, coping strategies and self-efficacy. We will further investigate the indirect and direct effects of illness perceptions and coping strategies, and the moderating effects of self-efficacy in the paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients. The aim of this study is to study the interventional factors that affect the quality of life of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation patients and to identify the factors that can help to prevent these problems and thereby improve patients' quality of life."

Rectal cancer is the second most common cause of colon cancer and the fourth most common cancer. Treatment of early rectal cancer is a multidisciplinary approach, and one of the main problems is the high morbidity rate in patients who are candidates to organ preservation. Transanal endoscopic surgery, with the development of endoscopic resection and transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM), has increased the indication for local excision of rectal lesions. However, there are no prospective randomized studies that demonstrate the quality of organ-preserving strategies. In the literature, the risk of locoregional recurrence ranges between 5% and 23% for early rectal cancer after transanal local excision. It is not known if there are enough tumors that cannot be removed that justify a total treatment plan vs. a watch and wait approach.
In March 2023, the local ethics committee will begin the recruitment process of centres that will participate in the LORENA project, and the project will begin in January 2025.
In a prospective manner, the project will include all patients who have early or locally advanced rectal cancer, defined as M0 tumors, located more than 4 cm from the anal verge which are candidates for transanal local excision, or T1 or T2 tumors that are clinically deemed unresectable and that meet the inclusion criteria. The study´s main objective is to study in situ rectum preservation in rectal adenocarcinoma through local excision. Demographics, tumor characteristics, type of intervention, complications, histological details and further necessity of treatments and rectal preservation will be recorded for each patient, along with the number of patients who have to perform total surgical excision after initial local excision. Surgery, histology, complications, radicality of salvage TME and morbidity rate will be the outcome measures.
Expected results: 5% of patients with early rectal cancer may avoid the need for total surgical excision with complications and functional results similar to those obtained after total surgical excision, although it is not known which clinical characteristics are associated with the success of local excision."

Type A aortic dissection involves an acute tear in the innermost layer of aortic wall, leading to the formation of a ""false"" lumen at the ascending aorta. The blood pressure then forces flow through the tear, into the false lumen, causing a tear in the outer layer, eventually leading to rupture of aorta and rapid death.
Over a two year study period, the investigators will enroll 2,000 patients operated on for a type A aortic dissection in participating hospitals. The investigators will document patient characteristics, concomitant procedures performed, procedural methods, procedural results, mortality, and early and late major complications. Patients will be tracked every year for life/death and any events related to their aortic dissection.
Overall, this study has a two-fold focus. One is to compare outcomes among various types of procedures. The second is to examine risk factors for adverse outcome. The data will determine the impact of current and developing repair strategies and it will help identify important risk factors for poor outcome. These may influence future strategies for the management of aortic dissection and may contribute more generally to the scientific understanding of aortic diseases."

Stress refers to a psychobiological state response to the demands of a situation that are perceived as excessively taxing or threatening, where a change in the behavior and physiological responses to allow the person to meet those demands takes place. Many factors have contributed to a more complex understanding about the role of stress in the human body; however, it is necessary to underline stressors such as academic stress, which may involve the perception of the subject about the relevance of an exam to meet the expectations of their loved ones and, subsequently, personal failures. Students in undergraduate degrees, especially in health-related disciplines such as physiotherapy and nursing are an example of situations that may cause anxiety by the constant demand of academic development and expectations of the profession itself.
Nowadays, there are different methods to manage stress, such as pharmacological, psychological and alternative therapies, as guided visualization (also known as imagery) is a procedure that consists of a mental focus on a specific image or scene, in order to evoke positive sensations and, potentially, lower stress levels. Based on the aforementioned, the objective is to design a single-blind randomized controlled study with two different groups of students who will be attending an academic test in Health Sciences. The effectiveness of virtual reality vs. traditional guided visualization to manage stress prior to the examination will be evaluated by the assessment of perceived stress in the last month, physiological stress responses (blood pressure and heart rate, both in rest and stress, and salivary cortisol, just before starting the exam), and academic performance."

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), a cancer arising from the epithelial lining of the nasopharynx, is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In children, adolescents and young adults (CAYA), NPC is often treated with radiation therapy, resulting in late side effects, such as loss of hearing.
A study is being developed to see whether combining chemotherapy with an immune drug called nivolumab improves outcomes with fewer side effects. It will be combined with standard chemotherapy to treat newly diagnosed patients, followed by treatment with nivolumab alone for up to 5 years.
Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle, gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 of each cycle, and cisplatin IV over 3-6 hours on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive concurrent radiation therapy on trial. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically and have repeated tumor evaluations.
Patients receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 of each cycle. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo echocardiography (ECHO) or multigated acquisition scan (MUGA) during screening and as clinically indicated on trial. Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and computed tomography (CT) throughout the trial and chest x-ray during follow-up. Patients also undergo dental x-ray imaging on the trial. Patients may optionally undergo tissue biopsy, blood and stool sample collection during screening and on trial. Upon completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 12 months, every 6 months until 24 months off therapy, and then yearly until 5 years off therapy.

The aim of this study is to use imaging techniques to assess liver and lung function, as well as digestive system issues in children with CF who are beginning treatment with a new drug called the CFTR modulator (ETI).
The study will include 3 phases.
In Phase 1, we will test to see if the new imaging protocols can be carried out with very young children (aged 6 to 11 years), as well as with healthy volunteers who are the same age and gender as the participants.
Phase 2 will recruit 12 children with CF who are aged 6 to 11 years, and they will have MRI scans taken at 3 time points determined by the ingestion of a meal. These scans will help us to measure how the gut moves and releases the nutrients it obtains from food into the body. The patients will also be asked to complete questions about their stomach and bowel symptoms, and a 3-day food diary for each of the 3 study days.
Phase 3 will require the participants to return to the hospital for a repeat set of the MRI scans. This will be between 6 months and 1 year after children have started ETI. Phase 3 is essential to see how the CFTR modulator (ETI) is affecting the children's gastrointestinal systems and liver and lung function."

Hypospadias repair surgery is an invasive surgery that results in significant postoperative pain. Pain alters the quality of life and satisfaction of the patients and results in manipulation of wounds, infection, bleeding, and wound dehiscence leading to unfavorable surgical outcome. As a plan for postoperative pain prophylaxis in children, different analgesic techniques have been used as preemptive analgesia such as local infiltration of anesthesia, penile block, epidural block and caudal block in addition to general anesthesia. Caudal block is found to be one of most succeeded technique in hypospadias repair and decreases the postoperative analgesia consumption. Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic commonly used via caudal epidural route but gives limited duration of analgesia. Therefore, the addition of other drugs in an attempt to improve the quality and duration of analgesia given by bupivacaine has been studied. Examples of additives drugs used in the caudal epidural are opioids, alpha 2 agonist as dexmedtomidine and clonidine which produce prolongation of the duration of the analgesia, but their undesirable effect may limit its use as nausea, vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression. Epidural corticosteroids have a long history of safe and effective use in the treatment of low back and radicular pain due to their strong anti-inflammatory effect encouraging use in management of acute postoperative pain. In pediatric surgical patients presenting for mainly lower abdominal surgery, a meta-analysis revealed clinically meaningful prolongation of the duration of analgesia from caudal blockade by adjuvant dexamethasone versus placebo. In addition to doubling to tripling the duration of analgesia, adjuvant dexamethasone has a rescue analgesia sparing effect and reduces post postoperative nausea and vomiting. A vast majority of literature supports the efficacy of particulate steroids like methylprednisolone over dexamethasone in providing longer analgesia in management of chronic pain conditions. Aim of the work and hypothesis: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that will evaluate the analgesic efficacy and safety of caudal methylprednisolone in pediatric patients. This randomized, double-blind, controlled bi-center study was designed to compare the postoperative analgesic efficacy of dexamethasone and methylprednisolone in caudal block for children undergoing hypospadias surgical repair using the duration of analgesia as the primary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that methylprednisolone will provide superior postoperative analgesia than dexamethasone when added to bupivacaine for caudal block."

This is a prospective randomized controlled pilot trial. It is a single-center trial to address our primary research question. Marginal donor organs are lung organs with the potential to be transplanted yet rejected conventionally due to low pre-transplant functional test parameters. Lungs from this category of donors are offered to hospitals and transplant centers for evaluation and the decision whether or not to transplant these organs is subjective. Based on preliminary evidence, EVLP has shown to be a potential tool to repair 'marginal' organs and provide a second chance for transplantation. However, this approach is not without risks and currently not available in all transplant centers. Several authors demonstrated the value of additional treatment strategies, such as HDF prior to lung transplantation. The combination of both techniques should lead to improved outcomes; nevertheless, there was no randomized evidence. We hypothesize that combination of EVLP and HDF will improve the lung function in the transplanted lungs. We also hypothesize that organ repairs by EVLP/HDF will lead to a reduced need for donor lungs with better outcome after transplantation. These assumptions were not evaluated in a systematic way. This prospective pilot trial is therefore designed to compare the functional testing parameters of donor lungs in EVLP versus EVLP/HDF. Furthermore, we will evaluate the impact of EVLP/HDF on the recipients by clinical parameters.
A prospective randomized open-label three-armed study is designed to investigate this hypothesis. The study group consists of 24 pairs of lungs for transplantation at the Medical University of Vienna, all other parameters are similar to clinical routine application.
Lung grafts (n=24 pairs) that are initially offered to our center for transplantation are identified based on their organ-procuring coordinator report and ISHLT criteria. After the initial consent and organ offer at the Organ Procuring Coordinator in Austria, the coordinator will get in touch with the investigators to identify eligible recipients. We will screen potential recipients for their suitability to participate in the clinical trial. Based on our inclusion criteria, patients on the intensive care unit prior to transplantation, with mechanical ventilation and/or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support will not be able to participate in the study. Lung transplant criteria of the Medical University of Vienna are accepted and follow the guidelines provided by ISHLT. Recipients with a life expectancy of less than nine months will not be considered.
Donor organs are offered to 3 different study arms. Inclusion criteria and organ-offering decisions are left to the investigators. 24 lung pairs will fulfill the criteria for acceptance to the Medical University of Vienna. If a lung pair cannot be transplanted in our center due to the subjective decision of our local team, it will be considered lost to follow-up. 24 pairs of lungs will undergo the randomization process."

Premature infants are known to be more susceptible to discomfort and pain than term infants during clinical examinations. Procedures such as retinopathy of prematurity examination are commonly experienced causes of distress and discomfort in premature and low birth weight infants. Several attempts have been made to optimize the retinopathy examination procedure by administering procedural pain relievers, such as topical sucrose administration and skin-to-skin contact with parental figures. However, most attempts have been primarily focused on analgesia and pain reduction, and have limited success in addressing distress and discomfort.  The present study aims to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensorial stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants. Previous studies have shown that auditory and multisensory stimuli might be helpful in reducing anxiety and pain in clinical settings. However, the effect of auditory stimuli on the outcomes of retinopathy of prematurity examinations has not been investigated. Thus, the present study aims to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants. It is hypothesized that the use of multisensory stimulation during retinopathy of prematurity examination will contribute to a more comfortable experience for the infants and will increase the overall examination success rate."

Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is a common ocular surface disease that is associated with abnormalities in the eyelid. It was previously known as meibomianitis and is a challenging disease for eye care professionals and patients. The prevalence of MGD was reported to range from 6% to 89%, depending on the criteria used, location of subjects and diagnostic tools used. A simple grading system would be useful when screening and managing patients who may have MGD, but current grading systems had certain limitations. The current grading systems, which rely on the eyelid morphology and lid structure, did not quantify the meibomian gland dysfunction.
During recent years, non-invasive imaging tools, such as in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM), Scheimpflug imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT) had been developed to quantify MG health and dysfunction. The aim of this project was to quantify Meibomian glands (MG) health by in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and develop a simple grading system based on the MG density and thickness. This was important as it would allow quantification of MGD and standardise the diagnosis. The investigators hypothesised that MG thickness and density could be used as biomarkers quantitate MGD and a simple grading system for MGD would be useful. They developed a modified formula for quantifying Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD), based on the average MG thickness, MG density, tear meniscus height, eye morphology and tear film lipid layer thickness."

The aim of this project is to study the effects on oral mucositis and on the quality life of subjects undergoing radiotherapy for oral cavity, pharynx or head and neck cancer. The oral mucositis is a common side effect of radiotherapy for head and neck. Radiotherapy induced Oral Mucositis (OM) is characterized by mucosal inflammation, severe pain and it can lead to several complications such as infections, feeding problems and malnutrition. The investigational product is based on zinc gluconate and bicarbonate. This combination has strong anti-inflammatory potential.
Previous studies have already proved that zinc is able to protect against radiation-induced toxicity such as mucositis and oral disorders. It is also considered one of the most powerful anti-inflammatory agents present in the food and it contributes to oral health.
It’s well known the importance of oral health in the quality of life of patients, because the oral cavity is considered a key point for social interactions. Patients affected by Oral Mucositis often experience a lot of pain and discomfort, and it can interfere with self-esteem and body image. Therefore the impact of this complication can be significant for patients.
In recent years different devices and products aiming to protect against OM have been tested and are commercially available, in most cases as rinses containing alkaline substances that help the formation of a barrier on the oral cavity. Nonetheless, no device or product based on antioxidants has been yet studied and tested.
It’s important to highlight that the effects of these products on oral health have never been studied in terms of prevention of OM. The objective of this project is to compare the effectiveness of the investigational product based on zinc and bicarbonate with a new rinse based on sodium chloride and bicarbonate to prevent the OM in patients submitted to radiotherapy for head and neck cancer."

The design of the study is a randomized controlled experimental design.
The sample of the study consisted of 84 infants with a gestational age of 28-42 weeks.
The infants were exposed to white noise, heart sounds, or the music that the mother listened to most frequently during pregnancy, for 10 minutes before the heel lance, during, and 20 minutes after the procedure.
The pain of the infants before, during, and after the procedure was measured using the Neonatal Infant Acute Pain Assessment Scale (NIAPAS).
The crying time of the infant was also evaluated.
Data were analyzed using independent samples t test, repeated measurement and Chi-square test.
Results of the study suggest that music intervention in the heel lance process can be used to reduce the pain of neonates, reduce the duration of the procedure and reduce the crying time of the infants.
Although heart sounds are also among the alternatives, the music intervention is preferred by mothers and may be more effective.
It is recommended to perform further pain minimizing studies in neonatal period by creating different music scales for neonates from different cultures."

The impact of early experience on brain development is well-established. In recent years, intensive early intervention has shown promise in mitigating the adverse effects of early experience in high-risk infants and toddlers. One example of such intervention is the NIH-funded Caregiver Skills Training (CST) initiative. CST is a family-centered, in-home parent development intervention designed to improve early behavioral and language outcomes for young children who are at-risk for negative outcomes. Caregivers of young children with risk profiles are trained to use evidence-based strategies to positively influence the children in their care. Results of CST have been positive, with reports of improved parenting, improved child behavioral and language outcomes, and improved child cognition. In fact, two randomized clinical trials of the CST intervention show promise with respect to reducing the risk of later-occurring mental health and behavioral challenges. While there is strong support for CST, many agencies lack the resources to offer such an intervention. This includes lack of staff time to administer the intervention and lack of funds to send staff members to face-to-face training.  In light of these limitations, the investigators have created a remote version of this intervention model. In this study, the investigators' objective is to offer to two agencies the opportunity to participate in either the remote CST model or the more traditional in-person CST model. To accomplish this, the investigators will compare the relative efficacy of CST when implemented remotely versus in-person. Staff will be trained in the CST curriculum and the process by which they facilitate CST groups. They will also receive supervision throughout the duration of the study. The investigators expect that the skills CST imparts to caregivers will be comparable regardless of how the staff was trained. The investigators also expect that the implementation of CST via a remote modality will be as effective as the traditional in-person model."

Physiotherapists play a pivotal role in functional rehabilitation of musculoskeletal disorders. Current practice is based mostly on empirical evidence; despite being evidence-based, our current practice have many limitations. For this reason, physiotherapist must have a critical interpretation of new scientific evidence that could change the practice and improve the clinical outcome. Recently, one new physical therapy intervention has emerged: Transcranial direct electrical stimulation (tDCS). This treatment presents some advantages and limitations that may vary depending on the intensity of the stimulation and the duration between stimulation sessions. It seems to be an effective therapy for the relief of neuropathic pain, but there seems to be controversy when it comes to the chronic joint pain pathologies. However, the physiotherapeutic approach to the rehabilitation of chronic shoulder pain syndrome (SDS) usually includes the use of non-pharmacological techniques such as exercises of specific strengthening of the shoulder muscles, or therapeutic exercises of the scapular and glenohumeral complex. In this case, therapeutic exercise has a good level of scientific evidence (in the long and medium term) and is highly recommended by the official practice guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). The aim of this clinical trial is to explore whether the addition of transcranial direct electrical stimulation (tDCS) to a standardized physiotherapy program (consisting of specific exercises of strengthening and scapular repositioning) in patients with unilateral pain of the shoulder and disability, improves the functional disability of such patients, as well as their pain intensity, compared to another physiotherapy program plus placebo (sham-tDCS) transcranial electrical direct stimulation and standard physiotherapy.."

Hypothesis: There is a trend of increase in verbal scores in ASD children receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) when compared to controls who did not receive HBOT.
Objective: To evaluate any association between HBOT and verbal skills in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
Study Design: This was a study designed to retrospectively determine any association between HBOT and any changes in verbal scores in children with ASD who received applied behavioral analysis at Oxford Recovery Center (ORC). All children aged 2 to 17 years, diagnosed with ASD who completed a verbal test every six months (either Verbal Behavior Milestones Assessment and Placement Program or the Assessment of Basic Language and Learning Skills), received applied behavioral analysis at ORC were screened for inclusion. Some of whom had elected to receive HBOT (at least 40 sessions for 60 minutes at 2.0 ATA).
Methods: For each subject, the change in verbal scores from baseline was compared between the HBOT and control groups. Both verbal scores were collected through chart review. The primary objective was to observe the change of verbal scores between subjects who received HBOT and those subjects who did not.
A total of 106 verbal scores at baseline and change scores were collected during this study with 13 subjects receiving hyperbaric oxygen. 3 subjects who elected to receive HBOT had their scores excluded because they received less than 40 sessions. 10 subjects completed the study of 12 sessions (1 month of treatment) or 20 sessions (2 months of treatment). 26 subjects did not receive HBOT and completed the study (1 month). There were 25 subjects in the control group who were only assessed with 1 score each. Data from 8 subjects were incomplete (2 were only evaluated at baseline for verbal testing and had no available change score). There were 32 subjects in the study population. 8 subjects were discharged during the course of the study for behavioral reasons.
The 3 subjects who elected to receive HBOT had their scores excluded because they received less than 40 sessions. 10 subjects completed the study of 12 sessions (1 month of treatment) or 20 sessions (2 months of treatment). 26 subjects did not receive HBOT and completed the study (1 month). There were 25 subjects in the control group who were only assessed with 1 score each. Data from 8 subjects were incomplete (2 were only evaluated at baseline for verbal testing and had no available change score). There were 32 subjects in the study population. 8 subjects were discharged during the course of the study for behavioral reasons. The average number of HBO sessions was 34.84 ± 7.01. 63 hyperbaric sessions were completed over the course of the trial.
The control group did not receive HBOT and scored an average of 31.53 ± 21.87 on the VBMAPP and 54.53 ± 18.38 on the ABLLS. The study group (those that received hyperbaric oxygen therapy) scored an average of 32.01 ± 25.18 on the VBMAPP and 55.61 ± 22.98 on the ABLLS.
The study group's verbal scores change from baseline (using the VBMAPP) was an average of 1.41 ± 15.38 and 2.68 ± 19.05 on the ABLLS. The control group's median change scores were both zero (VBMAPP= 0, ABLLS= 0). There was no statistical difference in the change from baseline verbal scores between the control group and study group on the ABLLS (p=0.456) or VBMAPP (p=0.057) (Fig 6). There was no statistical significant association between treatment group vs. control group (chi square test X2= 0.03, d. f., = 0.01, p=0.889) (Fig 3).
All subjects that were enrolled completed the study without any notable side effects or adverse reactions. There were no deaths occurred during the course of the study. There were no complications noted by the treating physicians including no changes in ASA Physical Status and no complications requiring hospitalization. Based on the data there was no statistical significant association found between HBOT and change in verbal scores in"

Burns are the fourth cause of mortality after trauma, cancers and cardiovascular diseases. Burned patients suffer both functional sequelae and cosmetic difficulties. The management of hand burns remains a challenge. In our practice, releasing incisions are performed to reduce the dead space and the surface burned. The main advantage of this technique is to reduce tension at graft application to increase survival and avoid scarring contractures. However, some patients may complain of functional sequelae such as hand weakness, limitation of range of motion and finger stiffness. The objective of this study is to describe the cosmetic and functional sequelae associated with hand burns requiring releasing incision. The objective of functional and aesthetic score is to have a quick assessment of patient hand condition and return to activities after hand deep burns that required releasing incisions."

The Stanford Plant-based Educational Study (PLANT) is a randomized, delayed intervention trial testing a flexible, multimodal WFPBD educational program for 6 weeks for providers at Stanford in any department. The trial is looking to determine if the intervention changes provider and patient mindset and practice of WFPBD in the context of diabetes care. To date, no one has tested this hypothesis. Providers at Stanford and other institutions have shown interest in WFPBD as a dietary strategy, however, there have been no systematic methods for physician adoption of this diet. We will measure changes in Diet ID score, a novel tool assessing diet type/quality, and assess mindset towards adopting WFPBD using the validated Survey of Mindset, motivation, and confidence for behavior change in the Transtheoretical model. The study will consist of a pre- and post survey and a WFPBD educational program. We will assess measures of motivation and confidence for adoption of a WFPBD and for prescribing a WFPBD to patients. Intervention: Participants will receive an educational intervention on whole food plant-based nutrition that will last 6 weeks and include an interactive didactic session, cooking classes, and weekly emails with suggested resources and activities including movies, recipes, and websites. Providers will then be surveyed at week 6 to assess if the intervention changed their provider and patient practices."

Rates of early postpartum depressive symptoms following childbirth are particularly high among Black birthing parents. Furthermore, in the U.S. most postpartum mental health care receives low rates of engagement (e.g., <20% accept referrals), with Black parents experiencing the lowest rates of engagement in maternal mental health care. Recent theoretical contributions within the field of developmental psychopathology link parental depressive symptoms in the postpartum period to an associated decrease in caregiver responsivity, which influences infant emotional regulation. The proposed study seeks to build on the evidence of short-term, manualized group psychotherapy, developed for Black postpartum women by Dr. Brody, for the management of depression and anxiety symptoms in the postpartum period. The primary aim of the study is to adapt the 12-session mentalizing-focused group therapy, known as Connecting and Reflecting Experience (CARE), for the support of parents and their children from birth through 12-months of age. The proposed study will assess the efficacy of this group-based parenting support intervention for the management of depression, anxiety, parenting stress, and parent-child bonding within the first year of the child's life."

Introduction: Despite substantial gains in women's health around the world, outcomes have not improved in Black/African American (Black AA) pregnant people (including Black Latinas), who continue to experience high rates of adverse maternal health outcomes in general, and preterm birth, severe hypertension and its complications, and pregnancy-related cardiovascular events in particular. Maternal medical mistrust in this population is common and has direct impact on adverse maternal health outcomes.
Objectives: This proposal aims to develop and test a novel integrated prenatal care model where a community doula is partnered with the prenatal healthcare provider team to deliver perinatal care in the Black AA population. Aim 1: Develop an integrated prenatal care model of medical providers and community doulas in Southeastern Wisconsin Approach: The investigators will conduct six focus groups with Black/AA birthing people and prenatal healthcare providers to elicit feedback on models of doula/medical provider integration with the overarching aim of building trust and improving maternal health outcomes.
Aim 2: Compare the effectiveness of the integrated prenatal care model to standard prenatal care in improving healthcare engagement and trust and reducing adverse maternal outcomes Approach: In a two-arm randomized controlled trial conducted at Froedtert and MCW, the investigators will randomize Black/AA pregnant people to BUNDLE or standard prenatal care.
Aim 3: Disseminate findings to scholarly and community-based forums and actively pursue opportunities for systems- and policy-level change Approach: The investigators will actively disseminate the findings to policymakers, the healthcare system, and community leaders to implement the developed strategies to sustain successful program outcomes through policy changes at the system and statewide level by advocating for doula coverage and healthcare system sustainability of the integrated prenatal care model.

BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is defined as low back pain lasting for at least 3 months and is still present on some days. Massage therapy has been shown to decrease pain and disability in patients with CLBP in several studies. Connective tissue massage (CTM) applied only on the lower extremities has shown effective results in this group of patients, and classical massage (CM) has shown effective results in patients with CLBP. In this study the aim was to compare the effectiveness of CTM, CM and control group on pain, functional status and quality of life in patients with CLBP.

METHODS: Participants were recruited from among the patients who applied to the physical therapy and rehabilitation outpatient clinic of Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University Faculty of Health Sciences between April 2020-June 2020. Thirty patients were randomly divided into three groups. Group I (n = 10) was given connective tissue massage intervention group . This technique includes a series of special movements called METS: Mobilization - Elongation - Tension - Separation. Each of them is performed in both directions and is performed for 30 seconds. Group II (n = 10) was given classical massage (CM) intervention group. In this technique, patients were positioned lying supine with their upper body and arms covered with a towel. The treatment began with a general stroking movement by using the entire back and upper leg. It continues by applying an up and down massage to the lumbar region. These strokes are performed in the direction of the spine. After the 1st month of the research, measurements were taken again.

FINDINGS: The results revealed that there was a statistically significant improvement in pain (VAS), lumbar forward bending and sit and reach flexibility (MST), trunk mobility/flexibility (SRT), daily activities/living functions (BPFS), functional disability (RMDQ) and physical function component (SF-36) in Connective Tissue Massage (CTM) and Classical Massage (CM) patients compared to the control group.

IMPLICATIONS: Connective Tissue Massage and Classical Massage are effective in improving pain, mobility/flexibility, disability and the quality of life of patients with chronic low back pain. The findings of this study provide practical recommendations for future applications and future research in this area . Based on the passage above, generate the response to the following quesion or instruction: Can you summarize the findings of the trial on the effectiveness of CTM and CM in improving pain, mobility, and quality of life in patients with CLBP?"

Colorectal cancer (CRC) remains the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. Despite screening rates below national targets, Veterans Administration (VA) patients are more likely to be up-to-date with CRC screening when compared with the general population. In our institution's Gastroenterology outpatient clinic, the current overall adherence rate to surveillance colonoscopy is 58% up-to-45-days after initial appointment date. The purpose of the current study is to examine the impact of a reminder/assistance phone call and text message intervention on increased adherence to scheduled colonoscopy appointments in patients due for surveillance colonoscopy.
Patients (≥ 45 years of age) due for a surveillance colonoscopy will be randomized to either an Intervention arm (receive text messages/phone calls) or No Intervention arm. Participants in the Intervention arm will receive a series of instructional and motivational text messages, which will be sent starting 7-14 days before and until the day of the colonoscopy procedure. Participants in the No Intervention arm will not receive text messages. The primary goal of the text messages is to assist with bowel preparation and remind patients of their scheduled appointment time. In addition to collecting data on attendance at scheduled appointments and clinical outcomes, the study will evaluate patient satisfaction with the text message messages using a survey developed specifically for the study. It is theorized that the use of reminders/assistance messages will increase adherence to recommended screening programs among patients due for surveillance colonoscopy."

Incomplete miscarriage is defined as early miscarriage with persistent intrauterine material on ultrasound. These retained products of conception may be responsible for persistent metrorrhagia and endometritis. This symptomatology often accentuates the psychological distress of patients mourning the pregnancy. Incomplete miscarriages are mainly managed by the gynecological emergency department. The recommendations of the Collège National des Gynécologues et Obstétriciens Français (CNGOF) suggest as a first line of treatment: either surgical management or expectant care. The choice between the two is left to the discretion of the doctor and the patient. There are no clear recommendations as to the choice between hysteroscopy and aspiration. Within the teams, the choice is often made according to the habits and protocols of the service, according to the equipment available and the skills of the gynaecologists.
Aim: The main objective is to compare the efficacy of management by endo-uterine aspiration versus management by hysteroscopy of trophoblastic retention after early miscarriage, at 6 weeks after surgery, by endovaginal ultrasound. The secondary objectives are: the comparison of the rate of complications of the two techniques, during and after surgery the comparison of the rate of recourse to a second line surgical management between the two arms, the comparison of the rate of synechiae diagnosed by hysterosonography between the two techniques at 6 weeks after surgery, the comparison of the time to conception in the two arms during the 2 years after surgery the comparison of the fertility rate at 2 years after surgery in the two arms. Methods: This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, open-label, two-arms, parallel therapeutic clinical trial comparing hysteroscopy versus endouterine aspiration for the management of trophoblastic retention after spontaneous miscarriage. Patients will be randomized (110 per arm) after verification of eligibility criteria and signature of consent, on the day of the operation: Arm A: 110 patients treated by operative hysteroscopy Arm B: 110 patients treated by endo-uterine aspiration Randomization will be stratified by center, age (<35 years, 35 years and over), size of trophoblastic retention (<30mm, 30mm and over) and scheduled by random size block. It will be centralized (Ennov-clinical software) and parameterized by the Unité́ de Recherche Clinique & Biostatistiques of the Montpellier University Hospital. Statistics: The effectiveness of operative hysteroscopy is expected to be 100%, and that of aspiration 90%. To show this difference with an alpha risk of 5%, and with a power of 90%, 98 patients per arm will have to be analysed (exact binomial distribution calculation, epiR package of R implemented in biostatgv). To take into account a 10% loss of sight rate, 220 patients will be recruted. Patients will be included in the study on the morning of the procedure, after verification of the selection criteria. The expected number of lost to follow-up is estimated at 10%; in fact, the main criterion is evaluated relatively early (6 weeks), in patients having a desire for pregnancy and therefore relatively compliant, the rate of lost to follow-up will be a fairly low. A flow-chart will be constructed to describe the evolution of the populations during the study. It will detail the causes of non-inclusion and the causes of loss to follow-up. All study data will be described according to the randomization arm, in the randomized population: mean, standard deviation, median and quartiles, extrema and number of missing data for quantitative variables, numbers and percentages of each modality for qualitative data. The clinical comparability of the randomized population and the ITT population for the primary endpoint will be assessed. Primary analysis: The uterine vacuity rate will be compared between the two arms in the ITT population for the primary endpoint by a Chi-square test or by a Fisher exact test if the conditions for Chi-square validity are not met. The significance level was set at 5%, two-sided.

This study will investigate ways humans make decisions by asking them to draw balls with computerized tasks. In these tasks, participants will be presented with two differently filled jars, one with more blue balls and one with more red balls. They can then make inference from the current jar to determine the colors of the next pair of jars.
The goal is to see how people make decisions when presented with these kinds of jars, and how they can use the information in them to better understand future outcomes.
The study hypotheses are that:
1. In short-term inference, visual and/or haptic cues increase decision making speed.
2. In long-term inference, visual and/or haptic cues decrease decision making speed relative to short-term and single-trial inference.
3. In multi-timescale inference, subjects can use short-term and long-term information to make the best prediction."

Lemborexant is a novel insomnia medication that has shown promise in helping adults achieve a restorative sleep. There is a growing body of literature indicating that this drug has a favourable side effect profile compared to conventional sleep aids, including benzodiazepines, and may have less of an impact on night-time blood pressure. There is no literature on the use of lemborexant for the treatment of insomnia in adults with dementia. Insomnia can wreak havoc on the lives of people living with an early onset dementia, their families, and caregivers since they often lack insight into the extent of their dysfunctional sleep patterns. Many of the treatment options for insomnia in dementia have high incidences of rebound insomnia. With lemborexant, clinicians may be able to treat insomnia without precipitating the problem they are trying to solve. Given the benefits lemborexant may provide, it behooves clinicians to consider it as a reasonable alternative to conventional sedatives prescribed for insomnia in older adults with dementia. A prospective trial of lemborexant will evaluate its tolerability, safety, and effectiveness in individuals that have been diagnosed with an early onset dementia."

Patients suffering from KOA in early stage with knee pain lasting for more than 6 months and whose X-rays show grade 2 or 3 osteoarthritis are eligible. The study is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the Sinomenine group and the glucocorticoid group, each receiving a single intra-articular injection every 4 months. 24 months after enrollment, all enrolled patients will be evaluated by X-rays of the affected limb, questionnaires and MRI of the affected knee (only the patients in Beijing TCM hospital). 
All eligible subjects will return to the outpatient clinics of all research centers twice a month for 3 months and 0.5 months after each injection for assessment of their conditions and adverse reactions. The final follow-up will be in the 24th month after the first injection.
The primary outcome measures are the change in the total WOMAC score from baseline, change in tibial cartilage volume from baseline, improvement in OA symptoms, improvement in lower extremity function, and improvement in quality of life. A total of 120 patients will be recruited, taking into account the possibility of loss to follow-up.

Neck pain is one of the most common and painful musculoskeletal conditions. As for most other musculoskeletal disorders, nonspecific neck pain is multifactorial. A variety of different types of exercise have been explored to treat chronic nonspecific neck pain, including low-to-moderate intensity aerobic exercise, high intensity aerobic exercise, stretching exercise and muscular strength exercises and isometrics. However, the most effective form of exercise as a method of rehabilitation non-specific neck pain is unknown reflecting its complexity and more research is require. The rationale of the study is to compare the effects of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy on pain, range of motion and functional disability in chronic nonspecific neck pain. The main purpose of myofascial decompression therapy and positional release therapy is to release the cervical trigger points, improving end ranges and lengthening of muscle. MDT helps draw toxins out of the muscles and to the superficial veins to be removed by the body. This leads to decreased pain and tension in the tissues. The ultimate goal is to achieve pain free end ranges and flexibility of muscle in nonspecific neck pain patients."

Complications of stoma occur commonly after rectal surgery with extraction of specimen via ileostomy; the most common one is obstruction, accounting for 52%-81%) of all stoma-related complications, of which abdominal skin necrosis is the most common cause, ranging from 11%~35%. The current international standard of stoma closure is the skin-fold method. This method is simple without any special equipment, but stoma complications are significantly higher than that treated by using a prosthesis made of silastic rubber (HANS) and the Ileostomy Dumpling suture method.
The Dumpling suture method with a double-layer sutures that are inserted radially from the stoma opening, making the sutures like Chinese small dumplings, which is expected to decrease the incidence of skin complications. This study is a randomized controlled study to compare the incidence of stoma complications between Dumpling suture method and conventional suture method in rectal cancer surgery with stoma, and evaluate the effect of Dumpling suture method in promoting early wound healing, relieving pain, and improving quality of life of patients with stoma.
For the inclusion criteria: the patients should be scheduled for rectal cancer operation with stoma. There are also limitations such as serious systemic infection, immunosuppressive disease, low expectations of survival more than 6 months, and unsuitable subjects. 
The intervention method is to use traditional suture method or Dumpling suture method; the former is a process similar to traditional suturing with no prosthesis used. Whereas the Dumpling suture method is to use 3-0 silk sutures progressively to close the incision at the lower right abdomen, leaving a gap at the upper and lower edges of the incision. The suture needles are inserted from the middle to the edge of the abdominal wound, and then the needle is pushed out from the bottom along the skin fold towards the abdominal cavity. This is designed to facilitate the reduction of stoma wound edge incision and hiding it.
The research design is a single-center, single-blind, randomized parallel control trial. The study evaluates the incidence rate of stoma, stoma DET score, stoma pain score, quality of life score, stoma revision and restitution rate, and wound healing.

Research has shown impaired cognition and instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) in PD patients (Pfeffer et al., 1995; Leurgans et al., 1999; Schneider et al., 2011). The impact of cognitive impairment on everyday functioning depends on the complexity of activities performed by cognitively impaired patients (Ivory et al., 2007). Several tools have been used to assess the impact of neurodegenerative diseases on daily life (Schmitt-Sorend et al., 2002; Lange et al., 2010). However, the applicability of these measures in PD needs to be assessed. Our goal is to determine how well motor symptom severity and cognition predict difficulties in IADL function in PD patients. Therefore, we aim to investigate the correlation of performance in several motor subscales (including freezing of gait), cognitive subscales, and IADL scores. Based on our results, we will develop a questionnaire to assess the difficulties in everyday IADL performance in PD patients. These results will also help to understand which cognitive domains are affected when motor problems occur."

Myofibrillation after succinylcholine injection can cause anesthesia patients to be unable to breathe, and even death. The incidence of anesthesia-related myofibrillation is relatively low, but anesthesiologists have to deal with many patients, causing a large number of patients to be at risk of anesthesia-myofibrillation. The incidence of myofibrillation associated with neuromuscular blockade is directly related to the dose of succinylcholine applied. The incidence of myofibrillation will be increased by the dose used. Nowadays, when anesthesiologists need to prevent myofibrillation, they generally use rocuronium as a prophylactic agent. Rocuronium has excellent muscle relaxation, a short action time and few cardiac side effects. However, the doses used in different age groups are different. The incidence of myofibrillation in the elderly is higher than that in young people. The dose of rocuronium in the elderly is higher than that in young people. Based on preliminary studies, we designed this study to observe the minimum effective dose of rocuronium in preventing myofibrillation in different age groups of patients. We hope that the minimum effective dose of rocuronium can be used to prevent myofibrillation in different age groups in the future."

Pollutants, particulate and volatile organic compounds and microplastics, are ubiquitous in the environment and have been implicated in carcinogenesis, inflammation, and oxidation.
Evidence has emerged recently on the role of air pollution, particulate and volatile organic compounds, in the development of atherosclerosis through the recruitment on monocyte and the promotion of the proinflammatory and oxidative phenotype of atheroma. Moreover, several recent reports suggest a possible role of microplastics in the pathogenesis of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disorders. The investigators postulate that these pollutants may act via similar pathways.
The aim of the study is to investigate whether the presence and the burden of volatile organic compounds and microplastics from atherosclerotic plaques would be associated with major clinical outcomes in patients undergoing surgery for the removal of carotid stenosis. To this purpose, 300 consecutive patients with asymptomatic disease will be enlisted and will be followed up for 2 years after surgery. Carotid plaques will be retrieved with high precision during the procedure through micro-scissors or atherectomy catheters and will then be analysed for the presence and the amount of organic pollutants. Corroboratory analyses will be performed by electron microscopy to identify the pollutants under the microscope.
Plaque-derived samples will also be analysed through immunohistochemistry, ELISAs, and Western Blot to quantify inflammatory markers and assess the plaque stability. In addition, patients will be categorized (post-hoc) as having polluted plaques (having detectable levels of at least one microplastics) or non-polluted plaques, and Cox regression analysis will be used to examine the association between the presence of pollutants and the composite outcome, adjusted for age, sex, BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidaemia, and smoking. Among those with polluted plaques, the burden of microplastics will be used to categorize patients into terciles, and Cox models, adjusted for the same variables, will be run to explore the relationship between the burden of microplastics and the outcome. In this manner, the study will be capable of exploring the role of these environmental pollutants in the clinical evolution of patients with atherosclerosis.
Patients will be further followed up and monitored for the incidence of a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality. The groups of patients with polluted plaques vs non-polluted plaques will be compared for the expression of all these markers.
At present, the effects of environmental pollutants on the incidence of cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis remain unknown. By providing novel insights on the role of these pollutants, either individually or as a group, in atherosclerotic plaques, it may provide new insight to identify patients with greater risk of cardiovascular events.  The insights obtained from the study may help to identify new therapeutic targets and guide future interventions to improve cardiovascular health.

Inclusion Criteria: patients with carotid stenosis (according to North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial classification ) enlisted to undergo carotid endarterectomy for extracranial high-grade (>70%) internal carotid artery stenosis.

Exclusion Criteria: All patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of heart failure, valvular defects, malignant neoplasms, or secondary causes of hypertension will be excluded from the study.

Transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is a palliative therapy for unresectable liver metastases in patients with colorectal cancer. It is performed by the transarterial delivery of small microspheres made of medical glass. To date, therapeutic decision-making based on effective tumor doses in TARE treatments is based solely on the size of the tumor. However, we now have a precise, high-resolution technique that allows to obtain additional important information about the state and the behavior of tumors at very low doses of radiation.
The investigators propose to conduct a national multicenter retrospective study to determine the relationship between effective tumor dose and healthy tissue dose on the response of patients to TARE treatment in liver metastases of colorectal cancer. This will help to find a correlation between dose delivered to metastatic lesions and their response to treatment. To determine this, the investigators will examine the effective tumor dose and, consequently, the effective healthy tissue dose in 18 patients.
Additionally, the investigators would like to study the response to treatment in the first six months post-TARE in 108 patients with at least one additional follow-up PET-CT examination. Based on a comparison of dose-response and dose-toxicity relationships after TARE in these patients, it is intended to calculate the response-effective dose."

The performance of conventional glass ionomer cements (GICs) are inferior compared to resin composites due to their poor mechanical and physical properties for restoration of carious cavity. However, recent studies revealed that improvement in GICs can be obtained by radiant heat transfer. This study aims to evaluate the influence of light-emitting diode (LED) radiant heat energy transfer enhancement on clinical performance of high-caries-risk patients, restoring the carious cavity with chemically cured conventional glass ionomer after 12 months. Eighteen healthy patients aged 21 to 45 years, with two oclusso- mesial cavities will be selected . The patients will be randomly divided into two groups; Group M1 will be restored with chemically cured conventional GICs (KetacTM Universal AplicapTM) without any enhancement (M1 group), while group M2 will be restored with chemically cured conventional GICs enhanced with LED radiant heat (M2 group). The clinician who performed the restorations was blinded to type of enhancement used. Restoration of all the selected cavities will be performed following manufacturer instruction and all clinical evaluations will be carried out using the FDI criteria at baseline (T0), 12 months (T1) and 24 months (T2). Data collected from this study may provide evidence in predicting the success rate of conventional glass ionomer after enhancement with LED radiant heat energy transfer."

The FAPO SI³ digital telemonitoring platform aimed to provide patients with a wearable device to track post-operative activity, heart rate, and sleep. Patients were required to monitor their heart rhythm through the smartwatch, as well as answer simple questions and respond to educational messages displayed on their smartphone app. Remote monitoring was conducted through the cloud platform, and alerts were automatically sent to the physician when abnormal readings were detected. If alerts were raised, a protocol for clinical intervention was determined with guidance from the telemedicine physician. In the six-month follow-up evaluation, the control group did not differ from the telemonitored group in rehospitalization rate, attendance at scheduled consultations, extra occurences, or any other outcome parameter assessed. The overall findings showed that the platform was efficient, with good participant adherence and engagement throughout the study. No patient developed any complications, and the 30-day evaluation of the primary outcome, which assessed rehospitalization rates, revealed no difference between standard care and telemedicine telemonitoring. However, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up are needed to determine the long-term impact of the intervention."

The study falls within the scope of the HSMonitor project, a pre-commercial tender for the development of telematics solutions aimed at optimising patient health status and disease management. Specifically, the aim of this study is to test whether the adoption of HSMonitor solutions by healthcare professionals and patients improves the management of patients with high blood pressure. This will be a randomised controlled trial where patients with hypertension will be randomised either to one of the two digital solutions or to standard care. The present pilot study is planned to be carried out within the framework of the EU project HSMonitor - Pre-commercial Procurement of innovative ICT-enabled monitoring to improve health status and optimize hypertension care (Grant Agreement Nr. 856698). The two solutions are referred to as: Solution 1 - HSmartBPM (developed by a supplier consortium led by GNOMON) Solution 2 - HyperHealth (developed by a supplier consortium led by TECH4CARE)
Inclusion Criteria: Diagnosed with essential hypertension (>140/90 mmHg or normal BP with antihypertensive treatment) Basic ICT knowledge and ability to access the internet at home and on mobile devices aged 18+ ability to provide written informed consent, giving informed consent. written informed consent Exclusion Criteria: inability to consent chronic renal replacement therapy (haemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis or transplantation) or if, at baseline, there is a history of active malignancy within the last five years pregnancy illiterate younger than 18 years being a prisoner being institutionalized the patient is mentally or psychiatrically ill the patient has barriers to understand the implications of participation to the study the patient is critically ill or dying the patient is extremely poor the patient has a learning disability the patient is sedated or unconscious the patient is a refugee with no permanent permission to stay the patient does not have a good command of the language the patient has problems in cognitive, juridical, and deferential dimensions.

The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomised controlled trial focusing on screening for liver disease. The trial intends to invite participants to liver stiffness measurement (Transient Elastography), blood sampling and a leaflet on alcohol-related disease. The participants are recruited on their way to treatment for their alcohol use disorder. We aim to assess whether it is possible to conduct additional investigations on patients with alcohol use disorder and the effect of this additional screening on alcohol consumption and liver disease progression. We will invite around 500 individuals aged ≥ 18 years to liver stiffness measurement (Transient Elastography). Individuals will be enrolled in a randomised controlled trial with random assignment to either a control or an intervention group. Participants allocated to the control group will serve as a comparison group. The investigators have no knowledge of the group-assignment until all groups are constructed.
All participants get an invitation by mail inviting them to participate in the study and an invitation to the first intervention or control visit. The study participants meet either in a public place or at the clinic if invited for liver stiffness measurement or blood sampling. Participants will receive a brochure on their alcohol-related liver disease, and participants who were invited for liver stiffness measurement and/or blood sampling get this as part of the control- or intervention group. In the intervention-arm we will conduct Transient Elastography or blood sampling if the participant is randomised to this arm. Based on the liver stiffness measurement results a discussion on alcohol consumption is held with the investigators. Afterwards the participant is offered participation in a screening program at one of the centres. At 6- and 12-months follow-up, all participants will receive a survey by mail. The same data is collected from all participants at all follow-up data collections, including an alcohol screen based on the AUDIT-C. Thus, this will form the follow-up period of 12 months."

Study of the Value of Trio Exome Sequencing in the Etiological Assessment of Specific Non-syndromic Language and Learning Disorders
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Introduction: Despite the progress made in the genetics of SLLDs, the genetic mutations are identified before in more than 50% of people. It is therefore possible that these mutations represent the first step of a path towards the development of personalized medicine in the sector. There are however some rare syndromes where progression is slower and less frequent than in the rest of the population. Indeed, among a cohort of 100 probands with SLLDs, 84% of cases are not syndromic. Among the 16% of syndromic subjects without phenotypic abnormalities, about half are already diagnosed. A first group of syndromes corresponds to known syndromes such as Fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome, which are more often described and recognized. A second group of syndromes corresponds to syndromes of a less recurrent pathophysiological origin, including the mitochondrial encephalomyopathies, for example. Other rare syndromes, less pathogenically known like Rett syndrome, represent less than 5% of severe SLLDs. It is therefore unlikely to detect these diagnoses by a whole genome or whole exome sequencing (WES). These SLLDs are thus considered as non-syndromic, even if they are often characterized by several anomalies on neuropsychological assessments suggesting the possible contribution, even if minor, of a variant present on the genome or in mitochondria. The goal of our project is to identify the genetic cause(s) of SLLDs. For this purpose, trio exome sequencing will be carried out in a cohort of 400 SLLD patients whose phenotype is characterized by neuropsychological examinations, including the use of specific scales (language, reading, calculation, non-verbal intelligence, memory, executive function, visual perception, motor and visuo-motor praxia ), but also a battery of tests in the health fields and the psychosocial field (assessment of the child's behavioral and emotional profile and the psycho-educational impact of the SLLD). A second battery of biological tests will be carried out simultaneously: array-CGH and karyotype as a first step in a systematic form, and exome sequencing as a second step for patients with a negative array-CGH, an FMR1 mutation or a mitochondrial pathology with a non-diagnostic array CGH. A positive genetic result (presence of a single or multi-gene mutation) will mean that this mutation is the one responsible for the phenotype in question. If the genetic analysis does not reveal a significant result, phenotypic data will have to be completed by expert medical and psychological examinations. A biological study of exomes (exome sequencing) and mitochondrial DNA will be carried out in 400 children and their parents or siblings. This strategy, which involves the analysis of the genetic status of the three people concerned (index case + parents), offers the opportunity to obtain a result likely to provide an answer in the case of a negative result on a trio or on specific syndromes (Fragile X, Down). The study will be carried out on parents and a child for whom they are parents. The index case is defined as any child suffering from a severe learning disorder (major educational support in school, learning disorder of reading or arithmetic or major difficulties in language or non verbal communication) and a neuropsychological or speech therapy assessment that certifies an abnormality. The index case must have one genetic parent or sibling who will be selected as biological parents for this study. The exome sequence will bring a double advantage: to detect a variant responsible for the phenotype, and to test its pathogenicity, even if it is not the only responsible. This will help better understand the mechanisms of inheritance and identify familial, familial + unknown genetic causes. The analysis of exomes includes the study of the 20 000 genes, making it possible to identify the abnormalities responsible for the learning disability. The sequencing and processing of 400 trios will be carried out by the Molecular Genetics-Cancer platform of the University Hospital Saint-Etienne - CHU of Saint-Etienne (the largest platform for biomolecular analysis in France). Biological samples will be transported and stored in this center. The medical, neuro-psychological and genetic data will be collected and"

The use of antibody therapy for cancer treatment has been increasing to help improve the survival rate of cancer patients. However, existing drugs cannot target the tumor to accurately kill the cancer cells while avoiding damage to normal cells. To solve this problem, scientists are developing antibody drugs that can recognize and attack specific tumor cells while sparing normal cells. CLDN18.2 antibody drug is one of the anti-tumor treatment drugs currently in clinical development. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the drug CLDN18.2 has anti-tumor effects and can be used safely in patients with advanced solid tumors."

The incidence of Retinopathy of Prematurity increases in parallel with the increase in the incidence of preterm infants and new technologies in neonatology. There have been studies on the effect of different methods in reducing pain and increasing comfort during the examination. This research is a stratified randomized controlled experimental trial study, which is a follow-up of the pain and comfort studies published in the literature, in which the music listened by the preterm infants during the retinopathy of premature examination carried out for the first time in our country was used as an analgesic and comforting method. Premature babies aged 28-36 weeks whose birth weight is ≤2000 grams and who are admitted to the neonatal unit are included in the study. It is planned to include 60 preterm infants who received at least one ROP examination in the neonatal unit within the first 40 days of life. The experimental group consists of premature babies who will be played different types of music during the ROP examination. Premature babies will play The Happiest Baby voice recorder for 45-50 decibels, which consists only of intrauterine sound, and the rain stick music group in the experimental group. Data will be collected with interviews and questionnaires from their guardians and data obtained from the recordings taken with the recording devices will be analyzed in the neonatal unit."

Postoperative sleep is one of the most important factors in postoperative recovery and an important part of the sleep/wake cycle. Although sleep difficulties occur in the perioperative period as short-term or long-term, sleep disorders can impair physical, cognitive and emotional functions, complicate postoperative recovery, and increase mortality and morbidity rates. It is necessary to determine the factors that affect postoperative sleep disorders for an early intervention. In surgery, the type of anesthesia is also important in preoperative sleep assessment. It was thought that the method of epidural anesthesia in orthopedic surgery may not cause sleep disturbance. Recent studies have shown that regional anesthesia is more advantageous than general anesthesia in terms of postoperative sleep disturbance and pain control. It is not clear whether regional anesthesia affects the circadian rhythm. The hypothesis of the investigator is that the difference in pain control between the anesthesia types plays a role in postoperative sleep quality.

The investigators hypothesize that regional anesthesia does not disrupt the circadian rhythm compared to general anesthesia, is more successful in pain control, and thus provides better sleep quality for patients. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate postoperative sleep quality in patients who undergo total hip arthroplasty with regional or general anesthesia and the secondary objective is to evaluate the effect of anesthesia type on circadian rhythm disruption."

Background: Atogepant is an anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) monoclonal antibody approved as a preventive treatment in episodic migraine.
Objective: This study will assess if atogepant can reduce migraine headache days and overall frequency of headache days with oral dosing.
Study design: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in Japanese subjects with episodic migraine. Following a placebo run-in period (3 weeks), subjects were randomized to atogepant dose A (75 mg QD), dose B (255 mg QD) or dose C (505 mg QD), or placebo for 12 weeks. After Week 12, subjects in the placebo group will continue to receive placebo, while subjects in the atogepant dose groups will continue at their randomly assigned dose of atogepant for an additional 12 weeks. The primary outcome measures were the change from baseline in the mean monthly migraine days, and the percentage of participants achieving ≥ 50% reduction in the 3-month average of monthly migraine days. The safety of atogepant was also evaluated.
Sample size: A total of approximately 870 participants are planned to be enrolled.
Expected results: The study will determine the efficacy and safety of atogepant in Japanese subjects with episodic migraine for up to 24 weeks in preventing migraine headaches, supporting the evaluation of its potential as a new therapeutic option for this indication. It will serve as a basis for the registration of atogepant for the management of episodic migraine in Japanese patients."

This leads to the need to transfuse massive amounts of RBCs and blood components. This is an important issue because in spite of advances in surgical techniques, immunosuppressive drugs, and intensive care, surgical complications are still the leading causes of death after liver transplantation, and patients are prone to developing transfusion-associated immunomodulation and transfusion-transmitted pathogens in large part due to immunosuppression and transfusion. Blood salvage has been increasingly used in the last two decades. The technique is used for collecting large volumes of blood lost during surgery and processing them to concentrate of red blood cells in a single process. In order to avoid the use of massive amounts of allogenic blood, it seems reasonable to collect blood during organ procurement and to transfuse it back to recipient after processing. However, there are no reports in the literature on the feasibility of collecting such amounts of blood from liver donors.
In this context, the investigators propose a feasibility study to collect donor blood for processing and transfusion to the recipient at the time that the liver is procured from cadaveric donors.
Objective: To collect, process and give back to recipient a large amount of RBCs recovered from liver donor during organ procurement.
Main outcome Measure: The primary outcome is the rate of successful and problem free LT using autologous donor RBC concentrates.
Secondary outcome Measure: To compare the rate of adverse events.
Study design: All adult patients receiving a liver transplant from deceased donors at Fondazione Policlinico A. Gemelli IRCCS (Rome, Italy) will be eligible for the study. All patients will be screened and a written informed consent will be required to enroll patients to the study."

The purpose of this study is to investigate where the 'cut off' is in terms of the minimum of tissue samples needed in order to establish a reliable diagnosis using CESB in women with ROLs. CESB is not part of the regular clinical workflow but has to be performed in case a suspicious lesion is only visible on the enhanced image of a CEM examination. The reason for this study is to improve efficiency of this procedure by enabling us to determine the minimum amount of breast parenchyma that needs to be sampled for an accurate diagnosis.
In this prospective, observational study, CESB is performed in a structured fashion enabling the chronological order of tissue specimens to be determined and correlate such specimens to the final histopathological result. Each lesion will be sampled using a 9-guage VAC, and using a standardized specimen collection protocol, 6 separate cassettes will be filled per specimen. These specimens will subsequently be processed in a standardized fashion, including H&E staining and immunohistochemistry (if necessary). By correlating the final histopathological result with the number of biopsies performed and their order of sampling, we aim to determine the minimum number of biopsies required in case a patient presents with an ROL.
The main outcome measure of this study will be the 'cumulative diagnostic yield per specimen', which will enable us to determine the minimum amount of tissue to be sampled during CESB in order to obtain a reliable diagnosis for women with ROLs. Secondary study endpoints can provide additional information regarding the quality and accuracy of CESB-based diagnoses, including the technical details of the sampling procedure (e.g., rate of technical failures, complication rate), lesion characteristics (e.g., biopsy outcome of benign vs. malignant CESB biopsies, BI-RADS score of the initial CEM examination), as well as patient comfort as assessed by pain scores."

The recent success of targeting Janus Kinase (JAK) in the management of hematological malignancies has led to an increasingly prevalent use of oral JAK inhibitors, such as ibrutinib. Ibrutinib has significantly broadened the treatment armamentarium and improved the outcome of patients with hematological malignancies. Despite the high efficacy, ibrutinib is also associated with several adverse events that may, in some cases, limit its use. Indeed, it has been associated with several cardiovascular complications that may be either cardiovascular risk factors (e.g., hypertension, peripheral artery disease and venous thromboembolism) or cardiovascular complications (e.g., atrial fibrillation). Given the long use of ibrutinib to be expected, it is now essential to address the main challenges of this treatment, which include the development of atrial fibrillation, thromboembolic events, and peripheral artery disease. Although several studies and case series have addressed the incidence of atrial fibrillation or peripheral lesions during ibrutinib treatment, there is still limited data on the frequency and mechanisms of thromboembolic events. Based on these facts, we will establish a cohort including 100 patients treated with ibrutinib for B cell hematological malignancies. During the follow-up period, which will last twelve months after the beginning of ibrutinib treatment, we will monitor their cardiovascular status by ophthalmological examination (to detect atrial fibrillation and retinal changes), a blood test for biomarkers of cardiovascular events, and clinical controls to evaluate the development of cardiovascular complication. As stated by the pharmaco-vigilance reports of ibrutinib, the monitoring of these parameters should help in the detection of both early complications and those related to long-term follow-up. Moreover, it opens new avenues in the field of research by identifying possible markers of predisposition to thromboembolic events in patients under ibrutinib treatment and paving the way for the introduction of preventive measures to increase the safety of ibrutinib. Overall, the establishment of this cohort is expected to benefit both patients and the healthcare delivery system by better monitoring thromboembolic events and to contribute to new ways of thinking about the management of ibrutinib."

Phosphate retention and acid-base disturbances are common in patients with end-stage renal disease on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis, that modifying dialysate bicarbonate does affect both phosphate removal and blood acid-base in HD patients and whether the blood phosphorus concentration change (Δ) can be maintained in the range of 1.0. The hypothesis is based on the fact, that phosphate removal is directly dependent on the blood pH during HD, as dialysate H+ ions compete with phosphate for binding sites in the hemolymph membrane. The study was designed as an open, two period, randomized, controlled, crossover study with three groups. Phosphate removal was significantly lower during the Dbic change than it was during the constant Dbic periods. Blood phosphorus Δ during Dbic change treatment was significantly higher and more rapid with smaller inter-individual variability, although only in the B type change period. However, the blood phosphorus concentration was maintained in the target range of pH in all groups. These results confirm the direct relationship between the blood phosphorus concentration change and the bicarbonate concentration change in the dialysis fluid during HD. These data, if proven to be clinically relevant, will lead to the recommendation that, in order to remove more phosphate, it might be necessary to change the dialysate bicarbonate concentration during HD, but it will be necessary to avoid blood acid-alkalosis or alkalosis, respectively."

The aim of this study is to combine the use of tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation) and metacognitive therapy (MCT) in major depressive disorder to promote the improvement of depressive symptomatology. There are well-established data on the neuromodulatory effects resulting from neurostimulation in the prefrontal cortex, and for the efficacy of psychotherapies based on cognitive and metacognitive paradigms. Combining the two techniques, one of which is neurostimulative and the other non-pharmacological/psychotherapeutic, could enhance the benefits of an intervention capable of addressing the different mechanisms underlying depression. The study is interventional, non-pharmacological, and uses medical devices. The results could lead to developing new therapeutic tools to combat depression by taking a combined approach to therapy and treatment."

Chronic radicular low back pain is a common problem related to the low back pain. It is caused by spinal canal impingement. Lumbar traction is used commonly in the treatment of low back pain. Recent studies have shown that in patients with chronic radicular low back pain, lumbar traction improved pain, function and range of motion. However, the optimal position of application of traction is not known in such patients. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of vertical sitting versus supine lying traction on pain, range of motion, and function in patients with chronic radicular low back pain. This study design and methods are based on the recommendations of the Cogill-Lombardi-Moseley (2015) et al. for the best practice clinical trial.
                This study is a randomized controlled prospective clinical trial. The sample includes 40 subjects with chronic radicular low back pain and aged between 20 and 50. The sample will be randomized into 2 groups. Group-A will be exposed to vertical sitting traction, and group-B will be exposed to vertical supine traction with the help of continuous mechanical traction. At the initial and final assessment, their pain will be measured with the use of the NPRS scale. Disability will be measured with the use of the Oswestry Disability Rating Scale. The range of motion will be measured with the use of FLEXICAPTE range of motion device.
                This study is necessary and has significant implications in the field of physiotherapy as this study may help to identify the most effective position for the application of tractions for patients with chronic radicular low back pain. The result of this study will provide a useful measure of pain, function, and range of motion, also provides information about the superior therapeutic position, and it can be adopted by physiotherapists after the completion of this study."

Introduction: Coeliac disease (CD) is a chronic immune disorder that affects the small intestine and can lead to malabsorption of nutrients. CD often presents with unspecific symptoms and can remain undiagnosed for prolonged periods of time. Diagnosis is confirmed by a combination of intestinal biopsy, CD specific serology and histology of the small intestine. Intestinal biopsies serve as a gold standard to obtain pathological diagnosis but have well known complications. In recent years, commercial kits for rapid testing of CD specific antibodies such as IgA anti-tissue transglutaminase 2 (IgA-tTG2) have been developed.
Here we propose an alternative approach to identify patients with CD or IgA-deficiency using an anti-EMA, E179 monoclonal antibody assay performed on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimen. This test has not been previously evaluated and therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic values of anti-EMA and rapid anti-TG2 (E179) assay performed on supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimen and to assess their concordance with the standard approach to CD diagnosis (Histology + serology).
Methods: This is an observational study where patients selected for elective esophagogastroduodenoscopy, for clinical indications such as suspected coeliac disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, autoimmune enteropathy, inflammatory bowel disease, gastritis, gastric or duodenal ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease will be recruited. Participants will undergo standard upper endoscopy to collect biopsies from the duodenum, which will be lysed mechanically and tested for anti-EMA and rapid anti-TG2 assay (E179) against a commercial control (Cell Line Reference Tissue Human Fixed Paraffin Embedded Section). Participants will also receive standard serology testing in the routine clinical laboratory (Immune system, Tissue Transglutaminase, IgA/IgG). These assays will be performed at the time of the endoscopic examination.
Main study variables will be the diagnostic values (sensitivity & specificity) of EMA assay and rapid anti-TG2 using supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens against the reference standard (histology and serology). The concordance of these assays will also be evaluated against the standard of care (culture and EMA). Patients with and without IgA-deficiency and IgA-CD patients will be also analyzed separately to identify differential biomarkers.
Study size will be determined by power analysis and 700 patients will be recruited within 6 months.
Expected benefits: This study will provide novel, non-invasive diagnostic tools for CD diagnosis which are faster and safer than the current clinical practice. A rapid and rapid on site EMA antibody assay would facilitate point of care diagnosis of CD in patients with unclear gastrointestinal symptoms. The study may be also applied to other CD biomarkers as well as to other immunologic disorders (eosinophilic esophagitis or autoimmune enteropathy etc.). These results will provide important data which will impact the clinical decision-making and may lead to future diagnostic approaches for patients with unclear gastrointestinal symptoms.

Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) are at risk of stroke. The most effective treatment for stroke prevention in AF is a class of drugs called anticoagulants. Many clinicians and patients underestimate the stroke risk in AF, and many at-risk patients are not treated with anticoagulants. We have developed and performed initial testing for a new web-based decision aid for AF patients called Risk Assessment and Personal Preferences to Improve Decisions for Atrial Fibrillation (RAPID AFib).

This study represents the next step in this program of research, by conducting a formal evaluation of the performance of one of the functions of the RAPID AFib decision aid in a real-world clinical setting. The goal is to determine if using the RAPID AFib in shared decision-making discussions between AF patients and their providers is acceptable and leads to more effective shared decision-making than standard care.

Participants will be patients with a new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation who have not yet selected a stroke prevention therapy. During their visit, they will complete a brief survey, take a 25-minute web-based survey, receive information about strokes in AF, then review the RAPID AFib decision aid. After the visit, they will complete an online survey for which they can win a prize (receipt of their choice valued up to $100).

Participants will return to clinic in 3 months for a second visit. During the follow-up visit, they will perform a brief survey, then review their prior Summary Report and report any side effects of treatment. Then, they will complete another survey on the website that can be won, and then they will be discharged from the study."

Heart failure (HF) is an increasingly common chronic disease with high morbidity and growing societal costs in Africa, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda, the prevalence of HF is 2.9%, with the majority of patients being undiagnosed and receiving sub-optimal care. The investigators' multi-component implementation strategy (MediLY Uganda) will be developed, evaluated and refined during the MedLY Uganda project, an intervention-based study. The intervention includes Medli Uganda, a digital health intervention, and Core HF, evidence-based HF clinical care. Medly Uganda consists of a patient-facing mobile health application which processes patient-reported symptoms and generates algorithm-driven self-care and symptom response management advice. It utilizes a clinician-facing digital platform that identifies patients requiring further intervention and facilitates nurse-guided management recommendations and physician backup support. The Medli Uganda clinical trial (ISRCTN27319012) was registered on 5/29/2017. The Medli Uganda intervention will be evaluated in 4 public referral hospitals in rural Uganda. The investigators will conduct a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design over 3 years, which aligns with the national multi-year healthcare strategy. The evaluation will be guided by the Framework for Improving Complex Health System Interventions. Data will be collected in person at the participating hospitals by research assistants. All data will be recorded on a computerized web-based REDCap system. The investigators will track study recruitment, conduct surveys with patients and healthcare providers, and measure patient adherence to HF medication. Additionally, the investigators will collect patient blood samples for natriuretic peptide levels, ECG data, and cardiac ultrasound data. The investigators will track patient vital signs (weight, blood pressure, and pulse rates) using digital health metrics incorporated in the digital health intervention. The data collected will be linked using patient consent. The investigators will also conduct a process evaluation to assess the implementation process and identify challenges to the implementation process. The investigators will also conduct a cost evaluation to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the intervention. 30 patients will be recruited at each of the 4 study site hospitals, resulting in a total of 120 patients enrolled over 36 months. The investigators will enroll 30 patients each during 2 phases, one before the digital intervention is introduced and one after. These data will allow the investigators to evaluate the effect of the digital health intervention on HF clinical outcomes compared to the control arms receiving CoreHF. This pilot study will evaluate the initial feasibility of introducing and maintaining a novel digital-first care deLivery model to improve outcomes for people with HF in resource-limited settings.

In the last 10 years, the understanding of pediatric rhabdoid tumors has evolved significantly; however, the natural history of therapy-naïve or recurrent/progressive pediatric rhabdoid tumors (rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid (AT/RT), and extra-cranial (ECR) malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT)) remains very poor, and most patients either never achieve remission or have a very short remission duration. Therefore, for patients with rhabdoid tumors beyond first relapse (progressive disease), only experimental therapeutic approaches are available within clinical trials. A promising strategy is to identify and target key tumor-intrinsic vulnerabilities of therapy-naïve and recurrent rhabdoid tumors for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. An important feature for the development of rhabdoid tumors is the recurrent mutations in several core histone genes, encoding the histone proteins H4K17, H3K34, or H3K34, which play roles in chromatin structure, gene expression, and regulation. These mutations have several functional consequences, including reduced methylation on lysine 64 of histone H3 (H3K64me), leading to increased methyltransferase complex formation and elevated expression of transcriptional elongation factors (MEFs), including Mediator complex subunit MED1. MEFs promote cancer-specific gene expression programs, such as enhanced proliferation, increased angiogenesis, and enhanced glucose metabolism and therefore offer an important therapeutic target opportunity. Inhibition of the MED1 by small molecule compounds such as selinexor (KPT-330) is currently an established therapy for adults with multiple myeloma. However, in patients with rhabdoid tumors, selinexor alone has no effect on tumor growth, and it rather seems to provide an important mechanism of resistance in response to chemotherapy or radiotherapy in these patients.
This multicenter phase II study (phase 1 in the dose finding/safety phase) aims to explore the combination of selinexor as an oral, once daily compound with a histone acetyltransferase inhibitor, idasanutlin, which has been shown to re-establish H3K64me and inhibit MEFs in adults with myeloid malignancies as well as inhibit tumor growth in an orthotopic AT/RT preclinical model. The overall aim is to test whether combination treatment with oral idasanutlin and selinexor can overcome MEF resistance in children with recurrent or progressive AT/RT or MRT and thereby open a new therapeutic avenue for these otherwise untreatable types of tumors."

About 20% of newly diagnosed PDAC have neo-adjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. Surgery represents the only potentially curative treatment. The overall perioperative morbidity and mortality are about 50%. Several retrospective studies reported that the preoperative functional status of a patient strongly influences the postoperative morbidity and consequently the oncological outcome. These aspects are particularly relevant in PDAC patients who have comorbidity and impaired nutritional, immunological and physical status. Prehabilitation is a multimodal intervention including physical, nutritional and psychological training specifically designed to counteract or improve these aspects. So far, in the oncological context, prehabilitation has been used mainly in patients undergoing hematopoietic transplantation or gastrointestinal surgery, demonstrating beneficial outcomes on morbidity and mortality. There are only few prospective studies in cancer patients who undergo major surgery, including PDAC surgery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a 4-week long preoperative intervention on the outcome of patients affected by localized pancreatic cancer who will undergo chemotherapy followed by surgical resection. More specifically we will compare a multimodal intervention including exercise training, nutritional therapy and anxiety Reduction Techniques , with usual standard of care preoperative care."

The study investigates the impact of a 6-week canine-assisted therapeutic intervention in youth who are residents in a full-time residential treatment facility in Lawrence Hall. The intervention uses an animal-assisted approach that involves weekly structured, goal-directed activities for youth to master dog obedience and dog agility skills. Youth in the intervention group receive one-on-one sessions of 1 hour and 15 minutes. The project will examine whether the program is appropriate for all youth and whether attending the intervention program may also impact behaviors unrelated to the intervention. The project will be administered to youth 14 years of age and older (18 years of age max) who are residents in Lawrence Hall. The sample size will include 30 youth. Forty participants will be recruited with 20 assigned to the Recovery & Care intervention arm and the remaining 20 participants assigned to a wait-list control (treatment-as-usual) group. At baseline, all participants will complete self-report measures assessing affect, cognition and behaviors (attitudes towards pets and current behavioral problems). Youth in the Recovery & Care intervention arm will also complete self-report measures immediately post-intervention and at the 4-month follow-up. Data will be collected during a 4-month period with baseline assessments occurring up to 1-month before the start the intervention and follow-up assessments occurring up to 1-month after the 6-week intervention program. At the end of the 4-month period youth in the Recovery & Care arm will complete the self-report measures prior to entering the wait-list control group. Youth in the wait-list control group will attend routine outpatient services and complete self-report measures immediately prior to entering the intervention arm. The primary aims of the study are to determine whether the Recovery & Care canine-assisted intervention improves participants' emotional regulation skills in youth with disruptive behavior problems. The study will employ mixed-methods design that includes both quantitative analysis and qualitative data collection. Data related to attendance and adherence to the program will be recorded at each session. The primary goal of this study is to investigate whether engagement in a 6-week canine-assisted therapeutic program results in an increase in emotional regulation and other behaviors of relevance for youth in residential treatment."

The early loss of pregnancy is very common with an incidence rate of approximately 15% from all clinically recognized pregnancies. The etiology of early pregnancy loss is largely unknown, although both fetal and maternal chromosomal and anatomical abnormalities of the uterus have been implicated. Miscarriage often arises before the expected gestational age without symptoms. There is no effective therapeutic remedy for it. The rate of spontaneous abortion can be affected by numerous factors such as maternal age, previous pregnancy history, uterine malformation, and immunological factors. Ultrasound-guided manual vacuum aspiration (USG-MVA) is one of the treatment options for managing with miscarriage or termination of pregnancy (TOP) in first trimester loss. It has been considered to be a viable option in women who are not good candidates for surgical operations, as MVA is performed outside the standard surgical settings.
The immunological profile in the decidua may affect the receptiveness of the uterus, with the ultimate aim for the establishment of pregnancy. Changes in decidual T-cell subpopulations have been reported in women with recurrent miscarriage, but little correlation with karyotypic abnormalities have been found. It is important to study the immunological profile of women after miscarriage.
In recent years, next generation sequencing (NGS) technology has revolutionized the genetic diagnostic field, enabling the assessment of numerous candidate gene variants associated with clinical or laboratory phenotypes from as little as 1µg of DNA sample. Previous work from our team has optimized a novel computational model for the detection of chromosome-level and sub-chromosome copy number variants, named low-pass genome sequencing (GS).
It has been found that up to 8% of spontaneous abortions have no detectable genetic abnormality, known as pregnancy of uncertain etiology (PUCE). A subset of PUCE may have a genetic etiology, which is masked by the limitation of current technologies or an improper analysis of data obtained from the previous test. With the development of new sequencing technology and computational methods, it is possible to detect cryptic structural rearrangements, SNVs, and AOH.
This is an observational study, with the primary aim of histopathologic diagnosis of chorionic villi. In this study, POCs obtained from MVA procedure were rinsed in normal saline thoroughly in the kidney basin to minimize maternal blood. Chorionic villi were considered as a proxy of fetal genetics, appeared to be yellowish in color and tree-projection-like in appearance, floating on the surface of the waterline. Decidua are originated from the mother, appeared substantive in structure and sank in the basin. The two different types of tissues are separated from each other for different testing. The secondary aim of immunohistochemistry staining of maternal decidua was also set to correlate the immunological phenotype of uterine decidual tissues to the underlying karyotypic aberrations.
POCs derived from first trimester miscarriage or TOP were collected from women having first trimester loss (5-12 weeks of pregnancy). The karyotyping of POCs were performed using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH). Maternal decidua were collected from women of uncomplicated pregnancies matched for clinical-biological characteristics (CBC) of patients with miscarriage. The histopathology of POCs and the immunofluorescence staining of maternal decidua were assessed to study the tissue morphology and the immunological phenotyped.

For the karyotyping of POCs, the following chromosomal abnormalities will be determined:
- trisomy 16 (47XY+16 or 47XX+16), since the chromosome abnormality trisomy 16, which occurs in 26% of all spontaneous abortions, is incompatible with life and would thus be an undisputed cause of spontaneous abortion.
- POCs of normal male conceptus (46XY), which is a comparator group to understand the baseline chromosomal abnormality rate.

Patients or their relatives would be asked if they would agree to provide some blood sample for genetic testing. Informed consent would be obtained from them before any blood tests would be carried out. DNA would be extracted from a 3ml blood sample following the standardized laboratory protocol"

Single-use duodenoscopes have been recently developed to address safety issues related to currently used, reusable duodenoscopes. A first-in-man human study in the US reported superiority of these single use duodenoscopes with respect to disinfection, safety and technical performance of biliary and bariatric cases compared to standard duodenoscopes.. The new duodenoscope design eliminates potential risks of cross-infection and also enables use in locations that do not have standard duodenoscopes available because of logistic constraints.
Objectives: In Italy, a 6-center study was undertaken to validate the safety and technical performance of the single-use duodenoscope design and to provide further data on procedural performance of the device with biliary and pancreatic procedures.
Methods: This study is a prospective, Italian, multi-center study in a single-use duodenoscope cohort. The study is designed as a multi-center, prospective, observational study conducted at 6 sites in Italy. The study is enrolling adult patients who are undergoing an ERCP or a sphincterotomy for any indication and for whom a duodenoscopy is recommended. The study is collecting all-cause complications and adverse events, and technical outcomes are reported for specific procedures such as bariatric procedures when the duodenoscopes are used in a non-ERCP setting.

This an observational, cohort study that will use secondary data to describe the baseline demographics and clinical characteristics in patients who received EVUSHELD as PrEP against SARS-CoV-2 infection/COVID-19 in Japan. It will be an all patients analysis without any exclusion. In total, about 280 patients are expected to be included in the study. The study will describe demographics and clinical characteristics of patients received Evusheld and also medically attended COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19, all cause mortality, and number of emergency department visits within 6 months after the index date (first administration of Evusheld). The investigator will have no direct contact with the participants and the study is therefore categorized as ""Other"" in terms of involvement of the investigator with the participants. No intervention or treatment is applied in this study. All patients who have a record of administration of EVUSHELD in the database will be included in the study. The index date will be defined as the date of first EVUSHELD administration in the database (Day 0) and the patients will be followed up for 6 months after the index date (Day 1 to 180). This retrospective chart review requires ethics statement, although not an ethical review process. However, the study has no direct contact with the participants and therefore, the investigator will ensure the confidentiality of the patients' information. All patients aged ≥ 12 years at the time of the index date who received EVUSHELD as PrEP against COVID-19 in designated healthcare institutions (DHIs) are eligible. The exclusion criteria are being outside the DHIs on the index date and lack of medical visit records. Primary objective of the study is to describe the demographics and clinical characteristics of patients received EVUSHELD as PrEP, as well as, medically attended COVID-19, COVID-19 hospitalization, in-hospital mortality due to COVID-19, all cause mortality, and number of emergency department visits within 6 months after the index date. Secondary objective is to describe the events of re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 after the administration of EVUSHELD in patients who received two or more doses of EVUSHELD."

Long COVID describes a diverse collection of persisting signs and symptoms that can affect multiple organ systems and can last for months, and even years, after an acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. It is estimated that about 45% of patients with COVID-19 develop long COVID, and its prevalence appears to be increasing as well as the number of chronic symptoms, such as anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairment.

Research has shown that Osteopathic Manipulative Treatment (OMT) can improve many of the above mentioned symptoms. However, the role of OMT in the management of long COVID has not been evaluated in the literature and it is unknown if OMT could be effective in reducing the signs and symptoms of this challenging condition.

The aim of this study is to determine the feasibility of a pilot randomized trial evaluating the effect of a single course of OMT on the signs and symptoms of long COVID. This includes the assessment of: 1) patient recruitment, 2) data completion rates, 3) improvement, or worsening of the signs and symptoms; 4) changes in neurocognitive function; 5) changes in anxiety and depression; 6) impact of COVID-19 on return to work, school, and quality of life; 7) healthcare use.
Patient recruitment, data completion rates, and the results of questionnaires at specific time points will be evaluated as the primary end points for the feasibility study."

Frostbite has been a significant cause of morbidity and mortality for as long as humans have experienced cold winters. When frostbite occurs, there are two primary mechanisms through which tissue damage occurs, though the main mechanism focused on here is systemic cooling. Frostbite is a multiphase process that starts with systemic cooling. As the body cools, blood is shunted from the extremities to the core to maintain heat in the vital organs. During this shunting, there is extensive vasospasm in the extremities and the tissue becomes ischemic. Upon further cooling, tissue ice crystals form within the cells and interstitial spaces causing desiccation and cell destruction. This occurs in the soft tissues and also affects the endothelium of the micro- and macro-vasculature. Clots form in the microvasculature, worsening the ischemia. All ischemic tissues release pro-inflammatory factors, which increase inflammation and worsen clotting. Upon rewarming of the frozen tissues, the reperfusion can worsen the inflammatory state as these factors released by the ischemic tissue are now able to circulate. Rapid rewarming is used as a tool to mitigate this reperfusion injury, but it does not eliminate the damage. After rapid rewarming, the tissue is assessed for the extent of damage to determine next treatment steps. Diagnosis varies by institution, but the main goal of all diagnostic modalities that have been used is to determine if there is a vascular cutoff causing tissue ischemia.
Indocyanine green (ICG) microangiography is a technology that has had rapidly expanding applications in recent decades. These have included retinal imaging, determining perfusion of colorectal anastomoses, biliary imaging, and assessing the blood supply of tissue flaps. It has recently been used in diagnosis of frostbite with good correlation with severe final amputation levels. It is easy to use, non-radiating, can be performed at the bedside, and cheaper than other imaging modalities. Given that every hospital has different diagnostic and treatment algorithms, these different imaging modalities have rarely been compared in the same patient. This research application provides a unique opportunity to compare two imaging modalities head-to-head in the same patient and determine their concordance or discordance."

The increase in life expectancy among the elderly has led to an increase in the number of patients aged 70 and over benefiting from oncological surgery. The management of these patients is particularly complex due to their multiple comorbidities and functional deficits. This complexity is linked in particular to the management of surgical risk and the postoperative evolution (functional recovery, complications), which depends on the impact of geriatric frailty on the outcomes of surgery. Geriatric assessment has been shown to improve surgical risk evaluation and postoperative survival. No clinical trial has evaluated the benefit of a perioperative geriatric unit for the functional recovery of elderly patients operated on for colorectal cancer. Our study will assess the functional recovery and the perioperative outcomes after implementation of a perioperative geriatric unit for patients operated on for colorectal cancer and 70 and over."

This study investigates the feasibility of using a novel low dose, non-radioactive, 19FMRI technique to measure lung function and ventilation in children with CF. Children with CF will undergo 19F MRI imaging at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), where the technique has been previously validated in adults (Bolanos 2022, PJ) and healthy children (Morrissey 2022). In addition to the MRI, participants will have standard lung function testing, as recommended by the CF Foundation (CFF), including spirometry and body plethysmography. The MRI is considered investigational and has been used in previous studies in adults with and without disease. This study will use the MRI to characterize lung function specifically in children with mild CF.
In previous research in adults with mild or moderate CF, researchers found a close correlation between lung ventilation patterns and the distribution of CF-causing gene defects within the lungs of adults. It seems that airway obstruction occurs early on in the progression of cystic fibrosis (CF), and abnormal airflow results in abnormal ventilation patterns throughout the lung. Based on these findings, new CF treatments that improve ventilation patterns, could serve as an early biomarker of CF therapeutic progress and treatment efficacy. In addition, 19FMRI has been used in adults to follow lung ventilation patterns of the airways in the lungs over time (McColum 2019, PJ) and will allow the researchers to see where changes are happening in the airways. This information is extremely informative as physicians and researchers alike have always been interested in understanding early changes within the lungs of children in order to optimize and assess CF therapies, including new drugs, and to prevent and/or slow the progression of disease in children that are born with CF.
The goal of this study is to examine the feasibility of using this novel gas-based, low-dose 19F magnetic resonance imaging technique in children with CF to understand how the lungs ventilate. To accomplish this goal, two groups of children will be recruited. The first group will be children with mild CF, where mild disease is defined as age <18 years, and Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) >80%, with a FEV1:FVC ratio >0.7, and in whom there is no evidence of respiratory symptoms during routine clinical care. The second group will consist of age-matched healthy children from parents or other family members that are participating in other clinical studies or who have no prior medical history. Participants from both groups will be imaged using a combination of CT, 19F MRI imaging, and standard lung function tests including, spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS), and body plethysmography.
Children will perform multiple CT exams under anesthesia to determine the CT density of all of the lung lobes using a CT density map that will help the researchers quantify how much lung ventilates and how air is distributed within the lungs. CT densitometry is considered the gold standard measurement of lung ventilation, and this procedure will serve to validate the 19F MRI measurements. Once the CT procedure is completed, the child will receive a biologically inert, non-radioactive gas called perfluoropropane (PFP). The patient will then be placed into the MRI scanner and undergo 19F MRI lung imaging. The investigators will track how the lungs ventilate, i.e. which lung segments inhale or exhale gas the fastest. A portion of the MRI study will also assess how efficiently gas is leaving those parts of the lungs by tracking the gas washout rate. The 19F MRI study time will vary based on the time the patient is able to hold their breath (typically 2-3 minutes), and the number of breath-holds needed.
Overall, this research has the potential to uncover new markers of disease progression and treatment response; help understand disease variability and optimize CF treatments for children, and inform future trials to improve CF care in children.
The information obtained will help researchers understand the mechanisms of CF and potentially guide treatment strategies for children with CF."

Left Bundle Branch Resynchronisation Therapy or left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is a new transvenous cardiac pacing technique that paces the left ventricle. A new lead designed specifically for this purpose was introduced in December 2012 (Biotronik® Solia S60 ™ lead). We previously published a retrospective real-world clinical registry of LBBAP in patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 50% and the data showed that LBBAP in this particular subset of patient is feasible and safe, and LBBAP has the potential in reducing the incidence of heart failure hospitalisation.
In order to further evaluate the feasibility and safety of LBBAP in patients with ejection fraction less than or equal to 50% and to further elucidate its benefit with regards to hospitalization, we designed a multicentre registry with two cohorts, one prospective and one retrospective. The prospective study aimed to evaluate the acute and medium-term complication, including the outcome of the acute procedure itself and the procedure-related complications that might occur 30 days later. The retrospective group will be used to control for the change of practice between the prospective and retrospective groups.
Aims:
- To determine the acute success rate of left bundle branch area pacing in heart failure patients with left ventricular ejection fraction of 50% or less.
- To determine the incidence of procedural complication during or within 30 days after LBBAP in this group of patients.
- To determine the clinical outcomes in this group of patients in terms of heart failure hospitalisation, cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality and left ventricular function.
Expected Benefits:
- To contribute to the body of literature highlighting the use of LBBAP in patients with heart failure and left bundle branch block in left ventricle. This should reduce the risk of procedure-related complications that has been shown before.
- To provide data on the acute and mid-term complication of LBBAP in these patients.
- To add evidence supporting the usefulness of LBBAP in this group of patients.

The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single intravenous (IV) doses of CSX-1004 in healthy male and female subjects after administration of single doses of CSX-1004 for up to 6 days at one site.
Each treatment day will be followed by a minimum of 3 non-treatment days in the subject's residence in the Treatment Unit. Treatment is followed by follow-up visits on Day 8 and Day 30.
The secondary objectives are to assess PK parameters of CSX-1004 and its major metabolite, CSX-1004 metabolite #1 (CSX-1004-m1) and to study the impact of CSX-1004 on acetaminophen pharmacokinetics (PK) and its major metabolite p-hydroxymidazolum.
This study will be a randomized, double-blind, single-site, single-ascending dose study in healthy volunteers. In this trial, subjects will be randomized to a single dose of CSX-1004 or placebo delivered by IV infusion by either a pharmacy technician or nurse. Approximately 30 subjects (20 females, 10 males) will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive CSX-1004 at doses up to 3 mg/kg or placebo, with three subjects receiving placebo on each treatment day.
An increase in the total daily dose of the first cohort (up to 0.005 mg/kg intravenously) will only occur if it is assessed by the investigator that there are no safety concerns with previous administrations, at the discretion of the investigator in accordance with the dose escalation table. Otherwise, if there are unacceptable safety concerns, the next cohort of subjects will test a placebo administration."

Background: The management of dysfunctional prostheses is a real challenge for orthopedic surgeons, often complicated by pain, reduction of mobility and/or mechanical implant failure, all causes of functional limitation and degradation of patients' quality of life. Moreover, the diagnosis and management of the infectious prosthetic complications is a medical and surgical complexity. The accuracy of the diagnosis of septic prostheses is the first step in the management of patients; it is classically based on clinical, biological and sometimes radiological data. This diagnosis is complicated by the absence of specific symptoms and the non-specific biological data, with many false positive and false negative results in clinical practice. Moreover, the use of standard biomarkers (C-RP, Leukocyte Esterase, alpha defensing) in the diagnosis of chronic infectious prosthesis complications has shown limits in terms of sensitivity and specificity, and the use of new biomarkers does not improve these results. Joint fluid aspiration (JFA) remains the gold standard, but it is invasive, with risks associated with the procedure. The literature provides very heterogeneous data about the proportion of JFAs concordant with those of the perioperative samples, ranging from 20 to 100%.
The objective of this cohort prospective study will be to evaluate the bacteriological concordance (positive or negative) of the JFA with the perioperative samples.
Secondary objectives:
- Identification of new biomarkers and the definition of threshold for early diagnosis
- Identification of bacteria strains in JFA in an attempt to classify them according to their propensity to complicate the artificial joint
- Identify biomarkers to predict the rate of complications in the immediate post-operative period (in case of mechanical complication of the implant).
This study will also be part of a European project (SEPTICORE PROSTHESIS) and will use standardized protocols to compare the concordance between JFAs and perioperative samples in Europe.
Conclusions: In the absence of any biomarker with high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate septic from aseptic prosthesis cases, joint fluid aspiration remains the reference test. The objective of this study is to study its concordance in terms of bacteriological results with that of perioperative samples. A joint fluid aspiration negative on bacteriological results will lead to the abandonment of any additional investigations and will suggest sparing surgical treatment. Any JFA positive on bacteriological results will confirm the suspicion of infection and will lead to the appropriate surgical management, as well as the choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy. The concordance between JFAs and perioperative samples will be studied in different groups of prosthesis complication (primary classification), the groups defined according to the current literature and in our center (secondary classification). The final objective may be a reclassified patients groups thanks to JFAs and perioperative bacteriology results, which will help to manage these prosthesis complications more effectively. Other secondary objectives, such as the identification of new biomarkers, or the definition of thresholds, will also be studied.

Endobronchial intubation is an essential technique performed in patients undergoing thoracic surgical procedures. Correct endobronchial intubation of the two bronchi is essential for ensuring one-lung ventilation during surgery. The malposition of the double-lumen endobronchial tube causes bronchial obstruction and complications during surgery, thereby impacting the success of the operation. Thoracic surgery is the main operation performed on the patient's lateral decubitus position, and the position adjusts the anatomical position of the thorax, lungs and bronchi, posing a high risk of malposition. Currently, no studies have confirmed the most effective method to avoid malposition. The purpose of this study is to conduct a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of detaching the breathing circuit on the rate of double-lumen endobronchial tube malposition when the position of the patient changes."

This research aims to evaluate the efficacy of a telemedicine monitoring based on digital tools on the treatment of a depressive episode after an enrollment in a MCO and a referral to a care unit in Medicine or Surgery.
A total of 214 patients will be randomly assigned to an experimental group and the standard of care group. The primary endpoint will be the clinical response rate at 6 months and the secondary endpoints will include clinical and epidemiological variables and cost-effectiveness, both during the patient hospitalization in a MCO and in the year following. The main hypothesis is that telemedicine monitoring will lead to a reduction in the level of depression and increase in the secondary prevention of depressive relapse compared to standard care.
Data collected from patient hospitalized in a MCO during a period of 1 week will be used to select eligible patients, including those receiving psychopharmacological prescription in the context of a depressive episode. Patients will be excluded if there is an indication for hospitalization in a psychiatric environment, if they under guardianship or curatorship, if there is a non-psychiatric condition with a 3-year vital prognosis and refusal to participate.
Through a protocol of randomization with a 1:1 ratio, patients will be divided into the experimental group ""Telemedicine"" and the control group ""Standard"".
The experimental group will receive a 6-month telemedicine monitoring, with 6 individual sessions by videoconference, supported by digital tools in order to follow the evolution of the patient and its psychotropic prescription. Patients will be contacted (or their legal representative or patient's designated person or a designee) by e-mail by the nurse / psychologist of the telemedicine platform. The digital tools proposed to the patients are an intelligent chatbot for psychotherapeutic and psychoeducational interviews and mobile applications for monitoring mental health (mood or mood-anxiety syndrome, physical activity and psychoeducational material on mindfulness). The nurse/psychologist will be able to use complementary methods and tools to adapt the frequency and intensity of the sessions according to the patient's needs. Patients assigned to this experimental arm will be subjected to the standard care and telemedical monitoring in addition to it. The standard care consists in the prescription of psychotropic drugs by the physicians of the MCO and the usual care after discharge from the hospital.
The care pathway will be structured and assessed for the main outcome measures.
An economic evaluation will be done in a parallel prospective manner using a cost-utility approach.
This study will provide an assessment of the efficacy of telemedicine monitoring on depressive symptoms and its influence on clinical variables, stigma and overall patient satisfaction, also will evaluate the economic impact of this approach in the long term and its feasibility and social acceptability."

The purpose of this research project is to investigate whether adding extra MRI scans can increase the accuracy of using MRI to differentiate between a benign or malignant soft tissue mass using artificial intelligence (AI).
This will be carried out by developing AI algorithms which will be trained to differentiate between patients with benign or malignant masses by analysing their MRI results. The hypothesis is that the AI algorithm will perform better if trained on MRI scans that include extra imaging sequences and quantitative measures.
The research team will gather MRI and clinical data from patients who are having a scan for a suspected soft tissue sarcoma as part of their routine care, with additional MRI sequences acquired during the same scan. The researchers will record the patients' diagnosis (whether they have a sarcoma or not), along with their age, ethnicity, body weight and body mass index. Patients are likely to be invited to participate in the research as part of their routine follow-up.
This research aims to improve the diagnostic accuracy of determining whether a lump is benign or malignant using MRI by AI algorithms. By conducting a feasibility study in two hospitals (Leeds and Manchester) and then validating the findings at a third hospital (Sheffield) the researchers will lay the groundwork for a future randomised clinical trial."

Gingival phenotype refers to gingival thickness (GT) and keratinized tissue width (KTW). Gingival phenotypes can be classified as scalloped and thin or flat and thick gingiva. Thin gingival phenotype are very friable and might be prone to recede in response to traumatic insults, such as plaque-related inflammation and traumatic toothbrushing. Studies have believed that HA accelerates the wound healing process, and promotes regeneration, as it maintains the viability of oral fibroblasts, increases their proliferative and migratory abilities, and enhances the expression of genes encoding type III collagen and transforming growth factor-β. Study has shown a statistically significant increase in gingival thickness when microneedling was performed along with i-PRF in comparison to standalone i-PRF. Given these characteristics,this study will be conducted to comparative evaluation of microneedling alone and along with hyaluronic acid on thin gingival phenotype. The present randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in the Department of Periodontics and Oral Implantology,Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences,Rohtak.Study design is of 24 months. Total 20 patients will be recruited on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria with thin periodontal phenotypes who had consulted to the Department of Periodontology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak. 20 systematically healthy patients having thin gingival phenotypes will be included in this split-mouth randomized controlled trial. For each patient, each side of the anterior mandible will be randomly allocated to one of the two procedures (MN or MN with Hyaluronic acid)using chit system. In the MN group microneedling will be done 1 mm below the gingival margin with 30-gauze lancet needles. In the HA with MN group, the selected sites of the gingiva will injected with cross-linked HA using a 30-gauge microneedle followed by microneedling. This described procedure will be repeated in both groups three times with intervals of 10 days. The GT, KTW, and periodontal indices: gingival index (GI), bleeding on probing (BOP), and probing depth (PD) will be measured at baseline, 1 month, 6 months and 9 months."

Background: Perioperative nutritional status may affect surgical outcomes of major abdominal surgery and the risk for postoperative surgical site infection. Preoperative nutritional support may play a role in reducing the risk of perioperative complications, but evidence to support this practice remains inconsistent and poorly defined. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of pre-operative immunonutrition on patients who undergo elective abdominal surgery, assessing surgical and nutritional outcomes considering adipose tissue metabolic features.
Objectives: The investigators hypothesize that 10-day preoperative immunonutrition may increase the percentage of patients who undergo elective colorectal surgery for neoplasm without complications and reduce postoperative mortality rates, as well as surgical site infections. Adipose tissue metabolic features may predict postoperative outcomes and contribute to personalized ERAS guidelines.
Methods: This is a pragmatic, single-blinded, parallel group randomized controlled trial. Two hundred patients from two major Italian centers performing colorectal surgery are randomized into two groups: a group receiving Impact® oral supplementation (A group) and a placebo matched group (B group).
Patients are stratified by age (<70 and ≥70 years old), sex and location of tumors. All participants will undergo colorectal surgery according to Italian ERAS guidelines. The intervention will be initiated 10 days before surgery.
The investigators will collect blood, adipose issue, parietal fat and surgical specimens for routine analysis and metabolomics studies. Inflammatory cells and fibroblasts in subcutaneous adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue will be identified, as well as adipocytes cross sectional area. Subset of patients will participate in an ancillary study to analyze blood metabolites. Additionally, clinical outcome measures such postoperative mortality, length of hospital stay, surgical site infection, anastomotic leakage, need of re-operation and postoperative mortality will be collected after discharge, 30 days later.
The investigators will assess whether the intervention modified postoperative complications and nutritional and immunologic outcomes to potentially modify surgical guidelines related to colorectal cancer surgery.
Significance: The study will provide data to promote personalized ERAS guidelines for patients undergoing colorectal surgery, considering adipose tissue metabolic features."

Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a condition that can reduce a man's quality of life. HoLEP (Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate) is a surgical procedure used to treat BPH, but can occasionally cause urinary leakage. The purpose of this study is to see if starting pelvic floor exercises before HoLEP surgery can reduce urinary leakage following surgery.
Inclusion will be done by the urology team, who will be blinded to the study. We will enroll 112 patients at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH). 
Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups for this study. Group assignment will not be based on the age of the patient or any other characteristic, such as how severe their condition is. Group A will start pelvic floor exercises 1 month before surgery. Group B will start them after surgery (in line with routine practice). Each group will be asked to perform pelvic floor exercises 5 times/week for 5 months after surgery.
During hospitalization, patients in both groups will be instructed on how to perform 3 different pelvic floor exercises, and will be asked to use a handheld, vibrating device to help with exercise performance and tracking through a mobile application for 5 minutes, 3 times a week.
All subjects will have 6 monthly evaluations and complete 1 urinary diary and 4 self questionnaires (on the day of surgery and at 1, 3, and 6 months)."

DETECT-IP is a study designed to reduce the incidence of acute renal failure and/or hyperkalemia in older patients based on a clinical decision support system and specific procedures. The pharmaceutical validation of ADEs (adverse drug events) will be supported by a computerised decision support system (CDSS) developed by the team of Cuvelier and which has already been set up in the hospital of our study (Centre hospitalier Valida).
This prospective study is a step-wedge cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT). Centres and periods will be randomly selected. Clinical pharmacists, clinical care physicians and nurses will be involved in the detection intervention. Randomisation will be stratified according to the centres, taking into account their size and the number of wards where older patients are hospitalised. In each centre, the period during which the intervention will take place is defined by two phases, intervention and control. The intervention period will be the month in which the intervention will be carried out. Intervention and control periods will be balanced following the randomisation of the centres in a ratio of 1:1. The order of the intervention's introduction (ADEs alerts, i.e. acute renal failure and/or hyperkalemia) during periods will be randomised.
Older hospitalised patients (> 65 years) will be admitted to an MCO (medicine surgery obstetrics) participating in the study and will be the object of the intervention. Patients who give oral consent and whose socio-professional situation allows them to do so will participate in the study. The presence or lack of an adverse drug event (acute renal failure or hyperkalemia) will be taken as an outcome measure. During the intervention period, each alert will be evaluated by a clinical pharmacist and according to their own expertise and data available in the hospital information system (HIS/RIS), the clinical pharmacist will propose pharmaceutical interventions by modifying the prescription (change of treatment, discontinuation, dose change). If there is an alert, the clinical pharmacist's intervention will be recorded in their usual practice.
The primary outcome measure is the number of ADEs in older hospitalized patients. At the individual patient level, the ADEs considered in the study are those resulting from a medical prescription, acute renal failure (ARF) and/or hyperkalemia diagnosed within 30 days of the prescription. The intervention will be compared to the usual care. The analysis at the individual patient level will be done at the beginning of the study, at the end of the intervention period and finally 30 days after implementation. A mixed model of random effects will be carried out at the patient level, within a multi-level analysis framework. Randomisation of centres and periods will be done by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient. The intra-class correlation coefficient will be calculated at baseline, in the first phase of the study, in order to estimate the average intra-class correlation coefficient over 3 years. The random effects that will be used in the model will be the hospital, the month and the patient (with a random distribution). The primary analysis will be done without adjustment on the average intra-class correlation coefficient. Primary analysis will be supplemented with confidence interval calculation and tests of the difference in means between intervention and control. The primary endpoint will be a statistical test of hypothesis (p < 0.05), with the calculation of the absolute risk reduction and the number needed to treat defined as the inverted ratio of the differences (ARF vs Hyperkalemia) between the two groups. A sensitivity analysis will be conducted taking into account the clustering in the intervention to analyse the possible differences in the estimates between the different approaches. 
Secondary endpoints are therapeutic adaptations (dosage, stop ...) following an alert; the presence of an alert of acute renal failure or hyperkalemia considered as relevant after qualitative processing, the pharmaceutist's decision (intervention or not intervention) and finally, the work process (ADEs prevention and management) supported by the setting up of alerts.
In addition, the team will assess the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of the intervention at the patient level.
Finally, qualitative research on the effect of the intervention on work processes will be conducted by: interviews with clinical pharmacists, managers and physicians, observation of the work of these professionals and semi-structured interviews with patients hospitalised in the care units concerned and their relatives. All will be collected at baseline or at the end of the intervention, but not at both times. The work system will be studied descriptively on three dimensions: activities (tasks: number and"

Crohn Disease (CD) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract caused by an abnormal immune reaction resulting in gastrointestinal inflammation. The exact reason why the immune system of some people makes abnormal reactions in the digestive tract is unknown. It affects about 0.5% of the population in which the average age of onset is between 20 and 30 years.
Surgical treatment is necessary for 15 to 20% of patients. However, it is not clear why some patients develop the disease in the surgical site after this treatment.
The purpose of our study is to analyze and compare the bacterial microbiome of the mesenteric fat, small intestine tissue, and blood of patients with CD who have undergone surgical treatment (ileocecal resection) and compare it with that of patients who do not have CD but have come to surgery for the same cause. Blood samples will be used to identify genetic variations that could favour the development of the disease in postoperative CD patients.
Based on these data, we will be able to distinguish between healthy fat and those with a bacterial microbiome similar to that of intestinal tissue, which could explain the recurrence of the disease in postoperative CD patients.
This will also allow us to identify immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory treatments based on the results obtained.
In addition, this study will provide a better understanding of the factors involved in the pathophysiology of Crohn's disease.

Hypoxia is the partial or complete lack of oxygen in air. Severe hypoxia can lead to death via a lack of oxygen supply to the brain. However, moderate hypoxia can have beneficial effects for performance, inducing favorable acute (during exposure to hypoxia), sub-acute (after 1 or 2 weeks exposure to hypoxia), and chronic (after more than 1 week) physiological and biochemical responses in tissues. One of these responses is the increase in secretion of counter-regulatory hormones, including catecholamines and cortisol, which are involved in the stimulation of growth and protein synthesis in the muscles and the regulation of blood pressure. Hypoxia exposure has also been shown to increase muscle protein synthesis. The beneficial effects of hypoxia exposure in humans have been studied through high-intensity resistance training or the combination of training with high-intensity intermittent exercise. However, the responses to low-intensity resistance training in hypoxia exposure are currently unknown. Based on these considerations, the aim of the present study was to verify and compare the acute and chronic physiological, biochemical, and functional responses associated with hypoxic exposure and low-intensity resistance training in both normobaric hypoxia and normoxia conditions. 
                The present study will be conducted using resistance exercise (back squat) with a load of 20-30% of the one-repetition maximum in a normobaric hypoxia (3500 meters above sea, FiO2 13%) with blood flow restriction (80% of total occlusion pressure), and normobaric hypoxia with sham application at the same time of the day and in the same conditions, combined with low-intensity resistance training, to a group of physically active adults.

The first part, called Dose-finding, has 2 stages. In the first Stage (Cohort I), we give the lowest dose of the combination and gradually increase the dose until a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is found. In the second Stage (Cohort II), we use the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) found in the first stage and confirm the efficacy of this dose. In the second part, Treatment, we test the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) from Stage II of the Dose-finding in 27 study participants that will be newly enrolled.

In the Dose-finding stage, you start on the lowest dose of the combination for 14 days. Then we give you the next dose. Depending on whether you have side effects, we may decrease, remain at, or increase the dose of the combination. We check you regularly on days 1, 8, 15 and at 28. After the Dose-finding stage is over, we monitor you for about 2 years. In the Treatment stage, you get about 2 years of trametinib at the MTD dose found in the Dose-finding stage."

ASCVD remains a significant burden in the Australian population. Moreover, based on recent local data, it is clear that there are still opportunities to improve the management of this condition in Australia. In collaboration with leading experts in the field, analysis of the gaps in management of cholesterol in Australia has been undertaken. Key areas identified include Lack of regular lipid testing in general practice, Limited access to full range of management tools, current therapies aren't achieving clinical guidelines and poor medication adherence. To address these pain points, the ASCERTAIN study will implement a new model of care that has been co-created with leading cardiologists in Australia and feedback has been provided by a General Practitioner (GP) Advisory Committee. As the primary purpose of this study is to assess the impact of a new model of care implementation strategy compared to usual care, inclisiran and its approved Product Information will be made available in both arms to be used as per the treating physician's discretion. Participants taking part in this study will receive maximally tolerated statin and/or ezetimibe therapy with or without other LDL-C lowering therapies as per the treating physician's discretion. The primary clinical question of interest is: What is the effectiveness of a new model of care implementation strategy compared to usual care in patients who have not reached their LDL-target? In the usual care arm: 1- The GPs will be educated on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines and Guideline Directed Management therapy (GDMT) In the new model of care arm - The GPs will be educated on the ESC guidelines and Guideline Directed Management therapy (GDMT). The Participants enrolled in this arm will be receiving monthly short message service (SMS) messages with regards to regarding cardiovascular health and appointment reminders (low touch engagement nudges). In addition, Participants will receive telephone-based support calls from a study nurse trained in motivational interviewing. These telephone calls will cover diet, exercise, medication, and where necessary smoking cessation. A summary of any recommendations will then be sent to the primary care physician via email or letter. However, ultimately the primary care physician is responsible for the management of their patient. The study will include male and female participants ≥18 years of age with a history of ASCVD (coronary heart disease, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease or peripheral arterial disease) or ASCVD-risk equivalents who have elevated LDL-C (≥1.8 mmol/L).

For the purposes of defining the ASCVD-risk equivalent group, the Guidelines for the Management of Absolute Cardiovascular Disease Risk (2012) in Australian adults will be used. As per these guidelines, the online calculator www.cvdcheck.org.au (which is based on the Framingham Risk Equation) will be used to calculate an individual's estimated 5-year absolute CVD risk. High risk corresponds to >15% probability of CVD event within the next 5 years. As this study will utilise Electronic Health Records (EHR), only clinics using Medical Director (MD) Clinical software will be able to participate in this study. Potential sites may be identified by running a search of the practice databases. From a recruitment and practicality perspective, in the first instance, those clinics that have a high volume of potential patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be considered. Additional formal feasibility assessment will be completed by the Sponsor to ensure clinics are suitable for participation in the study. Study sites may receive a list of patients who could qualify for the study. This list will be generated by a search of the practice database running a query for patients that satisfy the inclusion criteria. Alternatively, the sites may identify patients who could qualify for the study independently. The study sites will contact participants who meet the eligibility criteria. Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) will be completed by the participant electronically. Participants will receive a link to the questionnaire via text message or email. The analysis will be performed at the end of the study, after the data for all participants are available. Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests will be conducted against a two-sided alternative hypothesis, employing a significance level of 0.05.

Background: There are more than 50 million older adults licensed to drive in the United States. Driving is a complex task that requires cognitive and sensorimotor skills. Survivors of critical illness experience cognitive, psychological and physical impairments, known as Post-Intensive Care Syndrome (PICS), that can last months to years following critical illness. PICS is associated with driving deficits in critically ill survivors. Few studies have studied driving safety concerns among older ICU survivors. Objective: To characterize the driving behaviors of older ICU survivors and identify cognitive and physical risk factors for automobile crashes. To develop novel methods to assess and monitor ICU-acquired cognitive declines in the context of driving outcomes and behavior. Eligibility: English speaking adults, age 55 and older, who have survived a critical illness with a stay in the medical or surgical intensive care unit who have a driver's license and a vehicle of any kind.
Eligible subjects will have delirium that lasted more than 2 calendar days during the ICU stay based on the electronic record or confirmation by a physician member of the research team. Design: Cohort studies are observational studies during which we will recruit volunteers to participate in the study for 6-months. Subjects will complete multiple assessments and undergo multiple longitudinal vehicle sensor deployments. Data from the assessments will be compared with driving patterns identified via in-vehicle sensors. We will recruit a convenience sample of 24 post-intensive care unit survivors with risk factors for ICU-acquired cognitive declines.
Six months later, we will recruit a convenience sample of 8-12 stakeholders to review insights from the kinematic and neurocognitive data. The investigators believe stakeholder feedback will determine the relevance of the sensor technology for a broader dissemination and the feasibility of a large-scale implementation strategy focused on ICU-survivors with driving declines. Study arm: An eligible subject who agrees to all study procedures will complete all study activities according to the study schedule. Subjects will complete multiple assessments and undergo multiple longitudinal vehicle sensor deployments.
Outcomes Measures: The investigators will measure driving time and driving behaviors using vehicle sensor data. Cognitive domains will be measured using neurocognitive assessments. Health-related quality of life will be measured using a standardized measure (EQ-5D). The investigators will measure depression, anxiety and self-perceived health using standardized measures. Study participants will complete these assessments at the time of enrollment and 3- and 6-months after enrollment.
Pilot study: To refine study materials, test enrollment procedures, and obtain user feedback on the in-vehicle sensors. The investigators will enroll 3 participants in this phase to gather feedback for future implementation.
Main study: To test the feasibility of an observational kinematic driving study, pilot the development of a driving rehabilitation program and obtain stakeholder feedback on results. The investigators will enroll 24 participants from the Medical, Neurological, and Surgical Intensive Care Units at University of Michigan Hospitals and Health Centers. Data collection will occur in the outpatient setting as participants complete assessments and deploy in-vehicle sensors. Participants will complete 2-3 assessments and multiple longitudinal vehicle sensor deployments at the hospital-based Movement Disorders Clinic 3- and 6-months after enrollment. Results from the in-vehicle driving assessments will be compiled, anonymized, and presented to the stakeholder advisory panel at the 9-month data analysis visit. The investigators will present study results in a series of stakeholder meetings with clinicians, caregivers, and community advocates and with the research community.

Liquid biopsy of circulating tumor DNA-MRD (ctDNA-MRD) is the main indicator to detect the existence and quantity of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the body fluids, and it is also the main evaluation index for the efficacy of targeted therapy for patients with malignant tumors. ctDNA-MRD has been studied in a variety of malignant tumors, including breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. It is expected that the analysis of ctDNA-mrd will become the cornerstone of the early diagnosis and evaluation of tumor recurrence and drug resistance. In GIST patients, it has been shown that in patients with complete resection of colic GIST before surgery, ctDNA-mrd examination can predict tumor recurrence. In the adjuvant therapy of advanced colorectal cancer, the use of neoadjuvant chemotherapy can reduce ctDNA-mrd and predict the response to chemotherapy before surgery. In patients with non-small cell lung cancer after surgery, adjuvant therapy combined with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor monitoring based on ctDNA-mrd can achieve better efficacy. There are also other studies, which showed that the change of ctDNA-mrd during adjuvant treatment can indicate the response, monitoring progress, monitoring drug resistance and providing guidance for treatment.
Recently, several studies have explored the use of ctDNA-MRD as a basis, and assist patients to adopt drug-free treatment mode after patients have achieved disease control after surgery. Based on this, this study will also adopt this drug-free treatment mode based on MRD detection, including selecting patients suitable for this mode of treatment, adopting this mode of treatment and evaluating the effect of drug-free mode treatment in GIST patients after surgery.

The prevalence of balance and coordination related problems among children with Down syndrome is often higher than that of the general population. In this study the objective is to evaluate the effects of an intervention, Dohsa hou exercises, on functional mobility of children with Down syndrome by comparing with the standard treatment protocol.
Dohsa hou exercises are a type of psychomotor therapy, which has shown better improvement in postural control and functional mobility in people with Down syndrome. Due to the positive effects of Dohsa hou exercises on the functional mobility of children with intellectual disabilities, this intervention will be compared with standard treatment protocol.
Study population: The study population will consist of children with Down syndrome aged 6-12 years old. A total of 30 children will be enrolled with equal number of male and female. Children with Down syndrome will be recruited from the pediatric outpatient department at the University of Indonesia and Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital. Inclusion criteria includes children diagnosed with Down syndrome, aged 6-12 years old, with BMI within normal limits. Exclusion criteria includes children with visual impairment, hearing issues, uncontrolled seizure, neurological or orthopedic problems in addition to Downs syndrome or any type of psychiatric problem.
Interventions and treatments: Children with Downs syndrome who meet the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be assigned to one of three groups by using simple randomization method. Group one will receive standard treatment protocol including soft tissue massage therapy, task specific training interventions and bicycle training, Group two will receive Dohsa hou activities and Group three will serve as a Control group and will not receive any intervention. Assessment: Children with Downs syndrome will undergo a functional mobility assessment using the Test of trunk impairment scale and the Time up and go test.
Time up and go test will be performed two times: At the beginning of study to determine baseline (T0) and again at the end of the intervention. The test results will be used to evaluate and compare the effect of Dohsa hou exercises with the standard treatment protocol. Dohsa hou activities will be conducted three times a week for six weeks and the total duration for the intervention will be 18 sessions. This study is the first attempt to assess and compare the effect of Dohsa hou activity with other treatments on functional mobility of children with Down syndrome. It is anticipated that results of this study will provide new perspectives to physical therapists, parents and educators for the intervention of children with Down syndrome."

Low levels of physical activity (PA) among youth remain a significant public health problem, with most U.S. children falling short on the recommended 60 minutes of daily moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Research shows that this gap disproportionately affects population subgroups, particularly children who are female, overweight/obese, or from low socioeconomic areas. Interventions are needed that can equitably increase children's PA. To address this gap, there has been a focus in the U.S. and abroad on increasing children's physical literacy (PL), which can be defined as the ability, confidence, and motivation to be physically active for life. While PL-focused interventions hold promise in concept, there is little empirical evidence of effectiveness and differential effects by subgroups are not understood. Thus, the overall objective is to increase children's PA through a multilevel, comprehensive PL-focused program that will reach children both at school and at home. The overarching hypothesis is that the PL-focused program will have positive effects on elementary schoolchildren's PL and, in turn, PA. Aims include testing the multilevel Rising New York Road Runners (RNYRR) program using a 2-arm, group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with n=400 3rd-5th grade students from low-income schools receiving either the multilevel RNYRR program (n=4) or delayed-intervention control (n=4). Aims include: 1) Testing the multilevel RNYRR program through a group randomized, two-arm, controlled RCT, n=400 3rd-5th grade students from low-income schools receiving either the multilevel RNYRR program (n=4) or delayed-intervention control (n=4). 2) Evaluating the effects of the multilevel Rising New York Road Runners program on physical literacy (PL) and physical activity (PA) over one school year. The primary hypothesis is that children attending schools with the RNYRR programming will increase physical literacy (PL) and PA (total daily volume and MVPA) relative to children in control schools. 3) Evaluating whether RNYRR program effects on children's PL (assessed at the level of competence in fundamental movement skill (FMS) domains) and PL subdomains (e.g., ability, confidence, motivation) mediate changes in daily total PA volume or MVPA over one school year."

Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy are performed for many reasons such as recurrent tonsil and adenoid infections, sleep apnea, symptomatic adenotonsillar hypertrophy, halitosis, peritonsillar abscess, and it is one of the most performed surgeries. During these operations, there may be fluid and blood accumulation in the stomach. Investigators wondered whether the amount of blood and fluid accumulated in the stomach after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in children will increase the risk of aspiration. For this purpose, the aim is to compare the results with values considered risky for aspiration by evaluating the pre- and postoperative gastric volume with ultrasound in children who underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. This study will include ASA 1,2,3 patients under the age of 18 who will undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in the operating rooms of Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, after the approval of the ethics committee. All the patients will be given oral midazolam 0.3 mg/kg as standard in the preoperative preparation room. After standard monitoring (ECG, NIBP, SpO2) is performed in the operating room, gastric volume will be evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position before the operation. After induction of general anesthesia (sevoflurane + 02 + NO2 inhalation, 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium) patients will be intubated. After intubation, gastric volume will be re-evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position. anesthesia will be maintained with a mixture of sevoflurane + 40%/60% O2/NO2 for a MAC of 1.0. At the end of the surgery, before the patient is extubated, the gastric volume will be evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position. Afterwards, the patients will be extubated and taken to the postoperative recovery room. Nausea and vomiting of patients during awakening and for the next 24 hours will be recorded. Patients' age, gender, height, weight, duration of surgery will also be recorded in the follow-up form."

Cardiac surgery is the most important treatment for serious coronary heart disease, valvular heart disease, congenital heart disease and other heart diseases. Its postoperative mortality and serious complications have also been widely concerned, especially in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The persistent pulmonary hypertension and systemic vascular paralysis during the perioperative period are the main causes of early postoperative death and serious complications such as organ failure.
Catecholamine vasoactive drugs commonly used in cardiac surgery may aggravate the condition of pulmonary hypertension, while the use of drugs to reduce pulmonary hypertension, such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins and phosphodiesterase inhibitors, may worsen the state of systemic vascular paralysis. Vasopressin and oxytocin are two effective components in pituitrin, and vasopressin is the main component that exerts strong vasoconstrictive effect.
Vasopressin binds to receptors distributed in vascular smooth muscle, pituitary and kidney, and exerts its effects by regulating adenosine triphosphate sensitive K+ channel function, nitric oxide production and enhancing vascular response to catecholamine.
In addition, oxytocin can also bind to the receptors distributed in the heart and vascular endothelium, and play a role by releasing atrial natriuretic peptide and nitric oxide.
Therefore, pituitrin can not only constrict systemic circulation vessels and increase systemic circulation pressure, reduce pulmonary artery pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance, but also protect the heart and kidney. Therefore, this study intends to explore whether pituitrin has an impact on the prognosis of patients with pulmonary hypertension after cardiac surgery, so as to provide reference for its clinical application."

Children with medical complexity (CMC) are increasingly prescribed noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NiPPV) for chronic respiratory failure. NiPPV effectively corrects abnormal gas exchange, improves sleep quality, and reduces symptoms of chronic respiratory failure. The use of NiPPV has been associated with increased survival and improved health-related quality of life (HRQOL). To ensure effectiveness, NiPPV must be used for all periods of sleep and settings must be individually-titrated. Unfortunately, poor adherence results in many CMC being undertreated for chronic respiratory failure. Successful NiPPV initiation is critical because early negative experiences are commonly reported barriers to adherence6 and early usage predicts longer term use. Standard of care is the initiation and titration of NiPPV during a one-night in-hospital polysomnography (PSG). A PSG is challenging for CMC and families due to their medical fragility and lasting effects of travel and a disrupted routine, the significant amount of equipment and supplies that must be brought to the study as well as the financial implications and additional psychosocial stress for caregivers. In addition, negative experiences with NiPPV may be exacerbated by introduction of the therapy in an unfamiliar PSG laboratory with burdensome monitoring. Furthermore, a one-night PSG provides limited sleep data that may not be representative of dynamic and variable sleeping patterns that occur in the comfort of one's home. Recent technological advances in remote NiPPV monitoring coupled with a shift to virtual care models has enabled a patient and family centered opportunity to bypass the PSG laboratory and initiate NiPPV at home. Remote NiPPV monitoring extends data collection beyond discrete health care encounters and provides real-time data on adherence and efficacy that can be wirelessly transmitted to facilitate setting adjustment by clinicians. Home NiPPV initiation is increasingly being requested by patients and caregivers. The potential benefits of this innovative care model include increasing patient and family empowerment, improving the delivery of high quality patient-centred care at home, and optimizing NiPPV use. Although there is growing data in the adult population to support home NiPPV initiation via telemonitoring, this cannot be simply extrapolated to CMC. There are key differences in the etiology and manifestation of chronic respiratory failure in CMC compared to adults. Furthermore, family caregivers play an important role in NiPPV acceptance and adherence. Canadian guidelines acknowledge the lack of evidence for the setting in which NiPPV is initiated. Home NiPPV initiation in CMC is a novel model of care that may result in large health system impacts, but requires a feasibility study before embarking on a large-scale trial.

The aim of this study is to analyze the effect of dry needling (DN) on latent myofascial trigger points related to gastrocnemius on vertical jump performance (VJP) in female athletes. VJP is a functional and multijoint movement that depends on neuromuscular control during the stretch-shortening cycle. The neuromechanical hypothesis proposes that MTPs causes functional alterations in the muscle structure. The DN can decrease myofascial pain and improve the range of motion, contracture, blood and lymph flow, and therefore improving muscle strength (1-3). The current study hypotheses that the VJP will increase after DN treatment in latent MTP areas. This study is designed following two main criteria: it is an intervention study in healthy volunteers with non-structural myofascial dysfunctions with the intention of determining the effectiveness of the DN technique."

Recent studies have shown that in almost one-third of these infections the causative bacteria are not bacterial species normally associated with these infections. Thus they are difficult to treat as a consequence of the bacteria commonly used are often ineffective and sometimes can exacerbate the infection. This is of concern in some cases as these infections can seriously affect patient wellbeing and are sometimes fatal. There are no clinical tests used to look for the bacteria usually responsible and the bacterial species of infecting bacteria can only be determined by growing the bacteria under laboratory conditions (culture). Unfortunately the use of antibiotics can prevent the laboratory growing of the underlying causative bacteria and culture is usually unhelpful if the patient has already been treated with antibiotics. This limits our understanding of the range of bacteria causing these infections and may mean that antibiotics given to patients with head and neck infections are not always appropriate and do not offer the benefits they should provide.
This study aims to examine the bacteria associated with acute head and neck infections and aims to develop tests which can accurately predict the likely cause of the infection and direct antimicrobial drug therapy where needed. The study will collect bacterial samples from inpatients with head and neck infections presenting to hospital, this will provide samples to be used for laboratory research. These samples will be used to identify the bacterial species present and this will enable the researchers to predict the species present using newly developed diagnostic assays. These assays will be correlated with clinical factors known to be associated with acute head and neck infections. This information will be used to develop further tests which can accurately detect specific bacterial species commonly associated with head and neck infections, and direct antimicrobial therapies when needed in the future."

This study was performed in the period of 07/21/2021-30/10/2021. With the help of random sampling, 48 women ≥29 years old who gave birth and applied to the gynecologist and obstetric clinic of Tekirdağ University Hospital were included in the study. Using the questionnaire method, women who have not experienced involuntary urinary leakage under conditions of physical activity, lifting weight, coughing and sneezing for at least 4 weeks, women who have given birth and signed the consent form were taken, while women who complain of vaginismus, suffering from urinary tract infection, cancer, epilepsy or skin conditions with implanted pacemakers, metal implants and pregnant women were excluded from the study. Before the intervention and repeated after 6 weeks, subjects were evaluated by general questionnaire, International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-Short Form (IIQ-7) to assess the symptoms of urinary incontinence and their impact on the quality of life. The strength and endurance of the subjects' pelvic floor muscles were assessed with a Pelvexiser perineometer. With the help of an intervention model consisting of two groups, functional magnetic stimulation group (n=24) and pelvic floor muscle training program group (n=24) were formed. The study was started with pelvic floor muscle exercises after functional magnetic stimulation on the first day for the first 20 minutes. Then, the first week was completed in the study of functional magnetic stimulation, and the second, third and fourth weeks were performed with 3 functional magnetic stimulation and 1 pelvic floor muscle training program. On the last day of the fifth week, the study was completed for the first time. Subjects were evaluated for the second time in the 6th week. Functional magnetic stimulation was applied on the first day of the week for 20 minutes, the first week was completed during the functional magnetic stimulation day, and the second, third and fourth weeks were performed with 3 functional magnetic stimulation and 1 pelvic floor muscle training program. In the 6th week, the study was evaluated again for the last time after completing the 5th week of the treatment plan. The data obtained were evaluated using independent t-test, chisquare test, Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test. It was found that the two treatment options positively affected all parameters analyzed. The study suggests that both functional magnetic stimulation and pelvic floor muscle training are effective for urinary incontinence in women and their effectiveness appears to be similar (ScienceDirect, 2022)."

Current pharmacological treatments, while beneficial for many patients, do not achieve good long-term outcomes or sustain functional improvements in a large proportion of individuals. Moreover, 40% of PsA and RA patients are seronegative for rheumatoid factor (RF), with the same high burden of disease and same need for treatment. Therefore, the study main hypothesis is that the pathogenesis of psoriatic rheumatoid diseases can be stratified on a molecular level, leading to more accurate molecular targeting. The investigators aim to:
- Define molecular profiles to predict individual responsiveness to therapy to guide treatment decisions in patients with seropositive and seronegative RA and PsA.
- Determine disease development trajectories and predictive biomarkers of PsA in PSO at risk of developing PsA, in order to tailor preventive measures and monitor disease occurrence.
- Quantify the pathogenesis of different joint phenotypes by detailed characterization of cellular and molecular atlases of PsA and RA patients.
- Determine the molecular determinants of remission and disease activity through detailed characterization of cellular and molecular atlases of PsA and RA patients at a cellular and molecular level.
- Analyze the association between arthritis/joint phenotype and extra-articular manifestations and pathophysiology of PsA and RA and vice versa."

Background: Some degree of scleral and corneal toxicity is common after radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy as a treatment for Thyroid Cancer (TC). These side effects can be managed with topical lubricants, including artificial tears. Anecdotal evidence from several centers suggests that nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) may develop after RAI, which may have a direct impact on patient quality of life, in particular leading to epiphora (tear overflow). Treatment of NLDO may be challenging for patients, requiring multiple, time-consuming outpatient visits and invasive procedures. Objective: This study aims to evaluate the role of prophylactic Artificial Tears (AT), in reducing the incidence of new-onset NLDO in patients following RAI therapy. Study arm: All TC patients referred for RAI therapy will be asked if they consent to participate in this study. A total of 392 candidates for RAI due to thyroid cancer will undergo RAI therapy. Study participants will present to the M.S.K. ophthalmology clinic two weeks (±2 days) prior to RAI therapy for a baseline ophthalmic examination (including Schirmer I test and tear duct irrigation). Then, participants will be randomized to one of the following two groups: Group I (Experimental) will undergo a prophylactic treatment with AT, using artificial tears with preservatives (0.5% methylcellulose) for 4 days following RAI. The instillation schedule will be as follows: Day 1 (Day of RAI therapy): Every 15 minutes for 2 hours, then every 30 minutes for at least 4 hours or until bedtime at night, then repeated at day 2: Once every hour for 12 hours, Day 3: Four times (morning, lunch, dinner, evening), Day 4: Two times (morning and evening). Group II (No intervention) will not receive any treatment with AT in the 4 days immediately following RAI.

Rural, low-income, and women of color are at greatest risk for complications of high blood pressure in pregnancy and postpartum. To improve maternal health outcomes for these patients, the Alliance for Innovation on Maternal Safety (AIM) developed the Severe Hypertension During Pregnancy and Postpartum Period Safety Bundle (HTN bundle) which includes five areas of focus: (1) Readiness of clinics to change practices (2) Recognition of high blood pressure (3) Response to patients with high blood pressure during pregnancy or postpartum, 4) Reporting/Systems Learning to track data related to clinic changes and (5) Respectful Care to ensure equity and respect in care of patients. Initially released in 2015, The HTN bundle has been used by hospitals to improve recognition and treatment of high blood pressure in birthing people. The ACHIEVE (Advancing Community and Clinical Care for Childbirth-related Hypertension through Implementation, Engagement, and Valuing Equity) Initiative was developed to support outpatient clinics in providing more effective care to pregnant individuals with high blood pressure. Adapting this bundle for community clinics providing pregnancy care has the potential to reach more birthing people outside the hospital setting who are most vulnerable to complications. In the initial phase of ACHIEVE, the study team partnered with three rural Piedmont Health Services (PHS) clinics that serve mostly White and Latinx patients. The inpatient HTN bundle was adapted to fit their setting and re-named the Outpatient Hypertension (O-HTN) bundle. Additionally, a coalition was established to engage patients, clinic providers/staff, and the broader community to: (a) understand factors influencing maternal health including economic stability, education, health care access, and community context, (b) assess what makes it easier or harder to implement the O-HTN bundle in community outpatient clinic settings, (c) adapt the O-HTN bundle to fit those settings and populations, and (d) select and tailor changes to clinic practices using continuous cycles of learning, measuring and adapting to be the most effective and sustainable for the organization. Building on this formative work, the goal of the clinical trial is to determine the impact of three implementation strategies (training, coaching, facilitation) in 20 outpatient clinics in central North Carolina. Usual clinic care for severe hypertension will be compared to the care provided after a practice has 12 months of implementation support from the ACHIEVE Nurse Coordinator. ACHIEVE partners include healthcare leadership, clinic providers and staff, community-based organizations, and individuals with lived experience who will work together on this project. If the project succeeds in improving care, the ACHIEVE model will be shared across the state and nationally to support healthier birthing people and communities."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of [18F]-Fluselenamyl and its capacity to image beta-amyloid in the brain of healthy participants as well as in human participants with mild cognitive impairment of Alzheimer's dementia. The imaging agents used in this study include [18F]-Fluselenamyl for PET Imaging and [11C]-Pittsburgh Compound for PET Imaging. It is anticipated that these imaging agents will be non-invasive and have high spatial resolution thus enabling the investigation of disease specific biomarkers. This study will assess the sensitivity and specificity of these PET imaging agents in healthy participants and participants with Alzheimer's disease. The study will also investigate the ability to directly correlate these radiotracers with established biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease. The results of this study will have an impact on improving our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease and potentially uncover biomarkers to diagnose the disease earlier thereby aiding the development of targeted therapy to reverse the disease."

The aims of this study are to determine if active TMS, combined with behavioral therapy, is more effective than placebo to treat aphasia in Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA) and to improve daily-living activity, and mood and cognitive symptoms. 
The study aims to include 80 patients aged 18 to 80 with PPA who will be randomized in real conditions of diagnosis and treatment. The TMS protocol will be adapted from our previous clinical work with 4 sessions of active TMS and 4 sessions of sham TMS repeated 5 days in 2 weeks. The sessions will finish with a behavioral therapy specifically focused on reading and writing. All the patients will receive the treatment at home. The effect of treatment will be measured by FDG-PET imaging (standard uptake ratio), linguistic assessments and scales for daily-living activities, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and global cognitive ability (Mini Mental State Examination). The evaluations will be done prior to the initiation of the protocol and 3 months after the treatment to verify the long-term effects of the treatment.
This is a real-world proof of concept study in PPA but a controlled evaluation of the long-term effects of TMS in PPA."

Patients with post-COVID syndrome (PCS) are characterized by persisting symptoms such as fatigue and various cognitive deficits. Neurological symptoms are particularly common and have been suggested to be due to an autoimmune component. Since no treatments for PCS are proven, there is an urgent need to conduct well-designed studies. In this study the investigators aim to investigate the impact of a well-established immunosuppressive drug, Methylprednisolone, on the resolution of fatigue and cognitive deficits in PCS patients. Since many symptoms of PCS may have non-immunological underlying mechanisms, the investigators will use a placebo-controlled design to account for potential placebo effects. Subjects will be screened by clinical investigation and a cognitive battery comprised of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Scale (MoCA) and the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ). Randomisation will be conducted in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Methylprednisolone (including a tapering phase) or placebo for 6 weeks, followed by an additional 6 weeks of open treatment phase with Methylprednisolone after a 6-weeks treatment pause. The general IMP (investigational medicinal product) titration regimen will be followed to achieve consistent conditions with the verum (Methylprednisolone). Participants will be assessed at baseline, week 8, week 20 and week 52 by the respective questionnaires regarding cognitive, physical and mental impairment, anxiety, depression, mood, fatigue and quality of life. Investigators will check all participants at week 8 and week 20 for occurrence of adverse and side-effects. This clinical trial is of significant importance as it has the potential to benefit individuals with post-COVID syndrome (PCS) by exploring the effects of Methylprednisolone on cognitive impairment, fatigue and quality of life. Additionally, it may provide crucial insights into PCS's pathophysiological processes, leading to the development of more effective therapies and improved patient outcomes."

The main objective of the study is to analyze the causative factors of malnutrition in inflammatory conditions that complicate a chronic disease. It is a prospective, multicentre study in which patients over 18 years of age with DRM (Disease Related Malnutrition) and inflammatory condition caused by chronic disease are characterized. Patients who meet the selection criteria will be recruited, and 60 subjects will be enrolled. In each patient, blood parameters, nutritional status, body composition and physical performance will be studied at the beginning and after 3 and 6 months of clinical follow-up. An intestinal permeability test will not be performed due to the risk associated with the procedure.
The secondary objective is to measure the efficacy of an oral nutritional supplement rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as EPA and DHA, and the polyphenols of the olive tree (phenolic oleanolic acid) (EPOCH, POLEN) in improving nutritional status, body composition and physical performance in patients with both conditions of low energy (14 kcal/kg/day) and with a low protein diet (0.5 g/kg/day) and in patients with low protein supplementation (0.5 g/kg/day) and maintenance diet (25 kcal/kg/day)."

The investigators aim to investigate the effects of targeted financial support to healthy foods and food security on outcomes for high-risk, low-income Kaiser Permanente Southern California members with Type II diabetes.
Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups:
1. Intervention Group: The participants will receive monetary support for choosing healthy foods such as vegetables and fruits plus free home delivery of their food choices through the Instacart platform for 6 months.
2. Control Group: The participants will receive free home delivery of their food choices through the Instacart platform for 6 months.
The investigators will evaluate glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels at 6 months and 12 months and other study outcomes at 3 and 6 months after enrollment.
All participants will complete surveys on diabetes quality of life, diabetes self-efficacy, food security, health behaviors, and diabetes-related knowledge after 6 months and 12 months. Those participants who do not finish the study can choose to complete only the post-intervention survey. Participants who finish all study assessments will have their HbA1c at baseline (Enrollment Month) and at 3, 6, and 12 months after enrollment. Participants who do not finish the 12 months of the study will have their HbA1c at baseline (Enrollment Month) and at 3 and 6 months after enrollment.
The investigators hypothesize that participants in the intervention Group will have lower HbA1c levels, less food insecurity, improved dietary habits and quality of life, and reduced hospitalizations and emergency visits.
The investigators will examine associations between targeted financial assistance programs and health behaviors and outcomes at 1 and 2 years."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of the prolonged evaporation time of the solvent of two universal adhesives used in non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL) restoration. The hypothesis is that prolonging of the evaporation time of the solvent of the universal adhesive decreases the surface area and volume of non-carious cervical lesion restored with composite. This study will be conducted on forty healthy volunteers older than 18 years who present, in the anterior half of their oral cavity, 140 NCCL that need to have an occlusal restoration. Each volunteer will present 4 of NCCLs. The non-carious cervical lesions will be randomly divided into experimental and control groups. Four universal adhesives systems with water/alcohol and acetone solvents, respectively, will be submitted to the evaporation protocol of 5 seconds (scenario control group) and 25 seconds (scenario experimental group).

During the day people are performing physical tasks. These physical tasks can have an effect on the musculoskeletal system. The physical tasks and physical work demands can have a negative impact on health and work ability. This negative impact is especially significant when workers get older. Among senior workers, low physical work demands and low participation in physical activities are major factors to decline work ability. But there is no knowledge of whether these physical demands affect senior workers' health status and musculoskeletal pain differently. Work ability is one of the most important predictors of disability, presenteeism, absenteeism and the need for early retirement. This study investigates how work ability is affected by physical work demands and physical capacity among workers 55- 70 years old. The knowledge of how work ability is affected among seniors is necessary for better treatment, better counseling to the oldest group of workers and for improved guidelines on how to optimize the balance between the physical work demands and the capacity of the worker."

Small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer (SCNPC) arises in male patients with pre-existing adenocarcinoma of the prostate gland. There are no established therapies for SCNPC since most clinical trials have been limited as they require specific diagnostic criteria. Additionally, SCNPC is rare and occurs in patients that are generally less fit or of advanced age compared to those with adenocarcinoma. This study will evaluate the safety and feasibility of infusing autologous CAR T cells into patients with SCNPC. This therapy involves re-directing the patient's own blood cells to target their SCNPC resulting in shrinkage or regression of the disease. The investigational drug Bx (bone marrow harvesting) will be used to collect the patient's cells and lymphodepletion chemo-therapy will prepare the patients to receive CAR T cell immunotherapy. Patient's will first undergo a clinical assessment to complete the necessary study procedures and complete blood draws. Within 4 weeks of the screening visit, patient's will undergo leukapheresis to collect an adequate number of T cells. At the time of leukapheresis, patients may receive bridging therapy as determined by the treating physician. Once the leukapheresis is completed, patients will proceed to the next phase of the study and receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine chemotherapy prior to CAR T cell infusion. The CAR T cells will be infused through a catheter (frequently called a port) or IV. Patients will also undergo repeated imaging (including x-rays, CT scans, PET scans, MUGA tests) and blood work during the course of the study. Patients will also be contacted regularly to check in on their condition. Patients will continue to receive follow-up blood work and imaging throughout the study."

The traditional treatment for pancreatic ductal cell adenocarcinoma (PDCA) which involve both the gastroduodenal and splenic arteries is total pancreatectomy. However, recent studies have shown that distal pancreatectomy with excision of splenic vessels and gastroduodenal artery can safely be performed without compromising survival outcome. In this study, the investigators evaluated safety and efficacy of the new technique, Whipple over the splenic artery (WOTSA), compared with total pancreatectomy. This is an uncontrolled before and after study. There are few limitations of this study since only the short term outcomes such as the changes in volume of remnant pancreas are measured.

Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) often experience significant sleep disturbances. Sleep disturbances can exacerbate the symptoms of ASD and have a negative impact on their quality of life and learning. A commonly observed sleep disturbance in individuals with ASD is a reduced frequency and density of sleep spindles, which are an important aspect of sleep organization. Preliminary research has suggested that melatonin supplementation can increase the density of sleep spindles in children with ASD and improve sleep quality. However, this research only included male participants. It is crucial to test the efficacy of melatonin supplementation on female individuals with ASD as they may respond differently to the treatment, making the research findings difficult to generalize to a wider population.

The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of melatonin supplementation on sleep spindles in a diverse population of individuals with ASD. As part of this study, 50 (22 +/- 8 yrs) autism spectrum disorders (ASD) will be enrolled. All subjects will consist of 50% male and 50% female. Subjects will be on a stable regimen of stimulant therapy and will continue taking their ADHD medication as prescribed. Baseline sleep spindle data will be collected for four nights using a portable EEG device. Subjects will then take 5mg of melatonin for two nights and again have sleep data recorded for four nights using the portable EEG device. Sleep spindle data will be calculated using Artiste software and the change in spindle density during NREM sleep will be statistically assessed based on two group analysis (male vs female) using ANOVA. Sleep quality will be assessed using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). This study aims to provide preliminary data describing the effects of melatonin supplementation on sleep spindles in children with ASD, including both male and female subjects. By using a portable EEG device to measure sleep spindles over multiple nights, this study aims to provide direct measurements of changes in sleep spindle density, a key aspect of the study hypothesis. Additionally, the inclusion of female participants will be crucial for understanding the potential differences in response to melatonin supplementation between genders. This study may provide important insights into the efficacy of melatonin as a sleep aid in individuals with ASD."

Introduction :
Persistent velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI) is a frequent problem in children with cleft palate (CP) that may negatively affect the quality of their speech. Although velopharyngeal incompetence is still reported in 30% of this population post operative (1), it is difficult to define which anatomical abnormalities that may be present pre or post operative, will expose an increase of this insufficiency.
Despite anatomical abnormalities like a small velum, posterior and lateral wall abnormalities, a short or a high velum, it appears that the true determinant of persistent velopharyngeal insufficiency, which may affect speech, is not a question of anatomy, but rather one of muscle dysfunction.
In adults, this dysfunction can be well appraised by electromyography. In children, the only way to study it is by analyzing the anatomy and the physiology of the velopharyngeal sphincter, which may lead to an increase of VPI.
Few studies have characterized the motor skills of the velopharyngeal sphincter using magnetic resonant imaging (MRI) during articulation. Moreover, no study investigated a population of children that present different severity of velopharyngeal insufficiency. The aim of the present study will be to study this motor skills statically (resting state) and dynamically (articulation during phonation) by the MRI by analyzing different anatomical abnormalities of the CP. It will also be the opportunity to determine a relationship between these motor skills and the severity of velopharyngeal insufficiency and its anatomical causes.
Methods :
This is a prospective and monocentric study on children aged 7 to 12 years with Isolated cleft lip and palate (Isolated CLP) or Isolated velopalatine cleft (VPC), without syndrome and treated surgically before first or second year of age.
In this experimental study, the subjects will be divided into 4 groups :
- Isolated CLP subjects operated for isolated lip with a myo mucous flap will be scanned in a supine position.
- Isolated VPC subjects operated for complete or subtotal VPC at the age of 12 to 24 months will be scanned in a supine position. Two groups will be included : those with a soft velopharyngeal insufficiency and normal velum anatomy compared to those with a severe velopharyngeal insufficiencies and abnormal anatomy of the velum.
- Isolated VPC subjects with a normal velum anatomy and a soft velopharyngeal insufficiency will also be scanned in a supine position.
All the subjects will be scanned with a 3T MRI system (ACHIEVA 3T TX Dstream Philips®) and a 33 channels head and neck coil in the supine position using the 3D T1 MPRAGE sequence and the 3D VELO 3.0 sequence (echo time 40 ms, repetition time 254 ms). An elastic strap will be fixed to the forehead to limits movement during scan. A headset will be used to cancel the loud MRI noise and to communicate with the subjects.
On these acquisitions, the motor skills of the velopharyngeal sphincter will be analyzed statically, at rest, and dynamically, during articulation, by a radiologist specialized in the field of head and neck imaging. This analysis will be realized through measurement between anatomical points (sagittal and frontal planes in mm) (velopharyngeal closure distance, ratio between the diameter of pharynx at rest and during phonation) and by measuring the muscles involved by an elastic measuring tape (correlation between VPI and the muscles mass, thickness and surface) (sphincter muscles mass, thickness and surface). The measurements will be assessed 1 mm accuracy.
In addition, all the subject will be assessed by a speech therapist for velopharyngeal insufficiency using the VPI Scale with a score ranging from 0 to 5 (score 0 represent complete velar closure and score 5 represents complete velar incompetence with nasal emission). The subjects will also be evaluated by the pediatric orthopedist for the existence of an orthodontic treatment.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an immune-mediated and neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system. Older adults with MS present with a wide range of health conditions such as chronic pain, fatigue, depression, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. MS also presents with cognitive impairments, walking difficulty, disability, exercise intolerance, and reduced physical activity participation. The common approach for managing MS involves disease-modifying drugs, yet this first-line approach for medical management has little efficacy in older MS age groups (i.e., those 50+ years of age). Exercise training has been recognized as a promising approach for managing symptoms and improving physical and cognitive health in older adults with MS. A recent systematic review reveals limited evidence of moderate-intensity physical activity programs among older adults with MS. Notwithstanding, this review did not examine the effects of exercise training on cognition and mobility in older adults with MS. To date, there is a dearth of research examining the benefits of exercise training among older adults with MS. The current study proposes a remotely-delivered exercise training program for improving cognition and mobility among older adults with MS. The proposed research adopts an innovative intervention approach (via telerehabilitation) with rigorous design for evaluating the feasibility and efficacy of a home-based exercise intervention program in older adults with MS who have cognitive and walking impairment. This exercise training program adopts an innovative intervention approach via telerehabilitation and is convenient and accessible for older adults with MS. This research may have practical relevance for improving physical activity among older adults with MS through alleviating travel concerns and reducing environmental/social barriers. If successful, the proposed project will provide foundations for implementing larger, high-quality RCTs using remotely-delivered exercise intervention for managing the consequences of aging and MS and ultimately contributing to successful living with MS."

This study focuses on the effects of using an oXiris membrane for haemofiltration in patients who have vasoplegic shock requiring vasopressin support. The study aims to test the hypothesis that vasoactive angiotensin metabolites are cleared with haemodialysis using blood purification and to determine whether or not this clearance has an impact on mortality. The aim is also to test the in vivo stability of renin in intensive care patients with vasoplegic shock. The hypothesis is based on the results of experimental studies showing that the stability of the circulating renin is directly dependent on the concentration of renin available at the level of the renal circulation. These results demonstrate the major importance of the angiotensin metabolism in maintaining blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance as well as the ability of patients receiving oXiris treatment to decrease vasopressor support and reduce the severity of shock. The aim of the study will be to correlate these clinical observations with the results of in vivo and in vitro biological analyses."

Knee osteoarthritis (Osteoarthritis) is a chronic disease that affects mainly joints of middle-aged and older adults, particularly in those who work physically and who are overweight individuals. Knee osteoarthritis causes pain, reduced physical activity, and the impairment of function with a consequent negative impact on work ability and employment prospects.
The management of knee OA includes medication, joint replacement surgery, education, and exercise that includes strengthening and range-of-motion exercises for knee girdle and ankle-foot.
There have been many trials of physical therapy for patients with knee osteoarthritis, however, most of which have not paid attention to the important role of extra-articular muscles in the management of such patients.
Extra-articular muscle imbalance may have a major role in the pathogenesis of knee osteoarthritis as their imbalance may lead to biomechanical abnormalities that have been associated with joint dysfunction. The imbalance of extra-articular muscles may lead to decrease in range of motion and muscle strength, and increased pain through mechanisms such as triggering nociceptive neurones in the joint that convey pain to the spinal cord. Moreover, weakness of hip rotator muscles can lead to excessive load on the ipsilateral knee girdle while walking, resulting in degenerative changes at the knee joint. Weak, inactivated muscles at calf and ankle plantarflexors may lead to insufficient knee extension while walking that can result in altered kinematics and pain.
Although previous studies have proven the beneficial effects of exercise in patients who suffer from knee osteoarthritis, only few were focusing on the role of extra-articular muscle strengthening in this patient population.
Hence, the main aim of the current study is to investigate the effect of adding exercise for hip rotators and calf muscles to knee exercises on functional level, pain level, strength of muscles, and knee proprioception in patients who suffer from knee osteoarthritis.
The hypothesis for this study is that the addition of exercises for hip rotators and calf muscles, in addition to knee exercises, would provide better improvement in functional level of knee girdle, decreased pain level, improved strength of muscles, and improved knee proprioception than knee exercise alone."

Providing cancer care closer to home presents challenges for providers, with the need to balance the goals of increasing patient access to care and improving patient quality of life. Prior to the creation of the Cancer Center at Siteman Cancer Center (SCC) at Barnes-Jewish Hospital (BJH) and the expansion of its regional network of clinics (satellites), the SCC catchment area included most of east Missouri and all west and central Illinois. Now that cancer care is accessible throughout these areas, patients and providers have had the opportunity to consider whether or not care is being optimally provided at these sites. This study will test the hypothesis that patients prefer treatment at their primary clinical site, thus reducing the burden of travel, and that these patients and their providers are able to continue a successful treatment and monitoring relationship at the primary site. Eligible patients with multiple myeloma who are currently undergoing treatment at SCC sites will be offered a survey at the time of their next regularly scheduled visit by their provider. If the patient lives within the catchment area of an SCC satellite site and expresses an interest in exploring the possibility of care transition, patient and provider discussions to consider care at the satellite site will occur. At the same time, the patient is asked to complete a baseline survey evaluating demographic characteristics, disease status, number of symptoms, and preferences regarding care site. There is also a question to determine whether the patient can easily access their usual provider's office at the satellite site in regards to distance. A follow-up survey to measure disease status, symptoms, provider visits, and patient satisfaction will be distributed to each participant approximately two weeks prior to the participant's routine appointment. At that time all participants will receive a comprehensive questionnaire to obtain information on whether the patient completed the care decision as originally intended. Additionally, a sample of patients who transitioned to the satellite site, and a sample that declined the opportunity, will complete a survey asking for their reasons for their initial treatment site decision and their current preference. This information will be analyzed with a sub-study."

Introduction: Virtual reality has been used successfully in fields of physical and emotional rehabilitation, treatment of anxiety, and analgesia, as well as pain reduction in medical and dental settings. It is thought that Virtual reality can reduce pain and anxiety by providing a digital distraction for patients during procedures. Nitrous oxide is a standard treatment in dentistry to reduce pain during dental procedures or anxious patients. The aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness of Virtual reality distraction for pediatric patients undergoing routine dental treatment compared to nitrous oxide.
Methodology: This will be a prospective, randomized controlled, interventional study.
Design: Participants will be randomized to one of two groups based on which treatment they wish to explore first. The first group being, the control group receiving Nitrous Oxide and then the Virtual Reality distraction, and the second group being, the treatment group receiving the Virtual Reality distraction first and then the Nitrous Oxide. Participants will be evaluated before, during and after dental treatment using a behavioral scale, pain scale, and survey. The FLACC scale, Wong-Baker Pain Scale, and Houpt Crying and Movement Scales will be used to assess the severity of pain and behavior during the procedure.
Reasoning for study design: It is important to include both forms of analgesia to compare their effectiveness. The crossover design between the two groups helps further evaluate the relative efficacy of virtual reality distraction compared to nitrous oxide, and allow for a fair comparison. Repeated use of the same procedure is difficult in pediatric dental patients as they may require additional intervention or may refuse treatment on subsequent visits, therefore, the use of a crossover design provides the option of using both modes of analgesia in a reasonable time frame. A randomized design was chosen to ensure that participant treatment allocation was unbiased.
Outcomes: The rate of effectiveness, pain and anxiety levels will be measured using the FLACC scale, Wong-Baker Pain Scale, and Houpt Crying and Movement Scales. This will help determine whether the use of virtual reality distraction provides analgesic effects comparable to the use of nitrous oxide.
Significance: The results of this study may potentially lead to a reduction in anxiety and pain for pediatric dental patients. Further studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of virtual reality distraction compared to nitrous oxide and to compare its cost-effectiveness."

Malnutrition is a highly prevalent and complex metabolic disorder that affects over 1 billion people worldwide each year. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines malnutrition as a state of altered nutritional status arising from deficient intake of energy or specific nutrients, malabsorption, infections or inflammation, or imbalance between energy intake and expenditure. Malnutrition is usually associated with deficiency of macro- and micronutrients, infections and inflammation, or alteration of the gut microbiota. These conditions are related with chronic diseases, such as obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer. In addition, malnutrition in the critical period of early growth is associated with poor brain development, with permanent developmental problems.
Current diagnostic methods for malnutrition and metabolic disorders can detect nutrients as amino acids, micro- and macronutrients, but are very expensive and time-consuming. Other biomarkers that can indicate malnutrition include inflammatory markers or gut microbiota, but these diagnostic tools still have limitations, especially for specific nutritional deficiencies and infections.
A novel and innovative approach could be the use of microRNAs (miRNAs) as specific biomarkers of malnutrition. MiRNAs are small non-coding RNAs that are able to regulate gene expression and impact on numerous metabolic processes, including cellular differentiation, proliferation, and metabolic rate. The expression of miRNAs is often deregulated in pathological conditions, making them very interesting candidates as a tool for diagnosis and prognosis in many diseases.
However, a significant barrier for translating miRNAs into clinical applications is the high cost attached to large-scale miRNA profiling. Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow for the high-throughput sequencing of small RNAs, making it possible to analyze miRNAs in a much more affordable and reproducible manner than old techniques.
Using NGS technologies, the investigators want to generate a non-exhaustive and non-random set of 300 miRNAs using miRNAs array platforms and to identify biomarkers of malnutrition and specific metabolic disorders associated with infectious diseases for their association with inflammatory and infectious processes.
These biomarkers will also be analyzed in saliva and extracellular vesicles as these biological fluids reflect changes in the oral and intestinal microbiota and in host nutrition-derived signals.
To do so, the investigators will recruit 600 patients affected by malnutrition due to nutrient deficiency or excess and sex- and age- matched healthy controls, without malnutrition.
Clinical data will be collected via anamnestic clinical data collection form that will be administered to the participants, including general information (age, sex) and specific information about the onset and characteristics of malnutrition.
Blood, stool and saliva samples will be collected for the study using specific protocols to ensure the quality and integrity of samples for further analysis.
The investigators will analyze the expression of miRNAs in blood samples using a TruSeq Small RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina), and extract and quantify salivary extracellular vesicles, which will be analyzed for their morphology, composition and content.
The investigators will also conduct a metagenomic analysis of fecal and saliva samples, including the metabolic profile and gut microbiome.
Additionally, the researchers will perform specific immunostaining to study the metabolic phenotype and metabolic capacity of different cell types.
The investigators will not use any specific drugs and will only collect samples and clinical data.
All patients will undergo a full clinical examination under the guidance of a physician, to avoid any harm during the collection of samples and data.
In summary, malnutrition is a highly prevalent metabolic disorder resulting in significant health expenses and loss of quality of life. miRNA profiling is a reliable and affordable method to identify biomarkers of malnutrition and of specific metabolic disorders. Understanding these changes will help us comprehend how malnutrition modulates nutrient- and energy-related signals and how the composition and phenotype of the gut microbiota drives the onset and development of metabolic disorders. This knowledge could be used to predict and treat the effects of severe malnutrition on human health, to minimize the risk of associated infectious disease and to improve clinical outcomes from nutritional interventions."

People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) will be enrolled each year into an activity and exercise tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. The purpose is to gain a better understanding of physical activity engagement in this population through a retrospective analysis of 12 months of data. The project will consist of 160 patients (100 at UCMC and 60 at NLF) with Parkinson's Disease that will use commercial grade activity trackers and participate in an activity and exercise tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. This intervention allows us to evaluate exercise and physical activity participation and its changes over time. Outcomes will be evaluated based on activity and exercise tracking using commercial grade activity trackers. Activity monitors will be given to participants following baseline assessments after informed consent and survey completion at each site. The activity monitors will be worn on participants' waists for 7 consecutive days at baseline, 3-, 6-, 9-, 12-months. In addition to research-grade physical activity monitoring, participants will use their commercially available activity tracker daily and sync to the Datos Health app. Participants will be asked to perform a moderate intensity walk for one minute to test the accuracy of each activity tracker.

The data collected will provide valuable information regarding the efficacy of remote therapeutic monitoring for use in larger trials and in improving exercise adherence for patients with Parkinson's Disease."

Perioperative stroke is a significant complication after surgery. Unfortunately, covert stroke occurs in one out of fourteen elderly patients after non-cardiac surgery and is associated with an increased risk of long-term cognitive decline. In addition, overt stroke is associated with an 8-fold increase in perioperative mortality, prolonged length of hospital stay, and decreased quality of life. For shoulder surgery performed in the beach chair position, due to systemic hypotension and reduction in cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral desaturation events and impaired cerebral autoregulation can occur in up to 80% of patients. To address these limitations, this project employs multi-channel time-resolved (tr) functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (tr-fNIRS) to detect specific brain regions at risk of ischemic injury with greater spatial resolution and less signal contamination from extracerebral tissue."

Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) consists of alternately applying positive and negative pressure airflow during an invasive mechanical ventilation session. The aim of the MI-E cycle is to mobilize and clear bronchial secretions and reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The objective of this study is to determine if MI-E sessions can be safely and successfully given to critically ill adult patients using a standardized protocol. This study will estimate the proportion of complete sessions of MI-E in critically ill adult patients without a contraindication for MI-E for up to seven days invasive ventilation. Patient outcomes are monitored regularly. The secondary outcomes include safety, patient satisfaction, respiratory therapy delivery, and clinical outcomes. These outcomes will be used to inform a full-scale study.

Functional tricuspid regurgitation (TR) presents in patients with heart failure (HF) with preserved or reduced ejection fraction, which is caused by left ventricle (LV) systolic or diastolic dysfunction. TR increases cardiac filling pressure and causes right ventricular dilation, remodeling, and dysfunction. Despite the adverse outcomes of TR, there are few evidence-based therapies available for this condition. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors improve cardiac and renal outcomes in patients with HF and diabetes. However, there is no evidence for the use of SGLT2 inhibitors in patients with functional TR. This study will investigate whether enavogliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor, would improve clinical and echocardiographic outcomes in patients with HF with functional TR and preserved ejection fraction. In a prospective, randomized, multicenter, open-label, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 18 months duration, 554 patients with echocardiographically confirmed moderate or severe functional TR and worsening of TR on follow-up echo during the screening period, will be randomized to receive enavogliflozin or matched placebo. The primary composite outcome will be a clinically meaningful deterioration of the echocardiographic parameters of TR (i.e. tricuspid valve regurgitant jet area ≥20 cm2 or increase of jet area from baseline by ≥ 50%) in addition to hospitalization for HF or all-cause death. The study will evaluate the safety, efficacy, and effectiveness of enavogliflozin therapy in patients with functional TR and HF. To this date, no study has investigated the safety and efficacy of SGLT2 inhibitors in HF and functional TR. If our hypothesis is true, enavogliflozin therapy would be transformative for patients with functional TR."

Women's health services are provided by nursing and midwifery departments in health institutions. In addition, nurses have an important responsibility in terms of informing and giving information to the individual. Nurses who provide a health education service that focuses on the prevention of diseases gain important skills in terms of raising awareness about the importance of health to the individual.
In this context, people who work on health by guiding people to health are called health promoters. Health promotion is an approach that covers individual, social and environmental factors that shape health and that aim to strengthen the abilities of individuals and communities to prevent diseases.
It should be emphasized that as a whole, health is defined as the state of physical, psychological and social well-being. Nurses, who have a significant role in health, work to ensure that people remain in good health throughout their lives in all areas.
Premenstrual syndrome is one of the hormonal changes in women's health and is seen in almost all women. About 50% of the women who have premenstrual syndrome are between the ages of 18-30. Premenstrual symptoms affect about 70-90% of women's daily life. Problems caused by premenstrual syndrome are also seen in the work environment.
People with premenstrual syndrome may experience a series of symptoms during the premenstrual period. Changes that gradually disappear with the onset of menstruation in women are called premenstrual syndrome.
In this syndrome, anxiety, irritability, lack of concentration, depression, mood swings, drowsiness, sleep disturbance, breast tenderness, appetite change, bloating, headache, weight gain, abdominal pain, fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms are observed.
Since these symptoms negatively affect both the work and personal lives of women, safe and effective treatments are needed. In this case, many women report using exercise as a strategy to help them cope with PMS, and exercise is often recommended for symptom management.
Premenstrual symptoms can also play a role in symptoms by affecting the individual's food choices. Emotional eating behavior is defined as a person's use of food as an escape from negative emotions and can lead to many conditions such as obesity, eating disorders and hormonal problems.
Perceived stress is a state that is defined by an individual's perception of whether the stress levels they have experienced recently have been high or low. When the perceived stress is high, this situation puts the individual under physical, emotional and social stress. It is a state related to the stress one experiences.
The health promotion model proposed by Mc Leran et al. In the 1980s, health education was given based on this model. This model was researched by the researchers in the field of health promotion. This model is based on the fact that people have the right to have control over their physical, mental and social health.
This model is based on the fact that individuals have the ability to control their own health. The factors that the person encounters within the society are within the reach of the individual and can be changed. This model was created by nursing staff to meet the training needs of nursing staff.
The purpose of health education given by the health promotion model is to guide people in the best possible way, to ensure that they choose the path that is good for their physical, mental and social health. Since the trainings given with this model are based on the perception of individuals to their problems, it is possible to determine the success of the training.
The study will be conducted as pretest-posttest randomized controlled research and it is thought that the training given according to the health promotion model will both create a resource for nurse candidates and contribute to the literature with the findings obtained by applying this training to people experiencing PMS."

The prevalence of mental health complaints is high within the prison population. This is problematic because mental health complaints are associated with recidivism. The prison context offers an opportunity to help individuals with mental health issues as treatment needs to be readily available. A problem solving intervention PM+ can contribute to a more effective delivery of treatment. The PM+ program is a brief, scalable approach which is a valuable addition to the current Dutch prisons service. The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing PM+ for individuals imprisoned in Dutch prisons.
Based on the description of the outcome measures, it seems that the study is focused on evaluating the effectiveness of PM+ in improving symptoms of various psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, self-identified problems, quality of life, trauma, and suicidal vulnerability. Additionally, the study will also examine the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention, including factors such as adherence to the intervention, implementation process, recruitment, and consent rates. The results of this study will provide valuable information on the feasibility and effectiveness of PM+ in improving mental health outcomes among incarcerated individuals."

The Combinations of Olaparib and Alpelisib for Breast Cancer (COMBIBE) study is enrolling patients in a phase II trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the combination of the drugs alpelisib (BYL 719) and olaparib in patients with advanced breast cancer and no remaining effective treatment options.
Participants receive oral alpelisib and oral olaparib (PARP inhibitor) in Phase I; participants receive oral alpelisib and oral olaparib (PARP inhibitor) in Phase II. Genomic analysis of tumor tissue and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) are also required. Eligible patients will be those with advanced breast cancer and no remaining effective treatment options. The study consists of the following cohorts:
1. Cohort 1: Parallel Assessment of Olaparib + Alpelisib vs. Olaparib with no prior exposure to PARP inhibitors (i.e., PARP inhibitors-naive).
- Experimental: Cohort 1, Arm A (olaparib, alpelisib)
- Patients receive olaparib PO BID and alpelisib PO daily on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or bone marrow findings consistent with MDS or AML. Patients also undergo MRI, CT, and/or PET scans throughout the trial and a biopsy prior to treatment start.

2. Cohort 2: Randomized comparison of Olaparib - based combinations (olaparib+alpelisib vs. olaparib alone) in patients with BRCA-mutated or PIK3CA-mutated relapsed/refractory advanced breast cancer
- Experimental: Cohort 2, Arm B (olaparib, alpelisib)
- Patients receive olaparib PO BID and alpelisib PO daily on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or bone marrow findings consistent with MDS or AML. Patients also undergo MRI, CT, and/or PET scans throughout the trial and a biopsy prior to treatment start.
- Experimental: Cohort 2, Arm C (olaparib)
- Patients receive olaparib PO BID on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or bone marrow findings consistent with MDS or AML. Patients experiencing disease progression have the option to migrate to Cohort 3, Arm D. Patients also undergo MRI, CT, and/or PET scans throughout the trial and a biopsy prior to treatment start.

3. Cohort 3: Olaparib + Alpelisib in BRCA/PIK3CA relapsed/refractory advanced breast cancer patients who have progressed on 1 prior PARP inhibitor
- Experimental: Cohort 3, Arm D (olaparib, alpelisib)
- Patients receive olaparib PO BID and alpelisib PO daily on days 1-28 of each cycle. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 5 years in the absence of disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or bone marrow findings consistent with MDS or AML. Patients also undergo MRI, CT, and/or PET scans throughout the trial and a biopsy prior to treatment start.

This study will provide valuable information about the efficacy and toxicity, and impact on molecular features of breast tumors, of the combination of alpelisib and olaparib in patients with advanced breast cancer."

The prevalence of depression is continuously increasing worldwide. In Denmark, depression is the most prevalent syndrome in the population and a main cause of early retirement. While a clear majority of people who have experienced a depressive episode do recover within a few months, about 30 - 50% of persons still suffer from depression for many years, even for some decades. The syndrome of chronic depression is a serious burden to the individual who suffers and often also has significant adverse effects for the close environment, the society and the economy. People with chronic depression often report that their depression feels intolerable, even though they have been offered various medical and psychological treatments throughout the years. Moreover, there is a high risk of suicide ideation and suicidal attempts among those who suffer from chronic depression.
The current treatment protocol for people who do not recover from depression within a few months has not been evaluated systematically and consists of a broad range of psycho- and somatopharmacological agents, along with psychotherapy of various lengths and modalities. A recent review on interventions for chronic depression reveals a substantial lack of systematic and rigorous evaluation research in this field, despite an increasing body of evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews suggesting that psychological treatment might be more suitable than medication treatments for this population. However, so far no single psychotherapy approach has succeeded in changing the course of the illness and to make depressed people fully recover.
The last decade has seen the increased use in clinical practice of Schema Therapy (ST), an integrated modality of therapy that combines cognitive-behavioural and psychodynamic methods and has been developed for the treatment of personality disorders and related problems, such as chronic depression. ST addresses the development and maintenance of schemas, which are stable, habitual and overgeneralized beliefs, memories and emotions that guide the way individuals interpret situations and interact with others. ST is a long term therapy, in the sense that typically the participant attends weekly sessions for a number of years. However, ST has not been scientifically evaluated in a large scale for chronic depression yet, i.e. depression with resistance to treatment that results in more than 12 months of severe depression.
This project has two main aims. Firstly, to investigate whether ST is effective in reducing depression symptoms and improving psychological functioning and quality of life in the treatment of chronic depression. Secondly, to examine the mechanisms of change in ST, especially with regard to ST as a treatment option for individuals with early maladaptive schemas, i.e. those who have developed maladaptive beliefs about themselves and others.
The investigation is designed as a randomized controlled trial, comparing Schema Therapy with TAU (Treatment As Usual) as the comparator (i.e. the control condition). Both types of treatments that are typically available to individuals with chronic depression at the Capital Region Psychiatric Centre in Denmark and at the participating private clinics will be used as TAU. We expect that ST will be superior to TAU.
This trial also focuses on two possible mechanisms of change in ST. Firstly, to explore whether ST improves subjective functioning via changes in specific maladaptive schemes (self-critical, self-sacrificing, overgeneralizing/absolute schemas). Secondly we will investigate whether individual schema patterns, such as early maladaptive schemes, predict the treatment response. Thus we will examine whether schema mode patterns and the quality of schema experiences predict the change in depression and functioning in ST."

Acute respiratory failure is a frequent reason of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and mechanical ventilation. The ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) is a respiratory condition characterized by persistent hypoxemia, even with a large volume of oxygen. The treatment of ARDS has improved since the 80s, with the decrease of lung mechanical ventilation, a treatment itself risky of inducing parenchymal and pulmonary ventilatory overload. In addition to conventional mechanical ventilation, various techniques can be used to increase patient comfort, facilitate pulmonary gas exchange and reduce morbidity and mortality associated with mechanical ventilation, such as recruitment, positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) or prone positioning. However, they must be performed by specific healthcare specialists or in the context of a high-level center having developed them for a long time. Some studies have suggested an association between the quality of ventilatory management in the context of ARDS and a higher survival rate. In addition, some studies have reported an increase in survival with the use of a protocol by an ""ad hoc"" nurse. However, many of these studies are of modest quality or have important limitations. In a randomized, prospective multicenter controlled (RCT) with a cluster design, we therefore assessed the impact of a respiratory protocol used by nurses on ventilatory parameters in patients with acute respiratory failure."

Background: The South has the highest rates of new HIV diagnosis with disproportionally high rates among Blacks in the United States. Haitians are disproportionately affected due to social determinants including stigma, poverty and homelessness. This disparity is compounded for Haitian immigrants with HIV due to their unique health care and cultural needs. Haitian immigrants also lack representation in most of the existing HIV interventions. An engagement and retention intervention for Haitian immigrants called iENGAGE (implementing Engagement and Retention Gain with Education) is a structured and standardized patient-centered behavioral intervention, which includes a comprehensive, motivational, and interactive intervention delivered over multiple sessions. The iENGAGE intervention has been developed and tested for African American men and women as part of the first study arm in the proposed study. A culturally adapted iENGAGE to be delivered to Haitian immigrants is a novel and timely research agenda. Objective: The proposed research project seeks to investigate the efficacy of a culturally adapted iENGAGE to improve HIV outcomes (viral suppression) among newly diagnosed or nonvirally suppressed HILWH. The proposed research project builds on knowledge gained from the first study arm and focuses on the adaptation of the iENGAGE to the unique needs of Haitian immigrants with HIV living in the South. Rationale and significance: The proposed study is vital to the health and wellbeing of Hiltonians with HIV in the U.S. The proposed study is critical in identifying key facilitators and barriers to achieving viral suppression and will help to disseminate the culturally tailored iENGAGE intervention. The proposed project will have significant and far-reaching public health impact to promote health equity among this underserved population. Hypothesis: In comparison to existing care received, participants in the HILWH iENGAGE intervention for improving retention in care with optimal viral suppression will have improved engagement in care, viral suppression and outcomes compared to standard care at baseline and post-intervention (week 12 to 14 post baseline). Specific Aims: Aim 1: Conduct a needs assessment to identify barriers and facilitators to engagement in and retention in HIV care and identify key sociodemographic and psycho-social factors at community and individual level of HILWH. Aim 2: To pilot test a culturally adapted iENGAGE HIV engagement intervention by demonstrating feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy for viral suppression among HILWH. Project Design and Approach: This project is both formative and intervention study. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected from health care service providers and HILWH (AIM 1). The pilot health intervention (AIM 2) for 6 months will be evaluated pre- and post-intervention. A total of 30 HILWH will receive individualized coaching with motivational interviewing techniques. In addition, photovoice will be used as AIM 3 to gather qualitative data."

Endodontic treatment is the mainstay of clinical dentistry. When non-surgical endodontic treatment fails, the alternative is an apicoectomy. This is a procedure, in which the tip of the root is removed and resected, to provide an easier access and complete cleaning of the root. Successful apicoectomy requires complete debridement and a good seal during the final root-end filling process. Complete irrigation and cleaning of the root canals is the crucial aspect for the success of endodontic treatment and root canal apicoectomies. The traditional passive ultrasonic irrigation (PUI) is the current golden standard in root canal cleaning and irrigation procedures. It is considered the most effective non-surgical technique for providing irrigation and cleaning of the root canals to facilitate better access of the root canal fillers. However, PUI is associated with several drawbacks such as its inability to remove the debris and irregularities present on the root canal walls. Also, PUI is a time-consuming and operator technique. This study is aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of hydraulic inertial cavitation (Endoclean) device compared to the passive ultrasonic irrigation protocol in cleaning and debridement of the root canals for routine endodontic treatment.
This investigation is a prospective multicentre study, enrolling 109 patients with symptomatic apical periodontitis of permanent anterior or posterior teeth. Patients were randomly assigned to either the PUI or Endoclean group as arms 1 & 2, respectively. Arm 3 includes the conventional protocol as the control group. The effectiveness of these approaches will be evaluated using the Periapical Index Radiographic Score at 12 months and up to 2 years to ensure healing of periapical lesion. Safety parameters will also be monitored through pain assessment using a Visual Analogue Scale score and the need for pain alleviation medications for up to 7 days of follow-up.

The investigators and other researchers can access a wealth of previously undiscovered data through the development of machine learning-powered clinical decision support systems. The investigators plan to use AI to help improve the diagnosis of fractures, as they occur in approximately 1 in 3 patients attending an A&E department. The aim of this project is to develop an automated detection of fractures on X  rays, which would be accessible to non-radiology clinicians. This innovative technology has the potential to help doctors in the fast-moving ED and trauma environments to detect fractures more efficiently, speeding up their diagnosis and allowing them to treat the patient quickly and confidently. In the process, the investigators aim to improve the care delivery process and the patient experience."

A number of studies from emergency medicine, anesthesiology and clinical oncology have highlighted the effectiveness of the Z-track and Airlock techniques for reducing pain and drug leakage in patients treated with intramuscular injections. There are no studies on these injection methods in psychiatric practice. In addition, no study has examined the effectiveness of these techniques together in adult patient with schizophrenia on the same drug, Haloperidol decanoate. Furthermore, no study on schizophrenia has highlighted the factors facilitating or hindering the implementation of these methods and their consequences on therapeutic alliance.
Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of combining the Z-track and Airlock injection techniques in order to: reduce pain for patients treated with Haloperidol decanoate at Mental Health Community Centres; reduce leakage of the active product; improve patient satisfaction and therapeutic alliance; identify levers and obstacles to nurses' change of practice (feasibility and acceptability of the Z-track and Airlock).
The study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled, study, in 2 parallel groups. Experimental and control administration protocols will be standardized to harmonize injection practices between the different nurses providing care, and to control some variables. Nurses will have been trained in these protocols and in experimental injection techniques.
The experimental group will be offered an intramuscular injection using the Z-track and Airlock techniques, while the control group will have an usual injection.
The object of the research is the intramuscular administration technique of an injection - Haloperidol decanoate."

The Feasibility Trial of Preoperative 5-Day Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Primary Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) is the first international randomized study (RRCT) comparing 11+5 fraction preoperative radiotherapy to preoperative conventionally fractionated radiotherapy (CFRT) in primary extremity STS. By accruing patients from 20 cancer sites in the US and Europe, this feasibility trial addresses two challenges with conducting RRCTs in STS, the small numbers of patients with localized disease and the inability to achieve high accrual rates in non-commercial/academic clinics in North America. This study's goals and objectives are to determine the feasibility of accruing a 2:1 randomized RRCT. Achieving a 30% accrual rate of 120 patients (60 evaluable in each arm) within the projected 4 years will enable a conclusive comparison of the two fractionation schedules and allow investigators to design a definitive RRCT with the 5-year accrual rates of less than 7%. The trial's overall hypothesis that preoperative 5-day HFRT is safe non-inferior in efficacy to CFRT for primary non-metastatic extremity STS, is supported by evidence from a phase II trial at UCLA and an open label comparative analysis of 636 patients undergoing preoperative hypo and conventional fractionation published from the International Rare Cancer Initiative Group. The proposed trial involves a 4-year feasibility phase followed by a 4-year definitive trial if feasibility criteria are met. Preoperative 5-day HFRT is a promising approach that could increase the efficiency of care delivery for the treatment of STS. The proposed trial will evaluate if it is feasible to investigate a novel hypofractionated radiotherapy approach in primary extremity STS and inform the design of a potentially transformative study in this patient population."

Background: Hip replacement is a very effective and safe treatment for hip osteoarthritis. Total hip replacement is usually painless, but during the first day after the surgery, severe pain is common. The causes include surgery, the anesthesia used and other reasons. Pain and opioid use in the first day cause gastrointestinal disorders, depression, increased risk of thrombosis and urinary retention.
Objectives: To analyze whether the combination of Pericapsular Nerve Group Block (PENG BLOCK) and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block are safe and effective to relieve pain after hip replacement surgery.
Methodology: This is a single-center, double-blinded randomized study. The patients who admitted to hip replacement surgery will be included in the study. The cases are PENG BLOCK group and control group.
The PENG BLOCK group receive pain relief through PENG and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve block using intra-operative ultrasound in the operating theater. Pain control is post-operative pain relief through patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) group. This group is morphine PCA.
Measurement: Pre-operative data: collected information including general characteristics of the study patients including age, gender, weight, height, diagnosis, health classification according to ASA. Information was collected including pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, SpO2. Intraoperative data that shows the type of surgery, surgical incision, postoperative pain control method, postoperative complications. Post-operative data: collected information including blood test results (urea, creatinine, liver enzymes), pain score (Visual analogue scale - VAS - scale from 0 to 10, the higher the score, the higher the pain level. more), analgesic drug consumption status, respiratory and circulatory changes, adverse events, and analgesic satisfaction.
Pain scale includes the average VAS score (Visual Analogue Scale) at rest and on movement of both groups. The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) measures pain intensity. The VAS consists of a 10cm line, with two end points representing 0 ('no pain') and 10 ('pain as bad as it could possibly be'). Ask the patient to rate their current level of pain by placing a mark on the line. Time was recorded from initiation of catheterization or PCA insertion (H0) to after 72 hours (H72). Data will be analyzed using the software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), version 24.0. The average of the data will be described. The categorical distribution of the data will be analyzed using Fisher's exact test. The parametric data will be analyzed with the independent sample t-test for two groups, and the Wilcoxon test for two groups. The data will be measured and compared in pairs. A p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant."

Endometriosis is characterized by the presence of extra-uterine tissue at ectopic sites. Its diagnosis is essentially clinical and requires the association and concordance of signs and symptoms. Abdominal magnetic resonance imaging with MRI with dynamic sequences during pelvic pushing is a very sensitive examination for the detection of pelvic endometriosis, but few data are available on its mobility in the pelvis and on its correlation with symptoms.
The main objective of this study is to define a dynamic MRI sequence of the pelvis during pushing (DMP) to assess any mobility changes of the pelvic organs of women with suspected endometriosis who will be subjected to a magnetic resonance examination in routine care. The secondary objective is to see if there is a relationship between organ displacement and women's symptoms.
All women who have an initial pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examination for the clinical suspicion of pelvic endometriosis will be included in this study. At the end of the examination, a dynamic sequence during pushing will be performed. A subsequent pelvic MRI with a DMP sequence will be performed three months later in case of histologically confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis (after surgery in case of suspicion of pelvic endometriosis on MRI).
The investigator will check the patients' records for the occurrence of subsequent pelvic surgery one year later.
All patients without endometriosis found at the initial pelvic MRI examination will also be included in this study. They will undergo the same procedures as women with endometriosis during the follow-up period. A post-therapeutic pelvic MRI sequel in the presence of the DMP sequence will be completed in case of pelvic surgery.
Patients will be invited to participate in the examination after informing them. The data will be anonymized by masking. Patients will sign a consent form. All MRI examinations will be performed at CHV in Clermont-Ferrand (France).

Tang poems are not only for language learning, but also induce people's positive emotions. Traditionally, some Chinese parents teach the very young kids to recite Tang poems even before the kids know how to read and write. Reciting Tang poems resembles singing a song without understanding the verses, and some kids can do so better than adults. Tang poems sound musical and should be easier to remember and recite than other texts. Learning and reciting poems at home could be happy and fun family activities in Chinese families. Whether using fun activities on small groups of kids in a community setting to promote Tang poem reciting and happiness could have the same effects of Tang poem reciting in Chinese kids is unknown for non-Chinese. This is a pilot pre-intervention trial with no controls, with 10-20 South Asian children in primary schools (Grades 1-2, age 6-9) being recruited. In most primary schools, grades 1-2 students have not started learning Tang poems. Students and their parents will be actively approached by Hong Kong Christian Service (HKCS). An information sheet will be provided to the parents of eligible children, and their contact information will be asked. Parents give written consent if they agree for their children to participate. Parents will be invited to join the intervention sessions to show support for students' participation but they will only sit at the back of the room without active interaction and learning requirements. The intervention comprises three 1.5-hour sessions of Tang poem reciting and one session for participant performances. Experienced instructors from Bestreben Drama Association Limited will lead each session, and adherence to the protocol will be assessed by independent reviewers. Participants will recite two poems per session, with adjustments based on performance. Body language, sound, images, and videos will be used, along with engaging games, to enhance motivation and memory. Participants will receive stamp/sticker collection books and be rewarded for their achievements. Parents are invited to attend the sessions to show support, their role will be passive, sitting at the back of the room without active interaction or learning requirements. A final session will include a 15-minute assessment of poem recitation skills, followed by a performance session where participants can recite any Tang poem. Family members are encouraged to participate, and awards will be granted to motivate and appreciate participants and their families. Assessment will include pre-session assessments (T0, T2, T4, and T6) and post-intervention assessments after each session (T1, T3, T5, and T7). A follow-up assessment (T8) will be conducted 12 weeks after the baseline to evaluate the sustainability of outcomes approximately one month after program completion. Parents will complete questionnaires for themselves (Part II) and assisting their children (Part I). Parental presence and support will be acknowledged through supermarket coupon incentives. The feasibility outcomes will be reported descriptively and narratively, including the recruitment rate, duration, and retention rate. Descriptive statistics, mean (standard deviation) for continuous outcomes, will be reported for the secondary outcomes. The investigators will use content analysis method to analyze the qualitative data from the in-depth interviews. It is expected that those fun activities for reciting Tang poem may help promoting happiness and enjoyment in primary school ethnic minority students in Hong Kong."

Youth suicide remains an important public health problem. Suicide is the second leading cause of death among youth and the 10th leading cause of death among all Americans. Adolescents aged 15-19 years old account for 9% of all US suicide deaths, and the numbers are higher among youth aged 10-14 years old. Suicide prevention efforts have been hampered by limitations in current preventive strategies. Despite effective treatments, a significant proportion of adolescents with current depressive and/or anxiety disorders do not receive needed treatment. Moreover, most suicide attempts preceding a completed suicide occur within two years of making an initial contact with a mental health professional. These two limitations have led to a heightened focus on proactive interventions, or programs that support adolescents outside of the mental health system. Yet few programs have been shown to substantially reduce suicide. The purpose of this study is to design and implement a novel proactive intervention that supports adolescents at high risk for suicide before and after making an initial contact with a mental health professional. To do this, the investigators will develop a comprehensive digital platform that allows practitioners to integrate mobile sensing data and HIPAA-compliant client communication tools into their management of youth at risk for suicide. The investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial (RCT and feasibility trial) based at the intensive outpatient services (Intensive Adolescent and Family DBT program (Columbia Doctors)) to test the impact of using the Vira platform for patients versus treatment as usual control (TAU; i.e., not using Vira)."

Sadovsky et al. 2020 recently showed that light exposure with blue/green light at night in the evening suppressed melatonin production significantly compared to light exposure of other wavelengths or no light exposure. The degree of suppression was related to non-visual light input that affects pupillary size. Intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cells (ipRGCs) are known to be the primary sensors of non-visual light in the human retina. In this study, we propose to test whether age and sex modify the effect of light on circadian timing and pupillary responses.
Pupillometer studies and laboratory measurements of melatonin concentrations will be performed in women and men between 18-85 years of age to determine the effect of aging and sex on response to non-visual stimuli, specifically using red and blue/green light input to affect the retina. We will study 30 women and 30 men between the ages of 18-85 years of age. The study will be conducted with visits to the laboratory to perform pupillometry and measurements of melatonin and a brief online survey. The study will include 2 nights in which participants will wear a saliva collection device. Participants will receive a light box, and perform a self-selected light exposure during the evening before each night of study. Light exposure will be self-selected, and participants may choose to be in the dark for the evening period. There will be an additional visit on at least 2 days for pupillometry testing. A brief online survey will take about 10 minutes and the visit will last about 3 hours for pupillometry testing.

The outcome measures will be: 1) Change in pupil size in response to different light stimuli during pupillometry testing and whether age and sex make a difference. 2) Comparison of melatonin levels measured in saliva on a night with red light exposure and the following night with blue/green light exposure.

The knowledge of how non-visual light input affects circadian timing on an individual level is important for the prevention or treatment of conditions associated with abnormal circadian rhythms and hormonal imbalances associated with circadian rhythms such as chronic insomnia, depression, anxiety, as well as some types of diabetes mellitus and obesity."

Parents who have ADHD often struggle to raise children with similar disorder. Most existing parenting protocols have not been adapted to meet the specific needs of parent with ADHD, and they often fail to help parents reduce stress, manage disruptive behaviors, and create a predictable and organized environment for themselves and their children. This pilot study tests the feasibility and potential efficacy of the IPSA program for parents with ADHD. The IPSA program combines group-based education and a systematic approach to implementing new parenting skills in the home. It is based in neuropsychology, behavioral parent training, and occupational therapy. The investigators expect that participants in the IPSA group will report greater improvement compared to an active waitlist control group.

This study will test a technology-based intervention (Substance Use and Health Risk Intervention, or SUHRI) for youth aged 14 to 18 years with Justice involvement (i.e., probation). The primary purpose is health promotion with an integrated health-risk approach that addresses the interrelated topics of substance use (SU) and risky sex practices, within the context of personal relationships. This intervention represents a shift towards addressing health-risk behaviors of young people in non-medical settings with a focus on health promotion/risk reduction (rather than diagnosis and treatment of specific problems). The primary aims describe a two-condition evaluation where condition A is a single-arm, non-randomized arm designed to examine preliminary efficacy of the adapted intervention on the proximal outcomes. Youth aged 14 to 18 who are disposed to community supervision (deferred adjudication or probation) and meet eligibility requirements (1+ indicator of substance use, under community supervisions, English-speaking, and no indication of suicide risk or thought disorder) are sampled from a large urban Texas juvenile probation department. Protocol administration is proctored by a TCU research assistant at a private space within a juvenile justice office or mutually agreed upon location of participant's choosing. Youth are asked to complete all assessments and participate in the 4 individualized technology-based intervention sessions where youth receive information and engage in decision making scenario-based games about substance use, sex risk practices, and related health-risk."

Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (PPMS) patients lack effective therapies for their disease. Treatment mainly targets patients with active inflammation (relapses and/or gadolinium-enhancing MRI lesions) but do little to prevent disability accumulation in the absence of inflammation. Recent trials have suggested that RIC (Remote Ischemic Conditioning) has the potential to protect against neurological injury and may be suitable as a therapy for people with progressive forms of MS. RIC entails cyclical inflation of an upper arm or a thigh cuff for a short 4-minute periods of time 3 times a day. It induces signals or molecules that protect the brain. It is tolerable by people with MS and can be done for up to a year. RIC may have a role in the treatment of Primary Progressive MS. This study aims to find the answer to the question ""Is Remote Ischemic Conditioning effective at preventing disability worsening in people with Progressive Multiple Sclerosis when compared to historical (past) outcomes?"". This study will be the first to use the RIC device in a study of MS. We will perform the first study for the RIC for people with PPMS. RIC is inexpensive, non-invasive, and can potentially be self-administered by the patient at home - it can be easily integrated into daily life. A positive result in this study would lead to additional larger trials and eventually a widespread use of RIC in PPMS. This will significantly improve the quality of life of patients with MS and their caregivers. In this exploratory, single arm, futility trial, the investigators aim to demonstrate non-futility of RIC for the reduction of disability in people with PPMS.
. The investigators will aim to reduce the Timed 25-Foot walk at 12 months in people with PPMS by 10% or more who have undergone remote ischemic conditioning. If this is achieved, the study will deem the intervention to not be futile. This is necessary prior to designing large scale outcome trials."

Introduction: severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) is a severe form of liver injury that can lead to severe complications and death. Corticosteroid therapy represents the first-line treatment of AH, however, not all patients respond to this treatment. Identifying reliable predictors of response to steroid therapy could be useful in directing management strategies of patients with AH. Prothrombin time and platelet count are key hemostatic factors that may play a role in mediating the response to steroid therapy. In this prospective multicentric study the investigators aim to assess whether prothrombin time, at diagnosis, may predict the response to corticosteroid treatment in a cohort of AH patients. Design: the study enrolled, as prospective cohort, 55 patients with severe AH fulfilling the Maddrey criteria for diagnosis, no contraindication to corticosteroid therapy and followed at three Italian Hepatology centers (Turin, Milan and Rome), during the period November 2018- April 2020. The baseline characteristics of the patients were registered and blood tests, including prothrombin time, were repeated at the 7th day of hospitalization in order to monitor the response to medical treatment. Prothrombin time was evaluated to assess its ability to predict the absence of response to treatment at day 7 (Lille score <3 at 7 days). The presence of infection during follow-up was also registered.

The objective of this study was to compare the effect of functional task training and traditional functional therapy program on the gross motor function (GMFM), range of motion, and balance in children with cerebral palsy GMFCS grade I to II. The study was the randomized control trial done with 36 children with hemiplagic cerebral palsy, GMFCS grade I to II, aged 6-12 years. Outcome measures included the Gross Motor Function Measure scale (GMFM), goniometer, and Pediatric balance scale. For data analysis, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed to check the normal distribution. Based on the findings, 90% of the data of range of motion, Pediatric balance scale and GMFM had normal distribution hence parametric test was used. In this study functional task training was superior in improving GMFM (p = 0.00), range of motions (p = 0.002), and Pediatric balance scale( p = 0.00) when compared to functional therapy program. Functional task training is a cost-effective, easily learnable, and implementable therapy program for children with cerebral palsy. It would be more effective than functional therapy program in improving gross motor function, ROM and balance in children with cerebral palsy. Therefore, functional task training should be incorporated into the rehabilitation program of children with cerebral palsy. It will be also helpful for treating professional and to reduce the cost of traditional therapy program in developing countries settings.

Intrauterine devices (IUDs) have increased in availability and popularity. However, insertion of an IUD is considered by many to be uncomfortable or even painful. There is little knowledge of how to best improve the patient experience of IUD insertion. The investigators propose that pre-soaked tampons placed by patients with IUD insertion may provide localized pain control. This pilot randomized double blind clinical trial study will assess the effectiveness of patient-applied aqueous lidocaine via tampon as a pre-treatment prior to intra-uterine device placement to reduce patient reported pain and improve patient and provider experience. Subjects will apply lidocaine or saline placebo to the end of a standard tampon with a plastic applicator and then place the tampon up to 1 hour prior to the procedure. The tampon will be removed as the subject prepares for the procedure. The procedure team will measure the procedure time as well as the subject and provider impressions of the procedure. This data will be evaluated to compare the lidocaine to the control group.

Inclusion Criteria: Request IUD insertion, Age 18 or older, Willingness to return for procedure after completing virtual study consent. Exclusion Criteria: Known allergy to viscous lidocaine or tampons, Current vaginal or cervical injury.

Autoimmune diabetes, celiac disease and cardiovascular diseases have a prevalence of 0.2-0.3%, 1-1.8% and 2-3% in the world population. Since their diagnosis is delayed, at-risk population is usually identified by their first appearance of complications, and an early staging of these diseases, based on low cost blood tests with capillary and/or venous sampling, would thus result in the possibility of reducing the incidence of complications, as shown in several diseases, and their burden in terms of quality of life and economic costs. Indeed, recent studies have demonstrated that even a low-level of autoantibodies is associated with an increased risk of developing celiac disease and type 1 diabetes. For this reason, research of new screening procedures is of particular interest to early detect the disease. Moreover, if a blood screening program could be accepted by the public, it would result in a significant reduction of the overall costs. The aim of this project is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing an universal screening program for the most prevalent chronic metabolic, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases in a population-based setting. In particular, the main purpose of this study is to assess whether capillary screening for these diseases is feasible in a population-based setting and is acceptable and sustainable by public authorities and citizens. This study focuses on two localities in Milan, Italy, where the local population will be tested by a low-risk capillary screening program for blood glucose and lipid levels, and the prevalence of specific autoantibodies for type I diabetes and celiac disease. The main goal is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of performing an universal screening program for the most prevalent chronic metabolic, cardiovascular and autoimmune diseases in a population-based setting. We aim to recruit 4000 subjects from two Localities of Milan (Cerro Maggiore and Magenta) within the next two years. The primary hypothesis is that no more than 55% of the population will participate to the screening program, as it was observed in previous studies where subjects were summoned individually to perform the screening tests. Moreover, we hypothesize that all subjects enrolling into the trial will accept finger-prick tests for capillary sampling of blood levels, and venous sampling will be accepted by 20-30% of them. In addition, the feasibility of the research will evaluate the time required for each screening test and the results will be provided to the subjects within a few days. The ultimate goals of the study will allow a rapid screening of the population, and the reduction of the incidence of complications, improving quality of life and reducing economic costs."

Nursing mothers in Turkey are the primary risk group for smartphone addiction. According to the World Health Organization (2017), one in three mothers spend more than four hours on their smartphones daily during the first five months of postnatal period (WHO 2017). Additionally, mothers can experience infant colic and feeding problems (American Academy of Pediatrics (2012), Levent and Demircanl (2018)) which can be affected by maternal smartphone use. The aim of the present randomized controlled trial is to develop a smartphone cue-reactivity task, an attentional bias modification protocol, and an intervention plan to help nursing mothers who are at risk for smartphone addiction manage their smartphone use during breastfeeding. This study will investigate the main effects, and the possible interactions between nursing mothers' smartphone addiction, breastfeeding-related stress, and maternal-infant bonding."

This is a single arm study, which aims to develop new neuroimaging methods which will help to understand brain activity during both physical and psychological symptoms, and will contribute to the understanding of neurological and psychiatric disorders where these symptoms occur. This study will allow us to understand the brain regions involved in health and disease, and how brain regions are connected. We will achieve these goals using simultaneous electroencephalography-functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging at 7 tesla. The aim of this study is to perform neuroimaging in healthy individuals (N=15) and in patients with tremor (N=10), psychosis (N=10) and epilepsy (N=10) to determine how brain regions are connected in 7T functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging and how brain activity differs in the different disorders. Simultaneous electroencephalography and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging will allow us to examine the activity of electrical signals in the brain (EEG) and the activity of blood vessels in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) in both the same and different conditions in healthy individuals and patients with neurological or psychiatric features. This project is the first of its kind to use simultaneous electroencephalography-functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to explore the brain at a microscopic level in neuropsychiatric conditions, and will provide a new and powerful tool for neuroimaging. The results of this study will allow us to achieve a better comprehension of the brain and will have an impact on the management of neurological and psychiatric diseases, with implications for their diagnosis and treatment, and for the development of predictive models for the progression of neurological and psychiatric pathologies. Participation in the study will last approximately 5 hours in total."

The objective of this study is to determine the effect of weight loss on hepcidin levels, iron status, and inflammatory markers in individuals living with obesity and iron deficiency anemia.
This study will consist of two phases: Phase 1, which will be cross-sectional, and Phase 2, which will involve a randomized controlled clinical trial. 
Phase 1: Cross-sectional Study: A cross-sectional study will be conducted to compare hepcidin levels, iron status, and inflammatory markers in people living with and without obesity. Upon obtaining signed consent, participants will undergo a medical history assessment, anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), body composition analysis (% body fat, % skeletal muscle mass, % fat-free mass), and blood samples will be collected to determine serum hepcidin levels, iron status, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, lipopolysaccharides), and oxidative stress markers (MDA). Additional blood samples will be taken for biochemical tests (glucose, lipid profile, creatinine, urea, liver function tests), insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and, optionally, DNA isolation for polymorphisms determination and those associated with iron metabolism and obesity. Participants will also complete a food frequency questionnaire (SNUT).
Phase 2: Open randomized controlled clinical trial: This phase will be conducted to assess the impact of weight loss on hepcidin levels, iron status, and inflammatory markers in individuals living with obesity. Participants recruited for this phase will be selected from those identified in the first phase who exhibit iron deficiency (serum iron < 50 mcg/dL). Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. The intervention groups will be as follows: 
Calorie-restricted diet with macronutrient distribution: 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight in protein (including red meat), 50% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fats.
Calorie-restricted diet with macronutrient distribution: 1.5 g/kg of ideal body weight in protein (excluding red meat), 50% carbohydrates, and 25-30% fats.
Participants in both groups will follow the same dietary plan and will receive ferrous sulfate 200mg every 48 hours for three months to correct iron-deficiency anemia. 
During the initial and final visits, participants will undergo a 24-hour dietary recall, complete a physical activity questionnaire, and fill out a quality-of-life questionnaire. Additionally, anthropometric measurements and body composition analysis will be conducted. Blood samples will be collected to determine various biochemical parameters in the blood, including lipid profile (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides), liver function tests, glucose, insulin, creatinine, urea, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein and lipopolysaccharides), and iron status markers."

Pregnant women in need for maternal and/or fetal monitoring are hospitalized at the obstetric high care (OHC) of Máxima Medical Centre (MMC). They are monitored for up to three times a day with conventional cardiotocography (CTG). In the meantime they reside at the OHC, but the status of the fetus and uterine activity (UA) is not monitored. Nemo Healthcare developed a wireless abdominal electrode patch for measuring fetal heart rate (FHR) and UA: The Nemo Fetal Monitoring System (NFMS). Previous research on non-invasive electrophysiological CTG (eCTG) has yielded promising results in monitoring FHR and UA both during pregnancy and labor. With the use of eCTG technology, safe continuous 24/7 monitoring is possible, which is not possible with conventional cardiotocography. The investigators hypothesize that by introducing continuous antepartum eCTG monitoring perinatal and maternal outcomes will improve. The investigators aim to include 1911 pregnant women ≥18 years old with a singleton pregnancy between 23+0 and 32+0 weeks of gestation requiring hospitalization on the OHC for maternal or fetal surveillance (including 1400 historical controls). Additional objectives: The collected NFMS and demographic data will be used to develop and verify a mathematical model for the prediction of time until (preterm) birth, which may be used in clinical practice to reduce unnecessary OHC admissions and facilitate a better timing of interventions. Furthermore, data collected in this study (NFMS, accelerometric, annotated ultrasound) will be used for the development and verification of a mathematical model for the automated detection of fetal movements in NFMS data. This latter model might provide new opportunities in non-invasive monitoring of fetal health."

A number of rare, severe and life-threatening infectious diseases have been reported for which a genetic origin may play a role: these are mainly viral infections but also bacterial and fungal infections. These infections are often disseminated and can become fatal. The aim of this study is to identify the factors that could explain this predisposition, in order to enable the early recognition of patients at risk. To do this, multiplex families will be sought in consultation with the Regional Reference Centers for Infectious Diseases. A retrospective search will be conducted in the computerized medical files and in the biological samples of these patients, their parents, their siblings, the relatives of the deceased patients and the relatives of the non-related patients, living or deceased, who presented the same disease as the index case. The multiplex families will be sought in consultation with the Regional Centers for Infectious Diseases and virology. The collection of samples will be carried out in the same centers. The samples will be collected if a non-consanguineous multiplex family is found among the patients suffering from an infection included in the study (except for viral infections which do not have sequels). The genetic analysis will be carried out on the DNA and RNA extracted from blood and from the skin cell sample (dermo-biopsy only in some cases), and will allow us to identify mutations in genes involved in susceptibility to infections, but also in genes that modify the immune system.
Infectious diseases: Disseminated bacterial, protozoal or viral infections.
1. Bacterial infections (meningitis, osteitis, endocarditis, osteoarticular infection (HLA 1), septicemia, Lyme disease)
2. Infections provoked by a viruse
3. Infections provoked by a fungus (mucormicrocosis, Candidiasis, histoplasmosis, coccidioïdomycosis)
4. Severe infections from an exotic origin (dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever)
5. Infections in which the sequel is recurrence or chronicity (encephalitis, dermatosis, neurological, hematological, digestive, cardiac sequelae)
6. Infections with severe sequelae (encephalitis, dermatosis, neurological, hematological, digestive, cardiac, etc).)
7. Infections with a disseminated germ

The researchers conducted this cross-sectional study among married women living in Aksaray province, Turkey to examine the prevalence, type, and risk factors of urinary incontinence (UI) in married women and its effect on their quality of life (QoL). The study design is a descriptive cross-sectional study, and the population consisted of 206 married women living in Aksaray province, Turkey.
Those who agreed to participate were included in the research. Those who did not want to participate were not examined.
Demographic characteristics of the respondents, health status and related problems, socio-economic aspects of the participants, life history, lifestyle, habits, medical history, physical activity level, and UI and its related factors were surveyed. The UI symptom, type, duration, and risk factors of UI were assessed using the Female Urinary Incontinence-Short form (FUI-S) questionnaire, the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire-7 (IIQ-7) questionnaire, and the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (ICIQ-SF) questionnaire.
The prevalence of UI was found to be 35.1% in married women aged 18 years and over. The most common type of UI is stress UI, followed by stress-mixed incontinence, urge UI, and urge-mixed incontinence, respectively. The prevalence of UI increases with age, and it is also found that it is more common in those who are obese, have chronic diseases, have a sedentary lifestyle, and experience pelvic floor muscle weakness. The mean urinary Incontinence Quality of Life score was found to be 47.2± 39.5, with the lowest mean score in terms of sleep, sexual life, and body image. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, it was found that the use of diaphragm was a preventive factor for UI. It has been determined that UI causes social problems, dissatisfaction with body image and sexual life, and that it has an impact on self, interpersonal, and social aspects of the lives of women. It was emphasized that in order to reduce UI rates, social awareness needs to be raised, and people with UI, especially married women, need to be treated effectively and holistically, and multidisciplinary management needs to be provided.

Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is the most frequent condition, responsible for pain, disability and the loss of quality of life, and the leading cause of disability in developed countries. A possible strategy to prevent or delay the progression of OA is to repair articular cartilage focal defects. Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC) and Minimally Manipulated Adipose Tissue (MM-AT) have been reported to improve outcomes in patients with degenerative and traumatic diseases. While a vast majority of available studies support a positive effect on symptoms and signs, there are no rigorous studies that allow BMAC and MM-AT to be considered as standard regenerative treatment of knee OA. In the current study, the investigators propose to conduct an RCT to compare the safety and efficacy of BMAC with that of MM-AT as cell-based infiltrative therapy for knee OA. The investigators hypothesize that both BMAC and MM-AT could be effective in preventing OA progression and improving patient-reported outcomes. This study will provide fundamental data to confirm or amend the current indications of BMAC and MM-AT in the treatment of localized knee OA."

Cirrhosis is defined as fibrosis of the liver in which a dense fibrous network or scars replace the normal liver cells resulting in the distortion of the normal liver architecture. The prevalence of cirrhosis on the earth is still high (>20%) with most commonly etiology including the infections such as Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, schistosomiasis, clonorchiasis. Intestinal parasitic infections have been considered to cause many complications in cirrhotic patients. However, there is not enough data in cirrhotic patients of Sohag University Hospital. The present study design aimed to detect the pattern and prevalence of the intestinal parasitic infection in the cirrhotic patients as well as to compare them with the pattern and prevalence in the non-cirrhotic persons to define the risk factor that may affect it.
Here, we want to design a study to determine the difference between the parasitic pattern and prevalence of cirrhotic patients and compare it with the non-cirrhotic patients in Sohag University Hospital, Sohag, Egypt.
Objectives:
The objective of this study is to determine the pattern and prevalence of the intestinal parasitic infection among cirrhotic patients with and without GIT symptoms in Sohag University Hospital.
Methods:
Patients and Methods:
Cases group: Case will be assigned to the hundred cirrhotic patients with gastrointestinal symptoms or without will be included during the period of study time (July 2019 to March 2020). The patients' data will be collected (name, age, sex, parity, residence, profession) and the patients will be subjected to history taking, physical examination, parasitological examination of the stool, and the patient will be subjected to the full clinical liver assessment according to the guidelines of the American association for the study of the liver.
Control group: The control group will be one hundred patients with GIT complaints but not have any cormorbidity and will be divided into another arm.
The parasitological examinations of the stool will be done as follows:
The patient will be invited to submit two sets of stools to be examined separately for Ova& parasitic eggs. The first examination set should be taken from the patient while presenting their problem, and in the case of absence of the sample, the sample will be given home. The second examination set should be taken after one month from the first sample.
Finally, the final diagnosis will be achieved according to the Egyptian guideline for the liver.
The Ethical committee of the Sohag University will be presented with our study protocol, and it is expected that ethical approval will be achieved.
The study duration will take 5 months to collect the data and samples, and the results will be announced after a time interval of 12 months from the submission of this study.
Data Analysis:
The collected data will be processed and analyzed statistically using Microsoft excel version 10 and the software program Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 20. Descriptive analysis such as absolute and relative percentages will be used to describe the results.

This study will allow us to detect the pattern of intestinal parasitic infection in the cirrhotic patients in Sohag University Hospital, Sohag, Egypt, and the risk factors that may cause it.
As a result, the study will find that there is an increase of the intestinal parasitic infections in the cirrhotic patients with a frequency of 30% to 35%, and the differences detected in the intestinal parasitic infection pattern between cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients will be due to the differences of the risk factors found in the study.
The results will be published in a peer-reviewed medical journal, and the patients will be informed about their liver health and preventive measures to reduce the risk of transmission of intestinal parasitic infection."

Purpose:
The purpose of the current trial is to compare the effect of adding intraocular gas tamponade (IFT) versus sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) gas tamponade versus perfluoropropane (C3F8) gas tamponade versus scleral buckle (SB) during combined vitrectomy /SB for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD).
The need for retinal reattachment surgery is one of the most common surgical eye emergencies. The most frequent cause of retinal detachment is a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD), a separation of the retina from the adjacent choroid and sclera. RRD is due to a defect in the retina allowing subretinal fluid to accumulate, leading to retinal detachment.
In the past, standard treatment of RRD was a combination of PPV and SB. However, with advances in the surgical technique and better treatment of vitreoretinopathy by PPV, the role of SB is becoming more debatable.
Intravitreal gas tamponade (ITG) as an adjunct to vitrectomy provides a tamponade effect to the vitreous cavity and facilitates adequate time for retinal adhesion. The tamponade effect also aids in maintaining anatomic integrity of the retina and provides time for the fibroglial substrate of the retina to undergo healing in cases where a retinal detachment occurs. In vitreoretinal surgery, the application of ITG allows for adequate time for the retina to reattach. The duration of exposure of intraocular gas to the globe is short because the gas disappears once absorbed by the peritoneal fluid. The inert nature of gas allows for a reduction in intraocular pressure over time in conjunction with the healing process.
Despite the advantages of using gas tamponade in the treatment of RRD, there are potential postoperative complications associated with gas including gas migration; gas bubble-related problems such as gas bubble opacification, gas bubble-related pain, and gas bubble-related discomfort to the eye and/or visual acuity impairment. Hence, the current trial investigates ways to help avoid issues with standard SF6 while taking advantage of the good properties attributed to C3F8. Based on the potential advantages of each treatment option and their inherent risks, it was decided to compare the 4 combined treatment options used in this trial in patients with RRD who are eligible for combined PPARV plus SB. It remains therefore to be decided whether these potential complications are outweighed by the increased benefit that the retina adherence obtained with the use of gas tamponade provides. The ultimate goal of this evaluation is to determine the best practice with regards to the use of combined PPARV plus SRT in standard retinal surgery and ultimately in improving the overall visual outcomes of these patients."

Research studies show that pregnant women with restless legs syndrome (RLS) experience the same complaints as non-pregnant people with restless legs syndrome. They report an increase in restless legs syndrome complaints during pregnancy, and it increases with gestational age. RLS complaints cause insufficient sleep, severe sleep disturbance and, as a result, a decrease in their quality of life. Women with restless legs syndrome who have severe sleep problems have high frequencies of depression, chronic fatigue and anxiety compared to women who do not complain about restless legs syndrome.
Pregnancy also causes an increase in the number of complaints about edema in pregnant women. The most common place of edema is the swelling of the feet of pregnant women. The most effective way to prevent swelling of the legs and feet is to use pressure socks during pregnancy.
It has been found that RLS complaints in pregnant women decrease with the effect of pressure socks. Pressure stockings increase blood flow in the legs and feet, prevent swelling. It is seen that compression stockings provide relief in the lower extremity edema which is the most common complaint in pregnancy and is effective in reducing the edema complaints in non-pregnant patients.
Pressure stockings have also been used in other areas. For example it is used in patients with edema complaints in the legs and feet, in patients undergoing cancer chemotherapy to prevent or reduce edema complaints in the feet, in patients with peripheral neuropathy in diabetes or other chronic complaints and in patients during long air flights, to prevent thrombosis complaints in the legs and feet. In patients with chronic neuropathy complaints in various areas and in other patients with complaints in the feet and legs due to chronic complaints; Pressure stockings are used to relieve these symptoms. In patients with diabetes, it is shown that the severity of diabetic neuropathy increases after the use of compression stockings in diabetic feet and legs.
In the scientific literature, it was not found in the database whether the sleep quality of pregnant women with RLS was effected by using pressure stockings.
In this study, which was planned to understand whether pressure stockings were used in pregnant women with restless legs syndrome, it was aimed to investigate whether these complaints would improve or change the quality of sleep of pregnant women and whether the quality of sleep would be increased.
The investigators aimed to compare the scores of the RLS Severity Rating Scale (RLSSRS) questionnaire, which is a validated scale for the evaluation of restless legs syndrome symptoms and the global scores of Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), which is a validated scale to evaluate sleep quality. The investigators compared the effects of using pressure stockings on the RLS severity and the quality of sleep in pregnant women.
After the necessary permission was obtained, a total of 60 pregnant women with RLS complaints with normal sleep patterns, including pregnant cases in the antenatal clinic of the Kahraman Maras State Hospital Department of Obstetric and Gynecology, and with a gestational age of 27 weeks or above, were included in the study. The cases who volunteered to participate in the study were included in the study after the patient information form, the PSSQRS scale in pregnancy, anemia, hemoglobin level, medical and obstetric history were evaluated. After the information form was completed and the scale and anemia were completed, pregnant women with RLS symptoms and quality of sleep complaints were included in the study. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups, the compression stocking group and the control group with knee socks, after the necessary randomizations were made. The 10 patients in each group were followed-up for 21 days. The PSQI and the RLS severity scale scale were evaluated in the first and 21st week. The scales were applied to the patients face to face. The scale data obtained from the patients in the study were recorded on the data collection form prepared for this purpose."

Postoperative pain following lumbosacral surgeries not only contributes to significant morbidities but also hampers early mobilization. Perioperative opioids, though relieve pain but hampers consciousness, increase PONV and delays mobilization. Caudal epidural block can be effectively given preemptively to alleviate pain and facilitate early mobilization. Caudal epidural block places the needle through the sacral hiatus into the epidural space to deliver medications. It can be performed as ultrasound guided procedure with very high successful rates. Single shot caudal block with local anesthetic (e.g. Bupivacaine, Ropivacaine or Levobupivacaine) provides analgesia for 2-4 hours but this can be further prolonged by adding adjuvants like opioids, steroids, ketamine, alpha 2 agonists, adrenaline etc. Ropivacaine is a long-acting amide local anesthetic agent which is less lipophilic, less cardiac and central nervous system toxicity with similar duration of analgesia, has lesser motor blockade and facilitates earlier mobilization than bupivacaine. Dexamethasone is a highly potent, long acting glucocorticoid. Caudal dexamethasone prolongs the analgesic duration of the ropivacaine. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role of pre-emptive caudal epidural analgesia for postoperative pain relief in lumbosacral surgeries and to compare the effect of adding dexamethasone to ropivacaine with respect to quality of analgesia, duration of analgesia, hemodynamic effects and associated side effects. Patients will be allocated in one of the two groups, I and II, consisting of 30 each, using a lottery based random number. A box containing 60 chits, with 30 labelled as group I and other 30 as group II, will be given to each patient and will be asked to take out 1 chit. The group allocated will be written in separate paper by an anesthesiologist, who will also prepare drugs. Decoding will be done later after completion of all data collection.The patient in Group I will be given caudal epidural injection with 0.25% ropivacaine 20 ml containing dexamethasone 8 mg (0.5% Ropivacaine 10 ml + 8 mg/2 ml Dexamethasone + 8 ml NS) and group II will be give 0.25% ropivacaine 20 ml. All the data collection will be done by another anesthesiologist, not involved in group allocation, drug preparation and administration."

This study is planned to determine the effect of nursing care based on kolcaba's comfort theory on the comfort, care satisfaction, and sleep quality of intensive care patients. In this experimental, randomized, single-blind, controlled study; 40 patients who stayed in the intensive care for at least 24 hours in a tertiary teaching hospital in Istanbul were included as a convenience sample. Patients applied to the intensive care unit who met the criteria and accepted to participate in the study were examined immediately on arrival. In the application process, individuals in the experimental group received care based on Kolcaba's comfort theory and comfort behavior checklist during their stay in the ICU. The control group received standard care in the ICU. Data were collected by the researchers who did not know the study groups. 

In a single-blinded manner, data were collected from patients in intensive care. The General Comfort Questionnaire, the Comfort Behaviors Checklist, the Newcastle Satisfaction Scale revised by Hakan Kügelü (1997) and Richards-Campbell Sleep Quality Scale (Richards et al., 1998)."

Injuries are the fourth leading cause of death in children and one of the biggest contributors to the global burden of disease. Over 90% of these injury deaths and global burden of disease are in low and middle income countries, including Tanzania. In the Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania, over 1000 children die every year from severe injuries. Over 50% of these deaths can be prevented by timely access to high quality life-saving care. Children die because they do not receive the high-quality, necessary care they need. The Pediatric Injury Knowledge, Innovation, Design (P-Kids) study is a mixed-methods implementation research study aiming to address health systems factors that hinder timely access to life-saving care for our youngest injured patients. The interdisciplinary and intercontinental team is working across two facilities in the Kilimanjaro region of Tanzania to improve timely access to care through a comprehensive health systems intervention.
The investigators will gather formative research findings to guide development and refinement of a contextually appropriate, evidence-driven health systems intervention integrating the Basic Emergency Care and Pediatric Resuscitation and Trauma Outcome (PROMIS) model. The investigators will then pilot the innovation in healthcare providers and facilities in Tanzania."

The hypothesis of this study is that a very short-course of antibiotics for acute cholangitis is non-inferior to a course of 4 to 7 days after adequate biliary drainage. This study is designed as a multicenter non-inferiority randomized controlled trial. Patients will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (one day of antibiotic therapy after ERCP) or the comparator group (4 to 7 days of antibiotic therapy after ERCP). The primary outcome measure will be the clinical cure rate of acute cholangitis without relapse at 14 days. This will be compared to a non-inferiority margin (difference in cure rates between groups of 5%) and with the international Tokyo Guidelines. If this is not achieved, then the one day group is not adequate to treat cholangitis resulting in unnecessary overtreatment with antibiotics.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Studies conducted on the cardiorespiratory complications in morbidly obese patients undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery reported different results of intraoperative Oxygen saturation and haemodynamic status. The routine use of lung expansion maneuvers has been advocated for the prevention of atelectasis and atelectrauma in obese patients. The standard lung expansion maneuver is the application of a PEEP followed by several inflations with a manual bag-valve device, which requires manual ventilation. Ultrasound is a novel tool to assess regional changes in lung morphology. Several studies have been performed for intraoperative lung ultrasound monitoring to detect the occured lung atelectasis and the potential application of lung ultrasound-guided lung recruitment maneuvers. The study will be conducted on morbidly obese adult patients scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Lung ultrasound score will be performed every intraoperative hour by one of the investigators, an anesthesiologist who have been well trained and certified by the ultrasound department of the university hospital. Patients enrolled will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: two intervention groups in which the lung recruitment maneuver will be given with the help of lung ultrasound when atelectasis detected by lung ultrasound, or when the lung recruitment maneuver will be applied routinely at different times of surgery. The third group will receive only mechanical ventilation. The investigator who will assess the primary outcome (lung ultrasound score) will be blinded from the intraoperative treatment assigned to the patients.

Inclusion criteria: adult morbidly obese patients of BMI more than 40, scheduled for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. Exclusion criteria: patient refusal, patients with history of severe obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease, patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), presence of emphysematous lung bullae, decompensated cardiac disease (NYHA class 3 or 4), patients with uncontrolled hepatic or renal disorders."

Optimization of Fractionation Schedules of Heel Spur Radiotherapy

Detailed Description
-----------------
This study evaluates dose and fractionation schedule in radiotherapy of painful heel spur. One of the advantages of low dose external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) is its anti-inflammatory effect. Current treatment practice consists of administering low dose EBRT in a fractionated scheme. There are data showing dose effectiveness correlation. The fractionation schema of Heel Spur Radiotherapy treatment currently in use is not clearly defined.. Our study aim is to compare the efficacy and safety of different fractionation schemes and single doses. It is planned to treat 106 patients with chronic pain heel spur in six fraction dosing schemes and in one dose-fraction. Radiotherapy will be administered as outpatient procedure. Patients of 40 years of age and older, eligible for radiotherapy, diagnosed with heel spur for at least six months and having painful heel will be enrolled. The primary endpoint is pain relief measured by Calcaneodynia sum score. We will also analyze the questionnaires."

This protocol has been developed in a collaborative transnational effort. The investigators work within a network of internationally experienced multidisciplinary researchers, who have previously cooperated on CLBP research. The first aim of the trial is to verify the effectiveness of the intervention targeting overweight/obese people with CLBP, based on the primary hypothesis that the lifestyle Intervention (including PNE & CTET) is superior in reducing pain levels at 12 months post-treatment compared to the standard (PNE & CTET) in overweight/obese people with CLBP. The second aims of the trial are to examine the effects of the lifestyle Intervention on 1) pain interference, pain distribution and pain beliefs, 2) on anthropometrics, 3) on energy balance related behavior (24h continuous activity monitoring, dietary intake and sleep) and finally 4) on health economics (heath care utilization, productivity loss and quality of life). A secondary hypothesis is that the lifestyle Intervention targeting overweight/obesity contributes to the cumulative effect compared to the standard PNE & CTET intervention in improving pain related outcomes."

Gastroparesis is a clinical syndrome in which the stomach has impaired coordination of muscle contractions. The prevalence of gastroparesis is estimated to be 3% of the population in the United States. G-POEM is a novel therapeutic approach for patients with refractory (persistent symptoms for >6 months refractory to medical therapy) and severe gastroparesis based on GCSI > 2. In previous retrospective studies and a single randomized controlled trial, clinical symptoms significantly improved after G-POEM. However, only one study compared single versus double pyloromyotomy. It showed a higher clinical response rate after 3 to 6 months of two-portal pyloromyotomy (double pyloromyotomy) compared with one-portal pyloromyotomy (single pyloromyotomy). However, the follow-up reported in a small number of patients and the long-term outcomes and the durability of the different techniques between single versus double pyloromyotomy have not been investigated. Therefore, our hypothesis is that the double pyloromyotomy technique results in a significantly higher clinical success rate compared with the single pyloromyotomy in patients with refractory and severe gastroparesis undergoing endoscopic per-oral myotomy. In this randomized controlled prospective multicenter study, we aim to compare clinical outcomes and the efficacy of single versus double pyloromyotomy in G-POEM for refractory and severe gastroparesis."

This pilot study will investigate whether, in participants with chronic spinal cord injury, exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia followed by transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) applied in conjunction with resistance training and grip strength training, results in larger respiratory and upper limb strength gains compared to a placebo (sham) tSCS treatment. In this pilot study, 12-14 participants with complete (C7-C8) or incomplete (C6-T9) spinal cord injury will be recruited. All participants will undergo baseline measurements of respiratory and hand-grip strength, as well as measures of neural circuitry responsible for respiratory drive [i.e., transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and cervical magnetic stimulation (CMS)]. After the baseline assessment, participants will undergo three experimental sessions where AIHH immediately precedes or follows tSCS delivered via surface electrodes. Within each tSCS/AIHH condition, participants will breathe normally for the first 60-75 seconds, followed by 4 minutes of normoxia and 4 minutes of AIHH. After the ventilation protocol, participants will undergo 20 minutes tSCS interspersed with grip strength training (3 x 10-second repetitions/min) performed bilaterally. The experimental intervention will be randomized using a crossover design, where participants will complete a total of 9 sessions (A, B and A, B and C). Session A will consist of AIHH followed by tSCS. Session B will be sham AIHH followed by sham tSCS, whereas Session C will be normal air followed by placebo tSCS. Participants will be kept blind regarding the sequence of intervention. The AIHH/tSCS sessions will be separated by ≥ 1 week for washout.
To investigate changes in neural circuitry related to respiratory, arm and hand movement, participants will be assessed again immediately after the intervention, and will be reassessed 2 weeks post intervention. After each experimental sessions, all participants will be asked to provide feedback via a survey about their comfort levels and experiences."

The human brain consumes nearly 20% of the body's oxygen and glucose during wakefulness. Its supply and demand are tightly coupled and this coupling is called the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen consumption (CMRO2). The human brain maintains CMRO2 stability under normal conditions and consumes more oxygen when performing cognitive tasks. When the brain is exposed to a lack of oxygen, or an excessive amount of carbon dioxide, or when its blood-flow is reduced, CMRO2 will decrease and the relative oxygen extraction by the brain (OEF) will increase, resulting in ischemic events such as strokes. The relative oxygen extraction by the brain is used clinically as a tool to detect brain ischemia.

In anesthesia and intensive care setting, hemodynamic, metabolic and neural conditions may change rapidly, and thus it is crucial to accurately detect and respond to CMRO2 changes in real-time. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effects of anesthetic maintenance agents and vasopressors on the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolic rates during surgery.
In recent decades, research on monitoring brain activity and metabolic status has moved beyond studying the brain's activity or disease, to studying the relationship between brain function, brain metabolism and the environment of the brain, such as blood perfusion. New non-invasive brain monitoring technologies which are relatively cheap have attracted the attention of many investigators. However, the majority of these studies only use signals from the scalp surface, which provides information about the metabolic status of scalp but not brain tissue itself.

A new developed device that combines two signal-measuring technologies in a single unit, the time-resolved (tr)NIRS device, is able to provide continuous monitoring of cerebral blood flow (CBF) and hemoglobin-oxygen saturation at the same time. In addition to CBF, complementary diffuse correlation spectroscopy (DCS) is applied, which monitors the microvascular blood flow (i.e. tissue perfusion). By combining these two signals, CMRO2 can be calculated. Compared to NIRS alone, trNIRS/DCS can accurately measure tissue perfusion to provide quantitative data about oxygen supply and demand in the brain. The validity of the trNIRS/DCS system has been tested extensively in healthy volunteers and critically ill patients, and we have shown that it can accurately monitor cerebral metabolism in these settings.

This research aims to collect data from 80 adult patients undergoing surgery to evaluate the effects of anesthetic maintenance agents and vasopressors on the changes in cerebral hemodynamics and metabolic rates during surgery. Four groups composed of a mix of patients undergoing different types of surgery are designed:
- G1: Propofol group, phenylephrine group
- G2: Sevoflurane group, phenylephrine group
- G3: Propofol group, ephedrine group
- G4: Sevoflurane group, ephedrine group

The data collected using NIRS/DCS will provide direct evidence of the changes in CBF and CMRO2 before, during and after anesthesia induction, and throughout surgery between the two anesthetic maintenance groups (sevoflurane vs propofol) and the two vasopressor (phenylephrine vs ephedrine) groups. We anticipate that there is a lack of CMRO2 studies under the influence of anesthetic maintenance agent and vasopressor due to the lack of accessibility of bedside cerebral hemodynamic monitors.
We propose this 4-way, prospective, randomized, blinded and controlled study to address this research gap. This research will examine anesthetic-induced changes in cerebral blood flow and metabolic rate by comparing the four proposed groups, and to investigate the effect of vasopressors on cerebral blood flow and metabolic rate in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia. We believe this research is vital to advance our knowledge regarding cerebral blood flow, metabolic rate and vasopressor in clinical setting."

The RaDiCo Cohort aims at studying adult and children with imprinting disorders (ID) at the clinical, biological, genetic and morphometric levels. An investigation of the prevalence of metabolic aberrations (MA) and their influence on cardiovascular risks, metabolic syndromes, obesity as well as diabetes in these patients is planned. To better understand the metabolic phenotype, a biological analysis will be performed as well as a gene sequencing analysis to decipher the molecular bases of the metabolic phenotype. In a second phase, a genetic study will be carried out to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of these disorders and to detect the molecular origins of these pathologies in children and their families. Quality of life will be analyzed at regular intervals for a total duration of 10 years. This study will be a nationwide prospective study conducted within 12 specialized centers in France. The main idea of the study is to better understand each step of the metabolic pathways potentially altered in patients suffering from IDs to prevent MA and associated comorbidities in the RaDiCo-IDmet Cohort"

Early intervention programs for psychosis provide much-needed resources for people with new-onset psychosis, but there has been little progress in enhancing treatment of these individuals beyond standard of care. Cognitive dysfunction and diminished motivation are critical pathophysiological components of psychosis, and both of these domains have shown promising signs of recoverable brain plasticity. Yet currently available cognitive and motivational therapies often lag behind brain-informed remediation that specifically targets these areas. This study will combine proven cognitive therapy with a new mobile device to specifically address cognitive and motivational impairments in early psychosis. By specifically targeting a key therapeutic need of the new-onset population, this project will deepen our understanding of mechanisms of treatment response in early psychosis. These data will inform the design of future treatment strategies and may change clinical trajectories of those served by the national network of early psychosis intervention programs.

This study involves three study sites: UMass Memorial Medical Center, the University of Maryland School of Medicine, and the University of California, Los Angeles - the UCLA Early Psychosis Program. Participants at all sites will be recruited from coordinated specialty care (CSC) programs that have been shown to improve patient and family outcomes. Participants will be aged 18-40 years and will provide informed consent to participate in the study. Individuals enrolled in a CSC program will be screened for eligibility by the PI or designated study clinician. Participants will complete assessments (detailed below), and half will randomly be assigned to the treatment arm, while the other half will receive Treatment-As-Usual (TAU).
Participants in the Treatment arm will complete 45 minutes of cognitive training on the laptop twice per week for six weeks (a total of 10 hours), and then twice per week for an additional two weeks (for a total of 12 hours of training). Participants will engage in social cognitive training exercises for an additional 10 hours (10 sessions) of training while completing their cognitive training exercises. Social cognitive training exercises aim to develop a deep understanding of the key components that guide successful social interactions. This arm will also use the PRIME mobile app for three months to boost motivation and engagement, in addition to completing the training exercises. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a Treatment-As-Usual (TAU) or active intervention (cognitive and social cognitive training) group. In the TAU arm, participants will complete clinical interviews at baseline, following 6-weeks, 12-weeks, and 18-months. Participants in the TAU arm will also use a basic smart phone version of the PRIME app for three months. All participants will complete the same clinical assessments at these time points, with those in the active intervention arm completing these assessments three times more frequently (i.e., at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 18 months, as well as 3- and 9-months follow up clinical interviews).
Participants in both arms will be asked to complete 9 questionnaire measures at baseline, mid-training, 3-month follow-up, 6-months, 12-months, and 18-month study completion. In addition, participants will complete cognitive testing at baseline, mid-training, 12-weeks, 18-weeks, 3-month follow-up, 6-months, and 12-months clinical testing sessions. Participants in the Cognitive Training arm will also complete a set of questionnaire measures at baseline, 6-weeks, 12-weeks, 3-month follow-up, 6-months, and 12-months. To optimize data acquisition, these tests will be conducted in person and at 2-week intervals, if possible.
In summary, this study builds upon existing evidence in the fields of cognitive training, motivational enhancement, and mobile health to generate new knowledge that can be disseminated in the field of early psychosis. The results of this study will provide data-driven knowledge to deepen our understanding of factors that contribute to 2-year treatment response trajectories in early psychosis. It will promote better clinical outcomes by identifying new and innovative approaches to enhance individual motivation and social functioning. This project is also designed to test new ways of delivering innovative cognitive training approaches, particularly in a mobile, low resource format. The goal will be to deepen our knowledge about optimal ways to deliver these therapies to people in early psychosis. By leveraging expertise from multiple specialties and disciplines, we hope that this interdisciplinary project will serve as a model for optimizing"

The purpose of this randomised controlled trial (RCT) is to evaluate the effectiveness of prehabilitation to optimise patient function for those undergoing open surgery for upper gastrointestinal (OG), hepatobiliary (HPB) or Lung Cancer (LC). To compare the effectiveness of two different methods of prescribing exercise to a prehabilitation population; i) Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and ii) heart rate (HR) zones to achieve a predefined target heart rate. Secondary outcomes will also be collected to determine adherence to prescribed exercises, volume of activity undertaken during the week, patient satisfaction of using a fitness tracker and the impact the intervention has on the overall patient experience. The fitness trackers used will also be evaluated for their suitability for use in a prehabilitation setting for the duration of the study. The findings of this study will provide valuable insights into whether the use of HR zones improves adherence to prescribed exercise and thus could result in improved outcomes for OG/HPB lung cancer patients undergoing routine prehabilitation."

The treatment of pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) remains controversial. The recommended standard treatment for PSD is pit-picking surgery with de-epithelialization of the sinus tracts. However, recurrence rates are reported to be considerable. SiLaC (a minimally invasive therapy with a radial diode laser) has been shown to decrease recurrence rates and to improve healing of the sinus tracts. It is unclear which treatment for PSD is better in the long-term. The aim of this study is to compare pit-picking surgery with de-epithelialization of the sinus tracts alone to pit-picking surgery with SiLaC.
It is a multicenter, randomised clinical trial. To assess the effectiveness of pit-picking surgery with de-epithelialization or pit-picking with SiLaC therapy 150 patients are needed to find a difference in recurrence rates of 14% (α = 0.05; ß = 0.20). It is expected that 15 to 20% of patients will drop out during the trial, therefore inclusion of 187 patients is expected (97 in each group). To assess the difference in recurrence rates, an intention to treat analysis, adjusted for the Dutch staging system, is used.
The patients are patients aged 12 years and older presenting with primary PSD, type 1b and 3 according to the Dutch staging system. The primary outcome measure is the success rate of treatment, defined as wound healing outcomes at 1 year, which include closure of all pits, absence of symptoms, absence of persisting sinuses and absence of recurrence of pilonidal sinus disease. The secondary outcome measures are pain score, patient reported outcome measures, wound healing and complications, work rehabilitation and return to daily activities, recurrence rate, need for secondary or revision surgery for pilonidal disease, patient satisfaction and quality of life.
SiLaC is a minimally invasive laser-assisted technique, which is more expensive than standard pit-picking surgery. However, it offers the theoretical advantage of decreasing recurrence rates and improving healing of the sinus tracts. Therefore, it is reasonable to investigate whether it leads to better treatment of PSD. If a substantial less recurrences is found with the use of this device, this will have cost-beneficial consequences to the patient and for health care in general."

Globally, substance use disorders are a prominent public health problem that affects individuals, families, and communities. They occur due to the repeated use of psychoactive substances, including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs, leading to physical, mental, and behavioral problems. The problem of substance use is becoming one of the most serious and rapidly growing phenomena all over the world. It accounts for substantial global morbidity, mortality, and financial and social burden. In Egypt, the prevalence of drug use disorders is constantly increasing. It is an epidemic that affects mostly youth and adults. Substance use disorders are characterized by compulsive substance use leading to tolerance and physical dependence. However, the coverage of interventions for the treatment of drug use disorders remains low overall. Identifying personal, social, and demographic characteristics of patients with this disorder at the local, regional and national levels helps physicians, health authorities, and policy-makers to detect early emerging trends and enable them to better plan and implement prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation programs. These interventions are essential to reduce the harms of illicit drug and substance abuse, and improve the health outcomes of people with drug use disorders. 
The Addiction Management Unit (AMU) of Assiut University Hospital is the main unit that provides treatment and rehabilitation programs for substance use disorders in Upper Egypt. The AAMU provides a detoxification and rehabilitation program based on the manual for treatment of SUD that is based on principles of the World Health Organization. This study aims to identify sociodemographic, personal characteristics, and patterns of illicit drug abuse in patients admitted for addiction treatment. In the current study, a retrospective observational study will be conducted to: 
The investigators aimed to enroll 350 patients attending the AAMU during the study period. Information about patients’ sociodemographic characteristics, personal information, and patterns of substance abuse will be obtained through Psychiatric interview and Urine Drug Screen, then the data will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences. It was hypothesized that: 
Finally, results of the study will be discussed in the context of evidence-based treatment, and suggestions will be made for local, regional, and national programs."

Seven to 10 out of 10 patients (70-100%) receive a dose of Durvalumab intravenously for 7 times.
This treatment is combined with tremelimumab administered intravenously and yttrium-90 radioembolisation performed 2 times. 
The first cycle of Durvalumab, tremelimumab, and yttrium-90 radioembolisation is given approximately 2 weeks apart.
Patients receive the first dose of yttrium-90 radioembolisation within the first cycle, and the next dose of yttrium-90 radioembolisation will be administered approximately a week (6-7 days) after the first cycle of Durvalumab and tremelimumab, usually in the second cycle.
Blood tests will be performed after the end of each treatment cycle to check the effect of the treatment on the liver. If there are any side effects, they will be recorded with descriptions and time-frames of occurrence and will be monitored as long as the effect of the treatment persists.
Each patient will have check-ups with imaging tests (e.g., CT or MRI scan) after 2 cycles, prior to each subsequent cycle of Durvalumab and tremelimumab, following the 2nd and 5th dose of yttrium-90 radioembolisation, and 2-3 months after the last treatment and stopping of treatment.
If a patient has responded well to the treatment, they will have another check-up after 3 years.
After the end of the 3-year follow-up, patients will be followed up every 6 months for another 2 years."

This is a phase 2, multicenter study of the effect of 4 cycles (1 cycle = 21 days) of durvalumab+tremelimumab±gemcitabine/cisplatin on resectability rate for patients with resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. The trial includes a screening period of up to 30 days, during which participants will undergo medical history evaluation, physical exams, performance evaluations, blood tests, electrocardiograms (ECG), imagining tests including computed tomography (CT), and other laboratory tests to screen for any diseases that could impact the results of the trial or impact the safety of taking part. If the participant agrees to sign the informed consent, the patient will receive the trial medication. During the initial treatment period, the participant will be treated with chemotherapy as well as the immunotherapy medications for approximately 4 months. The chemotherapy treatment includes gemcitabine and cisplatin. During the first 12 weeks, the participant will receive treatment once every 3 weeks. The participant will receive tremelimumab 300 mg by IV infusion once, on Cycle 1. During cycles 1-4 (weeks 1-8), the participant will receive durvalumab 1500 mg IV on Cycle 1, Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and Cycle 4. After Cycle 4, the surgeon will assess the disease to determine if the participant is eligible to have surgery. If the surgeon decides that surgery is not an option, the participant will continue to receive the same treatment, without gemcitabine and cisplatin, during the maintenance phase until the end of the treatment period. Following surgery, the participants will follow-up medical appointments on a regular basis to evaluate how well the tumor has been removed. If the surgery was successful, the surgeon will assess the participant during follow-up appointments on Day 14 after surgery, at 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks, and every 3 months thereafter to monitor for any signs of biliary cancer recurrence. If the surgery was not successful or the tumor returned, the participant will receive durvalumab until 1 year from randomization. After 1 year from randomization, the participant will receive no further treatment with durvalumab or tremelimumab and will be monitored by their participating physician for any complications of durvalumab or tremelimumab. Patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma will receive the durvalumab and tremelimumab combination therapy with chemotherapy. Surgery may also be considered if the tumor is evaluated to be resectable after neoadjuvant durvalumab+tremelimumab+gemcitabine+cisplatin after cycle 4 or after cycle 8. Surgery will be considered to be curative if complete resection is performed and pathological staging is cT0cN0cM0.
The primary study endpoint is the Rate of Conversion from unresectable to resectable. The secondary study endpoints are the Incidence of related Treatment Emergent Adverse Events, Objective Response Rate (ORR), Pathological complete response (pCR), Overall survival (OS), Progression-free survival (PFS), Rate of R0 resection, Relapse free survival (RFS), Patient Reported outcomes (PRO) decline, Event Free Survival (EFS), and Survival probability of 2 years and 5 years."

Arterial structural abnormalities mainly appear in cardiovascular patients, and there is increasing evidence that the vascular lesion lesions is an early warning sign of microvascular endothelial injury. The structure and blood flow of major blood vessels were evaluated using high-frequency duplex ultrasound in Han adults in China, and the normal range of peripheral blood vessel structure and blood flow was established. The normal value provides an important reference for the early diagnosis of microvascular endothelial injury.
This study aimed to establish a normal value of high-frequency ultrasound for the structure and blood flow of the extremities of Han adults in China, and explored its influencing factors, so as to provide a quantitative reference for the early diagnosis, degree evaluation and curative effect observation of the structure and blood flow of the extremities.

The purpose of the study is to test the safety and efficacy of STERIFY GEL in promoting healing of periodontal pockets following SRP, compared with treatment with SRP alone. With specific visco-elastic and mucoadhesive properties, STERIFY GEL easily penetrates into the deepest and hard-to-reach areas of periodontal and peri-implant pockets, adhering to the gingival tissue and alveolar bone, providing complete coverage of the pockets. The effect of STERIFY GEL is promoted by a physical mechanism of action. After SRP, the gel is applied into the gingival pocket, where it acts primarily as a filler to restore volume, physically preventing bacteria from entering and reinfecting the pocket. STERIFY GEL can thus mechanically protect treated pockets and bone defects, promoting tissue healing. The occluding action at the level of periodontal and peri-implant gingival pockets, in synergy with the accessory action of hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, prevents bacterial recolonization and promotes subsequent tissue regeneration."

Background: Many people who were exposed to a traumatic event develop Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Their memory of the traumatic event remains inaccessible and fragmented, due to malfunctioning of the hippocampus. Malfunctioning may lead to difficulty in memory contextualization in the context of time and location, and to the feeling that the traumatic event is present all the time and everywhere. Although trauma-focused psychotherapy and pharmacological treatments can reduce PTSD symptoms, they do not induce recovery of the traumatic memory. Objective: We propose to augment the hippocampal neuroplasticity effects of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) and further enhance recovery of inaccessible, traumatic memories in veterans with PTSD. Design: Twenty male veterans with combat-associated PTSD, peri-traumatic amnesia, with a minimum of one course of trauma-focused psychotherapy, will be randomly assigned to a HBOT or a HBOT plus hippocampal training arm. A multiplace HBOT chamber will be used. The treatment arm will consist of 60 daily sessions, five days a week, lasting 90 minutes each, including five-minute air breaks every 20 minute. In addition, the hippocampal training arm will undergo 36 sessions of cognitive and physical training, prior to HBOT, more than 20 hours after the last HBOT-session. MRI, electroencephalogram (EEG) and autonomic nervous system (ANS) data will be obtained before and during/after treatment. Memory enhancement will be evaluated by means of standard memory tests and a special memory assessment form.

Input Text: Cardiac Sarcoidosis Biomarker

Study Overview
=================

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background: Cardiac sarcoidosis is a clinically challenging disease, often diagnosed after symptoms have manifested and irreversible myocardial damage has occurred. Biomarkers that can allow non-invasive early diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis are of utmost importance in order to identify affected individuals prior to significant myocardial fibrosis caused by scarring and dysfunction. The inflammatory disease of sarcoidosis has previously been shown to express somatostatin receptors, especially the SSTR subtype 2 that is also expressed in cardiac sarcoidosis. The current study aims to investigate 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging of SSTR-expressing granulomas for the identification of cardiac sarcoidosis. Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare tracer retention in patients with cardiac sarcoidosis, inflammatory myocarditis, and neuroendocrine tumours for the identification of cardiac sarcoidosis. Methods: Sixty patients with suspected cardiac sarcoidosis will be included in this prospective, comparative study. Group A (n=16) is expected to have cardiac sarcoidosis based on specific clinical, echocardiographic, radiological, and/or serological features. These patients will undergo 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging with a protocol of the routine diagnostic work-up in addition to the standard imaging. In addition, the same procedures will be conducted in Group B (n=16) with verified cardiac sarcoidosis. Similar procedures will be performed in each of the groups, but in Group C (n=20) the same cardiac evaluation will be conducted in patients with acute lymphocytic myocarditis. The number of patients in Group C might be increased in order to obtain sufficient cases. Group D (n=10) will include patients with a neuroendocrine tumor (controls) which have previously undergone 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT as part of their diagnostic work-up or follow-up. Group E will include a large number of additional patients with verified inflammatory heart diseases in order to increase the number of cases for analysis. The study will involve 24 patients with verified acute lymphocytic myocarditis. The cardiac assessment will include: 1. Echocardiography, electrocardiogram (ECG), blood tests, and lung function tests (LFTs) prior to 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging and 1-year follow-up. The patients will be followed for 2 years, and additional clinical, echocardiographic, and ECG assessments are to be performed, as well as 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT at 1-, 2- and 3-year follow-up. Data collection: Cardiac assessment will include ECG (ECG-12), lung function tests (LFTs), 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging, and echocardiography (Echo1). This assessment will be repeated at 2- and 3-year follow-up. ECGs and LFTs: ECG will be assessed after resting in the supine position for 10 minutes. Blood samples will be tested the same day. Lung function tests (Spirometry) will be performed using a handheld spirometer (Spirobank; Medical International Research, Rome, Italy). All tests will be done just prior to the 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT imaging. After ECG-12, LFTs, and spirometry, 10 ml/kg of water with 90 mg elementartal for 1 hour and 6 mg heparin for 3 hours will be administered. On arrival to the PET/CT facility, the patients will receive 10 ml of glucose solution, followed by a standard uptake dose (300 MBq) in 50 ml water with 90 mg elementartal (Vitrum) for 30 minutes. 64Cu-DOTATATE PET/CT acquisition: A 6"

Shoulder injury is a common chronic disease in the working-aged adult population. Rotator cuff tears are the most common cause of shoulder dysfunction and are common in the working-aged population. With advancing age they become more frequent. Over the past few years, superior capsular reconstruction (SCR) has been introduced as a new soft-tissue reconstruction procedure for massive rotator cuff tears. The study is conducted in Tartu University Hospital Sports Traumatology Centre and rotator cuff repair procedures will be done by three orthopaedic surgeons with long experience in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. Patients with massive rotator cuff tendon tears aged between 50 to 80 years will be included in the study following the eligibility criteria. Massive tear is defined as grade III tear according to Davidson and Burkhart classification (2010), supraspinatus (SSP) tendon retraction described by Patte (1990) classification. The study is conducted in Tartu University Hospital Sports Traumatology Centre and rotator cuff repair procedures will be done by three orthopaedic surgeons with long experience in arthroscopic shoulder surgery. It is determined intra-operatively whether the tear is reparable or not. If possible, the tendon(s) will be anatomically repaired. For irreparable tears intra-operative urn randomization takes place - either partial repair or partial repair with SCR using the LHBBT. Surgical techniques will be standardized. Patients who refuse operative treatment, will be followed as conservative treatment group. The primary objective of the study is the functional status of the included subjects in different treatment groups. The secondary objective of the study is to confirm whether the tendons are intact on follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 6 months, 12 months and 24 months after operation using Sugaya classification (2007). The post-operative therapy regimen will be the same for each study group. Subjects will come for scheduled visits at 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month timepoints. Assessment tools consist of range of motion (ROM), strength measurements, preoperative radiography measuring acromio-humeral index (AHI), critical shoulder angle (CSA), acromion type and shoulder arthrosis (Hamada), functional scores: The Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH), The Constant-Murley score (CMS), The American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) and visual analogue scale (VAS), also including Tampa kinesiophobia score and emotional well-being (EEK) score. Goutallier classification (1994) will be used pre- and post-operatively to measure muscle fatty infiltration."

The purpose of this study is to compare the use and user experience of a mobile versus a web-based platform in reporting adverse events (AEs) after influenza vaccine. This is a prospective, non-interventional, randomized, parallel cohort study. This study will be conducted in the community setting.
CanImmunize is a mobile health platform for tracking personal immunization records including vaccines, prescription drugs and blood products received, as well as recording health information such as symptoms, medications taken, and interactions with the Canadian healthcare system. CANVAS is a national platform that manages influenza surveillance in Canada. The goal of CANVAS is to monitor and document any vaccine-related adverse events and ensure that clinicians get notified immediately if a suspected adverse event occurs.
Participants will be recruited from the general Canadian population and will be offered to participate. The study follows those who participate by randomizing them into one of two groups - an email and web-based survey notification group (control), and another using the CanImmunize mobile app. All participants will be asked to complete a 20-question survey about adverse events after receiving the influenza vaccine through either a web-based link or a mobile app. The study will include a user experience survey to gather information about the useability and satisfaction of the platform. Participants will be allowed to withdraw from the study if they wish."

As stated in the introduction section, peri-implantitis is a significant health problem affecting a substantial percentage of the population. The condition can be prevented or can result in implant loss depending on the time and the ability to provide adequate treatment. Furthermore, even if the cause of peri-implantitis is not entirely clear, it is evident that it is a multifactorial condition, which can be influenced by genetic predisposition, a variety of bacteria, and some systemic conditions, such as diabetes, obesity or smoking.
In recent years, an increase in the number of new cases along with implant failure leads to the increased research of peri-implantitis, both in terms of diagnosis and treatment. As a result, researchers worldwide developed sophisticated diagnostic methods and a broad range of treatment modalities.
In this study, we aim to investigate the relationship among certain polymorphisms of the Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene (rs20417), aswell as the levels of Active MMP-8 in peri-implant fluid (PIF) and the characterization of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis in patients with a history of successful dental implant placement over the past 12 or 24 months.
Based on previous research on gene polymorphism, it has been shown that some genetic polymorphisms could predispose patients to be more susceptible to gum disease. In this context, Cyclo-oxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene polymorphism rs20417 (COX-2 SNP), located on chromosome 1q25.2, is involved in inflammatory and pro-thrombotic reactions (59). The SNP rs20417 of COX-2 is a G/T SNP, where G allele predisposes patients to increase the expression of COX-2.
Additionally, the involvement of prostaglandins as mediators of inflammatory mechanisms in gingival crevicular fluid (GCF), has been widely reported, being the main target of several anti-inflammatory agents. In particular, Eprosutan, a COX-2 inhibitor, has been proven to control the levels of pro-inflammatory markers as IL-1, IL-6, TNF-a, and prostaglandins (PG) E2 in GCF (60). Considering that peri-implantitis is a complex disease that involves many pathways and pro-inflammatory mediators, further research is mandatory for the identification of gene polymorphisms related to peri-implantitis diagnosis as well as to the characterization of host related factors.
The second aim of the study is the characterization of microbiota associated with peri-implantitis. In this context, peri-implantitis, as well as periodontitis, is an infection in which the microbiota is a crucial factor.
The third aim of the study is the assessment of Active MMP-8 levels in site-specific peri-implant fluid with the use of a novel biomarker testing system (ImplantSafe©). Active MMP-8 is considered to be a crucial factor in the breakdown of host tissue during infectious diseases (61). High aMMP-8 levels in peri-implant fluid indicate enhanced proteolytic activity in the tissue and could be considered as a predictive biomarker in peri-implantitis.
The fourth and last aim of the study is the development and validation of a novel, POC lateral flow point of care (PoC) biomarker test, which is based on active matrix metalloproteins aMMP-8.
This study will enroll 100 consecutive patients (50 with peri-implantitis and 50 patients with normal peri-implant status) referred to the Department of Periodontology, Dental School, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki for the diagnosis and treatment of peri-implantitis. At baseline, the demographic data of each patient will be collected, and the status of each implant involved in the study will be recorded. All the patients will be required to provide a buccal swab for gene polymorphism research. From each peri-implant, two paper points will be used for the characterization of microbiota, and one of these paper points will be stored overnight for the detection of aMMP-8 levels in each case. Also, an aMMP-8 lateral flow test (ImplantSafe©) will be performed according to the test's specific"

The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of virtual reality video watched during trigger point injection on patients' anxiety, comfort and pain. 40 patients scheduled for trigger point injection will be randomized into two groups using a blind method. In one group, the patient will be given 10 minutes of virtual reality videos during the trigger point injection, in the other group, the patient will continue routine practice without using virtual reality glasses. State anxiety scale, general comfort scale, visual analogue scale (VAS) will be applied before trigger point injection, at the end of the injection and at the 24th hour after the procedure. It is planned to investigate the impact of virtual reality videos on patients with trigger point injections on anxiety, comfort and pain levels. The groups will be compared. The results of the study will be statistically analyzed with descriptive statistics methods, univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) and independent groups t-test applied to parametric data or chi-square, McNemar and Mann-Whitney U tests."

Background:
Per-oral endoscopic myotomy (POEM) is a relatively novel technique for treating achalasia. POEM has been reported to have significantly less cardiovascular instability and fewer complications compared to the conventional Heller myotomy procedure. Although POEM seems to be a safe procedure, hemodynamic changes during the surgery have not been investigated.
Objective:
This study is designed to investigate the hemodynamic changes due to PEM comparing patients with autonomic dysfunction based on the heart rate variability test results with those having normal autonomic function.
Methods:
We will conduct a prospective observational study. Patients scheduled for per-oral endoscopic myotomy in Gangnam Severance Hospital for achalasia will be enrolled. Patients aged ≥ 19 years with good understanding of English will be included. Exclusion criteria include patients who are hemodynamically unstable prior to surgery, patients in whom the preoperative heart rate variability (HRV) test cannot be conducted, pregnant women or breastfeeding women, and patients unable to read the informed consent form. A total of 147 patients will be enrolled in this study.
We will assess the correlation between SAP variation, cardiac index, cardiac output, stroke volume, preload, and heart rate during POM in relation to the autonomic dysfunction detected preoperatively using HRV tests. We hypothesize that autonomic dysfunction detected by HRV may be a predictor of more hemodynamic instability during surgery.
This study aims to elucidate the factors that contribute to hemodynamic instability during PEM. This information will be useful for optimizing intraoperative management of the patients.

The researchers aim to evaluate the analgesic effect of virtual reality glasses (Roller Coaster, Wild Dolphin) during inhaler treatment in children aged 2-5 years who present with recurrent bronchiolitis. It was determined that no study was conducted on this subject in children in our country. The use of VR glasses was aimed to reduce the discomfort of the child during inhaler treatment and to facilitate the procedure. Children will be included in the study group by random allocation. The effectiveness of the method will be compared with the standard treatment technique and no VR group. Parents will be asked about the child's anxiety scores before and after inhaler treatment before discharge at the end of hospitalization. The anxiety scoring made by the physician before and after the treatment will be recorded with a FLACC Pain Assessment Scale. It will be determined that a 1-minute crying period is more than 2 minutes in order to assess the analgesic effect of VR glasses used during inhaler treatment in pre-school children. At the same time, changes in SpO2, RR, and HR values during the inhaler treatment will be recorded, and it will be determined that if this value is over 96% for SpO2, over 17/min for RR, and over 160/min for HR, it signifies that the procedure was not successful. Anxiety scores before and after inhaler treatment will be compared using the Mann Whitney U Test and chi-square test. For the comparison of SpO2 and RR, the Kolmogorov Smirnov Test was used. The chi-square test was used for the comparison of HR. If the P value was less than 0.05, it signified a statistically significant difference. The researchers hypothesized that the use of virtual reality glasses during inhaler treatment will increase the number of successful inhaler treatments, shorten the duration of the treatment, reduce crying times, and reduce the anxiety of the child according to the parents.
The inclusion of children with a score of 5 and above according to the bronchiolitis severity score, children with chronic diseases who may have underlying chronic diseases, and children with fever above 37.5 degrees C, respiratory failure symptoms, obesity or malnutrition, with a previous operation or a sedative history, or using a previous prescription of inhaler therapy were not included in the study. Children who did not consent to the study or to whom their parents did not consent were also not included. Children with a saturation value below 92% at the time of admission, those with a severe asthma attack, those with respiratory failure symptoms, and those who did not speak Turkish fluently were included in the exclusion criteria."

Rapid sequence induction (RSI) is usually associated with an increased risk of hypoxia . Preoxygenation is generally used before induction to establish a reserve of oxygen and to reduce apnea time. Preoxygenation is usually performed with either a face-mask or high-flow nasal oxygen cannula (HFNOC), but the optimal choice is not known . The aim of this clinical trial is to compare two different preoxygenation techniques in terms of oxygen saturation and heart rate in pediatric patients. In this randomized controlled trial three groups will be studied. The first will be the control group where the face-mask preoxygenation will be performed. The second group will receive HFNOC preoxygenation and the third group will receive both HFNOC and face-mask preoxygenation. The primary outcomes will be oxygen saturation and heart rate. Secondary outcomes will be safety of the RSI protocol such as intubation attempt success rate, number of intubation attempts, intubation conditions. This research has not received any funding. It is a pilot study that will be presented to the Ethics Committee of the State Hospital Association in the 1st quarter of 2021, and approval will be requested. All patients requiring an acute surgery and rapid sequence induction/intubation will be checked for eligibility criteria and then an informed consent will be obtained. Afterwards, randomization will take place, which will divide a patient into one of three groups: 1) RSI + face-mask preoxygenation, 2) RSI + high-flow nasal oxygen cannula (HFNOC) preoxygenation and 3) RSI + face-mask and HFNOC preoxygenation. The demographic data, type of surgery and vital signs will be observed. Primary outcomes will be the impact of HFNOC preoxygenation on oxygen saturation. Secondary outcomes will be safety of the RSI protocol such as intubation attempt success rate, number of intubation attempts, intubation conditions. The RSI will be done according to our protocol. Initially, equipment will be checked and an i.v. line will be checked/started and then a bolus of ketamine will be given. Afterward, the preoxygenation will start according to the randomization result - group 1) face-mask preoxygenation, group 2) HFNOC preoxygenation and group 3) HFNOC (flow 2 L/kg/minute) + face-mask preoxygenation (flow 2 L/kg/minute) - with 100 % oxygen for three minutes. Then a bolus of anaesthetic and myorelaxant agent will be given. The neuromuscular blockade will be monitored, first intubation attempt will be started as soon as single twitch will be bellow 10 % or train-of-four (TOF) bellow 1 or after 60 seconds, whichever comes first. After that, the first intubation attempt will take place, a video laryngoscopy will be used and Cormack-Lehane score will be documented photographically. The attempt will end either by successful intubation with monitored capnography wave or by failure."

The effect of Swaddling the Pain and Comfort During the Placement of Peripheral Intravenous Catheter
The study was conducted to determine the effect of Swaddling and Inhaling Mother's Breast Milk Odour on the pain and comfort during the placement of Peripheral Intravenous Catheter in Term Infants. In this randomised controlled experimental study, a total of 120 (60 boys, 60 girls) healthy term infants (born at 37-41 weeks of gestation) hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and not having a previous insertion of peripheral intravenous catheter, were accepted to the research. The infants were randomly assigned to three experimental groups and a control group (each of which consisted of 30 infants). During the placement of peripheral intravenous catheter, the infants in the 1st experimental group were swaddled (N = 30), the infants in the 2ndexperimental group were made to inhale their mothers' breast milk odour (N = 30),the infants in the 3rd experimental group were both swaddled and made to inhale their mothers' breast milk odour (N = 30) and no procedure was applied to the infants in the control group. The pain and comfort levels of infants in the experimental and control groups were assessed before, during and after the placement of peripheral intravenous catheter with the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) and the Newborn Comfort Behaviour Scale respectively.
All three experimental groups who were subjected to swaddling and inhaling milk odor or both, did not have any significant differences with each other in terms of average pain and comfort values.
The mean pain and comfort values of the infants in the 1st experimental group (swaddling), the infants in the 2ndexperimental group (inhaling milk odor) and the infants in the 3rd experimental group (both swaddled and milk odor) were statistically significantly lower than the control group.(P<0.05). In other words, the findings of the study indicate that the application of swaddling and inhaling milk odor was found to be effective in reducing pain and discomfort of the infants during the placement of peripheral intravenous catheter.
In short, the study showed that Swaddling and Inhaling Mother's Breast Milk Odour have an effect in providing comfort and pain relief to newborns during the process of catheter insertion and contribute to the psychological support of nurses in this process."

The purpose of the study is to determine if a new imaging agent called 111In-panitumumab can detect the sentinel node in patients with HNSCC. We also want to find out if this imaging agent adds any new information about tumor spread in the neck when combined with other imaging scans (MRI or FDG PET scan). In this study, patients will have an imaging agent, such as 111In-panitumumab, injected into a vein. The doctor will use a radiation camera to capture pictures of the injection as it moves around the body. The patient will have a scan 1-5 days after first injection. The scan will find a small number of lymph nodes that carry tumor cells and are at risk for removal during surgery. These scans will help identify which lymph nodes should be removed and which lymph nodes can be left behind. The scans will be compared for accuracy. The amount of information obtained from this imaging strategy, compared to results from standard imaging scans, will also be studied.

The investigators encourage the collection of all lymph nodes in a single surgical specimen. This makes the research results easier to interpret and compare with the results from standard imaging tests. The investigators will also encourage the use of standard imaging scans, but some patients will not receive them. This may lead to a slightly larger number of sentinel nodes being missed in the neck in patients who undergo a sentinel lymph node procedure and do not receive standard imaging scans. The researchers do not expect this higher rate to affect the long-range prognosis of the patients."

Recent preclinical and clinical studies have shown that electroacupuncture or acupuncture can alleviate anxiety symptoms by activating the non-invasive Vagus nerve stimulation (NVNS) pathway or the efferent branch of the Vagus nerve. Transcutaneous vagus nerve simulation (tVNS) is a non-invasive method to stimulate the vagus nerve and has been proven to have anxiolytic effects. Therefore, tVNS has been proposed as a useful tool for patients with anxiety disorders. In this study, we will use Nexo tVNS for transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation to explore its efficacy for treating refractory patients with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). The investigators will select 30 patients aged 18-65 with primary diagnosed generalized anxiety disorder as cases, and another 30 healthy people as healthy controls. At the same time, 10 cases will be withdrawn at once, and their vital signs monitoring data, Nexo tVNS stimulation and patient recovery will be monitored, and the collected safety data will be analyzed retrospectively."

Epiphora or recurrent infections with mucopurulent discharge are two major symptoms associated with lacrimal drainage obstruction. NLDO can occur at any level along the lacrimal drainage system: punctum, canaliculus, nasolacrimal duct (NLD), or nasal ostium. Dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a standard surgical procedure used to treat NLD obstruction. However, differences in the surgical technique, stringency of definitions of success, and duration of follow-up, may be confounding factors of success rates. Dacryoendoscopy was originally described in 1979 and has recently matured for use in lacrimal drainage system imaging. It has been proved to be useful instrument not only for understanding differences in the etiology of obstructions but also for treating LD obstructions. Hence, dacryoendoscopic-assisted laser dacryoplasty with silicone intubation (DLDI) offers direct therapy to the obstructed site, leading to minimal collateral damage external to the target zone. In addition to that, it has advantages such as short surgery time and less risk of bleeding during surgery, resulting in its increasingly widespread use in China. The aim of our study was to report DLDI results in the management of NLDO, and to identify factors associated with DLDI failure."

Chronic stroke patients have gait deficits that impair their ability to walk. The gait deficits are predominantly due to decrease ankle dorsiflexion with prolonged swing phase duration of paretic leg. Several studies have revealed that the ankle dorsiflexion in patients with stroke may decrease due to the hypertonicity in the stretch reflex of gastrocnemius-soleus muscles.
The aim of the study is to estimate the immediate effects of PNF with lower leg kinesiotaping. PNF technique is very powerful healing exercise for the improvement of muscle thickness, dynamic stability and gait. However, effects of application PNF with lower leg kinesiotaping on ankle dorsiflexion, gait and functional mobility in chronic patients after stroke have not yet been investigated. The null hypothesis is that no significant difference exists between the three groups regarding the ankle dorsiflexion, gait and functional mobility after one treatment session. While the alternative hypothesis is that no significant difference exists between the three groups regarding the ankle dorsiflexion, gait and functional mobility after one treatment session."

Diving catheters are used to administer medications or to carry out various routine medical procedures. For more than 20 years, the placement of diving catheters has led to considerable anxiety among patients due to the sometimes painful and cumbersome practice that has generated a multitude of painful, potentially traumatic complications, the costs of which do not always allow a cost-benefit balance to be found (Freund et al., 2018; VAN KIRK (2004); Guitton et al., 2015). In Belgium, for example, it is estimated that 2% of the total budget of the hospital sector is used for the placement and management of peripheral venous catheters, whereas in the American literature, the placement alone is estimated at more than 10 billion dollars per year in the USA (Freund et al., 2018).

A vascular access difficulty score (VAD score) (Laurent et al., 2016) was developed to quantify the risk of complications posed by a peripheral venous catheter at the time of insertion, by determining the morphology-anatomical characteristics (skin, vasculature, vein and hand characteristics related to the location of the vein for insertion), which define the VAD of the patient. The VAD score consists of a 6 items questionnaire, each item being scored from 0 to 10, for a total score of 11 to 110, which is then analyzed according to the risk group: 1) no risk, 2) low risk, 3) moderate risk and 4) high risk (Laurent et al., 2016) (Figure 1). Patients assigned to a high-risk VAD group have a mean pain of >3/10 on the scale, compared to 0 or 1 for the low-risk groups. The risk of failed insertions, phlebopathies and complications significantly increases in the high-risk groups (p=0.0001). Based on these results, it is possible to suggest ways to improve peripheral venous catheter handling, while reducing the complications related to catheter insertion, namely to prioritize operators trained in the use of the score to increase the success rate of catheter insertion and decrease complications. Although the use of the score alone has never been assessed, the current state of the literature shows that the VAD score alone and in addition to the algorithm is the subject of intense discussion. The work carried out in these centers for the last 24 months has allowed, through prospective studies, to identify an approach to improve the care given to patients, namely the implementation of the Algorithm, a tool for improving the care during and after catheter insertion. This Algorithm uses the VAD score by stratifying the patient groups with respect to VAD, then offering practitioners the choice between a classic insertion technique (Venefit catheter) and an alternative insertion technique (intra-epidermal insertion (ie, SEL) using a SEL-catheter in the case of anatomical difficulties to optimize the success rate of insertion, by decreasing the trauma to the vein and a faster recovery of the hand (De Beer et al., 2008), thus reducing the risk of complications. On the one hand, this tool has been shown to be acceptable and feasible by the population and all the people involved. On the other hand, it has been shown to reduce the number of punctures (from 3 to 1.7) and reduce pain from the beginning (5/10 compared to 3/10) for patients in high-risk groups, whereas there was no significant impact on the other patient groups. Despite the quality of the work carried out and the support of the literature, there is no proof as to the effectiveness of this tool in real-life situations, thus limiting its use in all patients and its implementation in all departments of the hospitals participating in the study. In addition to the impact on patients, this tool could save more than 120 € per patient and per catheter for health institutions, with significant savings for hospital institutions. The goal here is to evaluate the impact of this tool in the day-to-day life of the hospital departments participating in the study. In short, the goal of the study is: 1) To evaluate the impact of the use of the Algorithm for the management of peripheral venous cathers on the patients' risk of complication, the patients' perception of pain or success of insertion and the number of venipunctures required per patient;"

Adolescent mental health problems are prevalent and pose a great burden on individuals, society and healthcare systems. Existing treatments focus on a subset of mental disorders and do not address subthreshold or multi-disorder problems. Furthermore, available treatments do not typically target disease mechanisms in a transdiagnostic way and do not work for all individuals. In addition, accessible care is limited by structural barriers such as geographical distance and social stigma, resulting in underdiagnosis and under-treatment. The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to determine the clinical efficacy of the 6-week emotion regulation treatment POET, a novel intervention that can be integrated with primary care. Treatment will be delivered in a blended treatment format combining asynchronous therapist-guided online modules and one synchronous session delivered in a virtual manner. Approximately 300 adolescents aged 12-17 years, seeking care for their mental problems, will be randomized to the POET condition or to an active control. Treatments in both conditions will include therapist support and will be delivered in a blended treatment format combining asynchronous therapist-guided online modules with one synchronous session delivered over video-link."

Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) incidence as well as morbidity rates are high in older patients. Surgery is the standard of care. About 5 to 10% of NMSC present high-risk clinico-pathologic features that can increase risk of local recurrence (LR). Adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) is often discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence. Despite the lack of high level evidence, ART is indicated in patients according to unfavorable prognostic factors. ART benefit is generally questioned in regard to the potential degradation of the patient's quality of life (QoL). Currently there is no prospective trial or recommendations that take into account geriatric patients' evaluation and profiles during the management of NMSC. In addition, there is no data that could help to define the subgroup of elderly patients who will benefit from ART in tumors with unfavorable prognostic factors. In terms of ART, multiple fractionation schedules are available, ranging from standard fractionation (45-60Gy in 5-6 weeks) to the extreme hypofractionation delivering 16-18Gy in one fraction. In routine practice, HF is mainly preferred in elderly patients for more convenience by reducing the number of transports and increase health related quality of life (HRQoL). However, there is no data on the fragility profiles of these patients, nor validating any HF schedule in terms of efficacy, acute toxicity, cosmetic results, and impact on HRQoL. Hypothesis/Objective Main Objective: To evaluate the comparative efficacy of two modalities of Radiotherapy over surgery alone on local tumor control in older patients with Non Melanoma Skin Cancer (NMSC) In current practice, adjuvant radiotherapy is discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence as determined by the existence (or not) of unfavorable prognostic factors. The proposed study will include R0-high risk of CBC and CEC of the skin in elderly patients. There is no risk regarding the design of the trial as the last will respond to two important unknown questions regarding the utility of RT and its fractionation in this population. Moreover, it is an excellent opportunity to collect prospectively geriatric evaluation and HRQoL data that are lacking in the literature for skin cancers. No constraints are seen neither in the design, nor in the potential recruitments. Primary endpoint: Local tumor control at 3-year follow-up in a time-to-event analysis Method This is a multicenter, randomized, open-labeled, comparative 3 arms phase III trial. After inclusion of patient aged ≥ 70 years with performance status OMS 0-3 who had completed surgery (R0) for SCC and BCC with at least one unfavorable prognostic factor, all patientsst will have G8 score and a Geriatric Core Data Set (G CODE) evaluation. Performance of a complete oncogeriatric evaluation and its modalities will be left to the discretion of the investigator. The patients will be randomized in 3 arms with stratification by center, time from surgery to wound healing and perineural invasion. Arm A: Surgery alone Arm B: Surgery + Moderate HF 45Gy in 15 fractions, 3 fractions per week over 5 weeks to the operative bed. Arm C: Surgery + Extreme HF : 30Gy in 5 fractions of 6Gy, 1 fraction per week, over 5 weeks to the operative bed. Reasoning: In current practice, adjuvant radiotherapy (ART) is discussed regarding the risk of local recurrence (LR) as determined by the existence (or not) of unfavorable prognostic factors (UPF). After surgery, ART is proposed to the patient in 45Gy delivered over 5-6 weeks. As no randomized trials are available, the proposed study, comparing ART delivered over 5 weeks either in 45Gy/15F over 5 weeks, or delivered over 1 week of 30Gy/5F, will allow to compare both modalities of treatment, for assessing their impact on LR. The moderate or extreme hypo fractionation (HF) in the 5 treated populations have been proposed in the literature as an alternative to the classical radiotherapy. Our objective will be to establish a new practice pathway for the management of NMSC in older patients with UPF. Secondary Endpoints: Rate of toxicity (acute and late) according to the"

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and surveillance colonoscopy is the only test recommended for reducing colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. Colonoscopy is especially risky for older adults, with an estimated 6,800 emergency visits or hospitalizations within 30 days of colonoscopy each year, and 1-3% of all deaths attributed to colonoscopy. To date, no study has adequately addressed the competing risks of colorectal cancer vs colonoscopy-associated harms among older adults. This study has three goals: 1) to determine whether surveillance colonoscopy in older adults reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality; 2) to compare risk of colorectal cancer after colonoscopy between those with and without prior serrated lesions; and 3) to obtain key stakeholder perspectives on existing data on CRC risk and surveillance outcomes in older adults to inform future value-based strategies for surveillance among older adults. To achieve these goals, more than 60,000 Veterans ages 75 and alive in 2019 will be followed over a 20-year period. Those with a prior, recent history of polypectomy (n=200,000) or with a recent, normal colonoscopy (n=400,000) will be followed to understand if surveillance colonoscopy, or colonoscopy without polypectomy, reduces colorectal cancer incidence and mortality. A separate subset of patients and providers will also participate in qualitative interviews and expert panels. Ultimately, the study will help define best surveillance practices in older adults, using data-driven methods to understand benefits and harms of surveillance, and stakeholder perspectives to inform future use and VA policy around surveillance among older adults."

The short-term benefits of exercise training are well documented in different disease states including cardiovascular, cancer, metabolic and musculoskeletal. Exercise training improves different biological and psychological functions in acute, subacute and chronic stages postoperatively.
Recently, several studies have shown that physical training in the form of bedside cycling is feasible in patients with different chronic diseases like Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease and Chronic heart failure. Studies conducted in these two population reported high tolerance and adherence to bedside cycling program and the improvement of selected physical, psychological and functional parameters.
Moreover, bedside cycling exercises showed superiority in comparison to the usual care, but the results are conflicting between them.
On the other hand, evidence of bedside cycling use as a form of physiotherapy in cardiac patients remains scarce.
This study will include all consecutive patients who will undergo valve surgical intervention. Patients will be randomly allocated into two equal groups, the bedside cycling patients and controls.
The bedside cycling patients will receive bedside cycling in addition to the medical treatment and routine physiotherapy protocol.
Afterward, the study will assess the selected outcomes in patients before discharge.
Primary outcome is the six-minute walk test.
Secondary outcome measures are quality of life measurement (SF-12), depression, anxiety and stress measurements (DAS-42), functional level and activities daily living (Barthel index) as well as the adverse events rate.
The results of this study will contribute to the scientific literature in different ways.
First, this study will be the first one to assess the effect of bedside cycling in patients after valve surgical intervention.
Second, this study will provide evidence for the role of bedside cycling as an effective method of early rehabilitation in patients who are too sick to participate in traditional rehabilitation program.
Finally, this study will contribute to improve the quality of life, psychological wellbeing, muscle strength and functional level of the treated patients after valve surgical intervention.
Therefore, this study is important regarding the novelty, need to assess the role of bedside cycling, potential early benefits, and improvement in the quality of care for cardiac patients undergoing valve surgical intervention."

This study is the first to use inexpensive clinical tools such as genome-wide and exome-wide screens to identify genetic alterations in screen-detected non-invasive and atypical breast lesions. Previous studies have analyzed the DNA of breast tumors only from diagnostic needle biopsies (sometimes at the time of mastectomy) and therefore failed to identify genetic changes associated with progression to invasive cancer and other complications. This analysis of breast tissue collected from the study site and not intended for diagnosis will provide a comprehensive understanding of the genetic basis of progression to invasive cancer in screen-detected non-invasive breast disease.

Background: Paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy (p-NSP) is a dose-limiting adverse event that limits the ability to administer neurotoxic chemotherapy such as paclitaxel in treatment of breast cancer patients. Our aims are to evaluate an objective and safe approach to the prevention and management of p-NSP when treated with standard of care chemotherapy agents.
Objective: The study has a two-arm randomized design. Study arm 1 involves the drug 100 mg, losartan, to be administered orally once daily for three weeks out of a four-week cycle of paclitaxel alone or in combination with docetaxel. The study arm 2 will receive standard-of-care management.
Detailed Description: The investigators will compare development of p-NSP and quality of life measures, including patient reported outcome on Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy/Gynecologic Oncology Group - Neurotoxicity scale, between patients in losartan arm and patients in control arm receiving standard of care management. Furthermore, levels of nerve growth factor (NGF), which play a major role in development of neuropathy are hypothesized to be higher in patients with p-NSP. We hypothesize that the administration of losartan in premenopausal patients undergoing chemotherapy for breast cancer would decrease the incidence of p-NSP."

For SAA patients who were intolerant to ATG, CsA+ EPAG had similar efficacy to CsA+ATG+EPAG. Since the action mechanism of AVA and EPAG is not exactly the same, and the metabolic level of the elderly is not the same as that of younger patients, it is unknown whether there are predictive factors of efficacy in the treatment of AVA. Thus, we wondered whether CsA+AVA could achieve an efficacy similar to CsA+ATG+AVA in the Elderly."

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) represents a diverse group of neoplasms that can arise in any portion of the head and neck, including the salivary glands, mouth, throat, voice box, sinuses, and nose. Currently, the best initial treatment of newly diagnosed HNSCC is surgery or radiation therapy. However, in many cases, surgery and/ or radiotherapy cannot be safely administered because the disease has already spread to other parts of the body (metastases) when diagnosed. The current diagnostic imaging used to assess the presence of metastasis to other parts of the body is typically a CT scan and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis (referred to as a chest CT or chest MRI). If a metastasis is detected during one of these scans, patients may undergo either a biopsy or additional imaging tests, such as a positron emission tomography (PET) scan to assess the presence of cancer in the bone, lymph nodes, liver, or other organs with greater sensitivity. PET is a type of imaging test that involves the use of a low dose of a type of radioactive substance, such as fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG), that is absorbed by cancer cells and can then be detected using a special camera. Another type of radioactive substance that may be used in other types of cancer, zirconium Zr 89, can also be used in PET imaging. In this study, the researchers are interested in evaluating how well zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab PET is able to detect cancer compared to 18F-FDG PET in patients who have recurrent or newly discovered head and neck or cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. This study will determine if, in comparison to standard imaging tests (CT scans and fludeoxyglucose F-18 (18F-FDG) PET/CT imaging), zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab PET imaging can differentiate between cancer and non-cancer lesions in patients. In this study, two groups of participants will participate. One group will undergo panitumumab alone intravenously (IV) (1 mg/kg) and standard of care (SoC) imaging tests (e.g., 18F-FDG PET or CT scan or MRI) at the time of enrollment to be used to detect indeterminate metastases. The second group will undergo panitumumab intravenously and zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab IV, followed by PET/CT imaging. During the PET/CT procedure, radiation is obtained that measures the activity of the substance (zirconium Zr) in the body and images obtained from the PET/CT scanner may show an increase in the number of cancer-like cells that are seen only when tumor cells are present. The primary purpose of this study is to test to see if 89Zr-panitumumab can provide more accurate results compared to the use of existing standard-of-care imaging techniques and to assess any safety issues that are associated with zirconium Zr 89 panitumumab PET imaging. Patients who have a positive 89Zr-panitumumab PET results will be instructed to undergo additional imaging, such as 18F-FDG PET if necessary, and may also undergo other imaging techniques or procedures as determined by their healthcare providers. Patients may also be asked to complete questionnaires that assess the quality of their life. In addition, physicians may review the subject's medical records to evaluate the management of patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and will document any follow-up procedures in which these patients undergo. The long-term goal of this research is to improve the accuracy of diagnosing metastatic head and neck cancer, which will ultimately lead to improved patient care."

Background: Prophylactic central neck dissection has been widely used in the treatment of thyroid cancer. But this operation did not effectively prevent lymph node metastases in central neck area. The effect of prophylactic central neck dissection on the survival and lymph node recurrence of papillary thyroid cancer at low risk is still controversial. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival and lymph node recurrence in patients with cN0 low-risk papillary thyroid cancer to clarify the role of prophylactic central neck dissection in this population.
Methods: Prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled phase III trial. 3000 patients with T1bN0 low-risk PTCF (tumor sizes range from 11mm to 40mm, with pre-operation FNA positive) were selected for inclusion. The eligible patients were randomly divided into test group and control group. Prophylactic central neck dissection for test group, while no lymph nodes dissection was performed for control group. The main outcome were excellent response and recurrence.
Expected results: Prophylactic central neck dissection could effectively improve the excellent response of cN0 low-risk papillary thyroid cancer, and could significantly delay the recurrence time of lymph node recurrence. However, there was no statistically significant survival advantage of prophylactic central neck dissection."

The study will be conducted in the department of Tiebissou (Gbeke Region in Lac district) Southern Bouake city, central Côte d'Ivoire. The Lac district is characterized by intense indoor malaria transmission with a prevalence of malaria reaching 51.3% in 2021 in children of under 5 years of age and extremely high pyrethroid resistance intensity in the main malaria vectors Anopheles gambiae s.s. and An. coluzzii. A cohort of 50 children will be recruited per cluster in 33 clusters for 12 months follow up to compare incidence of malaria cases between each intervention study arm and the control arm, a cohort of 50 children (45 + 5 to account for loss to follow up) will be recruited per cluster in 33 clusters for 12 months follow up. Malaria infection prevalence surveys will be conducted at baseline, 6 and 12 months after LLIN distribution. Two next-generation LIN containing alpha-cypermethrin pyrethroids will be tested alone or in combination with chlorfenapyr synergist. Vector surveillance will be conducted with the same methods and schedule as for the cohort. Assuming a mean mosquito density of 28 in the control arm and a 60% reduction in mosquitoes in the two intervention arms with a coefficient of variation of 0.55 between clusters, this will give 80% power to detect differences at each timepoint."

In this study the investigators want to reduce the number of treatments down to only 3, given on consecutive days, further enhancing the patient experience and providing evidence that this number of treatments could become the new standard of care. In this study the investigators will be using the very latest state of the art radiotherapy machines and the unique RayPilot system, adopted for routine use by a small number of global radiotherapy centres when delivering prostate SBRT(Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy). The ability to track the position of the prostate cancer throughout the radiotherapy treatment using RayPilot allows the treatment to be given more precisely with less dose being given to the surrounding bladder and rectum. It also ensures that all the intended dose is given to the cancer as the treatment can be interrupted should the cancer move due to rectal gas, changes in bladder filling or simply the patient moving position on the treatment bed, maximizing the chances of cure and minimizing the risk of life changing side effects. This is a single arm 2 stage Phase II study that will test the safety of the 3 fraction radiotherapy schedule. It has built in safety measures to ensure that the immediate post treatment side effects on the bowel and bladder are within the expected limits of acceptance at 12 weeks post completion of treatment. After 43 patients are recruited the initial data will be analyzed and if acceptable the study will continue until all 100 patients have been recruited. The study will be opened in the UK with Edinburgh as the lead Centre, and also in a number of other global centres each of which will ask for their own local ethical approval and sponsorship. The anonymized data from each Centre will be recorded on a trial specific RedCap database held by the University of Edinburgh for analysis of the trial results."

Upper incisor intrusion treatment with mini-implants is considered an invasive treatment for adult patients with deep overbite in order to obtain a more aesthetic appearance, however; it may cause root resorption of these teeth which may lead to root fracture or loss.
This study compares the effectiveness of using a low-level laser (LLLT) in the orthodontic treatment of deep overbite by intrusion movement with mini-implants. In this study, we will measure the root resorption of the upper incisors by using Cone-Beam computed tomography (CBCT) after correction of deep overbite by intrusion movement with mini-implants. We will compare root resorption in the upper incisors of the test group that will receive the laser treatment with a control group that will receive traditional orthodontic treatment with fixed appliances. A total of 20 patients will be recruited for this study. Each patient will be randomly assigned using a randomization sequence (150) to one of the two groups (Low-level laser treatment group or the traditional orthodontic treatment group). Data will be analyzed using SPSS 23.0. Descriptive statistics will be used. The level of significance will be set at P < 0.05."

Colon cancer is the most common neoplasm in our society and the third in the oncological order of frequency. It is still the first in the ranking of oncological diseases mortality in our country. Surgery is the treatment of choice, both for curative reasons, and in cases of advanced and metastatic disease in non-surgical settings. In the curative setting of colon cancer surgery offers a high chance of resection with negative margins, and consequent increase in five-year survival. Radicality of the surgical technique is crucial for this. The quality of surgical specimen, for example the number of harvested lymph nodes is a fundamental factor for the selection of post-operative chemotherapy and for the definition of prognosis in terms of survival. The radicality of the surgical technique influences both: the extent of the en bloc resection of the colonic wall, and lymphadenectomy performed. The more proximal the radical colonic resection, the longer the terminal ileum and the number of vessels removed and consequently the number of lymph nodes collected increase. The quality of lymphadenectomy is an issue that has been the subject of debate for years and recent guidelines (ASCO-NCCN and ESMO) report the number of harvested lymph nodes (12 at maximum) as the main prognostic indicator of survival.
The right hemicolectomy is the most common operation in colon cancer. It consists in the removal of more than 90 cm of colonic wall, on average divided into 443 (45%), 228 (27%), 148 (16%) and 78 (8%) of resected bowel for male, female, right colon and left colon respectively. A D3 lymphadenectomy has not been demonstrated superior to a D2 in a randomized study, whereas a D3 lymphadenectomy has been shown to be superior to a D2 in a meta-analysis. However, these data have not been univocally confirmed by other randomized trials. Many retrospective studies have shown a trend towards better prognostic results in terms of lymph node dissection and reduced risk of tumor recurrence and patient death with a D3 lymphadenectomy compared to a D2. Many of the studies on lymphadenectomy have been based on post-surgical pathological studies. Only a few data indicate the incidence and percentage in the whole series, of cases with prognostic significance (R0, pN, ypN, pT, ypT, pStage) in the analysis of lymphadenectomy.
Thus, there are still controversial aspects regarding the best technique and consequently the best surgical specimen for quality post-operative treatment. No data in the literature exist about the quality of the lymphadenectomy in right hemicolectomy and in particular the impact of the type of lymphadenectomy (D2 versus D3) as related to surgical radicalness (R0, pN, ypN, pT, ypT, pStage).
For this reason, a study was carried out with the collaboration of the Italian Colorectal Surgery Society (SICRE) concerning the right hemicolectomy. In order to evaluate and standardize the quality of lymphadenectomy in the course of right hemicolectomy (RH) in Italian centers that perform high-volume surgery for colonic cancer. The study involves 125 centers throughout the country with at least 25 RHs performed in 2014. After a period of inclusion of 6 months the investigators will evaluate more than 1000 cases using a common data sheet. The study will end after 12 months from the date of the final enrollment of the patient (31/1/15).
For what concerns the study technique, it will be observational with a 12 months follow-up. Once the enrollment of new patients will be verified, patients will be referred to individual databases in each center. The personal data, tumour stage and the type of surgical procedure (open versus laparoscopic and/or robotic) will be collected in all cases. In addition the investigators want to evaluate the following: type of lymphadenectomy (D2 versus D3), mesocolic sail integrity (Benz criteria) and the quality of lymphadenectomy as related to the resection margins. At the end of the 12 months period the data collection center will transfer the data to the coordinating center by fax"

The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of vestibular rehabilitation through exercises on balance and quality of life in children with a significant level of hearing deficit. The design of the study was randomized, controlled, with parallel assignment, in which all families signed informed consent. The participants were divided into two groups: Group I, performed balance exercises using the Cawthorne Cooksey method for 4 weeks, 3 sessions per week, half an hour. This group is called ""Control"" because there is no intervention for the second group. The participants in the control group will continue to receive treatment for their hearing loss as before. Group II, performed exercises with a Swiss ball for 4 weeks, 3 times per week, half an hour.

Efficacy is being evaluated using the Pediatric Berg Balance Scale (PedBBS), which has 43 items that assess the balance of patients according to age. Higher scores indicate improvements in balance, while lower scores indicate decreased balance.

The Four-Step Square Test was also taken to assess the balance of the participants with a 10-meter walk test. This test is used to assess the balance of the patient with a single task. This test takes 5 to 10 minutes.."

Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia (GTN) is highly curative, but can have psychological consequences for women due to the nature of the diagnosis. Little is known about the psychological impact of diagnosis and treatment experienced by women following the completion of treatment. As the specialist centre for GTN in the North of the UK, it is important to understand the experiences and care needs of our patients, particularly given our high incidence rates of this cancer. The aim of the study is to explore women's experiences following treatment, how they managed any negative impacts and investigate if there is gap in the follow up support provided to patients after treatment. The study aims to have 20 participants who received chemotherapy. Semi-structured telephone interviews will be conducted; each interview will be digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis will be used to generate in depth descriptions of the patients' experiences. The findings will enable health care professionals working closely with this unique group of patients to gain some understanding of the patient perspective; recommendations will be made to improve the support and provision of care these patients receive after their treatment has completed."

Malunion of a distal radius fracture is a common complicaton after fracture of the wrist. If the malunion is not fixed by surgery, the patient suffers from persistent wrist pain and functional restrictions. Standard surgical treatment to correct the angulation in the distal radius (deformity) is open wedge corrective osteotomy (OWCO) and plate fixation. However, sometimes, the gap created in the cortical bone after the osteotomy does not heal properly and bone defects remains. One common way to improve bone healing is to fill the gap with bone grafts either from a harvesting site or as a combination of local bone, biodegradable scaffold, and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). One possible source of bone grafts are the bone-forming cells in the iliac crest. We hypothesize that bone grafting will be more beneficial in improving osteotomy healing, reducing bone resorption, and reducing the incidence of complications.
All patients who fulfil the inclusion criteria for open wedge corrective osteotomy of the distal radius will be invited to participate in the study. After informed consent, a surgeon will examine the patients in the operating room under general anesthesia. The patients will be placed in a beach chair position, and the upper extremity in neutral position, at least three times longer than the size of the planned deformation. An additional skin incision is made on the lower part of the iliac crest to expose bone for harvesting or not, depending on randomization. Randomization is performed using sealed envelopes. All included patients will undergo an open wedge osteotomy and plate fixation according to the standard surgical techniques in both groups. In one group, the bone defect will be filled with bone graft of the iliac crest after open wedge osteotomy according the standard procedure. The other group includes patients who will not receive any bone grafts. The participating hospitals have extensive experience with both treatments. The surgeons are unaware of the contents of the prepared envelops. When the patient reaches the end of the postoperative care and is ready to be discharged, the surgeon records the primary outcome measures. The primary endpoints include number of reoperations, number of infection, total time to completion of bone healing, and complications such as bone resorption and hardware loosening. We expect the presence of complications to be more common among patients who have not received any BG."

Behavioral teaching difficulties (BTD) often occur in the classroom, are detrimental for classroom management and negatively affect the course of children's psychosocial and academic development. Despite the fact that BTD are relatively prevalent in schools, no previous studies have examined the effects of brief teacher training interventions for BTD in the school context. Therefore, the objective of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a brief, individualized, three-session teacher training program that exists of two (bi)weekly individually tailored training sessions and a third session of one hour. The training program combines individually-tailored stimulus control and contingency management techniques to treat children's behavioral difficulties in two (bi)weekly training sessions of two hours and a third session of one hour in which the training will be evaluated and maintenance training will be provided. A randomized controlled trial with two arms will be used. Teachers will be randomly assigned (equal randomization) to (a) brief teacher training with practice as usual (PAU) or (b) PAU only. To ensure blinding of the outcome assessor, the severity of teachers-rated daily measured target behaviors in specific classroom situations will be measured with brief daily phone calls to teachers on four consecutive school days. This approach of using observer ratings to assess the effectiveness of a treatment intervention is novel, efficient and cost-effective. The results of this study will enhance our understanding of the effectiveness of such approaches to improve classroom management and support optimal behavioral development of children.."

Chronic non-specific neck pain is a public health problem due to its high prevalence, the frequency of consultations, and the costs related to the disease. While physiotherapy is considered the gold standard of treatment for neck pain, tele-rehabilitation is increasingly being used. However, few studies have evaluated the feasibility and usability of tele-rehabilitation based on virtual reality exercises for pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific neck pain. This study aims to assess the feasibility of a remote rehabilitation combining immersive virtual reality neck exercises and therapeutic education for individuals with chronic non-specific neck pain. The aims of this study are: (1) to evaluate the feasibility (mainly the retention rate, adhesion to treatment, safety, and implementation at home) of a remote rehabilitation based on virtual reality exercises and tele-consultations; (2) to assess the acceptability and usability of this tele-rehabilitation; and (3) to explore its effects on perceived pain, range of motion, neck disability, quality of life, and illness perception.

This study is an exploratory, randomized, controlled, monocentric, pilot study. 16 patients randomized in two groups are planned. The first group will receive virtual reality-based multimodal rehabilitation for six weeks (virtual reality exercises and tele-consultations with a physiotherapist), whereas the second group will receive therapeutic education (six information booklets on pain, physical activity, and relaxation, and weekly follow-up by the physiotherapist).

The study consists of three sessions. Session 1: screening assessment and informed consent. Session 2: baseline assessment (pre-intervention) and randomization into the two experimental groups. Session 3: post-intervention assessment (at week 6).

Quantitative data such as the retention rate, adhesion to treatment, safety, global perceived effect, pain intensity, quality of life, range of motion, and illness perception will be collected. Acceptability and usability will be assessed through self-reported questionnaires and semi-structured interviews at the end of the intervention.

In total, five booklets, four tele-consultations, and six virtual reality sessions will be planned over a six-week period."

Preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PPROM) is a common cause of preterm birth and is associated with a high rate of neonatal complications, including neonatal respiratory complications, intraventricular hemorrhage, sepsis, pneumonia, and death. Cervical examinations, including digital examinations and speculum examinations, are recommended for patients with PPROM in order to estimate cervical dilation and fetal station. These are useful for planning for delivery, assessing the size and location of the fetal head in the vagina, and to assess the presence of chorioamnionitis. Traditionally, speculum examinations have been considered painful and uncomfortable for patients, but digital examinations have been associated with lower levels of patient discomfort. Due to a potential higher rate of maternal infection after PPROM, we previously studied the rate of bacteremia after PPROM comparing delivery after a speculum exam to delivery after a digital exam. After completing this study, we found no difference in the rate of maternal or neonatal bacteremia between the two groups. Conversely, digital exams were associated with lower total discomfort scores (10.24 vs. 18.97, P<0.001) and lower level of anxiety scores (4.0 vs. 8.1, P<0.001). Therefore, digital exams are likely a safer cervical exam without major drawbacks.
In the present study, we propose a randomized control trial comparing the rate of maternal and neonatal chorioamnionitis, maternal intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, maternal wound infections, maternal death, composite neonatal complications (sepsis, IVH, NEC, hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, and neonatal death) and length of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission in patients with PPROM undergoing speculum versus digital cervical examinations. 
Patients with PPROM will be randomized to either a speculum or digital cervical examination as necessary for clinical management. We hypothesize that the rate of adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes, as well as length of stay in the NICU, will be similar between the two groups."

No reliable or valid quantitative measure of finger dexterity exists for cervical myelopathy. To address the lack of a reliable dexterity scale, the investigators propose to develop a novel finger dexterity tool based on current knowledge of hand function in myelopathy. The investigators will recruit patients newly diagnosed with cervical myelopathy as well as healthy controls in order to evaluate the validity and reliability of this novel diagnostic tool. Once patients and healthy controls have agreed to participate and have been consented accordingly, each participant will perform a total of 15 unique finger movements, each 15 seconds in length, which will be recorded and analyzed to estimate the severity of cervical myelopathy. The investigators aim is to develop an objective, reliable, and practical instrument for assessing finger dexterity in patients with myelopathy. By demonstrating the validity and reliability of this tool, the investigators hope to improve the ability of clinicians to accurately diagnose, monitor, and measure functional outcomes in patients with myelopathy."

Despite great advances in modern anesthesia and surgical techniques, postoperative pain continues to be a major problem. Postoperative pain is an essential problem for both patient comfort and fast mobilization in the postoperative period. SPSIPB is used successfully in many areas of pain management. However, its efficacy in breast surgery procedures has not been reported. This study is aimed at examining the effect of SPSIPB on postoperative shoulder-pain management in patients undergoing mastectomy and axillary dissection surgery. Our primary aim is to compare NRS scores and second is to evaluate the need for rescue analgesics, block-related complications, dermatome level, and side effects associated with opioid use.
The results of the intergroup comparison will be evaluated using the Fischer's exact and Student's t test and the analysis of variance and post-hoc test will be used in these evaluations."

This is a prospective cohort study.
Recently, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) lesions can infiltrate along the ducts from the level of the nipple. Previously, the detection of a breast abnormality detected by breast imaging examination is always based on breast symptoms such as non-palpable mass or palpable mass, or an imaging finding with a high degree of specificity. Unfortunately, early DCIS lesions are mostly detected only by nipple discharge and are usually negative for breast palpation or imaging (especially mammography and ultrasound), and ductal discharge is not uncommon in Chinese women. When these early DCIS lesions are diagnosed after biopsy, they have infiltrated into the ducts and expanded to the surrounding breast tissue. In these cases, the breast imaging examination cannot detect the early breast lesion, and this diagnosis is often only based on the symptoms of nipple discharge and may be missed if the symptoms of nipple discharge are mild and do not follow the specific time cycle at all.
The mammographic findings of breast lesions caused by nipple discharge are mostly ductal calcifications, asymmetric or multiple intraductal masses, or abnormalities of ductal structures that may or may not be accompanied by calcifications. Compared with other lesions found by breast imaging, it is often not clear whether it is cancer. Therefore, ductal discharge in women is often treated as a high-risk group for breast cancer, and early detection measures should be used to identify early breast cancers and accurately assess the risk of breast cancer.
As an exploratory study, the study plans to conduct another imaging using contrast-enhanced spectral mammography (CESM) 4-6 hours after the routine iopromide 370 mgI/ml-enhanced ductography, so as to explore the optimization of the ductography technique and attempt to make a systematic description of the mammary duct structure in the Chinese population of patients with pathological nipple discharge, and thus to assess the clinical value of this delayed imaging protocol, including the effectiveness of the diagnostic dimension of the disease and the safety of the radiation dose and the degree of patient tolerance."

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of standard pelvic floor physical therapy with the addition of a pelvic floor muscle training device against using the pelvic floor muscle training device in isolation for the treatment of Stress Urinary Incontinence. The investigators expect to demonstrate that the use of the Pelvic Floor Trainer will enhance the efficacy of pelvic floor physical therapy. 
The Pelvic Floor Muscle Trainer (Pelex Upp) (device under study) is a self-diagnostic device that teaches the subject how to locate and control the pelvic floor muscle group, as well as assisting a clinician in measuring pelvic floor muscle function and strength using biofeedback sensors. The device delivers auditory and visual guidance to the subject, and reports the data to the subject's computer screen or mobile device. The device is not an aid intended to replace regular treatment plans or treatments with a treating physician, but instead a tool designed to assist treating physicians in providing treatment to patients with pelvic floor muscle issues related to stress, urge, or mixed urinary incontinence.
Subjects will be recruited via an online recruitment tool to participate in the study. Participating subjects will undergo a screening process and will take a pretreatment survey to assess urinary incontinence symptoms. After completing the survey, the participant will be assigned to one of the following three treatment groups: Group 1: Treatment with the Pelex Upp alone (device under study). Group 2: Treatment with the Pelex Upp in combination with 4 visits with a treating clinician (device under study). Group 3: Treatment with 4 visits with a treating clinician (comparative treatment). Subjects will be followed up approximately 4 weeks after treatment begins in order to evaluate the treatment's effectiveness."

A full factorial experiment with three interventions (recruiting individuals under supervision, incentivizing intervention attendance, and delivering the intervention in an open group format) will be used to maximize study power and examine the individual and interactive contributions of each intervention delivery strategy on intervention attendance (with a minimum of 50% of participants attending at least 50% of the intervention; number of sessions attended) and to test their efficacy. The goal is to improve access to treatment through a greater understanding of these important factors related to intervention delivery strategies."
814,"<br>Inadequate pain management can have very serious consequences such as prolonged hospitalization and increased mortality and morbidity. Although many regional anesthesia techniques have been used to manage acute postoperative pain, the most common of which are intercostal block and paravertebral block, these techniques may not cover all dermatomes, which can cause incomplete pain control and the need for additional pain treatment. The interpectoral-serratus anterior plane block is a regional anesthetic technique applied to cover the thoracic dermatomes. This technique has been used for pain management in lung and mediastinum surgeries for years. There is no information about using this technique in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The aim of the intervention study is to evaluate the effect of interpectoral plane block combined with serratus anterior plane block on the pain and recovery process in the case of minimally invasive cardiac surgery using the erector spinae block. With the help of this study, the investigators wanted to determine whether the pain management of the patients is better with erector spinae block and interpectoral-serratus blocks in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Since these treatments are the most common regional anesthesia methods used in regional anesthesia and have been used since many years ago, we believe that this study, which aims to provide clear data in terms of pain management in this surgery, will provide new data to regional anesthesia applications to be applied in minimally invasive cardiac surgery. The sample size of the study is estimated as 50 participants each for the intervention group and the control group, as a result of the literature review and the number of patients who came to our service in the last 12 months. In addition to the data obtained from the sample groups, data to be used in our statistical analyses from the literature will be reviewed and recorded.

Introduction: Haemorrhoids is a common disease and it is one of the most important anorectal diseases. The best conservative treatment, is the surgical treatment. The problem of the operation is post hemorridectomy pain. There are many procedures have been described to decrease the pain post hemorridectomy such as internal sphincterotomy, botox injection, giving strong analgesics. Our objective is to evaluate the efficacy of botox and internal sphincterotomy in pain relief after hemorrhoidectomy. Methods: In a prospective randomised controlled trial, 100 patients will be randomly allocated into two separate groups. One group will have botox injection in the internal sphincter(Botox hemorridectomy group) and the other will have internal sphincterotomy(Sphincterotomy hemorridectomy group) in addition to hemorroidectomy. Post operative pain will be assessed by the visual analogue scale(vason), time taken to return to normal activities.
All subjects who have chronic idiopathic hemorrhoids and had failed a conservative treatment and have grade 3 and 4 hemorrhoids will be included in this trial. Patients with partial rectal prolapse, surgically unfit patients , patients who need emergency operation for complicated hemorrhoids and patients with rectal varices due to portal hypertension will be excluded. The primary aim of this study to decrease the pain by injection botox after hemorridectomy compared to the pain after internal sphincterotomy with hemorroidectomy in a randomised controlled design.
The secondary aim is to compare the time taken to return to daily activities in patients having internal sphincterotomy compared to botox injection with hemorroidectomy . Also to evaluate the outcome of hemoridectomy with botox and internal sphincterotomy with hemoridectomy. Statistical analysis: Comparing the outcomes of the two groups will be done using chi square test, Mann Whitney U test, paired t test, one way analysis of variance and Spearman Rho correlation tests.

Background: Colorectal cancer is one of the few tumors that can achieve long-term survival of patients, and maintaining the best possible quality of life in patients is of great importance. However, the recurrence and metastasis rates of colorectal cancer are still quite high, and about 30% of patients have tumor recurrence during the first three years after radical treatment. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to study the clinical efficacy and safety of fruquintinib as maintenance treatment for advanced CRC patients who have achieved NED after adjuvant chemotherapy.
Objective: To explore the clinical efficacy and safety of fruquintinib as maintenance therapy for advanced CRC patients who achieve NED after adjuvant chemotherapy.
Methods: This is a prospective, single-arm, phase II study. Patients will receive Fruquintinib maintenance treatment for six months or until tumor recurrence, metastasis or intolerable drug toxicities occur within six months. After achieving NED, a chest, abdomen and pelvis CT scan with contrast or a chest CT scan with abdominal and pelvic MRI scan will be performed every 6 months within 2 years. Colonoscopy will be performed annually. CEA, CA19-9 and abdominal and pelvic ultrasound will be performed every 3 months. If abnormalities are found, further imaging studies and colonoscopy will be conducted, and if necessary, a PET/CT scan will be performed. The primary end point of this study was the 2-year recurrence and metastasis rate. The secondary end point includes the 2-year disease-free survival rate, 2-year overall survival rate and toxicity. The time frame of 2 years is used to ensure the completion of adjuvant treatment and the maintenance treatment at the designated time points. The incidence of drug-related adverse events is another important indicator for drug safety evaluation. The severity and frequency of adverse events in this study will be recorded and graded according to the NCI CTCAE version 5.0, and dose adjustments will be made according to the corresponding rules."

The investigators propose to conduct an aggregated N-of-1 randomized placebo-controlled trial of Methylphenidate for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and subjective cognitive complaints in Veterans with PTSD, with or without a history of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). In this multi-site trial, 70 Veterans, ages 18-65, with a diagnosis of PTSD and subjective cognitive complaints, as measured by both the Neuro-QoL Cognitive Function Short Form (NeuroQoL) and a single item about cognitive functioning in clinical interview, will be randomized to receive either methylphenidate (MPH) or placebo (PBO) for two 28-day treatment blocks, with the order of the treatment blocks randomly assigned. Weekly cognitive functioning assessments and bi-weekly PTSD, depression, and cognitive functioning evaluations will be completed during both treatment blocks. This study design consists of two cycles, providing 8 weeks each of MPH and PBO, and allows not only to detect a main effect of treatment on PTSD and cognitive functioning, but also a significant treatment response in those with a history of mTBI. Through careful and systematic evaluations of neurocognitive functioning, the investigators will explore whether the effects observed extend beyond symptomology to include improvements in neurocognitive functions, as measured by objective tests of attention and executive function. This design will provide the specificity of treatment effect necessary to evaluate the impact of MPH on PTSD, depression, and cognitive symptomology across a range of severity levels. Should the investigators find that MPH is efficacious for PTSD, depression, and/or cognitive functioning in this population, it would provide an important step in the search for effective treatment for the many suffering from these life-interrupting illnesses."

Invasive study of microvascular function has become highly relevant for the diagnosis of alterations in coronary physiology for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic purposes. Currently, the microvascular resistance index (IMR) is considered the gold standard for invasive diagnosis of coronary microvascular function, with a recommendation of 2A in the current clinical practice guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. In recent years, technical innovation has allowed for the measurement of absolute coronary flow (AF) and minimal microvascular resistance (MMR) using continuous thermodilution, enabling the determination of quantitative flow and resistance units. However, the main limitation is the absence of reference values. Objectives: The main objective is to prospectively validate the capacity of CFRflow as a predictor of the presence of angina measured by SAQ7 in patients with INOCA at 3 months. Secondary objectives include identifying hemodynamic factors related to the persistence of angina at 3 and 12 months, identifying clinical factors related to the persistence of angina, establishing the prevalence of patients with coronary microvascular dysfunction within the cohort of INOCA patients, identifying predictors of major cardiovascular events at 12 months, validating the pathological value of MMR and establishing the pathological value of AF measured in ml/min. The study also aims to evaluate the concordance between measures of the coronary microvascular function obtained by continuous thermodilution and bolus thermodilution, as well as their concordance with clinical characteristics."

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a syndrome characterized by chronic, recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort. The etiology and pathophysiology of IBS are not well known; however, changes in the intestinal microbiome and ecosystem, food intolerance, persistent intestinal hypersensitivity, and inflammation are suggested. A temple stay is one lifestyle program consisting of a vegetarian diet and daily meditation, and our research team hypothesizes that it may be effective at stabilizing chronic intestinal inflammation and at inducing changes in the composition of the gut microbiome, leading to subjective symptom improvement. In this study, 30 patients with IBS who agree to participate in a temple stay for 8 days (4-day monastic training period and a 4-day observation period) will have baseline IBS symptoms recorded using the IBS-Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS). Fecal samples will also be collected before and after the temple stay experience. The IBS symptoms score, intestinal microbiome, and quality of life will be compared before and after the temple stay experience by the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test. The results will be calculated based on data from 15 subjects. The study will support the effectiveness of the temple stay in controlling the chronic glycemic symptoms of IBS by objectively validating the relationship between the change in the intestinal ecosystem and the change in symptom score, and its clinical impact will be observed."

Asthma is an airway disease and one of the most common non-communicable diseases affecting over 339 million individuals worldwide. One important advance in the treatment of this disease is inhalers (both dry powder inhalers and pressurised metered dose inhalers). However, there are significant environmental impacts to the production and disposal of inhalers. Metered dose inhalers (MDI) contain potent greenhouse gases (GHG) and a recent study from the UK revealed that although patient awareness of the discrepancy in climate impact of inhalers is low, their willingness to change inhalers after being educated on the subject is high. An example of inhaler change is to use the Bricanyl Turbuhaler (terbutaline) instead of Ventolin (salbutamol) as a rescue medication. They are both short-acting bronchodilators (SABA) and have similar pharmacodynamics. However, use of Bricanyl for one year produces 7,183 kgCO2e or the equivalent of 59.9 km by car, whereas use of Ventolin for one year produces 411,720 kgCO2e, the equivalent of 3,431 km by car. The objective of this study is to assess asthma patients' willingness to change inhalers for environmental reasons as well as prescribers' willingness to prescribe a different inhaler for environmental reasons at patient's request. The study will also be assessing patient awareness of the climate impact of inhalers and the importance that they attribute to this issue as well as other important issues (such as cost and ease of use). The investigator will also be asking prescribers about their willingness to prescribe environmentally friendly inhalers."

Disability is part of being human. Everyone may be temporarily or permanently disabled at some point in their life, and it has been stated that they will experience increasing difficulties in functioning in old age. He estimates that the prevalence of disability among women is 60% higher than that of men. Disabled women coexist in a dual state of vulnerability where being a woman and being a disabled person have two social disadvantages. Among people with disabilities, women with physical disabilities have higher unmet healthcare needs than women without disabilities. Cancer is an important public health problem and cause of death all over the world. According to the Turkish Cancer Statistics, it is estimated that approximately 69,633 women are diagnosed with cancer in our country. Among the most common cancers in women; breast, uterine corpus, ovarian and cervix cancers are seen to be prominent, respectively. It is known that with regular examinations and screenings, early diagnosis of breast and cervical cancer increases the chance of treatment. International studies show that women face barriers and difficulties in accessing reproductive health and cancer screening services. In the study of Horner-Johson et al., it was stated that especially rural women with disabilities had lower mammography and Pap-smear tests compared to non-disabled women. It is emphasized that as a result of lower screening participation of persons with disabilities, there is a higher risk of cancer mortality with delayed diagnosis. In another study investigating the reasons why women with physical disabilities do not engage in preventive health services; time constraints and priorities, interactions between health professionals and women with disabilities, lack of knowledge, belief, sensitivity, belief that people with disabilities have more information than service providers, economic problems, transportation problems, appointment problems, availability of accessible facilities, physical pain, mammography, pap smear It has been stated that the factors affecting the use of mammography and gynecological examination services and the women's belief and attitude systems were discussed with the participants. One of the most effective methods in health education for cancer is the Health Belief Model (SIM). The most basic components of the model are the perception of susceptibility, the perception of seriousness, the perception of benefit, the perception of obstacles, the health motivation and the perception of trust. The SIM recommends that if a person has a desire to prevent illness or a belief in recovery, he or she should take a specific health action to prevent illness as a positive behavior. This study was conducted to determine the barriers for women with physical disabilities between the ages of 18-65 to adopt behaviors to diagnose common cancers in women at an early stage, and to increase participation in early diagnosis behaviors in cancers that are common in women (Breast Self Examination (BSE), Clinical Breast Examination (CBE), Self-Examination. Vulva Self Examination (KKVM), Mammography and PapSmear Test) by determining the awareness of women with physical disabilities. The effectiveness of awareness training based on SIM was planned to be determined."

Trastuzumab is a biological targeted agent that improves survival in HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. It may also be effective in the neoadjuvant setting. We aim to identify high-quality clinical trials that report the effectiveness of the neoadjuvant treatment with Trastuzumab, combined with conventional chemotherapy, to treat HER2-positive breast cancer.
The primary endpoint for this systematic review is an estimated (with 95% confidence intervals) of the pathological complete response rate for the HER2-positive breast cancer. Secondary endpoints are estimates of overall survival and disease-free survival in the different trials.
There is a need for a systematic review to give a clear overview of the evidence on the efficacy and safety of the most promising and effective treatments in the management of HER2-positive breast cancer.
Inclusion criteria: - All patients with operable and locally advanced breast cancer who have received neoadjuvant therapy including trastuzumab and chemotherapy are eligible. - Clinical trials will be included in the review if at least 20 patients per treatment arm have been evaluated. - All cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens will be considered eligible for this systematic review given that the same drugs were given at the same dose in every trial."

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western World. Current CAD management mainly involves the assessment of the severity of lumen stenosis (visual estimation of diameter stenosis) in the clinical workup. However, severe CAD patients with stable or unstable angina often undergo invasive coronary angiography (ICA) with a functional diagnostic evaluation using pressure wire-based FFR (FFR). Although FFR is currently best practice for assessment of functionally significant coronary stenoses, it is expensive and complex. IVUS and ultrasonic flow ratio (UFR) represent new, non-invasive cardiovascular imaging modalities that could be utilized on a larger scale.
The present study examines the diagnostic performance of ultrasonic flow ratio (UFR) when compared to FFR in the assessment of functional hemodynamic relevance of coronary artery stenosis. A total of 80 patients with moderate, intermediated coronary lesions (DS: 30-75%) are recruited from the intervention group of the randomized, multicenter FACET trial to undergo a single IVUS pullback and the pressure wire-based FFR. The UFR will be measured prospectively using the ﬁfty-ﬁve Echo intravascular Echocardiography catheter (Fifty-Five, Vivid Diagnostics) immediately following PCI. The aim of the study is to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of UFR in comparison with FFR in regard to predicting functionally significant coronary stenosis per patient. The ﬁtness for clinical use is determined using the De Bakey classification."

Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of Balint group activities on reducing nursing leaders' burnout and enhancing self-efficacy by means of randomised controlled study design.
Inclusion criteria: The inclusion criteria are registered nurse staff of clinical departments who have not participated in Balint groups previously.
Methods: The study adopted the design approach of randomized controlled trial (RCT) and the mixed-method parallel assignment study design. The sample of the study comprised 100 nurse leaders who voluntarily participated in the study. Participants in the Balint group completed Balint training for a period of three months.

Pre-established measures: Before the Balint training, both groups completed a series of questionnaires, including the general self-efficacy scale (GSES), the Maslach Burnout Inventory-Human Services Survey (MBI-HSS), and the self-reported questionnaire of quality of life. After the Balint training, the follow-up survey was conducted for all participants, in the format of the same measures as pre-tests. Two to four months later, some participants selected from both groups were invited to participate in in-depth interviews using a semi-structured interview.

Limitations: The potential biases include self-selection biases, inability to ensure the follow-up rate is completed by all participants until the end of the research, the possible influence of other work-related variables on the study outcomes, and the lack of control in a single unit for participants.

Expectations: It is expected that completing Balint training activities will reduce the burnout and increase the self-efficacy of nurse leaders.

Theory: Balint's original idea of Balint group is a safe working environment to help the improvement and progress of participants, including doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals. The Balint group is a collaborative, safe and open learning space. Balint believes that the working space of medical staff should be a place of mutual trust and protection. The Balint group is a place where participants feel safe and comfortable in the process of mutual supervision and exchange, can express themselves fully and accurately, in addition, can learn and improve through listening and self-exploration.
In China, Balint group has been proved to be effective in relieving burnout and improving self-efficacy. However, whether the effect of Balint group can be applied to the specific context of nurse leaders in China has not been systematically verified.
In this study, the investigators conducted a longitudinal study to evaluate the effectiveness of Balint groups intervention on reducing burnout and enhancing self-efficacy of Nurse leaders in China."

Background:
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common causes of dementia. Among the neuropsychiatric and behavioral symptoms seen in AD patients, apathy is the most common symptom. In addition, depression, aggression, anxiety and sleep disorders often accompany and contribute to increased mortality and reduced quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Because of the inability to treat the disease completely and adverse drug side effects of the drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms and behaviors, it is recommended that non-pharmacological treatments be applied first. The concept of cognitive stimulation in AD is one of the most popular approaches. Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) is the best evidence-based practice with robust clinical trials, applied according to a specific guideline for individuals with mild and moderate dementia. The inability to treat the disease completely worsens this situation. Because of the inability to treat the disease completely and adverse drug side effects of the drugs used to treat neuropsychiatric symptoms and behaviors, it is recommended that non-pharmacological treatments be applied first.

Objective:
The aim of this research is to determine the effect of CST application on the levels of apathy, loneliness, anxiety and daily living activities in elderly individuals diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease.

Method:
Ethical permission has been obtained from the Ethical Board of Gaziantep University Faculty of Medicine.
After obtaining permission, data collection will include people with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers. In the first stage, individuals with Alzheimer's Disease and their caregivers who have agreed to participate in the study are informed about the research and the consent form is obtained from the caregivers of individuals with Alzheimer's Disease. Those who volunteer and prefer to participate in the research are assessed with the inclusion criteria.

Design Details: A randomized controlled experimental research design is planned with pretest, intermediate test and post-test control group as the design basis.

Study type: Interventional
Participants: Randomized controlled clinical trial
Intervention model: Parallel Assignment
Masking: Double

Procedure:
The participants who have been evaluated in terms of all inclusion criteria will be divided into two groups by the 4-block random sampling method, with one group receiving an intervention and the other group receiving no intervention. In the control group, in addition to standard care, individual and group activities will not be applied to the patients, and the control group will continue their daily routines with their family members. The group where the intervention will be applied will be called Intervention Group. This group will participate in Cognitive Stimulation Therapy application for 14 sessions. The training will be held two days a week at the same time and same location. After the 14th session, they will be given an individual session for the final application. CST sessions consist of 14 individual sessions, in which the patient completes at least 8 sessions, in addition to 2 to 3 sessions for each other. Before the application, an interview will be done and they will be evaluated using standardized scales. After the 14th application, these tests will be applied for the second time. In this way, the cognitive and social state, apathy, anxiety, loneliness and daily living skills of the patients will be assessed.

Instruments:
Data will be collected through forms and tests designed for the purpose of research. There is no standard Turkish version of the questionnaire or scale suitable for assessing the level of apathy, loneliness, anxiety, daily living skills and cognitive state in individuals with Alzheimer's. Therefore, validated scale Turkish versions (UCLA Loneliness Scale; Beck Depression Inventory; Geriatric Anxiety Scale - 14 items; Apathy Evaluation Scale in Alzheimer's; Functional Disability in Dementia Scale; Cognitive Stimulation Therapy Individual Session Evaluation Form; Cognitive Stimulation Therapy Group Session Evaluation Form; Treatment Feasibility Questionnaire for Psychological Interventions) will be used in the same form in the study.

Apathy Evaluation Scale in Alzheimer's: In this scale, which consists of 18 items, there are positive or negative statements. It is evaluated according to the 4-point Likert scale (1=completely disagree, 4=completely agree). The highest score in the Alzheimer Apathy Scale is 72, the lowest score is 18.

The aim of the study was to determine the effect of counselling and follow-up after breast cancer education on early diagnosis behavior and healthy lifestyle behavior.
The study was a prospective, parallel, two-arm (1:1), randomised controlled experimental study. Participants were randomly divided into the study group and the control group. The total sample of the study was 160. The study group that received counselling had its frequency of early breast cancer diagnosis behavior, counseling and healthy lifestyle behavior examined before and after training, whereas the control group was not given any additional education or application. Data was collected using the Descriptive Characteristics Form, Breast Cancer Early Diagnosis Behaviors Form, Counselling Form, and Healthy Lifestyle Behaviors Scale II.
The study found that counselling after breast cancer education had a positive effect on early diagnosis behaviors, specifically self-examination. However, there was no effect on healthy lifestyle behaviors. The investigators suggest that counselling after breast cancer awareness training for women with risk factors may increase self-examination and early diagnosis behaviors, and more research is needed to improve lifestyle."

The prevalence of chronic pain remains high at around 20 percent of the population, with a disabling impact on functional performance, personal well-being and daily life, as well as an economic burden at the national and international level. Chronic pain is nowadays one of the most challenging medical conditions that health professionals have to deal with, as it has proven extremely difficult to be treated, with a therapeutic success rate of only 10%. In order to provide a personalized and efficacious answer to the complexity of the physiological and psychosocial pain experience, new interventions and therapies are required to change the landscape of chronic pain management. The major problem with assessing pain is the heterogeneous nature of the construct of pain, which encompasses both physical and psychological aspects. While the gold standard in pain assessment is self-reported pain scores, today 95% of patients suffering from chronic pain have poor pain relief, presenting high satisfaction rates for treatment. Therefore, the efficacy of currently available treatments is suboptimal, and new approaches for characterizing pain have to be devised to improve patient's quality of life. pAIn-sense aims to design and develop a digital-based telemonitoring platform, integrating innovative digital technologies and Artificial Intelligence models, that enables real-time and objective pain monitoring in daily life scenarios. The investigators plan to study patient pain, as a continuous process in daily settings, using wearable non-invasive physiological sensors (such as galvanic skin response, blood pressure, heart rate, electroencephalogram, functional images and temperature sensors) and questionnaires (anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, sleep, etc.), which will provide information on the patient's pain experience using an artificial intelligence model. The data collected will be used to produce daily personalized reports about the pain experienced by the subject. Physicians will have access to a holistic health-dashboard collecting both psychophysiological and psychosocial details, allowing them to adjust the medication, and to evaluate progress of pain. Therefore, pAIn-sense aims to provide a digital-based telemonitoring platform for pain assessment and personalized treatment, with the ultimate goal to provide a new tool for pain management that will improve patient's quality of life, by understanding the true nature and multidimensional aspects of their pain, thereby changing the current landscape of chronic pain therapy."

Introduction: Lymphatic Malformations (LMs) are abnormal collections of lymphatic vessels. There are two types of LMs: macrocystic and microcystic LMs. Macrocystic LMs are rare, and treatment options are limited. This study will be conducted to assess whether TARA-002, an investigational treatment, is effective and safe in reducing volume of cysts and increasing or restoring function in these rare LMs. Procedure, Risks, and Benefits: Subjects will be treated with 4 to 20 intracystic injections of TARA-002 spaced approximately 6 weeks apart into the target cyst or cysts for a total of up to 8 months. TARA-002 has been previously shown to reduce the volume of cysts and improve function. Risks are generally similar to those with other procedures to treat LMs, including surgery, sclerotherapy, microwave or laser ablation and chemoembolization. Benefits are injections can be given as an outpatient procedure under conscious sedation with local anesthetic. If the child completes the study it is likely that they will have decreased volume of their LM and increased function, and that the cyst or cysts will not have further increased in size. It is also possible that the participant will have a reduction in the need for treatment with local anesthetics, analgesics or medications to reduce swelling. This research may help to avoid surgical removal, as well as the potential complications that can be related to surgery such as increased pain, blood loss, infection, hospitalization or general anesthesia. Treatment is usually associated with discomfort or pain in the area where the injections or treatments are given. Other risks include the possibility of an allergic reaction to the treatment, which is rare, or injection of the treatment into the wrong cyst. Study participants will be monitored for side effects in the hospital after injections and outpatient. The study has risks that are similar to those of any type of treatment, such as the risk of infection or scar tissue formation, but it also has other unique risks such as changes in blood pressure, changes in heart rate, changes from normal blood tests, allergic reactions or problems that could affect your vision. There is the risk of the treatment being ineffective. Participants will need to have their parent or legally authorized representative (LAR) sign a written document of consent for the study. For younger participants, they will need to sign the assent form if they are old enough. Your doctor can answer any specific questions you may have. There will be an opportunity for participants and their families to learn more about the study during the screening visit. There will be additional opportunities to discuss the study during the visits in the hospital after treatments. If you agree to take part, you will be able to ask any questions or discuss the study further. If you and your parent/LAR decide to join the study, you will be asked to sign the informed consent/assent form and may have up to 2 screening visits prior to receiving any study treatment. You may receive treatment if you meet the selection criteria for the study. This study will assess the effectiveness in treatment of macrocystic LM in the Head and Neck region (H & N) (i.e., face, neck, eye orbits) after treatment of TARA-002. The study is an expansion of the Phase I safety study. The dosage and method of application of TARA-002 is currently unclear for larger cystic volume disease in children, especially those that are difficult to treat by conventional means of sclerotherapy or surgical resection. The study will be conducted as a single-group, open-label trial in participants between 6 months to less than 18 years of age. This study will assess the efficacy, safety, tolerability and long term performance of TARA-002 for the treatment of LM in participants. Repeat injection treatment within the same cyst can begin approximately 28 days (4 weeks) after the last injection in the previous cycle. The study may take up to 32 weeks after the last treatment injection. Participants who do well in their first treatment cycle may have an option to continue treatment in future cycles after discussing this with their doctor and obtaining approval from the sponsor. An opportunity for participants and their families to provide written feedback on the study and their experience is available after completion of the study at 32 weeks. This is a voluntary, anonymous process and is not part of any other study or clinical research. If the participant chooses to provide feedback, they may choose to share their information with their treating physician, but they do not have to."

The purpose of this study is to determine the potential long-term benefits of early aggressive treatment of patients diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia. During a period of five years, patients with hyperlipidaemia and/or Type 2 Diabetes will be encouraged to take dietary supplements and/or dietary advice and to undertake regular physical exercise. The hypothesis is that early aggressive treatment for two years of patients diagnosed with hyperlipidaemia will result in a lower number of patients developing heart disease (coronary heart disease, heart attack or stroke) and/or Type 2 Diabetes. Patients with dyslipidaemia/hypertension/ Type 2 Diabetes will also be treated."

People with severe communication difficulties are known to face multiple access barriers to assistive technology. One major challenge for this population is access to augmentative and alternative communications (AAC), which can improve social interaction and employment outcomes. While AAC devices currently in use are effective, they may be inaccessible either due to high cost or the physical size of the device. More compact AAC devices are needed. These smaller devices can then offer greater flexibility in the AAC delivery environment and enable people to maintain a more natural interaction style with other people. Small handheld devices such as smartphones and tablets may be used as AAC devices due to their small size, multi-user access, and portability, however these devices are not optimised for AAC use. The Earswitch™ is a new type of AAC device which fits in the ear canal and operates using a soft biocompatible material in the form of an earpiece and a miniscule camera hidden inside the earbud. The camera sits in the ear canal in close proximity to the ear drum, which enables it to detect and analyse low frequency sounds (around 140Hz) that can be created using the tensor tympani (TT) muscle in the outer ear. The Earswitch™ provides a simple input mechanism using TT movements and no external switches or other input devices are needed.
Unfortunately, very little is known about how well people with severe communication difficulties can contract the TT muscle in response to visual or audio stimuli. This research study therefore aims to investigate the robustness of the Earswitch™ by asking participants to make TT contractions in response to a series of stimuli. Additionally, interviews will be conducted with participants about the fit of the camera and its overall suitability for future AAC implementation. Therefore, this study will aim to generate valuable information about the potential of the camera to act as an input device and about how well people with severe communication difficulties can use the Earswitch™ effectively."

Autologous Adipose Tissue (AAT), is well documented to contain stem cell populations, but also extracellular matrix elements and a diverse cell population. We aim in a randomized controlled trial to see whether AAT as cartilage regeneration technique would be superior to microfracture in cartilage repair in patients with femoral condyles lesion (type II-III according to Outerbridge classification). All participants in this study will undergo a single stage knee arthroscopy and will be divided into 3 different protocols in a randomized manner. This paper serves as an introduction into our study and describes the design, including outcome measures and baseline demographic data of all participants in the study.
The 50 consecutive patients with symptomatic single femoral condyles isolated ulceration with no previous intra-articular treatment were referred to KOREMA clinic. Inclusion criteria were a symptomatic femoral condyles focal cartilage lesion (type II-III according to Outerbridge classification) without previous treatment that could affect the evaluation of the procedures under study (previous knee surgery, systemic treatment for osteoarthritis). The presence of concomitant knee deformity was accepted if it was between 50-100 according to Whiteside classification. Patients with a valgus deformity above 100 or a varus deformity of 50-1000, a history of intra-articular injections of corticosteroid within the last 6 months, a varus deformity less than 10, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Gout, Systemic Arthritis, Crystal arthropathy, Psoriatic Arthritis, Post-infectious arthritis, Avascular necrosis, Osteochondral defect or Post-traumatic arthritis were excluded."

Exercise is a crucial component of many individuals' training programs and can play an essential role in improving health status and reducing several health hazards. It has been known that the benefits of high-volume exercise training are not limited to the physiological adaptations but can also improve physical performance and health status via modulation of the immune response. However, some have expressed the idea that there may be a ""point of diminishing returns"" at a certain exercise volume, and exercise above this point cannot improve performance. The immune response has been mentioned as this point and may depend on overreaching conditions that are believed to impair performance.
There is a vast amount of heterogeneity in both well-trained and untrained individuals' training volume. This heterogeneity is partly due to the lack of a structured approach on exercise volume, intensity, and frequency as well as the absence of a gold-standard recovery strategy after every bout of exercise. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the relationship between exercise training and recovery to improve physical performance and health status. The primary aim will be to determine the effect of different recovery strategies during 8 weeks of well-controlled, high-volume, large-scale, exercise training on the immune system, cardio-metabolic markers, and endocrine response. Secondary aims will include: (1) To determine the effect of different recovery strategies during 8 weeks of well-controlled, high-volume, large-scale, exercise training on body strength, aerobic capacity, and body composition.
We will recruit highly active and healthy participants from the Ministry of Defense to participate in an 8-week well-controlled, high-volume exercise training trial to investigate the influence of recovery strategy. Participants will be randomized into one of three groups: control (35 h/week), less exercise volume (25-45 h/week), and a longer rest group (35 h/week with longer rest between exercise sessions) for 8 weeks. Changes in health indices will be assessed by cardiometabolic, endocrine, and immune blood markers and body composition assessment at baseline (T0), after, 4 (T4), and 8 (T8) weeks of the intervention. Aerobic capacity, anaerobic threshold, and strength measurements will be used to determine changes in performance at T0, T4, and T8. We believe that we will be able to determine the relationship between exercise training and recovery and develop a sustainable training strategy that can further decrease the cardiovascular diseases, cancer incidence, and chronic low-grade inflammation's prevalence rate. Additionally, this study's results will aid individuals with medical problems, who often need to modify exercise volume or be more selective when implementing exercise in their daily practice, in designing more successful recovery protocols and improving the quality of life."

Osteoarthritis (OA) affects the knee joint on a large scale, where 80% of the joint surface wear is a result of the loss of the joint space. The joint space width (JSW) of the knee indicates the health of the cartilage and joint, and can be measured non-invasively on MRI scans. Weight-bearing MRI scans can give insight into joint space loss in the medial compartment of the knee in OA patients, as the medial compartment carries more weight than the lateral compartment. However, there is lack of evidence in regard to differences in medial and lateral JSW between different scan positions, including weight-bearing scans. Therefore, this trial will assess the differences in medial and lateral JSW in weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing scan positions in both the flexed and extended knee (in two randomized scan positions), in terms of the correlation with clinical variables."

Dysphagia is prevalent in almost all neurodegenerative conditions and results in the inability to effectively protect the lower airways from foreign (i.e., food/liquid) and endogenous (i.e., saliva) material [1-3]. An unfortunate consequence of dysphagia is aspiration pneumonia, which is a leading cause of death in Parkinson's disease (PD) [4-6]. Swallowing therapy has proven to be effective for the management of dysphagic symptoms in PD. Treatment is most often delivered in clinics once/week over short time periods with the expectation that exercises be completed at-home. However, these paradigms lack biofeedback to assess the accuracy and strength of the prescribed exercise and accountability to ensure completion of the exercise program. Without biofeedback or options for long-term therapeutic intervention at-home, patients often regress to baseline levels [7-9]. The proposed research project seeks to test the effectiveness of a novel at-home surface electromyography (sEMG) biofeedback therapy tool called Biofeedback in Strength and Skill Training (BiSSKit) on swallowing safety and efficiency in patients with PD. The significance of this project lies in the fact that dysphagia is expensive in terms of patient quality of life, health outcomes, and healthcare costs [10, 11] often increasing hospital costs by approximately 40% [12]. Thus, a targeted swallowing therapy system with biofeedback that can be utilized at-home may reduce hospitalizations secondary to dysphagia, help maintain therapeutic gains, and reduce the burden that dysphagia places on our healthcare system. sEMG is a therapy tool that has been used in rehabilitation practice for decades. Use of sEMG during swallowing therapy involves placement of electrodes under the chin (overlying the anterior belly of the digastric, mylohyoid and geniohyoid muscles) [13]. While the patient completes a swallowing task, electrodes detect collective muscle contractions associated with hyolaryngeal excursion - a biomechanical event critically important to airway safety and swallowing efficiency [14]. The patient can then see the waveform of the swallow displayed on a computer monitor. Measures of swallowing strength are derived from the amplitude of the waveform. sEMG provides external biofeedback regarding swallowing parameters by activating neural networks controlling both motor execution and imagery of the act of swallowing including the pre- and postcentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, basal ganglia, insula, and cerebellum [15]. Research has shown that exercise programs incorporating biofeedback promote significant physiologic change that is maintained over time in patients with dysphagia [14, 16-18]. Patients with PD benefit greatly from biofeedback exercises for respiratory muscle strength and lingual strengthening programs and have even been found to maintain the gains made in therapy with at-home programs [7, 16, 19]. A limitation of the currently available sEMG programs is that research studies have solely focus on the strength aspects of the swallowing (amplitude of the waveform) while failing to address the dynamic, skill-based parameters such as timing and volitional initiation that is captured in waveform morphology. Skill based swallowing training focuses on the precision of movements; and this is especially important for patients with PD [14]. Additionally, traditional sEMG systems in the US lack the ability for clinicians to modulate swallowing targets during tasks, which, according to principles of neuroplasticity, is essential for maximizing therapeutic results. The BiSSKit program is a well-researched office-based biofeedback system that adheres to principles of neuroplasticity and incorporates skill training in addition to strength training [14]. Developed in New Zealand and recently approved by the US FDA, this program has been converted into an affordable and accessible home-based application for tablet computers. This hybrid BiSSKiT system incorporates clinical visits and home-based skill/strength training and shows promise to change current therapy delivery models. Although exciting, there is a paucity of data regarding the use of the BiSSKiT with daily home therapy focused on strength and skill based swallowing training on changes to swallowing safety and efficiency in people with PD. This study seeks to evaluate the impact of this device on swallowing outcomes compared to traditional swallowing therapy models in PD."

The main focus of the study will be to estimate prevalence of HPV and incidence of persistent HPV in women, with a special focus on women in low socio-economic areas of South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 30,000 women in 8 different countries will be enrolled in this study and will complete a survey and provide a sample. Countries have been selected in order to represent regions with high, medium, or low cervical cancer incidence, countries with or without HPV screening and treatment programs, and countries that are in various stages of prophylactic HPV vaccine rollout. Urine sample and self-collected vaginal swabs (SCVS) will be collected for HPV testing, along with data on demographics, socioeconomic status, sexual and reproductive history, cervical screening, HPV vaccination, and potential risk factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer. In selected countries, the comparison between urine and SCVS will be done using 16/18 DNA positivity rates. For the purpose of the study, a positive urine test is determined to be when the participant is HPV DNA positive irrespective of the type specificity (i.e., irrespective of the specific HPV types being detectable) and if there is at least 3500-genome equivalents of 16/18 type in the sample; the definition of a positive vaginal swab test is based on the presence of HPV 16/18 type in the sample. After informed consent and a completed survey, a urine sample and/or an SCVS will be collected. Urine samples will be collected first, and if urine sample collection is unsuccessful, an alternative test will be done with the SCVS. The main focus of the study will be to estimate the prevalence of HPV among a representative sample of women ages 9-50 in 8 countries in low SES areas of the south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, and to evaluate the burden of HPV in a representative population sample of lower SES status, as well as in particular vulnerable sub-populations of girls and women depending on the country. For this purpose, up to 4 surveys with the same questions will be conducted, and urine sample and or SCVS will be collected from the same participant at least once in their lifetime. 108 of the 8 different countries will participate in one CSS and up to 5 CSS. Overall, approximately 15,000 women will be enrolled in the CSS. Additionally, women in five countries will also participate in Longitudinal studies (LS) in order to estimate the incidence of persistent HR HPV infection. 138 of the 8 different countries will participate in one LS and up to 5 LS. Approximately 15,120 women will be enrolled in the LS. LS participants will be followed up for 24 months and will be tested every 6 months for persistent high-risk HPV, with an SCVS being collected. In selected countries, urine samples will be collected at the first and all subsequent visits."

The use of cognitive functions such as memory is essential for the execution of daily activities and represents a crucial element for autonomy maintenance during aging. It is known that the physiological cognitive decline associated with aging also involves memory and can significantly impact the older person's independence. For these reasons, great interest has been generated by two tools that have proved to be decisive in supporting memory functions: non-invasive neurostimulation and memory training. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a form of noninvasive brain stimulation that modulates brain activity by employing a direct current delivered through electrodes applied to the scalp. Recently, the use of tDCS has been combined with training interventions focused on working memory in healthy older adults, providing evidence of a significant improvement in memory function when memory training is associated with the use of tDCS compared to when it is performed without it. In particular, adaptive memory trainings coupled with stimulation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex provide benefits that last also at follow-up visits after 1 or 3 months, especially in participants who exhibit a lower baseline performance. While it was observed that adaptive working memory training alone is unable to modulate brain plasticity mechanisms, it was hypothesized that tDCS can modulate brain plasticity by acting through long-term potentiation (LTP) mechanisms and that it can modulate brain neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a protein that plays a relevant role in LTP. Several adaptive memory trainings focused on working memory, which is essential for decision-making processes and daily activities. Even if promising results have been shown so far, it appears that no study addressed the implementation of strategic memory training coupled with the use of tDCS. Adaptive trainings allow improving the performance in each task by gradually increasing its difficulty, without however resorting to teaching a strategy. Strategic memory trainings permit not only to improve participants' performance in the practiced task but also to generalize the use of memory strategies to new tasks. Intending to prevent cognitive impairment, using these intervention methods in healthy aging and the prodromal phases can be useful. To this end, subjective cognitive decline (SCD) indeed represents an intermediate state between normal cognition and mild cognitive impairment (nMCD) and may predict the development of objective cognitive decline. In this frame, the primary goal of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to assess whether the application of transcranial direct current stimulation during strategic memory training (on-line neurostimulation) enhances the effect of strategic memory training. The follow-up visits allow for investigating whether eventual improvements are preserved over time and if this combined intervention affects the evolution of cognitive decline. The treatment protocol consists of 5 sessions (2/3 session/week, 1 hour/day) of strategic memory training combined with on-line tDCS (anodic tDCS, 2mA for 20 minutes, versus sham tDCS, applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex - DLPFC). Healthy old participants will be recruited from the general population. Participants with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) are recruited from Neuropsychology/Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Unit and Neurorehabilitation Unit of IRCCS Mondino Foundation. The diagnosis of SCD is formulated based on a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation (baseline cognitive assessment - T0) according to the guidelines presented in the literature. At T0, the following standardized tests are used: Global cognitive function is assessed using Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE); Cognitive reserve is assessed using Cognitive Reserve Index Questionnaire (CRIq); Mood is assessed using Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS). At T0, practiced and not practiced memory tasks (Bottiroli et al., 2013) will be administered to the participants as pre-tests: Associative learning; List learning; Name-face learning; Place learning; Text learning; Grocery learning; Participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria are enrolled and randomly assigned to the experimental group (strategic memory training + ACTIVE tDCS) or control group (strategic memory training + SHAM tDCS)."

Currently, there are no preventative strategies available to protect against the debilitating effects of the age-related decline in muscle mass and function, sarcopenia. This is a major challenge facing our aging populations. One of the main causes of sarcopenia is a decrease in testosterone (Test) with age that is also linked to a number of chronic health problems, as well as the onset of sarcopenia. However, Test replacement has been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, suggesting we need to identify other ways of protecting our muscles. Epigenetic modification of the genome has been proposed as a mechanism whereby the body can store, or remember, information that is essential for the correct functioning of cells and tissues. In particular, epigenetics has been proposed as a mechanism of storing information about hormones, such as Testosterone. Testosterone is a powerful hormone that is involved in muscle mass and function and has been shown to induce epigenetic modifications in mouse skeletal muscle. These epigenetic modifications include an increase in Histone H3 acetylation and a decrease in Histone H3 lysine-4 trimethylation, in conjunction with changes in gene expression.
Skeletal muscle is the largest organ in the body that can store this type of information. Research within our group has shown that resistance exercise (REX) training induces epigenetic modifications, including acetylation of histone H3 at genes that encode for myosin heavy chains, a process that has been linked to an increase in muscle mass and strength. The mechanisms linking exercise to epigenetic modifications are not fully understood, and we have not determined if REX training can ‘sustain’ the epigenetic modifications induced by exercise training. This project is a randomised, placebo-controlled, crossover trial that specifically targets the testosterone hypothesis. The study is a pilot trial focusing on 15 middle-aged men who will undergo the intervention either in isolation or whilst undertaking REX training. The primary aim of the study is to investigate whether the combined effects of Testosterone and REX training induces epigenetic modifications that are able to withstand periods of detraining. The combined effects of Testosterone and REX training will then be compared to the effects of REX training alone in the absence of the hormone. It is hypothesised that the combined effects of Testosterone and REX training will be able to induce epigenetic modification that persist beyond exercise training and that these changes will be enhanced by the combination treatment. If this occurs, muscle will have a 'memory' of the Testosterone-REX treatment and this may lead to development of long-term prevention strategies against sarcopenia."

Background: Dengue is a mosquito-borne tropical disease that is prevalent in many countries of Latin America. With the increase in travel and the development of urban spaces for human settlements, a dengue epidemic occurred in Argentina in the fall of 2018. The objective of this study is to determine the prevalence of immunity to flaviviridae in the metropolitan area of Buenos Aires prior to the outbreak.
Methods: This is a cross-sectional seroprevalence survey among a representative and random sample of 1,487 persons who reside in 104 sectors belonging to 19 municipalities of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan region. The study results will be an approximation of the seroprevalance of flaviviridae, divided by age and municipality, in the area of study before the outbreak. The sample will be randomly selected from 2010 census data. Primary sampling units are the census sections of the 2010 National Census of Population, Households and Dwellings (ECPOH 2010), which have been divided into strata based on income quintile. Enumerators will use a random selection of at least two residences within each primary sampling unit, and the members of the selected households will be surveyed for inclusion within the study population. Participants will be asked for demographic data and they will donate a blood sample taken by venipuncture to be analyzed in a laboratory certified by the National Administration of Drugs, Food and Tobacco (ANMAT). Sample calculation for the study assumes the presence of individuals with previous flavivirus infection in 30% of the population, varying according to the area of reference. The sample size was calculated based on the estimated probability of pre-infection for each of the municipalities and localities participating in the survey.
Immunoglobulin G anti-flavivirus IgG antibodies will be detected by direct ELISA using recombinant dengue virus proteins, and dengue-specific IgG antibodies will be identified by plaque neutralization with a pool of four dengue virus types. Dengue-specific immunoglobulin G antibodies measured by ELISA will be confirmed by dengue type-specific plaque neutralization assay and by a plaque assay on dengue virus of each serotype. Serotyping of neutralizing antibodies will be done with a plaque neutralization test. Plaques in the sample and control dishes will be counted and the sample: control ratio will be expressed in arbitrary units. Sensitivity and specificity of antibody detection to dengue will be previously analyzed in the laboratory. Serum neutralizing antibodies to other flavivirus were also assayed by plaque neutralization assay. Antibody titers will be expressed in International Units (IU), calculated as the reciprocal of the largest dilution that neutralized the virus in the plaque assay. This study will be conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, the ethical guidelines set forth by ANMAT and the guidelines of the American Society of Research through Human Subjects.
Discussion: This study will be the basis for defining public health policies for this disease, since after the sero-epidemiological data is published, the national and local authorities will have indicators to predict the risk of outbreaks in the country. It will also serve as an assessment tool to evaluate the effectiveness of national and city-based dengue control strategies, such as mass vector control interventions."

Ischaemic heart disease (IHD), the incidence of which continues to rise, represents one of the key factors determining future health expenditures and is expected to become the leading cause of death, despite a reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality in the past few decades mainly due to decreasing mortality from myocardial infarction (MI). In addition, due to their multifactorial nature, patients with IHD often are prescribed several medications that might interact and increase risk of bleeding.
The risk of adverse outcomes is greatly influenced by residual inflammation and platelet reactivity, an essential component of platelet function. Atherosclerosis (the hardening of arteries caused by plaque build-up) is considered to develop from thrombotic inflammatory atherosclerosis. The activation of platelets in the presence of activated endothelium, the key driver of atherosclerosis, triggers a positive feedback mechanism. As such, platelet activation and recruitment of inflammatory cells play an essential role in the progression of atherosclerosis and its complications.
Platelet reactivity is defined by the platelet’s ability to respond to specific stimuli leading to platelet aggregation and adhesion. While aspirin inhibits platelet reactivity by up to 80%, the introduction of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) (aspirin + clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) was developed to decrease platelet reactivity in patients with recent symptoms of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) and/or Coronary Stent (CS)/Prosthetic Heart Valve (PHV) implantation in subjects with increased bleeding risk. This approach has proven to be very effective for reduction of mortality and myocardial infarction (MI) rates in these conditions. However, long term DAPT is associated with an increased risk of major bleeding. Thus, the benefit of DAPT has to be weighed against the harm of increased bleeding risk. Although the benefit of the currently used P2Y12 inhibitor prasugrel and ticagrelor is significantly greater than that of clopidogrel, their use continues to be associated with an increased risk of bleeding. In clinical practice, the fear of bleeding and poor drug compliance might lead to undertreatment and reduced efficacy of DAPT.
In order to reduce major adverse clinical events (MACE) and bleeding events in high bleeding risk (HBR) patients, the de-escalation of P2Y12 inhibitors was proposed to decrease the bleeding risk, maintaining good efficacy and reducing mortality and MACE rates. A meta-analysis of different randomised controlled trials (RCTs) found that clopidogrel substitution to prasugrel or ticagrelor has no impact on major adverse cardiovascular/cerebrovascular events compared to standard dose therapy. Several international guidelines recommend to use full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors for at least 9 months after recent ACS, coronary stenting or coronary artery bypass grafting.
The DESC-HBR trial will explore (for the first time) patients at HBR, treated with full-dose potent P2Y12 inhibitors after recent ACS. Patients with HBR may be at excessively higher bleeding risk as suggested by the PRECISE-DAPT score validated on 62,314 patients, which may lead to high rates of discontinuation of DAPT. The DESC-HBR trial aims to assess in patients with HBR after a recent ACS the impact of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel 75mg, prasugrel 5mg or ticagrelor 60mg bid, on the proportion of patients with optimal platelet reactivity (OPR). The secondary objective is to explore the effect of de-escalating P2Y12 inhibitor therapy on clinical events and patients' quality of life. The primary outcome is defined as a platelet reactive unit (PRU) between 85 and 208 reactivity units based on international consensus. The secondary pharmacodynamic outcomes include platelet reactivity with the VerifyNow and T-TAS system at different timepoints (baseline, 2h after first dose, through levels before MD and peak levels after MD at 14±2 days). Further pharmacodynamic assessment at 1 and 2 weeks after P2Y12 inhibitor discontinuation will be performed in the"

Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) and other adverse infant outcomes are the result of maternal alcohol drinking and other substance use during pregnancy. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that lack or are under-resourced for maternal and child health, there is much at stake when it comes to children's welfare. While many countries in Africa have policies that ban drinking during pregnancy, this is not translated into practice. To address this, we will adap and test a behavioural intervention to improve maternal drinking and use of other substances (especially tobacco and marijuana) during pregnancy and breastfeeding, while improving care-seeking for substance use treatment interventions. By focusing on low-income South African women, and targeting alcohol use, tobacco use, and marijuana usages separately or in different combinations of use we will be able to understand the most effective strategy to reducing their use and preventing negative outcomes in their children.
Situated in the area with the highest number of births in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, key informant interviews conducted with expectant mothers and a review of the literature will inform the design of the intervention. A sample of women will be selected from existing clinical registries and antenatal services at the research area will be approached through a community-based sampling frame. The study will use a randomized design with two arms: an intervention arm, providing contingent incentives and text-based support, and usual care arm."

The study will be recruiting people who have had a limb amputation (traumatic or atraumatic) and are experiencing chronic phantom limb pain (PLP). Participants will be asked to be seated during the study session. Non-painful peripheral stimulation will be applied to elicit a brain response. Electrodes will be placed on the scalp to record these electrical brain responses during the study session. Visual feedback based on the response will be provided in pseudo realtime. The study will involve three 1-hour sessions per week for 8-9 weeks, followed by 2 follow-up sessions at 3 and 6 months after the last session. Assessments of pain intensity and quality, and neurophysiological sensorimotor response, will be performed before the first session, after the last session, and at follow-up sessions. Additional electroencephalography (EEG) based assessments will also be performed as exploratory measures, to assess inter- and intra- hemispheric functional connectivity and sensorimotor responses associated with amputation and operant conditioning training."

Trauma is the major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Invasive hemodynamic monitoring is commonly used to guide fluid resuscitation and resuscitate hemodynamic disturbances. Subclavian vein catheterization is generally considered as the ideal central vein catheterization route in trauma patients because high venous pressure may be associated with complications of peripheral vein catheterization. However, complications of subclavian vein catheterization like subclavian artery puncture, pneumothorax and hemothorax may not be easily detected with bedside X-ray, which makes the choice and placement of these catheters difficult.
Axillary vein catheterization is an alternative way for resuscitation in trauma patients because the diameter and volume of axillary vein are larger. Also the arteries and veins pass through a shorter distance. If the puncture is performed by ultrasound guidance, it is possible to reduce the incidence of complications.
There are no studies on the complications of axillary vein cannulation and hemodynamic monitoring in the intensive care unit in trauma patients recently. Whether ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization could reduce the complications during the resuscitation therapy in trauma patients still needs further study.
The investigators hypothesize that ultrasound-guided axillary vein catheterization for CVP or hemodynamic monitoring would reduce the incidence of complications in trauma patients during the resuscitation therapy.
In this study, the investigators sought to investigate the clinical effect of this method and its value in guiding the CVC catheter placement in trauma patients.
The investigators will retrospectively collect information on all axillary vein catheterizations from the intensive care unit of Beijing Youan Hospital, from October 2021 to April 2023. The parameters investigated include placement of the catheter tip, occurrence of complications during catheterization, thromboembolism events, death rate during TICU stay, ventilator support, length of TICU stay, ICU mortality and hospital mortality. Based on the collected data, the distribution of complications in axillary vein catheterization, the predictors of complications, the reasons for catheter tip errors, and the outcomes of patients with complications will be analyzed."

Background: Patients with multiple myeloma (MM) have a disease process that does not typically involve the blood and bone marrow. Treatment is initially geared toward killing cancer cells that grow and cause an increase in specific abnormal proteins in the blood. Over time, these cancer cells may continue to grow despite treatment. A type of therapy called BCMA (B cell Maturation Antigen)-directed Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells has been approved as a treatment for patients with MM whose disease is no longer responsive to traditional therapies. These CAR T cells seek out cells with a specific protein marker, BCMA, and eliminate them. This type of treatment has been shown to temporarily eliminate disease in about one third of patients with relapsed or refractory MM. Cevostamab is a monoclonal antibody that is designed to block interactions between a protein on immune cells, called CD32B, and the same cancer protein, BCMA, on MM cells. By preventing these interactions, it may help kill cancer cells and stop them from returning or progressing. Objective: To see how well cevostamab helps to eliminate MM cells in people who have received a specific type of CAR T cell therapy. Eligibility: Overall, people ≥18 years of age with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) who have previously received a BCMA-directed CAR T cell product are eligible for this study. Design: People who meet the inclusion criteria will be given cevostamab, which will be given once every 3 weeks, with the first day of each treatment cycle being Day 1. People will receive 8 total doses of cevostamab during this study, unless they have achieved a complete response without detectable minimal residual disease (CR+MRD-) at 12 months post-CAR T cell therapy. Some people will also have a bone marrow biopsy before treatment with cevostamab to assess their disease status. People who achieved a complete response without detectable minimal residual disease (CR+MRD-) at 12 months post-CAR T cell therapy will undergo repeat bone marrow testing or imaging studies (MRI or CT scans) every 6-12 months to monitor their response to treatment and assess time to progression. People who did not achieve a complete response without detectable minimal residual disease but remain in remission for ≥1 year post-CAR T cell infusion, will be followed annually by imaging studies to monitor their response to treatment. Follow-Up: The first follow-up visit after completing the treatment regimen will be approximately 2 weeks after the last drug infusion. After that, visits will take place up to 2 years after enrollment to assess the effectiveness of the drug. During follow-up, visits will be conducted to evaluate the patient's health and check for signs of recurrence or progression. The longest patient visit will be 3 days. A bone marrow biopsy will be requested at the week 12 visit after completing ≥6 cycles of cevostamab. If a patient is in stable CR+MRD- or CR+MRD-, the following follow-up tests will be conducted every 6-12 months until progression: Blood-based tests to assess MRD status. Bone marrow biopsy for complete remission response evaluation. CT or MRI imaging studies to assess response to treatment. Additional tests may be conducted for patients who are in remission without achieving a MRD-negative status. Blood samples will also be collected at the end of each treatment cycle to monitor the immune response and the safety of cevostamab treatment before discontinuation of cevostamab."

The obesity epidemic remains a major public health problem worldwide The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing alarmingly, especially in industrialized countries, according to WHO reports; overnutrition, overfeeding and a lack of physical activity is causing a rapid increase of obesity and an increase risk of noncommunicable diseases.
This study aimed to investigate the effect of the combination of cavitation ultrasonic lipolysis and repetition ultrasound-guided imaging (RUSI) on core muscles function. Thirty six subjects divided into three groups; 12 subjects in the cavitation group , 12 subjects in the repetition ultrasound guided imaging (RUSI) . Both Cavitation group and RUSI group had 10 consecutive sessions twice a week for 5 weeks. And combination of cavitation and RUSI group .
In order to understand the relationship between visceral fat accumulation and core muscle functions , 16 patients divided randomly into 2 groups , cavitation group , RUSI group. All patients had abdominal ultrasound in the supine position, and had RUSI to visualize diaphragm muscle on the screen, and the patient was instructed to have 5 seconds to contract the diaphragm muscle by deep breathing and hold the contraction, and to visualize transverse abdominis muscle after a slow cough test and to have 10 seconds contraction. All these procedures were performed under the guidance of an experienced ultrasonography medical professional. After 10 repetitions, image measurement was performed to determine the increase in muscle thickness during contraction compared to the baseline. Then cavitation and RUSI were given respectively
By ultrasound imaging , it was determined that the effect of the combined application of cavitation and RUSI on core muscles was more significant than the single application , and the mean diaphragm excursion was 120% in the cavitation group and 130% in the RUSI group and 145% in the combination group.
According to this result , it is thought that the combined application of cavitation and RUSI can be evaluated as a new method for increasing core muscle functions."

Objectives: Hypothesis 1: In patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke, there is a linear relationship between the atrial fibrosis surface area determined by Cardiac MRI with contrast and the occurrence of atrial fibrillation (AF) during the 3-year follow-up period. Hypothesis 2: A threshold value of the atrial fibrosis surface area determined by Cardiac MRI with contrast could help to predict the occurrence of AF within 3 years in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke. The AF burden (duration and number of episodes) will be determined by the implantable loop recorder. To reach this objective, the protocol of the study includes a group of patients with clinical suspicion of atrial fibrillation not previously diagnosed (suspect group), another group of patients without clinical suspicion of atrial fibrillation previously diagnosed (control group), and a third group of patients with clinical suspect of atrial fibrillation, previously diagnosed (control group), and a third group of patients with clinical suspect of atrial fibrillation previously diagnosed (control group). Each group will have 40 patients. Patients with clinical suspicion of atrial fibrillation of cryptogenic ischemic stroke, previously diagnosed by a permanent electronic loop recorder will be proposed to participate to the cryptogenic group. Patients with previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation will be randomly assigned to the control group. Procedure: Patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke will undergo Cardiac MRI with contrast to determine the atrial fibrosis surface area. During this examination, blood samples will be taken in order to characterize parameters of renal function and other biomarkers predicting atrial fibrosis (MicroRNAs, C-reactive protein). The blood sample and the Cardiac MRI dataset will be stored for future biological analyzes. An implantable electronic loop recorder will be implanted within one week of the stroke and patients will be given anti-coagulation treatment according to international guidelines for long-term anticoagulation. Patients presenting AF episodes during the 3-year follow-up will be followed and if clinically relevant, will require a heart rhythm correction procedure and appropriate anticoagulation treatment. Patients without AF or with unobserved AF episodes during the 3-year follow-up will also be followed but no heart rhythm correction procedure will be proposed. Study population: The target population is patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke, cryptogenic stroke is defined as neurologic symptoms with radiographic evidence of stroke that do not conform to one of the standard classifications (atherosclerotic or cardioembolic). Patients are referred to implantation of an implantable electronic loop recorder for diagnostic purposes. Patients with clinical suspicion of AF and cryptogenic ischemic stroke will be proposed to enroll to this study. The hypothesis to evaluate is whether a given atrial fibrosis surface area threshold defined by Cardiac MRI with contrast will lead to occurrence of AF, after 3 years of follow-up, independent of the patient characteristics. Sample size : for each group of patients, a sample of 40 patients will be enrolled. Patients who will provide informed consent will benefit from Cardiac MRI with contrast and will enroll into the suspect group (30 patients) or control group (10 patients). An Implantable electronic loop recorder will be implanted within one week of the stroke and patients will be given anti-coagulation treatment according to international guidelines for long-term anticoagulation. Stroke patients with atrial fibrillation of cryptogenic origin will be invited to enlarge the cryptogenic group to 40 patients. Patients with previously diagnosed atrial fibrillation will be randomly assigned to the control group."

The RecuR Score is a novel risk score developed at the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS), that estimates the probability of 30-day unplanned hospital readmission for inpatients and patients in the Emergency Department (ED) at various UMMS hospitals. It is derived using claims data, laboratory data, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, and sociodemographic information, but excludes race or insurance type from the calculation. The score is calculated in Epic, and the target population includes any inpatients, currently in-house ED patients who may become inpatients, and previous inpatients within the previous 30 days of discharge. Higher RecuR Scores indicate a higher probability of unplanned hospital readmission based on RecuR Score of the patient. A comparison of the performance of the RecuR Score, using a dataset that contains a mixture of Epic and Claims data, compared to two existing risk scores, LACE and HOSPITAL, showed that the RecuR Score was the most accurate at 48 hours post-arrival. It is known to work best during and immediately after the index admission for which the RecuR Score is calculated. The study objective is to identify patients at a higher risk of unplanned hospital readmission and then apply enhanced peri- and post-discharge care interventions to assess the impact on readmissions at UM CRMC. The interventions being tested include, use of a handheld digital device (iPad) or a physical patient education manual in lieu of a printed handout to educate patients about their medical conditions and medications, and a focus on the patient's RecuR Score during multidisciplinary team rounds. The study will also evaluate potential interventions offered through the Hospital's Readmission Prevention Program, such as home health visitation from Home Health Services (HHS), Mobile Integrated Healthcare (MIH), or Resources, Education and Access to Community Health (REACH).
Hospital readmission is a quality measure that measures the proportion of patients discharged from the hospital that is readmitted either to any hospital or the index hospital. Healthcare providers are financially penalized for repeat hospital admissions for the same episode of care, also known as episodes of hospitalization, within 30 days. Healthcare providers are notified of their year-over-year readmission rates for different diagnoses and conditions via an online dashboard called the Readmission Reduction Program (RRP) Dashboard. The Hospital at UM CRMC has one of the longest running transitional care programs in Maryland, called the Transitional Nurse Navigator (TNN) program, that provides assistance with medication reconciliation, home health education, scheduling of follow-up appointments, and community resource training on an individual patient basis. The TNN program has been relatively successful in lowering the hospital's 30-day unplanned hospital readmission rate. Despite the reduction in readmissions, the Hospital's overall readmission rate at UM CRMC and its associated financial penalties continue to decrease incrementally, from 1.5% in 2010 to 1.0% in 2016. Therefore, the Hospital has developed the Readmission Prevention Program (RPP) using a quality improvement (QI) framework that focuses on prevention of unplanned hospital readmissions. The goal is to implement the most effective interventions to provide patient-centered care that supports patients and their families in understanding their diagnosis, medications, and medical treatment, to make sure that patients receive appropriate care at the correct location, and to help reduce the burden of unplanned hospital readmissions.
If the Hospital is implementing an intervention, such as using nurse navigators, to support a patient population at higher risk of readmissions, it is important to compare the outcomes of patients who already receive this intervention (current approach) to those who receive additional resources. This study will look for an additional 30% reduction of 30-day unplanned hospital readmissions in the treatment group. There will be two study arms. The first arm will be the Standard of Care arm which will represent the status quo at the Hospital. The second arm will be the Enhanced Care arm where nurse navigators will receive additional training and education, and patients will receive expanded education and follow-up visits, and care coordinated through additional community resources such as, home health visitation from Home Health Services (HHS), Mobile Integrating Healthcare (MIH), or Resources, Education and Access to Community Health (REACH) to potentially lower the rate of readmissions in this high-risk patient population. All enrolled participants will receive the standard of care, regardless of study arm."

Worldwide more than approximately 500 million people suffer from AR (30% of the Dutch population) and its prevalence is expanding. Nasal congestion (i.e. reversible mucosal congestion/nasal mucosal obstruction) is one of the most general and bothersome symptoms in rhinitis and is associated with other medical conditions such as rhinosinusitis and otitis media.
This study is relevant as in addition to the high global occurrence of AR, this disorder has substantial effects on the quality of life (QOL) (e.g. during sleep and work). AR is related to high direct medical costs (mainly prescription of medications and outpatient visits) and indirect economic costs (including productivity decrease). Current medications are undesirable due to their side-effects (such as sedation in the case of intranasal antihistamines (INAH)). Acupuncture for AR in general can be considered as safe and can be seen as a potential remedial blueprint for nasal congestion. Evidence supported that acupuncture is clinically used for signs and symptoms of nose disorders, such as nasal congestion, with effectiveness, but whether acupuncture has immediate, post-treatment and long-term effects on specifically nasal congestion in AR is not verified by strictly designed clinical study. The ANCAR trial aims to evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin®). A standard treatment protocol with a fixed set of acupuncture points has been established - to be as scientific as possible from Western medical viewpoint - and this selection of acupuncture points can be seen as a solid and profound approach from which every AR patient may benefit. This standard set opens the nose and affects the underlying energetic imbalance and immunity at the same time to maintain its nose opening effect (i.e. to prevent recurrence of the complaint). The acupuncture protocol concerns 8 treatments during 6 weeks (i.e. 2 treatments per week during the first 2 weeks and 1 treatment per week in the consecutive 4 weeks). The positive effects of this treatment protocol (such as improvement QOL) may result in more confidence in the direct, post-treatment and long-term effects of acupuncture and lead to more acceptance of acupuncture as a solid treatment option for nasal congestion in AR instead of using an INAH spray. Hypothesis: Acupuncture will improve nasal congestion in AR compare to azelastine nasal spray (Carelastin®). Objective: To evaluate the effects of an acupuncture treatment protocol for nasal congestion in AR."

Interest in the effects of cold exposure on the brain has developed dramatically in recent years. One of the most promising results reported since the mid-1990s is that mild cold exposure can improve mood. Although mood improvements have proven difficult to replicate, they have nonetheless been observed in a number of laboratory trials, as well as in two large scale field studies. In the present proposal, we would use neuroimaging (functional MRI) to investigate the neural underpinnings of these improvements, and to assess how these improvements compare to the improvements that typically follow exercise-based treatments for depression. Our central hypothesis is that cold exposure will lead to measurable improvements in mood, with these improvements being linked with activation in the basolateral amygdala, an area strongly implicated in processing emotional stimuli such as those associated with negative affect. We further hypothesize that the extent of the cold effect on mood will depend on the extent of activation in the basolateral amygdala. This proposal will represent the first direct investigation of the relationship between changes in body temperature and the neural underpinnings of mood, with potentially important implications for basic understanding of mechanisms linking the body with the brain, as well as potential clinical applications in the context of novel therapies for depression, anorexia nervosa, and other eating disorders.
Participants to be studied include 30 men and women with subthreshold symptoms of depression and anxiety, randomly drawn from undergraduates enrolled in introductory psychology courses at University at Buffalo, State University of New York at Buffalo.
The following study procedures will be utilized: Subjects will participate in six sessions to be conducted during a two-week interval. In session #1, subjects will complete online questionnaires assessing depression symptoms, general anxiety, physical health and physical complaints of depression symptoms, as well as complete medical and drug history questionnaires. In session #2, we will administer the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, Axis I Disorders to confirm our subjects have no present diagnosis of major depression, and perform a cardiovascular fitness exercise tolerance test, a urine drug screen, and saliva collection for genetic studies. In session #3, we will collect fMRI measures while subjects passively view a series of images eliciting distress and pain. In session #4, we will assess the impact of moderate cold exposure on mood and functional magnetic resonance imaging neural activity. In session #5, we will assess the impact of an acute increase in body temperature on mood and neural activity. In session #6, we will have a follow-up interview to clarify mood ratings assessed at home following sessions #4 and #5."

This is a retrospective study of a total of 990 cycles of insemination and IVF in women 18 to 42 years of age without any indication of polycystic ovaries or chronic abnormal ovarian function.
The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the starting dose for Follitropin Delta in a mixed protocol, including both hCG and HP-hMG, in the evaluation of the IVF cycle from the perspective of the number of oocytes, fertilization rate, embryonic development, blastocyst formation, and implantation.
This retrospective study consisted of three sub studies.
Study 1: Follitropin Delta plus HP-hMG: 809 cycles of insemination and 181 cycles of IVF.
Study 2: Follitropin Delta plus hCG: 62 cycles of insemination and 56 cycles of IVF.
Study 3: Follitropin Delta and hCG: 182 cycles of insemination.
For all cycles where only one protocol is used, a maximum of 3 cycles with the same protocol is authorized to be selected, according to the number of cycles from which there is more than 8 weeks of data available, based on the criteria established by the CIOMS (WHO / ICMJE) scale. In the case of cycles of a different procedure, the data from a maximum of 2 cycles of the same protocol will be analyzed, but each patient may only be present in the database with a maximum of 8 weeks of follow-up (for the number of oocytes and good quality blastocysts).
In Study 1 an hCG-based dose was used for Follitropin Delta (starting dose), with the dosages being increased to cover for the individual inter-individual difference in sensitivity. Serum LH will be monitored and, at the discretion of the doctor, hCG will be added. In Study 2 a combination of Follitropin Delta and hCG at different doses to cover the individual inter-individual difference in sensitivity. Serum LH will be monitored and, at the discretion of the doctor, HP-hMG will be added. In Study 3 HP-hMG will be used for ovarian stimulation and serum LH will be monitored to evaluate the effectiveness of Follitropin Delta at different fixed doses according to AMH values and body weight, ranging from 150 IU to 300 IU, with 50 IU increments.
The effectiveness of the starting dose is measured by the number of good quality blastocysts.
The main hypothesis is that there is no difference between these protocols in terms of the number of good quality blastocysts, since the effectiveness of the dose used for ovarian stimulation did not differ from the hCG-HP-hMG dose used as a control."

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic disorders characterized by alternating periods of remission and exacerbation, with periods of clinical relapse occurring frequently. IBD patients often need to attend several visits to their local hospital. Additionally, the symptoms of the disease cause substantial disturbances in the quality of life. The symptoms of IBD are characterized by pain, diarrhea, bloating, and fatigue. These symptoms cause substantial emotional distress and negatively impact patients' ability to work, socialize and carry out daily activities.
The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a telemonitoring intervention in patients with IBD on the quality of life, remission rates, number of adverse drug reactions, health-related expenditures, and the frequency of outpatient visits, hospitalizations and surgical interventions.
The outcome will be compared between patients with IBD who were monitored through a newly developed telemedical platform and patients with IBD who were monitored using standard face-to-face interventions. Based on the results of the research, the authors intend to create a universal software product with an online interface for a web platform, which can be integrated into the information systems of medical institutions and will allow monitoring the dynamics of IBD and support decision-making on the further treatment of patients with IBD."

A total of 432 participants will be randomised into this multicenter international randomised trial. After progression of their disease on first-line SSA treatment, patients with locally advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine tumours (NET) will continue (on or off SSA treatment, according to local policy) or alternatively discontinue their SSA treatment for a duration of 18 months. For pragmatic reasons, treatment decisions will be based solely on the local clinician's decision. The participants will then be crossed to a central imaging review committee, blinded for allocated regimen, to estimate objective responses according to RECIST criteria. The secondary objective is to demonstrate non-inferiority in objective tumour response in the subgroup of patients continuing SSA treatment.
An important secondary objective is the evaluation of costs (for health care providers) and quality of life.
This trial will provide evidence for future policy on the appropriate management of patients with progressive G1/Gr2 non-functional neuroendocrine tumors upon discontinuation of SSA treatment. The design of this trial is pragmatic to reflect future clinical practice and enhance generalisability of the results, and is also of importance in case a treatment beyond the standard option is being considered for patients. We will be able to explore the economic impact of extending or stopping SSA treatment after progression."

The investigators propose that improving socialization experiences in the preschool classroom for children with language delay through a peer mediated intervention will disrupt the social exclusion of targeted children, leading to improved growth patterns for the core language delays of 3-5 year olds at risk for further language and literacy delays in elementary school. Specifically, this randomized controlled trial (RCT) focuses on 25 preschool classrooms, with 12 classrooms randomized to the experimental group and 13 classrooms randomized to a control group. Children identified as most excluded from the classroom social network through social network matrices are selected as focal children, and the peer-mediated intervention is implemented by a classroom facilitator-a teacher or teaching assistant who works in the classroom daily. Focal children in the experimental group receive peer-mediated pivotal response training from the teacher who is randomized to this assignment, and focal children in the control group continue as usual. The goal is to recruit 65 children from 25 childcare centers, inclusive preschools, or pre-kindergarten classrooms within one geographical area. Research staff observe each focal child in the classroom setting for a 9-month period, including 4 play interactions observations and 4 peer interaction observations per focal child. Researchers will also record auditory and linguistic communication with an audio detector or device. This audio data will be transcribed, and the amount of incoming talk will be calculated for each focal child. The primary outcome variables will be: (a) changes in auditory comprehension and expressive language skills, as measured by the Preschool Language Screener 5; (b) changes in pragmatic language skills, as measured by the Developmental Pragmatic Profile; (c) changes in teacher perceptions of social/behavioral competencies, as measured by the Teacher Checklist Rating Scales; and (d) changes in focal children's social/behavioral competencies, as measured by the Peer Assessment Scale. Results from this study have the potential to accelerate social and linguistic growth in children with language delay, as well as inform school-based prevention programs, including strategies for implementing peer-mediated interventions and training protocols."

There is strong evidence that physical therapy can improve mobility-related function in people with MS, and emerging evidence that motor-relearning approaches to rehabilitation may be associated with changes in brain structure and function that correlate with improvements in functional performance. The leading pharmacological intervention for walking-related deficits in people with MS is dalfampridine. Dalfampridine improves motor function by increasing nerve conduction through demyelinated axons, however, dalfampridine alone is not likely to generate neuroplastic changes needed for lasting benefits, because neural plasticity requires salient and task-specific practice with high repetition at adequate intensity, as well as complex environments that stimulate opportunities for movement to facilitate synthesis of neurotrophic factors. Indeed, the treatment effects of dalfampridine are reversed as soon as the treatment was discontinued. However, it is possible that improved nerve conduction velocity provided by dalfampridine may accelerate neuroplasticity generated from rehabilitation. Yet, combining dalfampridine with concurrent rehabilitation has never been studied. The objective of this study is to test our central hypothesis that providing a motor-relearning physical therapy intervention in combination with dalfampridine will produce superior gains to either intervention alone in mobility through augmented neuroplasticity."

Background: CLEFT-Q (CLEFT-specific quality of life) is a questionnaire for patients with cleft lip and palate. Cleft-Q was designed and tested by Swedish researchers. Researchers wanted to know how CLEFT-Q works if patients with cleft lip and palate answer the questionnaire twice (test-retest) or if it works well before and after surgery.
Investigators wanted to study how CLEFT-Q works with patients who have had secondary surgery to improve speech and also with patients who has surgery on the lip, jaw, nose or to change the opening between mouth and nose.
Researchers also wanted to explore how the questionnaire is perceived by professionals who work with patients who have had cleft lip and palate surgery.
What is the condition being studied? How is the study designed?
-----------------
Fifty patients will be enrolled in a study that is about having CLEFT-Q answered twice (test-retest) and 17-20 patients will be enrolled in each of the other surgery groups. Sixty-five patients will be enrolled in a study that is about answering CLEFT-Q before and after secondary speech improving surgery. Health care professionals will also be interviewed and 20 will be interviewed. In total 200 patients are enrolled in this study.
All participants in the study fill in CLEFT-Q and photographs are done at the 1st clinic visit. For the patients in the study about answering CLEFT-Q twice this will be done 1-2 weeks after the first CLEFT-Q has been answered. The patients who are part of the test-retest group or groups answering CLEFT-Q before and after secondary surgery will also answer the questionnaire again, some will fill it in one time and others will fill it in at 10 week time intervals. The patients who are part of the test-retest group also will answer CLEFT-Q again 2 times (test-retest) and 3 months after the surgery. For the group answering CLEFT-Q before and after secondary speech improving surgery the questionnaire is answered again at 6 and 12 months follow-up appointments. Health care professionals will be interviewed before the first clinic visit.
What are the possible benefits and risks of participating in the study?
-----------------
The benefits of this study for the patients is that they will be better understood, and that the health care personnel involved in the development of CLEFT-Q is given the chance to affect this instrument."

Cerebrovascular autoregulation is an important protective mechanism that maintains a constant and adequate blood supply to the brain, and an equally important cerebral reserve capacity, able to rapidly increase brain blood flow in the event of a sudden fall in blood pressure. Several conditions common during general anesthesia (general hypoventilation or hypotension) increase the risk of impaired cerebrovascular autoregulation and thus may cause organ dysfunction and complications during surgery. The main objective of this study is to better characterize this protective mechanism by identifying patients at risk of a reduced perfusion reserve and predict the risk of complications by assessing the sensitivity of the monitoring used during general anesthesia for surgery. In addition, new non-invasive monitoring methods that are easy to use and offer great potential by providing complementary information to the clinician about the patient's physiological state will be implemented. The use of these monitoring tools during surgery will also make it possible to predict the risk of complications in cardiovascular patients, the elderly and pregnant women."

Introduction: Small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine tumor with a median survival of < 1 year due to metastatic potential and the rapid development of chemoresistance. At present, the chemotherapy regimen of platinum plus etoposide ± thoracic radiotherapy has been considered as the standard treatment, however, the response rate and prognosis of this treatment regimen are not ideal. With the advent of immunotherapy, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy has become a new treatment regimen for SCLC. Currently, immunotherapy is also used as the first-line treatment strategy for extensive small cell lung cancer .
Serplulimab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against PD-L1. Studies have shown that serplulimab combined with chemotherapy has a higher objective response rate and a longer time to progression (TTP) compared with chemotherapy alone . However, due to the heterogeneity (subtype) of SCLC, it is important to assess the clinical response and the impact of immunotherapy on tumor progression and the immune microenvironment in SCLC patients undergoing first-line immunotherapy. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) is defined as a small number of intact individual tumor cells/nests, which cannot be detected by conventional imaging criteria during remission, but can be detected by laboratory methods. MRD can predict the response of tumors to treatment and can be used as early indicators of disease control and treatment efficacy . 
This prospective single arm cohort study will include adult subjects aged ≥ 18 years with newly diagnosed and previously untreated subjects diagnosed with extensive small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). All subjects in the study will receive serplulimab combined with etoposide plus cisplatin or carboplatin as first-line treatment. To comprehensively evaluate the clinical benefits of PD-L1 immunotherapy against SCLC, circulating MRD testing will be performed before treatment, after 2 cycles of treatment, after 6 cycles of treatment, 6 months after the end of chemotherapy, and 1 year after the end of chemotherapy. The long-term efficacy and safety of PD-L1 inhibitor combined with traditional chemotherapy can be comprehensively revealed, and the MRD test can reflect the depth of remission, evaluate the control efficacy and treatment efficiency."

The lack of regular heart-healthy physical activity is an important risk factor associated with impaired cardiac rehabilitation outcomes, including recurrence of cardiac events. While cardiac rehabilitation programs are effective at promoting activity, this behavior change is largely lost to follow and after discharge from cardiac rehabilitation. The present project ACTIVE-CaRe intends to design, implement, and evaluation of a digital intervention for supporting regular heart-healthy physical activity of cardiac rehabilitation patients following completion of the intervention. The design and development of a digital application called aktivplan are based on the ACTIVE principles, integrating principles from behavioral sciences (e.g., self-efficacy, self-regulation, motivation, and user experience)."

This study will test whether nasal oxytocin improves social behavior and reduces repetitive behavior in youth with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). 22 male or female youths with ASD will receive either 24 international units of oxytocin (Ox) or a placebo (placebo) twice daily for four weeks in a double-blind, randomized, cross-over design. The dose and dosing regimen are based on our previous trial which showed a beneficial effect of the same dose on behavioral inflexibility, social behavior, repetitive behavior and repetitive cognition in male adults with ASD and an effect of a similar dose range on behavior in ASD compared to controls. We will evaluate both primary (social behavior and repetitive behavior) and secondary (behavioral inflexibility, social cognition, vagally-mediated cardiac autonomic function) outcomes using questionnaires, behavioral tasks and ECG."

Background:
Neonatal complications are of paramount importance, especially for those born before 37 weeks (preterm neonates), whose number is increasing in recent years in our country. As a consequence of their prematurity these neonates are at risk of many pathologies, mainly digestive problems (gastric reflux or malabsorption), that will lead them to abdominal complications. The intensive care unit of Clermont-Ferrand University hospital proposes the evaluation of newborns in order to optimize clinical decision-making.
Objectives:
To create a clinical evaluation scale of the premature baby's abdominal condition (ECAP) by a multidisciplinary neonatal committee (physician, physiotherapist and nurse). To validate the ECAP scale and to evaluate its use in clinical practice, in order to propose, if necessary massages whose interest has been demonstrated.
Methods:
It's an observational study with longitudinal follow-up regarding validation of the ECAP scale.
Inclusion: 70 Premature babies (≤37 weeks of amenorrhea) hospitalized in neonatal intensive care units and born in Clermont - Ferrand University hospital will be included and evaluated during 21 days.
The ECAP assessment consists in: 
1st evaluation: the evaluation will be performed between the 3rd day of life and the 21st day by the nurse of the neonatal ward. The aim is to record, in a standardized way, abdominal findings (abdomen, periumbilical and anal areas) encountered for this premature infant
2nd evaluation: on the 20nd day, it is necessary to perform an evaluation of the abdominal massage. The investigators aim to make this evaluation in a standardized manner and to check that the abdominal massage allows an improvement and/or resolution of abdominal pathology encountered in the first evaluation
3rd evaluation: the abdominal massage is also evaluated. The investigators aim to make this evaluation in a standardized manner and to check that the abdominal massage allows an improvement and / or resolution of abdominal pathology encountered in the first evaluation.
Evaluation of the first evaluation: the aim is to validate the ECAP scale developed by the panel of experts proposed in the ECAP standardization protocol (for prematurity) in France and Belgium. This evaluation corresponds to an evaluation on all parameters described in the ECAP standardization protocol (for prematurity) in infants born under 37 weeks of amenorrhea.
Evaluation of the second and third evaluations: it corresponds to a comparison between the preterm infant's abdominal condition at the first evaluation by the ECAP scale (ECAP score ) and at the last evaluation (ECAP+/- massage score ) by the ECAP scale in preterms with the abdominal massage and without the abdominal massage for the comparison group (the abdominal massage is indicated based on the score of Clinical Abdominal assessment scale for Premature infants, at the first evaluation by the ECAP scale).
The investigators aim to do an evaluation in which the ECAP score and its evolution during the time will be the same whatever the abdominal massage or its absence. The aim is to improve the care of preterms by proposing only the medical indication of an abdominal massage if necessary.
Assessor:
1. First assessor: the physician, nurse or physiotherapy assistant who performs the evaluation of the ECAP scale. 
2. Second assessor: the other member of the nursing team who will do the same evaluation. 
3. Third assessor: the other member of the nursing team who will do the same evaluation.

Study Overview
=================
The prevalence of persistent pain (PP) continues to rise in the United States, making it the most frequent reason for physician visits and the leading cause of disability, which is the biggest barrier to participation in clinical trials and care for other illnesses. PP is highly prevalent among minority patients, women, people with obesity, and those with a low socio-economic status. These disparities in PP are due to a variety of factors including lack of access to care and inequalities in pain treatment. The lack of access and treatment for PP creates an unmet need in the United States that needs to be addressed through innovative and cost-effective pain treatment approaches. Pain self-management is essential in managing the burden of PP, but access to it is disproportionately low among marginalized communities. Furthermore, research supports that providing education and skills training in self-management can increase participants' ability to improve their pain and function. Addressing these disparities in pain care requires nurses to lead the way in advocacy, education and access for marginalized communities. Nurses are at the forefront of health care delivery and are in a unique position to deliver pain management programs to patients within primary care practices and community settings. However, few programs have been tested whether nurses can deliver pain management programs. These barriers and disparities need to be addressed to reduce the burden of pain in patients at risk for unmet pain needs. The goal of the study is to test a cost-effective and scalable approach to providing education and skills training that can reduce pain and improve function in patients with persistent pain. This pilot study will conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare a scalable nurse-led pain education and skill training program with usual care for participants presenting with PP in primary care and community nursing settings. It will be tested in an underserved adult population in which there are disparities in access to pain care.

The long-term goal of our research is to improve pain communication. Our study focuses on patients with chronic pain, the health care nurses assessing their pain, and patient-reported health indicators. We will address two objectives in this study: objective 1) compare pain intensity rating scales in terms of their perceived mental effort, and objective 2) compare patient- and nurse-reported perceptions of the mental effort required to understand or describe a variety of ratings based on pain in a muscle.

Objective 1: This objective addresses our first aim, which is to compare the mental effort of choosing and understanding different pain intensity rating scales. The scale type can be categorized as worst pain you have ever felt versus worst pain you can think of; using a scale over a shorter time frame versus a longer time period, and assessing pain across multiple body areas versus concentrating on one area. Aim 1a: Compare the mental effort perceived by choosing pain intensity ratings using the worst pain you have ever felt versus the worst pain you can think of scales, using a 1-month versus 7-day recall period, and assessing pain in one body area versus across multiple body areas. Aim 1b: Compare the mental effort perceived by understanding pain intensity ratings using the worst pain you have ever felt versus the worst pain you can think of scales, using a 1-month versus 7-day recall period, and assessing pain in one body area versus across multiple body areas. The study aims to compare pain intensity scales on the amount of mental energy required for each type of scale on these characteristics."

Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a treatment method for patients with hematological malignancy. The most important outcome indicators of the treatment are the hematopoietic recovery speed after transplantation and the incidence of severe adverse reactions.
There are many factors that can affect hematological recovery and adverse events after transplantation. Previous studies have shown that the speed of hematopoietic recovery after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is affected by a variety of factors. At present, the main clinical treatment method for accelerating blood recovery after transplantation is immunosuppressive chemotherapy therapy (PFG). In recent years, research on the role of exogenous stem cells in improving hematopoietic recovery after transplantation has made significant progress. 
The investigators believe that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have immunosuppressive properties and can promote early hematopoietic recovery in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation, and can inhibit or alleviate the occurrence of complications of a variety of organ damage. In this study, the investigators try to clarify the mechanism of MSCs immunomodulation in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and explore the role of MSCs in the treatment of poor graft function after transplantation. This will provide a theoretical basis for the role and function of MSCs in regulating allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation."

The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Quit Genius-Alcohol application for Alcohol Use Disorder. Participants will be randomized into two groups. Participants assigned to the experimental group will receive monthly appointments with a medical provider who, upon evaluation of each participant for appropriateness for pharmacotherapy, will order the prescription of oral naltrexone with the option to refill up to 90 days after the initial prescription. The mobile application will provide participants with CBT-based support. Participants assigned to the active comparator (control) group will receive the same medical management but no adjunctive digital support. The study will utilize a longitudinal design with follow-up assessments at 15 days, 3 months, and 12 months."

The disease burden and patient pain associated with pancreatic cancer has risen to a level that is now the sixth leading cause of cancer death in the United States with a dismal 5-year survival of 5%. For most patients, metastatic pancreatic cancer is diagnosed too late in the disease course to resect; therefore, chemotherapy is the mainstay of therapy. The current standard of care is a combination of three chemotherapy agents (gemcitabine + nab-paclitaxel + 5-Fluorouracil). Even with a response rate of more than 55 %, the median overall survival remains just 4.9 months, with 50 % of patients alive at 1 year compared with 15 % at 2 years. As patients progress through and beyond first-line therapy, there is no known way to stop relapse of the cancer or to halt it from progressing.
Investigators propose to test the combination of botensilimab (CTLA-4, an Fc-engineered anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody), balstilimab (PD-1, a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody that inhibits PD-1 binding by PD-L1 and PD-L2), celecoxib (COX-2, a cancer suppressor), and chloroquine (CQ, an anti-malarial agent). This treatment combination is predicted to cause an increase in the levels of anti-tumor cells to be able to combat cancer cells with three key mechanisms that are thought to be associated with pancreatic cancer: 1) increased ER stress, 2) inhibition of anti-apoptotic gene BCL-2 (B-cell lymphoma 2) that prevents cell death, and 3) autophagy, or a process within a cell by which the cell destroys itself to survive the damage done by cytotoxic drugs."

In this study, we compare clinical pregnancy and live birth rates of Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET) in substituted and natural cycles.

Frozen embryo transfer (FET) is a well-established assisted reproductive technology (ART) technique for patients undergoing IVF treatments. The endometrial cycle can be substituted to synchronize with the frozen embryo development. However, natural cycle FET (NC FET) is more advantageous due to its simple preparation without administering exogenous hormonal agents and its less costly and less complicated procedure.

The aim of this study is to compare clinical pregnancy and live birth rates between substituted FET (sfFET) and natural cycle FET (ncFET).
In a substituted cycle, estrogen and progesterone are given and a transfer is planned when the endometrium is ready (usually 3-4 days before ovulation). In ncFET, no hormones are given, and the transfer is planned when there is a dominant follicle apparent at the ultrasound (usually up to 14 days after last menstrual period).

Cryopreserved embryos may be used to attempt to establish pregnancy in an additional method of infertility treatment, i.e.., Frozen Embryo Transfer (FET), which has a considerably lower cumulative ongoing pregnancy rate than a first cycle in a fresh cycle, despite of the higher cumulative ongoing pregnancy rates of the 2nd or 3rd cycle (approximately 30%).

The present study compares pregnancy and live birth rates of NC FET and sfFET in selected cases according to embryo implantation potential by comparing day 5/6 blastocyst rates, in order to assess the usefulness of NC FET regarding the increased risk of failed stimulated cycles with high grade embryos (5/6 grade) transferred.

Natural cycle FET (NC FET) will be compared with substituted cycle FET (sfFET). This could lead to an increase of clinical ongoing pregnancy rate.

Inclusion criteria: age < 40 years old, Women having undergone either a frozen embryo transfer in natural cycle or substituted cycle IVF and FET cycles performed at Clinique OVO, excluding patients with egg or embryo recipient, history of recurrent miscarriages, defined as ≥ 3 consecutive losses, patient that needed Viagra, Plasma-Rich Platelet (PRP) or other modalities to improve their endometrial thickness, uterine abnormalities, abnormal hormonal profiles, FET stimulated cycles, history of recurrent implantation failure.

The design is a retrospective cohort study.

The endpoints will be clinical pregnancy and live birth rates. The primary endpoint will be clinical pregnancy, defined as the presence of fetal heartbeat at the viability ultrasound, while the secondary endpoint will be live birth rates.

FET cryopreserved embryo thawing, preparation and transfer will be monitored by a specially trained nurse. After the FET, embryo implantations and pregnancy rates will be followed. The ongoing clinical pregnancy will follow embryo implantation, the miscarriages will follow the outcome and the live birth will follow the neonatal outcome. Statistical Analysis: The demographic and outcome data will be collected and tabulated and Chi squred analysis will be performed to compare the 2 groups of embryo implantation potential.

Furthermore, it is important to know the clinical pregnancy and live birth rates.

Background: Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are always suffering from nutritional deficiency that may affect their growth and weight. It is important to identify the prevalence of undernutrition and the causes in these children. A standardized pediatric care system is not available in Egypt. To the best of our knowledge, there has no published work from Egypt about the effect of nutritional management on growth and nutritional status in the infants affected by CHD. 
The objective of this study: To determine the prevalence of undernutrition and the cause from the Egyptian Egyptian sample.

This study will evaluate safety of resection of infiltrating glioblastoma (GB) based on pre-operative imaging. We have found using high resolution MRI, specifically amine chemical exchange saturation transfer (microscopic CEST), an abnormal pH in Glioblastoma. Using this technology, we have shown that 1) high pH is associated with decreased PFS, and 2) resection of these pH abnormalities results in maximal safe resection and increased survival in our initial case series with no significant surgical complications (NCT01777570).
We hypothesize that maximal safe resection of infiltrating glioblastoma based on microscopic pH will minimize the post-operative tumor cell burden and allow for increased survival. Furthermore, we hypothesize that this resection will be safe, with similar frequency of complication as the standard of care resection strategy.
In order to test our hypothesis, we will conduct a prospective, randomized controlled trial of surgical resection of glioblastoma with microscopic pH (ME).
This will consist of two study arms. All patients will have standard of care resection. One group will receive an experimental CEST+ME resection (surgery), and one group will receive standard of care resection without CEST+ME resection. Both groups will have standard of care adjuvant therapy (temozolomide + radiation therapy).
We will compare the primary endpoint of progression free survival and secondary endpoints of overall survival, surgical complication rates and quality of life metrics with 1) no intervention and 2) standard of care only (No intervention arm) to assess if maximal safe resection based on microscopic pH improves outcomes compared to standard of care only. All analysis will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis.

Urinary Bladder Cancer (UBC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide. UBC is much more common in African Americans and other minority groups than in Asians, Caucasians, and Hispanics. The incidence of UBC is highest in low-income, rural areas of the world, and in developing countries. The highest incidence rate in any country worldwide is in Egypt. However, the incidence rate of UBC in Egypt and other parts of Africa is lower than that of industrialized countries, such as the United States, Germany and Japan. The Sudan is in the middle of the countries that are considered to have a high incidence of UBC. It is not a leading cause of death in the Sudan. Nevertheless, it can be a leading reason for consultations and hospitalization because of the lack of early detection and poor performance of the treatment offered. There is a paucity of data on the incidence, presentation and histology of UBC in Darfur.
This research study investigates the patterns of urinary bladder cancer (BC) in Darfur, Sudan, with a focus on understanding the clinical outcomes, etiology, histology, and demographic distribution of the disease. We plan to interview and perform clinical exam, imaging (ultrasound, CT, and X-ray) as well as histology and genetic analysis of urinary bladder mass in adult (age of age > 18) Sudanese pts who lives in Darfur and presented with urinary bladder mass. We will gather patients from Nyala Specialized Teaching Hospital (NaSTH) and Sennar Hospital. We will retrospectively analyze the clinical outcomes of patient with urinary bladder tumor in these two hospitals from January 2010 through December 2019.
This is an observational study, and the results will be published in the medical literature. Information from this study will be kept confidential and used to advance knowledge and treatment of the disease."

The investigators propose to examine the effects of a short playful interaction on the cognitive, social, and mood of older people. The investigators will examine changes in indices of mood, mental health, social functioning, cognition compared to an active control intervention. The investigators will examine whether the effects of short-term playful interaction tasks will be preserved in the online format. In addition, in the past two decades there has been a shift toward the development of tailor-made interventions that fit individual needs and abilities. This trend is especially important in aging, given increased variability in personality and cognitive and sensory characteristics. The investigators will examine how personality traits, cognitive functions, and socio-emotional factors will influence the effects of a playful interaction on the dependent variables. The investigators hypnotized that playful interactions will induce greater effects on emotional and social indices, as well as on executive functioning, compared to more familiar social interactions. The investigators hypothesize that these effects will be found in older populations. Overall, the research on playful interactions in aging aims to investigate novel ways for stimulating and supporting cognitive, emotional, and social functions of aging and provide insight on how to support these functions in at-risk populations. The research on playful interactions has received great international attention, and the current research will provide an opportunity to bridge this fascinating field with the aging field. It is hoped that the current research will contribute to the field of aging by showing the importance of cultivating playfulness and novelty seeking as a way to support cognitive, emotional, and social functions of aging. The novel aspect of this research is the use of improvisation as a metaphor for stimulating novelty seeking, playfulness, creativity, and social connection. Moreover, to date, research that has looked at playful interactions has used young participants or participants with specific cognitive or psychological impairments. The investigators propose to use an experimental design to examine the effects of playful interactions on cognitive, mood, and social functioning of generally aging populations."

Recent studies suggest that parents of youth with developmental disabilities report less frequent communication about sexual health and puberty compared to parents of youth without disabilities (Hershenson et al., 2008). A 2016 Kaiser Family Foundation national poll found that more than half of parents lack confidence in having conversations about sexual health topics with their teen, with a clear discrepancy among parents with children with disabilities (48%) compared to parents of teenagers without disabilities (36%) (Kaiser Family Foundation, 2017). Evidence-based practice supports parent training as an excellent way to improve a wide range of parenting behaviors, including sexual health communication (Raposa, Nelson, & Witkiewitz, 2010). Further, these skills can be taught through a brief microskills intervention for parents resulting in significant and lasting improvements (Davies, Witkiewitz, Hilton, Nelson, & Brown, 2010). Although no studies have examined skill-based interventions with parents of youth with developmental disabilities, one study demonstrated significant improvements in parent skill usage when communication curriculum was taught with parents of youth with neurodevelopmental disabilities (SkillTalk, Davies et al., 2016) compared to usual care where the majority of parents made no improvement. Research supporting the effectiveness of an adaptable microskills parent training with families of youth who have disabilities (Davies et al., 2016) combined with the growing evidence for the effectiveness of online modules in improving communication skills (e.g. Davis et al., 2018; Kulik, Vogel, & Weinstock, 2017), warrants testing the potential impact of online trainings with parents of youth with autism spectrum disorder. This study aims to examine the impact of an online training for parents of youth with ASD on parents' demonstrated skills, confidence, communication frequency, teen knowledge, attitude, and behavior around sexual health and relationships between January 2022 and December 2022. Based on existing evidence of efficacy found in studies with parents of youth without disabilities, parents of youth with developmental disabilities will demonstrate a modest to moderate improvement in communication knowledge, skills, and frequency.

The incidence of sepsis is high, but the mortality rate is high in sepsis, among which septic shock is life-threatening for critical patients, and more than half of the patients die. Septic shock is an inflammatory response with extensive multiple organ dysfunction and pathological vascular permeability. Studies have reported that the increase of vascular endothelial injury reflects the severity of the disease and predicts poor prognosis. Recent studies have found that the sepsis patients induced gasdermin D (GSDMD) pore formation on vascular endothelial cells, thereby disrupting the plasma membrane, promoting the occurrence of multiple organ failure, and promoting cell death. The exact regulatory mechanism of GSDMD pore formation under septic conditions has not been elucidated, and the relationship between sepsis patients induced GSDMD pore formation and pyroptosis remains unclear. DDX17 is a member of the DExD/H domain helicase family, and DDX17 plays an important role in regulating cell apoptosis and pyroptosis. Moreover, high expression levels of DDX17 in tumor tissue are associated with a poor prognosis of patients. However, the relationship between DDX17 and sepsis has not been fully addressed. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the relationship between DDX17 and GSDMD pore formation in sepsis patients, and to establish the relationship between DDX17, GSDMD and vascular endothelial injury, and to evaluate its clinical impact on the prognosis of sepsis patients. The research hypothesis: DDX17 is associated with GSDMD pore formation in sepsis patients. The higher the expression level of DDX17 in the plasma of sepsis patients, the more severe the clinical manifestations, the more serious the organ failure, and the less satisfactory the prognosis. The study aims to confirm the hypothesis by combining clinical and basic information to confirm the relationship between DDX17 and sepsis. At the same time, a follow-up research proposal is put forward to explore the regulatory mechanism of DDX17 on GSDMD pore formation in sepsis patients."

Liver transplantation is a standard operation of end stage liver disease patients. Postoperative course of liver transplantation is affected by complications. Acute cellular reactive and delayed graft function are complications that can affect liver transplantation patients. In the early period of liver transplantation, if complications are detected together with postoperative blood count and biochemical analysis the probability of diagnoses are higher. But in the late period, it makes difficult to detect these complications. Therefore, there is a need for non-invasive methods to be performed in routine follow-up."

Glioblastoma (GBM) is a life-threatening disease with only a 5-year overall survival (OS) of about 5% in real-world studies. Elemene is an anti-tumor drug found to be effective in treating glioblastomas (GBMs) in preliminary retrospective studies. This study aims to conduct the phase II clinical trial ""Efficacy and Safety of Elemene Plus Stupp Protocol Versus Stupp Protocol Alone for Newly-diagnosed Glioblastoma: A Multi-center Phase II Randomized Controlled Trial"" and to test the safety and efficacy of adding Elemene to the conventional Stupp protocol consisting of irradiation, radiochemotherapy, and adjuvant TMZ in treating GBM patients.
Patients with newly-diagnosed GBMs will be randomly divided into two arms: 1) the experimental arm will take Elemene for 6 cycles during the adjuvant TMZ administration, and 2) the control arm will receive placebo during the adjuvant TMZ administration. Before the start of the clinical trial, the investigators aim to recruit 80 patients at 15 hospitals in China, using block-randomization and random number tables to allocate patients into two arms."

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a syndrome characterized by widespread inflammation and diffuse alveolar injury, resulting in hypoxemia, and frequently requiring invasive mechanical ventilation to guarantee the alveolar oxygenation, which in turn increases the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). VILI increases the stress that the lungs exert to the surrounding thoracic cage, with an effect dependent on the position of the patient, i.e. the direction of the gravity-vector with respect to the lung: in the supine position, when the lungs are placed vertically under gravity, some areas of the lungs (i.e. the dependent lung regions) are more vulnerable to overdistension, while other areas (i.e. the non-dependent regions) are more prone to atelectasis. For this reason, patients on mechanical ventilation commonly present greater respiratory system compliance (Crs) when the patient is in the supine position. On the other hand, when the patient is in the prone position, both non-dependent lung regions and dependent lung regions are equally vulnerable to overdistension, with a consequent decrease in Crs and an increase in driving pressures, resulting in increased risk of VILI. Therefore, to reduce the stress exerted by mechanical ventilation on damaged lungs in ARDS, the prone position, as compared to the supine position, has been demonstrated to improve oxygenation impairment by reducing lung non-uniformity, increasing FRC, decreasing heterogeneous distribution of lung ventilation and homogenizing alveolar recruitment. In infants and children ARDS is characterized by a different pathophysiology as compared with adults, with greater heterogeneity of lung ventilation, even when the patient lies in the supine position, because of the limited airway closing pressure and the lower pulmonary compliance. For this reason, it has been hypothesized that these subtleties in the pathophysiology should result in a higher efficacy of prone positioning in preventing lung collapse and non-uniformity of ventilation in children ARDS. However, prone position efficacy in children with ARDS is uncertain, since studies performed in this population so far lack evidence. The current knowledge gap on the effects of prone positioning in non-intubated infants/children with ARDS is mainly due to the lack of standardized measurements to identify the respiratory and hemodynamics effects of body position. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the physiological effects of prone positioning during non-invasive, CPAP-supported ventilation in infants/children with ARDS."

The present study focuses on comparing the effects of progressive relaxation training (PRT) on pain features, attack frequency, activity perception, self-efficacy, and social participation in women with migraine or TTH. In this experimental study, 44 women underwent PRT or no intervention for 6 weeks. Before the intervention and at the 1st week after the intervention, occupational self-sufficiency, disability, catastrophizing, headache impact, perception of activity and social participation were assessed. It was hypothesized that the women who participated in PRT would have a lower perception of work performance and participation in social life limitations, less disability, lower frequency of attacks and less pain impact due to the treatment compared to the control group. The findings revealed that women who participated in PRT had lower attack frequencies, reduced pain severity more than women in the control group, while they felt less physical disability, but did not see improvement in cognitive/ emotional aspects such as participation in daily activities and social life. No statistical difference was determined between the groups in terms of pain features or attack frequency in women with TTH. Furthermore, no effect of PRT was found in women with migraine. In this group at the end of the study, the women who underwent PRT had less headache impact and physical disability and felt less pain in the week following the training; they felt less physical disability 1 month after the training, and this was important for their self-sufficiency perception and participation in social life. These findings demonstrate that PRT has a more positive impact on women with migraine than women with TTH. In this group, the training increased perception of work performance and improved participation in social life, which are vital in terms of self-sufficiency. The findings indicate that PRT is a non-invasive treatment option for women who experience pain."

Infant withdrawal syndrome after prenatal exposure to opioids is a serious illness that requires prolonged hospitalization and long-term medication use. Opioid addiction is growing in prevalence, particularly among pregnant women. Infants exposed to opioids in utero often experience withdrawal syndrome, which is commonly called Neonatal Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome (NOWS) or Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS). NOWS or NAS describes a group of symptoms experienced by infants after birth when maternal opioids are stopped or reduced. These symptoms may include tremors, fever, sweating, seizures, vomiting, poor feeding, diarrhea, and poor weight gain. In some cases, withdrawal symptoms can be severe and require prolonged hospitalization, long-term medication use, and may even be life-threatening. 
The use of pharmacological agents to treat NOWS/NAS is the standard of care for the past several decades. This treatment is often not without side effects including suppression of growth and feeding difficulties, as well as a risk of adverse behavioral effects in later life. Unfortunately, the clinical course of withdrawal may also be unpredictable, with some infants experiencing mild symptoms and a short treatment course while others may have severe symptoms and prolonged courses lasting over a month. Currently, there are no reliable predictors of withdrawal severity and clinical course. 
In addition to pharmacological treatment, the treatment of infants with NOWS/NAS in the current clinical context is largely trial and error. It is well known in clinical pediatrics that no two infants with withdrawal react exactly the same, but the severity of symptoms and response to treatment can take anywhere between a few hours and a day to manifest. Unfortunately, current withdrawal guidelines and scoring systems used to determine the severity of individual symptoms are subjective, and may be based on the assessment of different clinicians. The standard withdrawal severity score is the Finnegan Neonatal Abstinence Scoring Tool (NAS-FIN). The Finnegan neonatal abstinence score is used on a 24-hour schedule, but there is currently no scoring tool that accurately predicts the severity of infants with NOWS/NAS in a shorter clinical time span. 
A potential alternative to traditional pharmacological interventions for NOWS/NAS could be the use of non-opiate medications that target different aspects of withdrawal. Such medications could provide a more consistent and reliable response and could be used in place of or supplementation to traditional medication. For example, the anti-pruritic medication chlorpheniramine seems to be effective in reducing withdrawal symptoms in animal models, and we have initial anecdotal data suggesting that chlorpheniramine combined with morphine results in reduced withdrawal symptoms as judged by the Finnegan score in some infants with NOWS/NAS. 
Recent investigations have focused on a group of small molecules found in the body and body fluids called microRNAs. These molecules have been found to be present in human fluids such as blood or saliva, and may be responsible for signaling between cells. Recent studies from our lab have shown that microRNAs are differentially expressed in infants with NOWS/NAS compared to infants experiencing withdrawal but are not exposed to opioids in utero. Specifically, we reported that the microRNAs let-7a, miR-126 and miR-299, as well as the long non-coding RNA lnc-MEG3, are changed in infants with prenatal opioid exposure. These microRNAs were highly expressed in those infants experiencing withdrawal. Furthermore, using a cell culture model, we found that exposure to opioids reduces the expression of these microRNAs, suggesting that these molecules may be a target for future pharmacological agents to modulate withdrawal. 
Despite our preliminary work, no other investigation has looked at the relationship between microRNAs and NOWS/NAS in human infants. In this study, we aim to examine the microRNA response to withdrawal and their use as potential biomarkers for NOWS/NAS. We plan to enroll infants between 1-5 days of age meeting diagnostic criteria for withdrawal. After obtaining informed consent from the infant's mother, we will perform a blood draw from the infant and a buccal (saliva) swab. We will also enroll infants in the clinical research protocol to receive morphine treatment of withdrawal for five days. We will then examine the differences in microRNA expression between NOWS and non-exposed infants using a combination of qPCR and"

Women receiving opioid treatment during pregnancy are at high risk of experiencing precipitated withdrawal with opioids used for delivery. They are also at high risk of illicit drug use during pregnancy. Opioid treatment programs commonly prescribe buprenorphine for the management of withdrawal and treatment of opioid use disorder in part to facilitate delivery. Induction of buprenorphine requires an initial period of withdrawal before the opioid effects of buprenorphine are realized and in most cases occurs in a hospital inpatient setting. This 18 to 30-month prospective, randomized controlled trial compares the effect of a transdermal patch containing buprenorphine in pregnancy versus no medication during buprenorphine induction. Participants will be recruited prior to entering labor and managed in an outpatient setting for the purpose of buprenorphine induction. This study aims to determine whether outpatient administration of the buprenorphine transdermal patch is effective for maternal and neonatal outcomes."

Background and rationale: Chronic pancreatitis is an inherently complex disease requiring coordinated, multidisciplinary care. Patients suffer from constant, distressing, adverse symptoms including abdominal pain, steatorrhoea, bloating, wind, cramping, and fatigue, making it difficult to eat a normal or sufficient diet. They develop vitamin deficiencies, osteoporosis, and a difficult-to-manage diabetes subgroup (type 3c diabetes). There is no effective medical/surgical treatment, and the disease is progressive and incurable. The mainstay of treatment is diet, supplementation, and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, which helps patients to digest and absorb their food, alleviating symptoms somewhat.
Chronic pancreatitis is a challenging disease with a significant burden on patients and society. It is characterised by relapsing/remitting episodes of pain (lasting up to 15 days) and steatorrhoea, exacerbating diarrhoea, bloating and abdominal discomfort, and affecting a patient's ability to eat a normal diet. Patients suffer from a range of vitamin deficiencies secondary to malabsorption. Patients usually present to tertiary hospitals with advanced disease and often have associated diabetes (3c diabetes). There is no effective medical or surgical treatment for the disease, but the mainstay of therapy consists of good nutritional advice, ensuring adequate nutrition through dietary supplements, ensuring adequate medication (pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy) and managing associated morbidities.
Chronic pancreatitis is a challenging diagnosis as many patients still smoke, remain obese and/or alcohol-dependent, which adds to the complexity of their management and often makes them 'treatment-refractory’. The investigators have identified a need to improve the management of this condition because:
1) it is challenging to coordinate care and this leads to poorer outcomes, high hospital admission and unplanned attendances to the hospital;
2) there are no new medical treatments available to treat the condition;
3) there is no evidence-based guidance to support a more coordinated approach to care; and
4) patient access to specialist pancreatic services is not always available, or patients travel long distances, leading to inadequate ongoing patient/clinic communication;
5) existing resources for patient/family support are limited; and
6) existing patient information available is limited.
What is the intervention?
A steering group designed and developed the SmartCP mobile phone app during 2022 with the support of a government innovation grant. SmartCP consists of a symptom tracker, diet/physical activity log, alert system for escalating symptoms, quality of life assessment, red-flag alerts for diabetes/pancreatic cancer, educational content, push notifications and messaging function.
The smartphone app will be used for the next 6-18 months. At the end of this period, a patient survey will determine how patients have used the application during this time, the number of interactions and what they felt the application was useful for.
The app is available for download on Apple and Android smartphones.
The investigators will ask a group of patients with chronic pancreatitis and a group of nurses to evaluate and feedback on the app. Patients will be asked to provide feedback on their experience of using the app before and after the intervention. Nurses using this app will be asked to evaluate and feedback on their experience of using the app.

This study was planned as a randomized prospective controlled study. Patients with Miller class 1 or 2 gingival recession who needs root coverage surgery in the Department of Periodontology were included in the study. The subepithelial connective tissue graft was obtained in each patient using the single incision technique from the region between the mesial of canine and the mesial of first molar in the palate. Connective tissue dimensions were approximately 10 × 5 × 2 mm. Finally, the incision line was sutured with 5/0 synthetic, nonabsorbable, sterile monofilament suture in the control group while L-PRF membrane was placed to the donor site in the test group before the suturing. Patients were evaluated using an ultrasonography device (MyLab™ Seven, Esaote, Genoa, Italy) at the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology. USG measurements were performed on days 0, 3, 7, 14, 21, 30 and 90 for palatal tissue thickness and tissue vascularization by an oral and maxillofacial radiologist with at least six years of experience. A 6-18 MHz intraoral probe was used in intraoral USG examinations. Sterile gel was applied to the intraoral probe and covered with a stretch film. Then, it was placed directly on the mucosal surface of the donor site in the palatal area. Mucosal thickness was evaluated using the B-mode of the device, and vascularization was evaluated using the color doppler and pulsed wave doppler modes of the device. The mean pulsatility index (PI) values of each patient were calculated and considered for statistical analysis. The power analyse of the study was performed for sample size calculation. Sample size was calculated using a statistical program (G*Power; Universitat, Dusseldorf, Germany) for α = 0.05 and effect size = 0.26. The analyses revealed that 10 subjects per group achieved a power of 80 % with 95% confidence. The data were analysed with the SPSS 21 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Continuous variables were presented as mean ± standard deviation and categorical variables as numbers and percentages. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to detect data's normality. For the comparison of the parameters of the study groups, independent samples T-test test was used for normally distributed data while Mann Whitney U test test was performed as non-parametric test. Within-group comparisons between the different time periods were tested with repeated measures of ANOVA. Bonferroni correction was performed for multiple variations. The statistical significance value was accepted as p < 0.05."

This study will seek to collect high quality data on outcomes and costs for patients receiving ARRC treatment in an Australian public hospital. This will involve piloting the use of a database to record these outcomes and costs from patient admission to 7-10 post-operative days.
This approach is intended to serve two purposes. Firstly, it will allow for collection of data to establish the effectiveness, safety and acceptability of ARRC treatment in an Australian setting. Understanding the experiences and outcomes of patients, and the cost implications of this model of care, is essential before scaling up to larger evaluations. Secondly, a database allowing collection of post discharge data will allow the researchers to maintain contact with patients, facilitate the evaluation of longer term outcomes, and build on the results of a previous study at RAH.
This study will be in a pragmatic, real-world context and will focus on surgical inpatient care at Royal Adelaide Hospital (RAH), particularly care in the Post Anaesthesia Recovery Care unit (PARC).
The study will recruit all patients who are admitted to RAH for surgery, who meet specific inclusion criteria of low inpatient mortality risk and expected to stay at least one night. Data will be collected from admission to discharge (estimated to be one week in most cases), and will include details of patient demographics, medical history, surgery details, post-operative care, complications, discharge destination and death.
The results of this study will help inform and improve models of care for surgical patients in both Australia and internationally. By establishing the best possible foundations for future studies and by building strong relationships between researchers, clinicians and consumers, the researchers aim to ultimately improve the value of surgical care provided to patients around the world."

This is a randomized controlled trial with a double-blind design.
Preterms often present neurological and metabolic complications that can lead to long-term health disorders (i.e., cerebral palsy and neurological or cognitive disorders, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, immunological disorders, etc.). Despite a large body of research on the impact of neonatal intensive care interventions on the neurodevelopmental and metabolic outcomes of preterm infants, the effects of specific interventions on the development of the central nervous system remain controversial.
Touch can have positive effects on the growth of infants (including preterms) and the modulation of emotional, cognitive and behavioral responses. Recently it has been suggested that touch has beneficial effects on the organization and the regulation of specific brain areas involved in the modulation of emotions, including the prefrontal cortex, the amygdala, the hypothalamus and cortical regions associated with affective processing such as the insula and the anterior cingulate cortex.
Hypothesis:  We hypothesize that touch (TOT) intervention has beneficial metabolic and neurodevelopmental outcomes in preterm infants.
Through this study, the researchers aim to verify the possibility that a 6-month treatment program can lead to beneficial neurodevelopmental and metabolic outcomes in preterms. The program could help preterms in developing adequate connectivity in the central nervous system and in regulating metabolic markers."

HIV-infected men in Hong Kong are at high-risk of Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI). Mycoplasma Genitalium(MG) has an increasing prevalence among MG-naive male recruited from two clinics of Prince of Wales Hospital in the past two years. The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of MG infection, MG drug resistance mutations, and the overall STI burden in HIV positive male patients in Prince of Wales Hospital. This study will recruit 750 HIV-infected male patients attending the Prince of Wales Hospital HIV outpatient clinic in Hong Kong. Participants will receive self-sampling kits to collect urine, rectal and pharyngeal swabs for MG, Chlamydia trachomatis(CT)and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) testing for both men who have sex with men (MSM) and heterosexual men. The data of clinical diagnosis of STI will be extracted from medical records. The study will determine the prevalence of MG infection. To investigate the prevalence of MG resistance mutations, genetic studies will be performed on bacterial DNA isolated from MG positive samples from rectal and pharyngeal sites with quantitation of the number of MGgenotypic resistance mutations. The prevalence of CT and NG infections would be examined. The investigators will estimate the overall STI burden in HIV cohort, which is important to inform clinical practices for better management of STI among HIV positive patients. This study can enhance the surveillance of the prevalence and genotypic resistance mutations of MG infection and the overall STIs burden in HIV positive male patients. Ultimately, understanding the prevalence and resistance mechanisms of MG infection can inform local practices and policy to prevent and manage MG infection."

All participants will go through a single-group baseline and observation phase. Then, participants will be randomized to either the experimental arm or the active comparator, with a balance ratio of 1:1. The experimental arm consists of the combination of Dalpiciclib once daily on days 1-21 of each 4-week cycle. Participants are required to undergo a CT or MRI assessment 4-8 weeks after randomization. Assessments at week 12 must be consistent with the first interim assessment. The active comparator consists of the clinically applicable chemotherapy regimen as determined by the clinical physician who is responsible for the selection of the chemotherapy. Patients are required to conduct the examination four weeks after randomization to determine disease progression. Participants are required to undergo a CT or MRI assessment 4-8 weeks after the first examination after the start of treatment. Assessments at week 12 must be consistent with the first interim assessment."

Inactivity is the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, leading to chronic diseases and obesity. Much of the world's population is inactive and older adults are at highest risk. Inactivity in older adults is linked to age-related diseases and cognitive decline, along with imposing social costs in the form of increased medical expenses. Incentive-based interventions have gained popularity among behavioral scientists and policymakers for improving health-related behaviors such as physical activity, but there are drawbacks due to concerns of scalability, habit formation, and crowd-out effects. While financial incentive programs are popular, they may be costly, and the effects are not long-lasting. Therefore, the investigators propose to design and evaluate alternative incentives that address these issues by focusing on prosocial incentives and personal incentives. The investigators will aim to encourage physical activity through alternative incentives by making meal donations on behalf of participants (prosocial incentives) and offering participants monetary incentives (personal incentives) for their walking behavior. Both types of incentives have underpinnings in behavior economics. For example, prosocial preferences are the tendency to derive pleasure from helping others, and may be more powerful than monetary incentives for reducing inactivity. The participants will be randomized to receive prosocial, personal, or no incentives for 8 weeks. Step count, mental health, and overall physical health of these participants will be tracked. The investigators will recruit 200 older adults from stores, cafes, and community centers around San Diego and track their step counts for 8 weeks."

As part of the critical time intervention (CTI-PS), a trained peer support coordinator from the community of mental health users (MHCMUW) will work closely with persons with disabilities from the Portuguese Centre of Mental Health (CMP) who, after a recent discharge from a psychiatric in-patient hospitalization, may be especially vulnerable and in need of support as they adjust to life in the community.
After a screening period, which will identify individuals for whom CTI-PS is the most appropriate and effective strategy, CTI-PS services will be offered to a total of 40 participants allocated in CTI-PS treatment who are, on average, 32-years-old. All participants will also receive services as usual (TAU) in the CMP in accordance with the established clinical practices, and the effects of psychosocial treatments in CTI-PS will be compared to the effects on persons with disabilities from the CMP receiving TAU alone."

The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of blood flow restriction exercis on musculoskeletal strength, body composition, and pain in patients with distal radius fractures undergoing surgical repair. The study will be a prospective randomized control trial consisting of subjects requiring operative fixation of their distal radius fractures. All subjects will receive standard orthopedic post-operative rehabilitation, and undergo DEXA scans and hand grip strength testing at multiple time points to assess body composition, muscle strength and bone density. The study will then be further divided based on age group, where one half of all subjects will receive the same rehab protocol, but with the addition of blood flow restriction using a tourniquet during certain exercises. The hypothesis is that a short course of rehabilitation incorporating blood flow restriction therapy will promote faster gains in muscle strength, reduce time to return to work and other daily duties, and reduce pain at time points following surgery. The study will be powered to detect a difference of 5lbs in grip strength between the two groups, while reducing inter-group variability based on age and gender. We believe these goals will be achieved by recruiting subjects from our own institution, and by ensuring the same surgeon is involved in all surgeries, and the same physical therapist in all rehabilitation. These methods will help minimize inter-group variability related to surgeon and rehab therapist experience with each individual patient."

Background: Recent guidelines recommend coronary computed tomography angiography (cCTA) as the first line test for the evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD). However, the management of patients with non-obstructive CAD is less clear, with a significantly increased risk of developing major cardiovascular events. An AI-based analysis combining multiple CAD determinants, including an innovative quantitative angiosegographical parameter (coronary adipose tissue attenuation), has been shown to stratify patient-risk and predict the severity of adverse cardiovascular events. Objective: The aim of this study is to develop an AI-based model that can accurately predict patient-risk and improve personalized management in patients with suspected CAD. It has two main goals:
1. To prospectively validate the clinical-imaging AI-based model in a retrospective cohort (month 0-30) in patients who underwent a cCTA exam for CAD evaluation. Specifically, 3000 patients will be enrolled in the retrospective single center cohort (2500 in the AI training cohort and 500 in the AI testing cohort), and the AI-based model will be validated retrospectively on a prospectively enrolled cohort of 500 patients who also underwent a retrospective follow-up.
2. To validate the AI-based model on a prospective cohort (month 0-60) of 500 patients who underwent a cCTA examination for CAD evaluation. The AI-based model will be prospectively developed and validated on this study population, and a prospective follow-up of 3 years will be performed. As a final step, a software solution will be developed to be integrated in the clinical workflow following the standardized regulatory procedure ""regulatory sandbox"" (1446/2019/EC). This will increase usability and reduce costs for the integration of AI-based applications in clinical care."

This research program aims to test the effectiveness of a unique wearable (Heel2ToeTM) for modifying gait in people with Parkinson's disease (PD).
The device produces real-time (auditory) feedback during walking, and provides detailed information to the therapist for review of sessions and analysis of long-term outcomes.
After a thorough review of the literature, the investigators have selected two gait indicators that are easily manipulated by the sensor: the angular velocity (speed) of the ankle at heel strike and foot push-off. These parameters were quantified and compared for participants using the Heel2Toe sensor compared with those of a control group who were assessed at the same time points. In addition, the investigators will assess changes over time in motivation and HRQL to determine whether improvements in gait translate into motivational change to be more active as well as improvements in daily quality of life. The data will be collected online using a secure website and smartphone app.
Based on the 4 questions about the sensor, the investigators expect most participants using the Heel2Toe to:
1. Require no training by a rehab therapist or other technical support person,
2. use the sensor at least once a week,
3. change gait pattern,
4. be motivated to walk more or better and
5. change HRQL by 5% to 20% (depending on participants' baseline scores)."

The relationships between the severity of rotator cuff tears, muscle activation patterns of scapular and rotator cuff muscles, and clinical symptoms are complex and not fully understood. The primary objective of this study is to investigate the hypothesis that the severity of rotator cuff tears has a significant impact on the activation patterns of scapular and rotator cuff muscles during functional tasks, causing changes in the muscle-tendon length and compensatory muscle activation patterns when painful and/or disabled shoulders are used. The secondary objective is to identify the differences in muscle activation patterns between varying tear sizes (small, medium, large, and massive). It is hypothesised that muscle activation patterns will differ between the different sizes of rotator cuff tears. This study will use surface electromyography (sEMG) to assess the activation patterns of scapular and rotator cuff muscles in patients with symptomatic full-thickness rotator cuff tears of varying severity. By understanding the relationships between tear severity, muscle activation patterns, and clinical symptoms, findings from this study can help clinicians to optimize rehabilitation programs and develop strategies to prevent further damage to the rotator cuff, thus ensuring faster and better recovery of affected patients."

Pyrotinib is approved to treat non-small cell lung cancer, but no studies have been reported concerning its safety and efficacy in patients with high-risk and early or locally advanced stage breast cancer. HER-2 positive breast cancer is generally treated by anti-HER-2 therapy, followed by endocrine treatment. However, in patients with HER-2 protein overexpression and/or gene amplification, the risk of relapse is higher, and their prognosis remains unsatisfactory. After 1-2 years of anti-HER-2 therapy treatment, pyrotinib treatment can effectively maintain the effectiveness of adjuvant therapy, reduce the risk of relapse in patients with early-stage breast cancer, avoid the recurrence of breast cancer, prolong survival time, and prolong disease-free survival time. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of pyrotinib to adjuvant anti-HER therapy(trastuzumab combined with pertuzumab or T-DM1)after surgery for patients with high-risk and early or locally advanced stage breast cancer. It can provide new treatment options for improving disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with HER-2 positive early or locally advanced stage breast cancer."

The Mediterranean diet has been associated with a reduced risk of diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular diseases. The regular consumption of pasta in moderate amounts is part of the diet, even though it is wrongly considered too caloric and associated with weight gain, especially if consumed at dinner. The scientific literature, however, does not evaluate, in a comprehensive way, the best time to consume pasta for improving or maintaining health status, especially with respect to metabolic, sleep and gastrointestinal parameters.
Thus, this study aims at investigating the effects of consuming pasta at two different phases, namely at lunch or at dinner, on sleep quality, anthropometric indices, cardiovascular risk factors, composition and functionality of the gut microbiota. Furthermore, the individual chronotypes, which have recently been considered for their influence on dietary habits, metabolic indices and human health, will be evaluated to understand if they have an impact on the study outcomes.
The investigators will recruit 30 normal weight participants to the study, each fulfilling the inclusion criteria. The participants will be randomly allocated to two groups, one that will eat pasta at dinner for 3 months at the beginning, and one that will eat pasta at lunch for 3 months at the beginning. After 3 months of intervention, the groups will change the phase of pasta consumption according to the following sequence: the dinner group that was initially at dinner will move to lunch, whilst the lunch group that was initially at lunch will move to dinner. Participants will be provided with 100gr of whole wheat pasta with tomato sauce, consumed at their habitual mid-meal meal (lunch or dinner, depending on the group they are in).
The investigators will perform several measures of sleep quality at the beginning and at the end of each dietary intervention period. Sleep will be evaluated by standardised questionnaires, sleep logs and actigraphy monitoring. The primary outcome of the study will be related to sleep and gastrointestinal health, while secondary outcomes will assess body weight, body composition, blood parameters, gut microbiota composition and short chain fatty acid production.
The results of this study are expected to provide novel insights on the impact of pasta consumption at two different pharmacological phases on the health of normal weight subjects. This information may be used to optimize pasta consumption for overall health and to develop dietary recommendations related to meal timing."

Micro-positive breast cancer is a breast tumor with a diameter less than 1 mm, and the long diameter of invasive cancer is less than 1 mm. Patients with microinvasive breast cancer have a high chance of survival after surgical treatment. However, some patients still relapse, and the site of recurrence is often in the lymph nodes or distant metastasis. The recurrence rate 10 years after treatment is about 10%-30%. In the adjuvant treatment of positive lymph node breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy and targeted therapy reduce the incidence of distant metastasis and improve the long-term survival rate. After positive lymph node surgery for breast cancer, some patients have a high risk of lymph node recurrence, such as patients with a large number of positive lymph nodes or the presence of other risk factors. Intravenous chemotherapy for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer has potential cardiotoxicity, leading to heart failure or cardiac death in a small proportion of patients. At present, there is still no standard surgical protocol for the treatment of micro-positive breast cancer.
                Therefore, we plan to combine drugs that can specifically target cancer cells to reduce side effects and evaluate their efficacy and safety.
                In this study, patients will be randomly assigned to two groups.
                The first study group is the experimental group. Patients treated with capecitabine and pyrotinib adjuvant chemotherapy. They will be treated with pyrotinib 400mg QD po and capecitabine 500mg Tid Po within 6 months after surgery. If the side effects cannot be tolerated or the tumors do not respond, the drugs will be withdrawn. The second study group is the control group. Patients treated with endocrine treatment after surgery. The endocrine treatment regimen for the control group after surgery is the following drugs according to the HR status of breast cancer: premenopausal women: 5 years of tamoxifen 10 mg/ day or toremifene 60 mg/ day; postmenopausal patients: 5 years of letrozole 2.5 mg/ day, anastrozole 1 mg/ day or exemestane 25 mg/ day. For patients who have received chemotherapy or targeted therapy before surgery, capecitabine chemotherapy, adjuvant targeted therapy or endocrine treatment before surgery can be selected. Both groups of patients should have a regular follow-up after the end of treatment. Clinical examination every month in the first year after treatment, and 3 months after that, repeat breast MRI, laboratory examination of breast cancer markers (including CA153), blood cell counts and biochemistry. CT chest and abdomen are also performed. The results will be compared between the two groups in the future,"

The investigators' goal is to advance treatment-related outcomes for patients with vocal fold motion disorders by comparing the relative effectiveness of video biofeedback to behavioral therapy (laryngeal control therapy). The investigators hypothesize that no clinically meaningful difference will be detected between biofeedback and behavioral therapy for the treatment of paradoxical vocal fold motion. The investigators will perform a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to compare the relative effectiveness of video biofeedback and behavioral therapy (laryngeal control therapy) in the treatment of paradoxical vocal fold motion. The primary endpoint will be the change in Dyspnea Index score before treatment and one month after treatment. Patients will complete surveys to collate data about patient expectations of behavioral therapy, their reasons for pursuing additional treatment if applicable, and the perceived benefits of the specific intervention. The investigators will use a pilot RCT design with 2 arms. Participants will be randomized to either 1) biofeedback or 2) laryngeal control therapy (LCT). If successful, this pilot RCT will provide data to design a fully powered trial comparing these two interventions. The primary outcome of this pilot RCT will be the difference in Dyspnea Index scores. Secondary outcome measures include responsive rates, assessment of treatment response using the CGI-I, and participant surveys. The investigators' goal is to provide important evidence for guiding treatment for patients with paradoxical vocal fold motion and dyspnea.

Inclusion criteria: Men and women aged 18 or older, patients referred to the Washington University School of Medicine Voice and Airway Center for concerns of PVFM, and those with pre-treatment Dyspnea Index score ≥ 11 (indicative of abnormal dyspnea). Exclusion criteria include inability to speak or understand English, history of laryngeal surgery, PVFM symptoms originating within 3 months of a COVID infection, history of other laryngeal pathology, and inability to provide informed consent."

Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to sleep disorders. In the context of critical illness and ICU admission, there is an intersection of factors contributing to this situation: pre-existing health conditions, severe acute illness, sleep-altering treatments (sedatives, analgesics, mechanical ventilation), psychiatric disorders, and the physical environment.
This multicenter clinical trial is conducted with 60 critically ill patients admitted to 3 ICU settings, 2 referral and 1 tertiary referral. The investigators hypothesize that patients in the pre-sleep protocol group will present significant change in the sleep quality of ICU patients - Richards-Campbell Sleep Quality questionnaire.
Study procedures included sensitizing the team about the importance of sleep for critical patients and providing training and implementation of a multifaceted protocol of interventions to promote the quality of sleep in ICU patients. Re-evaluation was carried out one month after the implementation of the sleep protocol. Change in the sleep quality of patients before and one month after implementation of the sleep protocol is measured by the Richards-Campbell Sleep Quality questionnaire."

In China, about 9.5 million new cases and 5.1 million deaths occurred each year. Among those deaths, about 21% of the elderly died of chronic diseases. With the aging of the population, China will have an unprecedented burden of stroke. According to statistics, by 2025, China's urban elderly population will reach 267 million, accounting for 35.9% of the elderly population, and in 2050, China's urban elderly population will reach 387 million, accounting for 38.3% of the elderly population. It is predicted that the number of stroke patients in China will reach 4 million by 2030 and 6.7 million by 2050. The prevention and control of stroke has therefore become one of the important tasks that cannot be ignored in the future.
In February 2013, the National Development and Reform Commission announced the ""Medical and Health Special Plan for Stroke Prevention and Control (2013-2020)"", which pointed out that the basic scientific research of new drugs for high-risk patients with stroke prevention and control is an important task.
AD16 is a new drug designed by Professor Liu Jian from the University of Texas at Austin (UTSA), which is expected to be used for the prevention of cognitive decline, dementia and Alzheimer's disease in patients with a high risk of disease or mild cognitive impairment according to the 1996 NINCDS-ADRDA criteria. AD16 is a low-molecular-weight heparin with a molecular weight of approximately 5 kDa, which is derived from heparan sulfate. Its mechanism of action may involve activation of protein phosphatases 1, 2A, 2B and 5B, inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3β, and inhibition of tau protein aggregation and phosphorylation under certain conditions.
Ad16 is a stable drug with low immunogenicity and toxicity under certain conditions. It is currently undergoing preclinical and clinical development in the United States by Rexahn Pharmaceuticals Inc.
The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of AD16 in adult healthy subjects after a single oral dose. 72 participants from 2 cohorts (60 healthy men and 12 healthy women) were selected, and the experimental groups and the matching placebo groups received a single oral dose of AD16 0, 10, 20, 30 or 40 to 80 mg. The dosing order according to dosing cohorts is 5 to 8 mg, 10 to 13 mg, 20 to 23 mg, 30 to 33 mg, and 40 to 43 mg.
AD16 showed excellent efficacy in neurocognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease animal models. In a clinical trial in healthy volunteers, the incidence of abnormal laboratory test results was lower in the AD16 group than in the placebo group, and the serum concentrations of AD16 in the drug group were higher than those in the placebo group, suggesting that AD16 has good safety and tolerability and good pharmacokinetics. Based on a large number of previous studies and preclinical and clinical data, the investigator believes that AD16 is safe and well-tolerated and has good pharmacokinetics. This study can provide data for the optimization of the dose form and dosing frequency and the design of subsequent clinical trials.
In summary, this study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, escalating-dose study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of single oral doses of AD16 in adult healthy subjects. The study's dosing schedule is 6 dosing cohorts, which are selected according to the dose escalation scheme."

Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is the most common form of cardiovascular dysfunction in adults and has a prevalence similar to that of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Despite intensive research, prognosis and management of HFpEF with clinical implications is still unsatisfactory. No specific diagnostic algorithm as well as no targeted drug therapy has been approved, unlike heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. As a consequence, the number of hospitalizations for acute decompensation of HFpEF is increasing. The identification of patients with HFpEF, the use of the most effective methods of preventive and therapeutic care, the improvement of patient compliance, and the introduction of comprehensive treatment management should improve the level of HFpEF management. The investigators have previously shown that the phenotype of acute decompensation of HFpEF with preserved ejection fraction is influenced by comorbidities, gender and obesity. Obese patients hospitalized with heart failure are characterized by metabolic disorders with obesity-related cardiomyopathy, which is associated with a poor prognosis; they have elevated levels of markers of systemic inflammation and are characterized by a significant percentage of impaired renal function. The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial in non-hospitalized patients with obesity and HFpEF, which confirmed the positive effect of exercise on the quality of patient compliance and on the prognosis of the disease. At the same time, the investigators still lack a comprehensive algorithm that combines the use of various clinical, laboratory and instrumental methods and that assesses the severity and course of HFpEF decompensation and predicts long-term outcomes. 
An international database is planned to be created to compare new tools for assessing the course, severity and long-term outcomes of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction. A prospective randomized study (PRE-HF-pEF) of 120 patients with HFpEF and acute decompensation is planned, as well as 150 apparently healthy obese people as a control group.
Inclusion criteria are HFpEF and acute decompensation, confirmed by instrumental and / or laboratory criteria. The main inclusion criteria that allow for a full-scale registration include the following. Female patients ≥ 40 years old and male patients ≥ 40 years old who will visit the Cardiology or Intensive care unit at the city clinical hospital named after. V.V. Veresaeva for HFpEF decompensation with an estimated age ≥ 40 years. Patients with a confirmed diagnosis in accordance with instrumental and / or laboratory diagnostic criteria. Exclusion criteria: Refusal to sign informed consent to participate in a clinical trial and to process personal data.
A multidisciplinary team will be involved, with the following specialists participating: a cardiologist, a nephrologist, a dietician, a psychotherapist.
The investigators plan to conduct the assessment of gender characteristics, clinical and anamnestic factors, body composition, topical characteristics of congestion, instrumental data and biochemical markers associated with cellular inflammation and stress in obese patients with acute decompensation of HFpEF. After assessing the baseline characteristics of the registered patients, the investigators will compare the clinical and instrumental characteristics of the patients and the control group to determine the phenotype of acute decompensation of HFpEF to identify patients at risk for adverse long-term outcome, based on which the investigators will develop recommendations for therapeutic management. This will allow for a comprehensive assessment of the course, severity, and long-term outcomes of hospitalized patients with HFpEF. In addition, these patients will have the opportunity to receive evidence-based treatment aimed at a positive long-term outcome."

Apraxia is a motor-based disorder that interferes with the programming and execution of voluntary movements. This motor disorder is characterized by difficulty producing speech sounds correctly, with both the accuracy of consonants and vowels being abnormal; thus, accurate speech production is not consistent or systematic. A growing body of preliminary research suggests that speech therapy combined with frequent practice sessions at home can improve speech production in children with apraxia, but parents and caregivers may face challenges in implementing treatment gains at home without direct supervision by their child's speech-language pathologist (SLP).
In this study, we aim to provide further evidence of the efficacy of this intervention and examine the role of a parent/caregiver training component in treating children aged 2:6 to 7:11 with congenital Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS). In addition, our research team will determine whether direct caregiver training provides a significant advantage over indirect caregiver involvement.
The present study is a multisite randomized control trial (RCT) that aims to investigate the impact of parent/caregiver involvement on DTTC treatment outcomes in children with CAS. This proposed work is multisite parallel-group randomized control trial (RCT) that aims to investigate the impact of parent/caregiver involvement on DTTC treatment outcomes in children with CAS. Participants will be seen in two groups: 1) Direct Training Group (DTTC + Home Practice + Direct Caregiver Training); 2) Indirect Training Group (DTTC + Home Practice + Indirect Caregiver Training).
The DTTC plus Home Practice plus Direct Caregiver Training Group will receive DTTC treatment for 16 sessions (8 weeks) over 20 treatment words. Additionally, direct coaching from the SLP will be provided during half of each 30-minute treatment session. Treatment will be implemented with the involvement of parents/caregivers as the primary practitioner during home practice sessions during the 4-week follow-up period.
The DTTC plus Home Practice plus Indirect Caregiver Training Group will receive DTTC treatment for 16 sessions (8 weeks) over 20 treatable words. Indirect training will be used during half of each 30-minute treatment session, in which treatment will be implemented with the support of parents/caregivers, who will receive online guidance from the SLP. Treatment will be implemented with the involvement of parents/caregivers, who will receive online guidance from the SLP, during home practice sessions during the 4-week follow-up period.
Hundred children with CAS and their primary caregivers will be randomized between the two study arms. Each child will complete 4 probe sessions (overall time commitment of approximately 3.5 hours) at 5 different time points (Pre-treatment, Post-treatment, and 1-week and 4-week follow-up). In this study, the effect of parent/caregiver training and treatment delivery on the progress of participants with CAS will be quantified and reported."

There is currently no organized social support for patients undergoing laryngectomy. Some organizations such as Chant pour Vivre offer psychological care through the organization of meetings. Laryngical cancer is one of the top ten cancers in France and one of the deadliest cancers due to its early dissemination and late diagnoses. The consequences of total laryngectomy are multiple: loss of phonation (voice) and need to learn to speak again through speech therapy; Disappearance of oral-nasal breathing (and therefore loss of smell, or even taste); Disappearance of the capacity of the effort with closed glottis (used in the acts of daily life: defecation, sexual act in men, etc.); Impairment of body image and sometimes self-esteem. These consequences impact patients' quality of life. A survey carried out by the University Hospital of Dijon and Lyon showed that the disappearance of voice had significant consequences on self-esteem. These patients then need adapted care. The ENT department of the Bichat hospital performs an average of fourteen surgeries of total laryngectomy per year over the last three years. The direct consequences of total laryngectomy are multiple: loss of phonation (voice) and need to learn to speak again through speech therapy; Disappearance of oral-nasal breathing (and therefore loss of smell, or even taste); Disappearance of the capacity of the effort with closed glottis (used in the acts of daily life: defecation, sexual act in men, etc.); Impairment of body image and sometimes self-esteem. For these reasons, it is essential to accompany patients post-operative to help them understand their body image and mitigate the direct and indirect consequences of this intervention. To support laryngectomized patients, the study will test and validate the creation of self-help and support groups. The study will include laryngectomized patients who wish and can participate in these groups. The sessions will take place as follows: 1st: presentation of each, answers to questions; 2nd: intervention of the association of the mutilated of the voice; 3rd: questions / answers with a resource patient (laryngectomized for 13 years at Bichat hospital), groups are planned after the third session: these groups will gather each of the four groups to evaluate the satisfaction of patients regarding the program. In order to assess the benefit of these meetings, two specific questionnaires will be given to patients before the first session and retrieved beforehand. The WHOQOL-BREF is a global quality of life questionnaire. It contains 26 subjects that can be grouped, with a score from zero to 100 in each group, and a total score where the scores in the four groups were joined and divided by four to obtain an overall score ranging from 26 to 130 . The EORTC QLQH&n43 is an ENT-specific quality of life questionnaire. It assesses the effect of hearing loss or deafness on various levels of life. It also assesses the impact of laryngectomy on quality of life. These questionnaires are accompanied by a free text part, so that the person fills in the keys that the workshops have brought him. Patients who cannot participate in the exchange groups for geographical or personal reasons will constitute a control group. They will also complete the two questionnaires four months apart. The number of patients registered and the participation rate at each session will be evaluated."

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common condition affecting around 7% to 10% of women of reproductive age.  PCOS is a complex condition that includes reproductive issues, such as irregular menstruation or anovulation (absence of ovulation), acne, and increased body hair. In addition to the physical symptoms, women with PCOS commonly experience psychological stress, depression, anxiety, and reduced self-esteem.  To identify ways to help better understand PCOS, help treat symptoms of the condition, researchers propose using a questionnaire survey that is available 24/7.

Inclusion Criteria:  Inclusion criteria are those diagnosed with PCOS by a health professional, self-diagnosed with PCOS or individuals with PCOS symptoms.  Exclusion Criteria: Unable to understand the surveys or what is being asked, unwilling to sign the consent."

The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of an automated algorithm aimed at speeding up the diagnosis and treatment of patients with thrombotic microangiopathies at two different hospitals. The automated algorithm will be triggered when specific clinical parameters are detected by the system. Patients will be followed-up for 24 months after they have been discharged from the hospital. The study will evaluate how long it takes for doctors to make a diagnosis and begin specific treatment procedures. It is hypothesized that the use of this algorithm will significantly decrease the time to diagnosis and the length of hospital stay. The results of the study will help to determine the clinical utility of using the algorithm to help diagnose this condition among smaller hospitals in which the care providers may lack awareness of TMA or a 24-hour hematological guard service."

A new innovative fountain faucet will be designed that will allow individuals with spinal cord injuries (SCI), particularly those living with quadriplegia, to access water more independently for basic activities of daily living such as drinking, rinsing, and grooming. The faucet will incorporate electromechanical controls and software programs to adjust spray outlets, spray angles, and water temperatures. A proximity sensor and voice recognition function will allow users to control the faucet through a smart speaker. The faucet design will include a camera and other sensors to enable hands-free operation of the faucet. The investigators expect that the new fountain faucet will enhance the independence and quality of life of individuals with SCI through the following aims: (1) test control of water streams via motion, voice, and eye gaze control sensors; and (2) develop standardized outcome measures for the control of water streams via fountain faucets for activities of daily living such as drinking, rinsing, and grooming. Testing will be done at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KWI) in Baltimore, MD. Forty-five able-bodied control subjects will perform task-based activities such as drinking and rinsing using a fountain faucet. Testing will focus on individuals who live with quadriplegia or tetraplegia to assess the feasibility of using the fountain faucet for daily activities and to develop a system usability scale (SUS) to evaluate the usability of the fountain faucet. Outcome measures for the control of water streams will be developed to measure the subject's independence level for hydration and grooming in daily life."

Post-secondary student mental health is crucial; however, there exist significant barriers in achieving equitable access to mental healthcare. These barriers include but are not limited to geographical distance from mental health services, long wait times for mental health appointments, social stigma associated with mental health services, and financial constraints. In response to these barriers, the proposed research project aims to create an online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT program that is accessible, cost-effective, and efficient. The goal of this project is to create an online mental healthcare resource that is not only scalable but also can be easily integrated into existing care models.

The project aims to create a comprehensive care model guided by a robust delivery of a seven-pronged mental healthcare hub (pre-adoption, delivery, post-adoption phases of the hub). The study will assess the current mental healthcare landscape and needs of post-secondary students through surveys and focus groups. The information gained from surveys and focus groups will be used in the development of 6-week online psychoeducation and 12-week diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs (guided by Aim 2 and Aim 3).

The psychoeducation program will be followed by 6 months of online journaling exercises. If the AI algorithm detects a psychiatric disorder (Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD), or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)) during the journaling exercises, the algorithm will make a referral to the relevant diagnosis-specific e-CBT program. Each e-CBT program will involve 12 weekly modules and homework, followed by 6 months of follow-up assessments.

This study will have three aims: Aim 1 will assess post-secondary student mental health needs through surveys and focus groups. Aims 2 and 3 will use the information from surveys and focus groups to develop 6-week online psychoeducation and 12-week diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs. Aims 4 and 5 will determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs by comparing them to treatment as usual. Aims 6 and 7 will use the collected data to monitor the success and fidelity of the programs. If this study finds the programs to be efficacious, the findings will significantly improve post-secondary student mental healthcare services in Ontario, and potentially Canada. We anticipate that our mental healthcare hub will support a range of mental health services; for example, the hub can function as a stand-alone service for individuals who do not have access to mental health specialists in the local community or can easily complement existing community services to improve access to care.

The proposed project aligns with the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada Competition-based Medical Education (CBME) program that requires medical students to participate in the development of a new care program before its implementation. Additionally, this project aligns with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Fundamental Research (FR) program, which aims to find basic, early-stage knowledge that will inform our understanding of the origins and nature of psychological distress and its impact on individuals, groups, and populations in Canadian communities.

In conclusion, this proposed research project will significantly contribute to accessible and efficient mental healthcare services in Ontario, Canada. With the implementation of the mental healthcare hub, our proposed research project will improve psychiatric care for post-secondary students in Ontario, and potentially other Canadian municipalities."

Background: Warts are caused by viral infection with human papillomavirus (HPV). They are benign growths of skin and mucous (wet warts) that are contagious and can spread to other areas of the body by touch transmission. Warts can be treated with antiviral or cytotoxic agents, but these treatments are associated with significant side effects and are costly.
Objective: The aim of the study is to assess the efficacy of antiviral ointment (AV2) in combination with Salicylic acid (SA) for treatment of the most common wart type (cutaneous warts). This is a phase II randomized open-label study with an investigator-masked end-point, comparing the standard of care (100% SA) versus AV2-SA treatment.
Methods: Eighty patients with 113 cutaneous warts will be enrolled; of these, 44 patients will receive the AV2-SA treatment, and 36 patients will receive standard SA treatment. All patients are given WhatsApp to upload photos of the warts once weekly for follow-up. Treatment efficacy of both treatments will be assessed by cure rates.
Discussion: No prior studies have investigated the efficacy of AV2-SA combined therapy for cutaneous warts. This study will provide important insights for the treatment of cutaneous warts and help determine whether this new combination therapy is superior to standard SA treatment in patients with multiple or persistent cutaneous warts. The study will potentially impact patient quality of life by offering an alternative that is readily available and cost-effective."

Human chorionic gonadotropin is produced in the trophoblast at the time of implantation and rapidly rises during the first 2 weeks of pregnancy. However, if the pregnancy implanted outside of the uterus, hCG will increase even when the pregnancy is abnormal. Therefore, the best method of detecting and confirming ectopic pregnancy is measuring the beta subunit of hCG, called beta hCG (ßhCG). Treating ectopic pregnancy is a routine obstetrical practice, and most patients, except those with ruptured ectopic pregnancy, are treated with methotrexate. Many studies have shown that methotrexate can be applied in 85-97% cases with good response. However, the complications of treatment, such as infection, adverse reactions to methotrexate, and drug refractoriness, have increased the search for alternative medications. Letrozole is a drug that has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced breast cancer and breast cancer. Letrozole inhibits the production of estrogen and is used in obese, postmenopausal patients. It was reported in some studies that letrozole will lead to decreased pregnancy in the ovary. By blocking the synthesis of estrogen and progesterone, letrozole can reduce the levels of hCG in the blood. Based on the information mentioned above, we believe that in this study to assess the efficacy of letrozole in management of ectopic pregnancy, the first group will receive a single dose (50 mg/m2) of methotrexate. The beta-hcg level is measured on the first day, and the hcg serum level is routinely measured on the fourth, seventh and fourteenth day. The second group will receive letrozole is given in the form of 2.5 mg tablets twice a day for 10 days. And on the fourth, seventh and fourteenth day, the HCG level is measured. And the third group will receive letrozole is given in the form of 2.5 mg tablets 3 times a day for 5 days, and hCG levels are measured on days 4, 7, and 14. Based on the results of this study, it is desired to examine the efficacy of letrozole for treatment of ectopic pregnancy compared to methotrexate."

The main objective of this trial is to compare the effectiveness of whole-body hypothermia with 33.5 ±0.5°C versus targeted normothermia with 36.5±0.5°C in mild encephalopathy.
The hypothesis is that the two treatment approaches would not differ in clinical outcomes while targeted normalization of temperature may be a safer approach to achieving temperature goals, with the potential to decrease risks associated with hypothermia.
The rationale for the trial is to establish if the new treatment approach of targeted normalization of temperature is as effective as whole body hypothermia in this specific population of babies at high risk of neuro-developmental impairment. 
The primary outcome of the trial will be cognitive outcomes at 2 years of age assessed using the standard Bayley assessment tool commonly used for this purpose. This tool provides information about the presence of, and the severity of, cognitive impairment in children."

Background: Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase reactant predominantly produced in the liver in response to systemic inflammation, tissue damage and infection, mainly by bacterial endotoxins. In idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), serum concentrations of SAA are associated with disease severity, progressive fibrosis and worse prognosis. In sarcoidosis, serum concentrations of SAA are increased in extra-thoracic disease, and are correlated with disease severity, but it is unknown whether SAA is a specific marker of thoracic sarcoidosis. Our aim is to investigate the role of SAA in the diagnosis and follow-up of intrathoracic sarcoidosis.
Objective: Main objectives of the current research are: 
- Determining the mean serum concentration of SAA at the time of diagnosis and during follow-up in sarcoidosis patients and compare these concentrations to controls.
- Investigating if serum concentrations of SAA in intrathoracic sarcoidosis corelate with disease activity and extent, and correlate with changes in disease extent and lung function tests during follow-up.
- Evaluate if serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis correlate with the need for therapy and the progression towards extra-thoracic disease.
Methods: This is a single center case series study in sarcoidosis patients, with a control group consisting of healthy volunteers.
The study is conducted at the Pulmonary Department at the Ghent University Hospital.
Study population: Sarcoidosis patients newly diagnosed will be included, according to the ATS/ERS/WASOG criteria, at the time of first diagnostic work-up and before any treatment was initiated. Healthy controls, matched for age and sex will also be included.
Study variables: Demographic variables, medical history, past medical treatments, results of lung function tests and chest HRCT, and serum concentration of CXCL9, CCL18, chitotriosidase and SAA will be collected at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis. Follow-up will be performed after one year and three years.
Study arms: Intrathoracic sarcoidosis cohort (interventional group).
Inclusion criteria: above 18 years of age, newly diagnosed with intrathoracic sarcoidosis according to ESR/WASOG criteria, and able to understand the purpose and possible consequences of the study.
Exclusion criteria: individuals with granulomatous disease that could not be unequivocally diagnosed as sarcoidosis were excluded, as well as patients with possible confounding other known systemic inflammatory illnesses, acute infection, patients on immunosuppressive drugs or immunotherapy and patients with active cancer.
Design: To examine the role of SAA in the diagnosis and follow-up of intrathoracic sarcoidosis, as well as its role in the determination of disease severity, progression and response to therapy in intrathoracic sarcoidosis, 200 patients with recently diagnosed intrathoracic sarcoidosis will be included and compared with 200 healthy controls in a period of 2-3 years.
During initial diagnostic work-up, baseline blood sample will be drawn from the patient to determine the initial serum concentration of SAA. Patients will be followed up after one year and three years to analyze the impact of SAA on disease progression and response to therapy.
Blood samples will be taken from patients and healthy controls. Blood and serum samples will be stored and used for the biomarker analysis.
Primary outcome measures:
- The correlation of mean serum concentration of serum amyloid A (SAA) in patients, newly diagnosed with intrathoracic sarcoidosis to mean value in healthy controls.
- The correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis with serum concentrations of other biomarkers of granulomatous inflammation and pulmonary interstitial disease.
- Correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to pulmonary function test results.
- Correlation of serum concentrations of SAA at the time of diagnosis of intrathoracic sarcoidosis to radiologic extent of disease.

Pregnancy rates after embryo transfer by frozen technology remain modest in the absence of a previous biopsy of the embryo (8-20%), with no increase in multiple pregnancies. The lack of progesterone priming of the uterus before embryo transfer could be a factor of low embryo implantation and pregnancy rates. The objective of this clinical trial is to test whether introducing a first culture medium into the uterine cavity prior to embryo transfer, in a population of patients not primed with progesterone, results in a significant increase in pregnancy rates. A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial conducted in 15 IVF centers in France will compare the pregnancy rates of a standard embryo transfer with those of an immediate embryo transfer after introduction of blank culture medium into the uterine cavity."

Acute lower back pain is one of the most prevalent health problems and causes disability and impaired ability to perform daily activities. When the research is examined, it is understood that about 70% of the population experiences back pain at some point during their lives. This rate is high in women who have experienced a cesarean delivery and who have experienced a cesarean delivery in the late postpartum period. As a result, the economic burden on the health system increases with these patients. Acupressure is an ancient and safe treatment method that has been used traditionally in the treatment of pain and other symptoms. This application has been accepted in developed countries, and randomized controlled studies also report that this application is used in the treatment of various diseases. It is known that acupressure has some positive effects on pain management. This study was planned to examine the effect of acupressure on back pain in the late postpartum period after cesarean section. The aim was to see whether there was a difference in the reduction of back pain in the cesarean section group who received acupressure treatment in the late postpartum period. It is aimed to determine if the study meets the primary outcome, whether there is a difference in the reduction of late postpartum lumbar pain in puerperal women who received acupressure treatment after cesarean delivery, and secondary outcomes between groups. It is planned to apply to 70 participants from different family health centers in the first day of the late postpartum period (between 7-15 days) before and after the application. It is thought that acupressure is a potential and cost-effective method in the treatment of back pain in the late postpartum period."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of serotonin on cardiovascular function in the context of septic shock. The investigators hypothesize that, by reducing serotonin, vasopressor drugs use can be reduced without worsening organ function or mortality. A double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial will be realized to assess the effect of serotonin removal on the vasopressor requirement. Vasopressor use will be recorded 24 hours apart, between enrollment and ICU discharge or death. Paroxetine will be started at a dose of 40mg/day, once a day for 5 consecutive days or until removal of all vasopressors at a stable dose for 48 hours or until shock resolution. Admission and outcome measures will be evaluated to assess mortality, need for mechanical ventilation, number of days and ICU stay after the end of vasopressor use.
Inclusion criteria:
Inclusion Criteria: Patient over 18 years of age; Patient diagnosed with septic shock for less than 48 hours and using a minimum dose of noradrenaline (0.01 mcg/kg/min); Patients and/or legal guardians who consented to participate in the study through the free and informed consent term before randomization.
Exclusion Criteria:
Pregnant women; Patients with inability to use the gastrointestinal tract; Patients with known intolerance to paroxetine and/or fluoxetine; Patients on concomitant use of medications that may potentiate the occurrence of serotonin syndrome (tramadol, citalopram, escitalopram, sertraline, desvenlafaxine, venlafaxine, duloxetine, sibutramine, bupropion, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, lithium); Patients in end-of-life care or with an expected survival of less than 24 hours at the time of eligibility."

Cardiomyopathy, or heart muscle disease, is a serious condition occurring in patients with Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy where insoluble amyloid protein causes damage to the heart muscle, leading to left ventricular dysfunction or heart failure. Tafamidis, a medicine which stabilizes the damaged protein and prevents it from forming in the body, has been shown to safely reduce the risk of death and hospitalizations related to cardiac events, such as heart failure, in patients at risk in a global population. To further understand the safety of Tafamidis in patients in India and to ensure its continued use for patients with Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy, a post-marketing surveillance study called ATTR-CM VyndaMx® Registry Study (Registry Study) will be conducted. Patients who are already treated with Tafamidis, or about to start treatment with Tafamidis in the course of treatment would be eligible for this registry study. The study aims to enroll up to 600 patients in order to study the number of adverse events or undesirable effects related to the ongoing use of Tafamidis in the population. The investigators would collect data on the number of adverse events while the patients are on tafamidis treatment. The study type is observational and all the patients would be treated with tafamidis as part of routine clinical practice. No additional interventions or treatments would be done as this is not a controlled trial. Therefore the patients would not face any major restrictions or changes in their treatment plans or activities. The study is intended to gain further insights into the safety of tafamidis in the existing population suffering from Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy.

Background: 
Median sternotomy is required as part of many cardiac surgical interventions, such as valve replacement, coronary artery bypass grafting, and heart transplantation. It is associated with serious complications, such as sternal instability and nonunion, especially in patients with risk factors for those conditions. These can result in postoperative pain and limited physical function, prolonged hospital stay, and even re-intervention. Several devices have been developed to secure the sternal closure and prevent complications however they are not widely used mainly due to their cumbersome configuration.
Therefore, the main objective of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy of the STERN FIX sternal closure device, in terms of sternal stabilization, with the standard of care sternal closure method, and to assess both their impact on postoperative pain and patient’s quality of life. 
Methods: 
This multi-center randomized controlled clinical trial will be conducted in 3 Brazilian hospitals. A total of 150 patients will be allocated to one of the two treatment groups:
Group A (intervention) will receive a combination of STERN FIX devices and wires to close the median sternotomy.
Group B (control) will receive the standard of care sternal closure method, only wires.
The primary outcome will be sternal stability, assessed by a dedicated clinical scale during regular patient follow-up. Secondary outcomes will include safety, sternal nonunion or malunion, sternotomy closure time, chest pain, hospital length of stay, blood loss, upper limbs functional index, quality of life, sternal halves union assessment, sternal halves alignment assessment, sternum integrity assessment, sterotomy closure system integrity assessment, among others.
Statistical Analysis: 
A sample of 150 patients, divided into 2 groups (A, B), with 75 patients in each, will be required to obtain a statistical power of 80%, with a significance level of 5%, and an estimated prevalence of main outcomes of approximately 10-15%. A Cox-Mantel chi-square (or Fisher’s exact test) will be used to compare categorical outcomes and the effect-size will be reported as the odds ratio with its 95% confidence interval. Chi-square test will be used for associations between proportions considering a 5% significance level. Continuous data will be compared using Student’s t- or Mann-Whitney U- tests.
Study Impact: 
The results of this study will provide important data regarding the safety and efficacy of a new sternal closure system. If proven efficacious, it may significantly reduce healthcare costs due to fewer revision surgeries, decrease pain and improve quality of life for patients.

Musculoskeletal discomfort, including low back pain (LBP), is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders and today it is known that the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the prevalence and intensity of LBP. This may be explained by the prolonged sitting time. Most people sit for a long hours in a slumped sitting posture. Prolonged sitting causes changes in the passive structures of the spine and induces a low back compressive load significantly higher than that observed in standing.
Physiotherapists recommend many different sitting positions to prevent and treat negative effects of prolonged sitting. However, there is debate regarding what is an optimal sitting posture. Periodic rest breaks have been identified as a way to reduce self-report discomfort at the low back.
The main goal of this study is to evaluate the effect of active break on reduce LBP and perceived musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting in young people with LBP. Research outcomes will be developed to match the needs of young people with LBP and the possibilities of the environment and subsequently reduce LBP and musculoskeletal discomfort during prolonged sitting, and maintain health and quality of life."

The aim of this study is to evaluate the correlation between hematocrit to haemoglobin ratio (HCT/Hb) and Red blood cell distribution Width (RDW) as markers of disease severity and the expression of erythropoietin in Polycythemia Vera (PV) disease. 150 patients will be selected in the Polycythemia Vera department in Sohag University hospital from December 2022 to September 2023. It will be a prospective analytic study in case and control arm. Patients with secondary erythrocytosis will be included as controls and will be recruited from Sohag university hospital and the control group will consist of 50 subjects. Clinical data will be collected from all patients including the level of hematocrit (HCT) and HAEMATOCRIT TO HAEMOGLOBIN RATIO and Red blood cell distribution Width (RDW). Data analysis will be done by 2 sample independent t test or 1 sample t test. Chi square test will be done to compare the distribution of qualitative variables in both group and compare the mean in each group. In this study a significant increase in Hematocrit to Haemoglobin ratio and increased values of Red blood cell distribution Width (RDW) were observed to be significantly higher in polypoid hyperplasia compared to the nonpolypoid and normal groups that was statistically highly significant. The same increase was observed in the polypoid hyperplasia PV group compared to secondary erythrocytosis non polypoid hyperplasia which was statistically significant. It was concluded that Hematocrit to Haemoglobin Ratio and Red blood cell distribution Width increased in both disease and that the same increase was found in disease polypoid hyperplasia compared to the secondary erythrocytosis non polypoid hyperplasia while there was a highly statistically significant increase in Hematocrit to haemoglobine ratio and significant increase in Red blood cell distribution Width as compared to polypoid hyperplasia."

The relationship between the perfusion index and the emergency triage classification in patients with dyspnea will be examined through the use of the Perfusion Index, which is a non-invasive peripheral perfusion measurement and has a high negative predictive value in the rule-out of acute coronary syndrome.
In the past 5 years many studies have been published in the literature investigating the role of the perfusion rate in the prediction of myocardial injury in the differential diagnostic triad of dyspnea: DIL, pneumonia, acute coronary syndrome. In these studies, Pulse CO-Oximeter is the most widely used non-invasive method to measure the level of end organ perfusion of peripheral tissues. One study published in 2015 showed that at the time of admission to the emergency room, even if the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome is made, the perfusion levels measured with the pulse CO-Oximeter do not change or decrease. There is no data on the relationship of the perfusion index with the triage classification of patients admitted to the emergency room with signs and symptoms of dyspnea.
Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the effect of perfusion index measurement on the triage status of patients with dyspnea."

End-stage illness is associated with physical, psychological as well as social consequences that often lead to considerable limitations in quality of life (QoL). Palliative care aims to identify and alleviate such limitations with targeted treatment approaches in order to improve QoL and reduce health care costs. Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), a psychedelic drug, has been proven to improve psychological distress (anxiety, depression), psychological burden and reduce opioid use in healthy subjects or healthy cancer survivors in controlled laboratory studies as well as in terminally ill cancer patients in pilot studies. The present study is designed as a randomized, double-blind, active-placebo-controlled phase II study and aims to estimate the benefit-risk-profile of two low doses of LSD (100 or 200 μg oral solution) applied in two sessions over a distance of two weeks compared with an active placebo in subjects with physical deterioration in their last phase of life. The design includes a main efficacy endpoint - changes in state anxiety assessed by questionnaire (state anxiety inventory, STAI-S) compared with active placebo - as well as a number of secondary efficacy endpoints, such as changes in pain level, opioid use, spiritual well-being, demoralization, QoL as well as changes in psychological distress assessed using questionnaires, qualitative interview, and psychometric rating scales. Moreover, the study includes patient's behaviour and attitudes rated by community observers, caregiver burden, adverse events, and measures recording acute effects of LSD as well as psychological changes after both acute and after long-lasting treatment effects.
Furthermore, a comprehensive collection of safety measures, such as vital signs, physical and general discomfort, as well as a detailed assessment of the participants' social situations are monitored. The investigators expect that in subjects with physical deterioration in the last phase of life, low doses of LSD - if administered in a safe and controlled fashion in a medical environment under supervision of specialized medical staff - may be an efficient and safe treatment option that can improve the psychological health of these individuals, leading to a better QoL, a reduction in the caregivers’ burden and an increase in end-of-life satisfaction. The present study will provide important valuable information for clinical practice."

Pregnancy is a period during which one's daily habits, including diet, physical activity, tobacco use, and other behaviours that can impact prenatal care attendance can change to affect maternal and infant outcomes. The text-based app SmartMom, used in the first study, aims to improve prenatal care attendance and promote healthy behaviours during pregnancy. SmartMom provides evidence-based information about the importance of specific health behaviours for pregnancy, and it has successfully improved prenatal care attendance and birth outcomes in a previous study. However, its content may not fully address all healthy behaviours and topics of interest for all pregnant persons. Therefore, it is unclear whether additional text streams tailored to specific needs would further improve maternal and infant outcomes.
The investigators aim to test an expanded version of SmartMom that includes five (5) additional streams of content to address specific concerns: mental health (in particular postpartum depression), excessive weight gain, older age at the time of birth, excessive alcohol use, and use of prescription opioids and non-prescription pain medication in the third trimester. The investigators will compare the expanded SmartMom intervention to a placebo-like control program and to the standard SmartMom program.
The investigators aim to conduct a follow-up study to a previously reported trial. Participants in the current study will receive one of three text-based programs: standard SmartMom messaging, expanded SmartMom messaging, or control messaging. The investigators will conduct a mixed-methods, randomized, controlled trial of 3200 patients with a singleton pregnancy at 15 weeks or earlier. SmartMom and control text messages will be sent to participants three times per week from the beginning of pregnancy until 38 weeks of gestation; expanded SmartMom text messages will be sent beginning at 20 weeks of gestation in participants with a higher-than-minimal BMI, postpartum depression symptomatology, prescription opioid or anti-inflammatory use, older maternal age, and excessive alcohol use in the previous 3 months. The investigators will evaluate the differences in primary and secondary outcomes between the groups."
