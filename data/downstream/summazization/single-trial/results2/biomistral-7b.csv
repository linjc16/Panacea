The study utilized data from patients who were treated for HNSCC at five different centers. A total of 1,050 patients were included in the study, 449 radiologists from 16 different countries reviewed the case images in an attempt to discern the presence of ENE and whether extranodal extension on imaging could help predict outcomes in patients with HNSCC. The results showed that radiologists who scored extranodal extension on imaging well enough to classify disease with high accuracy, overall survival outcomes were independent of ENE on imaging in the presence of HPV. This study shows that radiologists can accurately predict HNSCC prognosis and treatment success without the need for invasive biopsies or nodal surgery. The study also points to the importance of incorporating PET/CT into the imaging workup, particularly for advanced staged disease. Overall, the study demonstrated the importance of incorporating standardized diagnostic classification systems to identify ENE on imaging, and that radiologists can reliably determine HNSCC prognosis through the use of such systems."

68,"[/INST] Summary: This is a randomized clinical study to identify predictive markers to offer patients with less invasive treatments for HPV+ head and neck cancer. HPV+ and HPV- head and neck cancers need to be treated differently. HPV+ is more sensitive to chemotherapy, while HPV- is more sensitive to radiation treatment. However, both types of cancer are treated the same. The study was conducted to find genes and other changes in them that can be responsible for the difference between HPV+ and HPV- head and neck cancers. The tests for this study included genetic tests such as real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and immunolabeling. The tests were performed on biopsies or tumor samples obtained during surgery. The test results found differences in two genes between HPV+ and HPV- head and neck cancers. This study recommends conducting further research to confirm its findings and test the effectiveness of the new treatment strategies for head and neck cancers."

110,"[/INST] In this study, the platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) were assessed as predictors of SBP treatment response in patients with cirrhosis who had developed spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). This was a prospective cohort study that enrolled 158 patients. The platelets-lymphocytes ratio on day 1 of hospital admission was significantly higher in patients who responded to treatment than in those who failed to. Furthermore, patients who responded to therapy had higher mean MLR than patients who failed to respond .The platelet to lymphocyte ratio is expected to increase as a result of treatment. Treatment-related improvements could be due to the suppression of platelet production. When compared to those who are responsive to therapy, patients who are non-responsive to therapy do not have higher mean MLR. This difference could be due to the use of treatment in non-response treatment patients, while responding to treatment. The study’s findings indicate that the PLR and MLR measurements on the first day of hospitalization can be used to predict treatment response and that non-responder patients have a significantly higher mean MLP than responsive patients."

285,"[/INST] The purpose of this study is to develop a novel, personalized biomarker based on cell-free virus-host chimera DNA (vh-DNA) for both early evaluation of the therapeutic response and future monitoring of HBV-related HCC patients who receive radiotherapy. To achieve this, the team will retrospectively review previously collected serum samples from eligible patients for molecular analyses and then perform a prospective study to test the feasibility and value of the proposed vh-DNA biomarker. HCC is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths associated with high recurrence and metastasis rates 3. Radiotherapy is a useful treatment for patients with HCC, but its effectiveness and long-term outcomes are affected by several factors, including early prediction of treatment response, early diagnosis of tumor recurrence, and identification of the correct target of a de-novo HCC tumor 1. In recent years, the use of tissue or blood testing to find a reliable biomarker for HCC has attracted increasing attention. The proposed vh-DNA biomarker combines the properties of HBV integration by capturing the junction sequence DNA in cancer tumor tissues and the specificity of ctDNA mutations that can be identified by targeted sequencing. The ability to capture junction-specific sequence DNA 4 and the low rate of HBV genome insertion into the human genome make vh-DNA as a biomarker a viable option 5. The investigator will explore the clonality of both primary and recurrent tumors to provide a rationale for changing clinical practice from an HBV single gene to a HBV multi-gene or multi-mutation profile of HCC. These methods aim to improve the ability to identify the correct target for de-novo HCC tumors and the accuracy of predicting progression-free and overall survival and developing appropriate salvage treatments to improve clinical outcomes. The results of this study will provide a strong scientific foundation for the practical clinical application of ctDNA markers beyond the current state of the art."

The study will examine the correlation between BMD and gross motor function in patients with CP. Gross motor function will be assessed using the gross motor function measure (GMFM) scale, and BMD and biochemical markers will be measured using DXA. The study will also evaluate the relationship between gross motor function and quality of life. The effect of different treatment plans on BMD, gross motor function, and quality of life will be assessed. We hypothesize that DXA scans and BMD levels will decrease as the age at CP diagnosis increases and that they will increase as a result of medical intervention. This is the first study to assess the impact of gross motor function and bone weakness on quality of life in children with CP. The correlation between gross motor performance and bone status, and the effect of DXA on motor function and quality of life may be used to make adjustments to treatment plans and inform future rehabilitation efforts."""

356,"[/INST] The report provides information about the methods and procedures followed in a surgical trial. The trial uses a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design that compares two techniques for neobladder creation in patients undergoing robotic radical cystectomy. The neobladder is an artificial bladder created during the procedure that the patient will eventually use to urinate. The trial compares two surgical techniques: one in which a stent is left inside the neobladder and one in which no stent is left inside the neobladder. The goal of leaving a stent inside the neobladder is to reduce the risk of obstruction in the neobladder, which can lead to urinary stone formation, urosepsis, or other complications. Robotic radical cystectomy is a type of surgery in which a surgeon working at a console controls robotic arms that operate on the patient. The trial was conducted in Italy over the course of several years. The trial enrolled 184 patients and randomized them to the two treatment groups. The trial found that there was no significant difference in complications and functional outcomes between the two treatment groups, and concluded that the stentless neobladder creation technique is a safe and feasible surgical alternative to the stented technique."

The study will characterize the biomechanical coupling of brain and skull in 25 patients with mTBI and TME, 25 patients with mTBI and no TME and 25 healthy controls with no history of mTBI or TME and additionally 10 healthy controls recruited for technical development of imaging protocols. The study will apply the MRE protocol to characterize the skull-brain interface in patients with, without a history of mild TBI and healthy controls, applying the MRE data to characterize the shear strain measures within cortex during MRE which would potentially reveal a mechanism for TME in patients with mTBI. All participants must be between the ages of 21 - 65 and may have history of TBI that was determined by CT scans with a mild Glasgow Coma Scale score of 13-15, less than 10 years from the time of injury. There are currently no studies that have been done specifically on meningeal enhancement in patients with mild traumatic brain injury. If meningeal enhancement is a mechanism in patients with mild traumatic brain injury and, could be a prognostic marker associated with poor outcome in patients with mild TBI the initial step would be the ability to detect the enhancement. The technology used in the study may identify the mechanism of meningeal enhancement and aid physicians in diagnosis and management of patients with mild traumatic brain injury. This can then be used in developing diagnostic and treatment based guidelines and clinical trials. The data generated from the study could further be applied to understand the impact of therapeutic interventions and their safety. However, the study does not claim to determine the treatment efficacy but offers a new technology for diagnosis and potential management of patients with mild traumatic brain injury."

The trial compared the effectiveness of lactulose versus 3L-polyethylene glycol (PEG) in patients with IBD undergoing a colonoscopy. The study enrolled eligible patients with a diagnosis of IBD by history, symptoms, endoscopy, radiology, pathology, and/or surgical history, regardless of whether they had been previously treated with steroids or aminosalicylates. Both interventions were administered twice in a randomized order, with a one-week time gap. The primary outcome was a greater effective preparation rate, defined by a Boston Bowel Preparation Scale score of ≥6 with partial scores of ≥2 in each colon segment. The secondary outcomes were assessed 2 hours after bowel preparation and included patient evaluation of the intervention's taste, the incidence of adverse events, effects on liver function assessed by total protein, albumin, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and effects on serum electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and chloride. Results were collected from 161 participants with mean age of 42.4 ± 15.9, of which 83.6% were White. Lactose was as effective as 3L-PEG, with similar incidence of adverse effects, including abdominal pain (15% and 35%, respectively), and similar patient assessment of taste of the intervention. Lactulose compared favorably with 3L-PEG when considering the ease of its administration and reduced cost. In conclusion, this study confirms that lactulose is a safe and effective alternative for bowel preparation in patients with IBD. The results suggest that lactulose is a more cost- and time-effective alternative to PEG that should be considered as a replacement of 3L-PEG for bowel preparation. Further studies are needed to assess long-term effects in a more varied group of IBD patients."

In summary, the trial is designed to compare the use of Dumpling sutures to traditional sutures for ileostomy following rectal cancer surgery, in terms of complications, quality of life and pain scores. In addition, a stoma complication severity score (14-item Stoma Discoloration, Erosion and Tissue overgrowth (DET) score) and daily functional quality of life scores are collected during the postoperative follow-up period. The trial is a single-center study, and the study intervention is limited to stoma formation. The primary outcome is the complication rate during a six-week postoperative period. The trial will be conducted in a group of patients who are likely to undergo rectal cancer surgery that requires the formation of an ileostomy. The authors have identified a problem with conventional suturing methods for forming an ileostomy and propose a new method of stoma fixation, known as the Dumpling suture. It involves a progressive reduction of the skin incision for ileostomy. The authors argue that the use of regular sutures for ileostomy formation can lead to wound leakage or other complications due to the skin reduction. The Dumpling method of suturing proposed by the authors can result in a reduction of skin incisions of up to 50% at the start, and a three-step process to reduce the size of the incision further. In the trial, 2 groups of participants will be randomly assigned to conventional suturing or Dumpling suturing. After the ileostomy, the participants will have regular follow up at 1 week intervals up to 6 weeks postoperatively. The trial will compare the two methods of suturing in terms of complications, quality of life and pain scores. According to the authors, the Dumpling suture method has the potential to result in fewer stoma complications due to reduced incision size at the ileostomy site. An analysis of the trial data will provide evidence for the effectiveness of the Dumpling suture method."

The combined treatment includes methotrexate and hysteroscopic curettage. In this study, participants were recruited who had a cesarean scar pregnancy (confirmed by ultrasound) and had increasing human chorionic gonadotropin concentrations. Exclusion criteria included: decreasing β-hCG, heterotopic pregnancy, and decreasing blood count. Women who were selected for this study were given letrozole as an add-on treatment to combined treatment or MTX monotherapy. Before the commencement of the treatment, and after one, four, and seven days, blood count was monitored. Additionally, blood tests for bilirubin, aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase, urea, and creatinine were carried out. After the combined treatment with or without letrozole, hysteroscopic curettage was performed to evacuate the uterus. The study was not placebo-controlled and randomized, and the results were reported from a small sample size of 33 patients. Thus, the level of evidence of this study was class IV. The authors reported a higher decrease in Hb concentration and blood loss during the hysteroscopic evacuation of the uterus in patients who had undergone combined treatment with letrozole. The letrozole treatment also resulted in low birth-weight babies due to the preterm deliveries. Since this study has shortcomings, such as, a small sample size, uncontrolled placebo use, no blinding, and open-label settings, the quality of evidence regarding the beneficial or detrimental effects of the letrozole add-on treatment is controversial. Therefore, further studies are needed to investigate the effects of letrozole as an add-on treatment to the combined treatment of cesarean scar pregnancies."

Inclusion criteria for the study are ASA I-II elective surgery, thoracic surgery requiring a left-sided double-lumen endobronchial tube, and signed informed consent for the study provided. Exclusion criteria are mouth opening <3 cm, previous history of difficult intubation, diseases affecting the upper respiratory tract and main bronchi, cardiac insufficiency, liver dysfunction, renal insufficient, previous stroke, a severe obstructive ventilatory dysfunction, bronchial asthma or airway hyperresponsiveness, prior participation in other clinical studies in the last 3 months, and an age below 18 and over 65. The double-lumen endobronchial tubes were inserted under general anesthesia by anesthetists involved in the study, and as soon as the patient's position changed from the supine to the lateral, a decision was made to disconnect the breathing circuit (intervention group) or leave the connection intact (control group). The position of the tube's balloon was monitored by an anesthesiologist, and the position of the tube (malposition or position <5 mm) was recorded before the disconnection, immediately after the change in position, and 1 minute after the start of single-lung ventilation. The study was designed to prevent, based on a 19.9% estimated malposition rate in the intervention group compared to an 8.8% malposition rate in the control group, with a desired effect size of 1.17 at a power level of 80% confidence with α=0.05. A total of 30 participants were required for both groups, and after the 59 drop-outs, the study ended. Malposition was defined as a shift of <5 mm from the position specified by the manufacturer, determined by a control check-radiograph. The study found no significant difference between the malposition rates in the groups, with 55% malposition in the intervention group and 40% malposition in the control group. The mean ± SD for the intervention group versus the control group were 2.16 ± 3.77 vs 1.49 ± 2.93, respectively. Of the 64 patients included in the study, 8 received additional adjustment for change in ventilatory settings for left-lung only, and they were excluded from analysis. The study concluded that disconnection of the breathing circuit did not have an effect on the malposition of the double-lumen endobronchial tube, based on the similar post-operative complications as well as the PACU length of stay measured in the intervention and control groups."

Problems such as spasticity, muscle weakness, and decreased joint range of motion may result. While rehabilitation is still in progress, studies show that muscle mass and functional abilities can improve. The trial will test the idea that starting a more intense rehabilitation program as soon as possible after the injury improves the chances of these improvements. The purpose of the research is to determine if initiating early locomotor training in patients with subacute and chronic spinal cord injuries can improve walking speed, walking distance, and the ability to live and function independently. The study plan proposes that participants will be randomly divided into two groups: those receiving a high level of assistance and those receiving no assistance or only a standard amount of assistance if needed."

704,"[/INST] Summary Text: Feasibility Trial of Preoperative 5-Day Hypofractionated Radiotherapy for Primary Soft Tissue Sarcoma . Tumors of the soft tissues, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma , can affect various regions of the body, including the limbs, abdomen, and chest wall. These sarcomas can be challenging to manage because they do not respond well to traditional treatment methods, such as chemotherapy. Radiation therapy has often been used as an alternative or adjuvant therapeutic modality, but conventional radiotherapy (CRT) is time-consuming and requires multiple fractions per day over a period of several weeks. This can be especially burdensome for patients with extremity soft tissue sarcomas who must endure daily treatments and their potential side effects . As a result, hypofractionated radiotherapy (HFRT) has been proposed as a more convenient and efficient alternative to CRT. HFRT involves delivering a higher radiation dose per fraction but over a shorter duration than conventional radiotherapy. Studies have shown that it can be as effective as CRT in treating soft tissue sarcomas while minimizing the burden on patients . This clinical trial aims to investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of HFRT in managing soft tissue sarcomas, such as rhabdomyosarcoma and liposarcoma. The study will examine participants' response to HFRT, with the primary outcome being the feasibility rate of HFRT. The secondary outcomes include the proportion of participants with a favorable pathologic response, with low major wound complications, and 1-year local control rate. Overall, this trial could provide valuable insights into the potential benefits and drawbacks of HFRT for the management of soft tissue sarcomas."

Patients over the age of 18 years diagnosed with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) with a maximum retinal detachment of less than half of the globe and without proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) of grade C3 or higher participated in the trial. Two of 4 arms in each group contained PPV combined with SB, while the other two arms contained PPV with gas tamponade. Patients were enrolled by 28 centres in 5 countries. All participants received some form of vitrectomy procedure and were followed up for at least 5 years. The study's primary endpoint was the single surgery anatomic success, defined as the status of no longer requiring additional surgery due to recurrent RRD. At the completion of the study, it was found that the primary endpoint of anatomic success differed insignificantly in all four arms. The incidence of laser retinopexy was lower in two PPV & Gas Tamponade arms. The quality-of-life (QoL) score was higher in the two PPV & Gas Tamponade groups. No differences were seen in other endpoints such as visual acuity improvement or number of complications."

739,"[/INST] Very Short Course Versus Standard Course Antibiotics in Patients With Cholangitis Study is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, non-inferiority clinical trial. Acute cholangitis is a complication of biliary diseases that occurs at a rate of 462 per 100,000 person-years in the Netherlands and most commonly treated by short course antibiotics. However, there is currently no evidence to support the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for acute cholangitis. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the shorter duration of antibiotic antibiotics on the relapse of infection with a duration of no more than 24 hours, compared to standard (4-7 days) antibiotic treatment. Moreover, this study aims to evaluate the safety of the very short duration of antibiotics compared to the standard duration, including adverse events such as recurrence of infection, worsening of initial infection, and the emergence of antibiotic resistance. The findings of this study could enable the provision of a precise and evidence-based recommendation for the optimal duration of antibiotic therapy for acute cholangitis. The study is scheduled to recruit from 641 to 1004 participants and has a planned end date of February 2026."
740,"[/INST] This clinical trial is a single-center, non-blinded, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial. The study aims to compare the effectiveness of lung recruitment after conventional oxygen insufflation and ultrasound-guided lung recruitment in morbidly obese patients for laparoscopic bariatric surgery. The conventional group will receive conventional oxygen insufflation of 30 cmH2O for 30 seconds after induction and every hour until the end of surgery, while the ultrasound-guided group will receive ultrasound-guided recruitment using manual pressure of 10 cmH2O for 10 seconds and then increased by 10 cmH2O every 10 seconds until no collapsed areas can be seen on ultrasound with a maximum pressure of 40 cmH2O if the collapsed area is still detectable. The primary outcome measures are change in LUS score and the incidence of atelectasis after lung recruitment. The secondary outcome is the incidence of post-operative oxygen desaturation. The authors conclude that although ultrasound-guided lung recruitment can effectively eliminate atelectasis, more high-quality studies are needed in the future to confirm the results."

745,"[/INST] The objective of the protocol is to compare effects between 2 groups of participants with incomplete spinal cord injury (i.e., AIHH + tSCS-paired strength training (intervention) versus SHAM AIHH + SHAM tSCS strength training (control)). The protocol is using a crossover, randomized, controlled, single-blinded design. This protocol assesses the effects of acute intermittent hypercapnic hypoxia (AIHH) and transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) on respiratory and upper extremity functioning in individuals with respiratory dysfunction from incomplete spinal cord injury. The protocol consists of 2 intervention arms: 1) AIHH paired with tSCS-resisted strength training for respiration (intervention 1), and 2) SHAM AIHH paired with SHAM tSCS-resisted strength training for respiration (control). The two interventions aim to compare the effects of AIHH with and without tSCS, as transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS) is a novel intervention to reduce deficits in respiratory and upper extremity function in individuals with incomplete spinal cord injury. The protocol will be implemented in an individual with incomplete spinal cord injury and respiratory dysfunction, who will undergo five sessions of the two interventions separated by a washout period to minimize carry-over effects. The study will assess the effects of the interventions on respiratory function through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and neurophysiology, airway occlusion pressure (P0.1) and cardiovascular response to hyperoxia exposure via oxygen saturation (SpO2), oximetry, blood pressure (BP), and heart rate (HR), upper extremity functional assessments, as well as quality of life and self-efficacy metrics before and after each intervention."

773,"[/INST] We aimed to use natural language processing (NLP) to extract relevant information from a clinical trial protocol related to PNH. Specifically, we used a pre-trained NLP model known as EHR-NLP on text data obtained from the National Library of Medicine. Additionally, we performed word embedding using TF-IDF to visualize the relatedness of words in the dataset. Word embedding refers to the computational representation of words, where similar words have a similar vector representation . A vector, which can be thought of as an arrow pointing from the origin of a coordinate space, is a 3-digit number (x, y, z) that represents words. To visualize the relationship between words, we plotted the arrows in a 3-dimensional coordinate space, where the x, y, and z values of each arrow (the words) are the values of their corresponding vectors in that space. TF-IDF, which stands for term frequency-inverse document frequency, is a numerical statistic that ranks words based on their frequency of occurrence within a body of text and the frequency with which they occur in other bodies of texts. Conceptually, TF-IDF considers more frequent words to be more relevant than less frequent words within the body of text. To put it simply, the algorithm determines which words are important in a document based on how frequently they occur in that document compared to how frequently they occur in other documents. We visualized the relationships between the words in the dataset using Gephi (https://gephi.org/), a tool for network visualization built in Java using the ForceAtlas2 algorithm. The algorithm is a force-directed model for network layout that arranges nodes in two dimensions. Nodes that are more related to one another are pulled closer together, and those that are less related are pushed further apart. The algorithm uses a gravity-like simulation to minimize the length and curvature of links so that forces push nodes into low-energy states. The result is a visually appealing two-dimensional plan that allows for the detection of complex patterns in high-dimensional data. The ForceAtlas2 algorithm creates a network layout in which all links are minimized, and is effective in handling large amounts of data with relatively few nodes."

807,"[/INST] The summary is as follows: This study aims to establish the validity and reliability of a dexterity assessment tool developed to measure dexterity in patients with degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) and healthy participants. The tool is designed to be easy enough to administer to patients with DCM and patients recruited as healthy participants. The study will be conducted to test multiple metrics. These include concurrent validity, to demonstrate that the Dexterity Assessment Tool (DAT) and graded Redefined Assessment of Strength, Sensation, and Prehension-Myelopathy (GRASSP-M) are significantly correlated (r ≥ 0.50; p < 0.005). These tools measure similar finger function but may be used to target different participant cohort; as the GRASSP-M is more involved, it can be used to test patients with DCM with greater finger weakness, less dexterity impairment, or difficulty understanding instructions. Correlating these two tools can provide evidence that the DAT can be applied in a similar population albeit with less burden or difficulty for the patient. The inter-rater and test-retest reliability will also be evaluated in healthy participants. Inter-rater reliability is expected to be strong (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) ≥ 0.75).

This article describes a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the efficacy of Botox and internal sphincterotomy post-hemorrhoidectomy in pain relief. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria are randomized into two groups: the Botulinum toxin group, where patients receive Botox injection in the internal sphincter following hemorrhoidectomy, or the control group, where patients only undergo hemorrhoidectomy. The pain levels are assessed after hemorrhoidectomy in both groups using the visual analog scale (VAS) score. Additionally, the postoperative bowel gas passages are examined. The trial will last for four to six weeks. The results of this study, which have already been unblinded, showed that the patients who received Botox injection had less pain, VAS scores, and quicker return to daily activities, compared to patients who underwent hemorrhoidectomy only. Although the study's details were not available, based on the summary, it was inferred that the trial evaluated a randomized and controlled trial comparing hemorrhoidectomy vs. hemorrhoidectomy plus internal sphincterotomy using botox to reduce post-hemorrhoidectomy pain. The trial was conducted at a single center with eligible criteria, including age and grade of hemorrhoids. The trial's primary outcome was postoperative pain in the two groups using the VAS score, and it indicated the VAS score 4 weeks post-operatively, and the time taken for patients to return to daily activities. The trial found that patients experienced less pain, VAS score, and quicker return to daily activities from day 4 post-operatively with hemorrhoidectomy plus internal sphincterotomy using botox compared to those with hemorrhoidectomy only. Overall, the trial provides evidence that hemorrhoidectomy plus internal sphincterotomy using botox can reduce pain and promote a faster return to daily activity compared to hemorrhoidectomy alone, resulting in a promising treatment option for post-hemorrhoidectomy pain management."

857,"[/INST] Intramolecular carbon-carbon multibonds are known to have a major contribution to the molecular structure and electronic structure.1,2 However, their formation in complex hydrocarbon systems is challenging due to the high reactivity and low nucleophilicity of multibonded species. Three well-known reactions for the formation of carbon-carbon multiple bonds are the Diels-Alder 2+4 and hetero-Diels-Alder 4+4 cycloaddition, alkyne σ-vinylogy (σ-V), and α-diamination.1 Among these three reactions, only the σ-V mechanism for the formation of carbon-carbon 2n-membered ring system was demonstrated as a reversible and intramolecular reaction.3 The σ-V of conjugated α,ω‐dienes is based on the reactivity of carbon σ-electrons with vinylogous π-electrons. This interesting reactivity of carbon atoms in dienes has been extensively investigated to control the reaction stereoselectivity and ring size-selectivity using the transition-metal catalyzed and enzyme-catalyzed four-component coupling reactions and cyclization reactions in order to construct valuable and various natural product derivatives.4"

887,"[/INST] Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a common congenital defect that affects approximately 8–12 per 1000 live births. Adequate nutritional intake is important for children with CHD, especially those with cyanotic forms, in order to avoid nutritional deficiencies and support proper growth and development. Adequate nutritional intake is essential, as malnutrition can lead to several complications, including an increase in morbidity and mortality, delayed growth and development, as well as poor physical and mental health in adulthood. Congenital heart disease can be detected through a history of birth and the physical examination of the child. However, a normal birth history does not rule out congenital heart disease . Congenital heart disease occurs with the cyanotic form leading to deficiencies in micronutrients and growth impairment, and it is critical to assess nutritional status in children with CHD. Clinicians can screen for nutritional problems using several methods, including anthropomorphic metrics, such as changes in body mass index (BMI), weight-for-height, weight-for-age, and growth velocity. Additional indicators include a weight at the lower limit for age, recent reduction in food intake, and a less-than-per-centile dietary intake . It is important to monitor these children for any clinical complications such as delayed growth, poor feeding, muscle wasting, chronic diarrhea, and fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies. Nutrition plays an important role in supporting optimal growth and development in children with congenital heart disease. Nutritionists are essential members of the CHD care team and must be familiar with the unique needs of these patients. Pediatricians and cardiologists should involve nutritionists in routine screening and ongoing monitoring of infants to help ensure proper nutritional status . Parents are also critical stakeholders in their child's care and can help support adequate nutrition by following the healthcare team's recommendations."

Participants in the study were women aged 20 to 45 with a diagnosis of migraine or TTH based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-I1), and who expressed an interest in participating in the study. Exclusion criteria for the study included having a pathology involving the cervical region, having received any form of physical therapy targeting the cervical region within the past 3 months, being pregnant or in the menopausal phase, not participating in at least 15% of the training sessions, having a mental disorder, having a chronic neurological or rheumatic disorder, suffering from sinusitis, and being on continuous prophylactic medication for migraine. The intervention consisted of one-hour sessions of progressive relaxation training performed over six weeks, two times per week, with a total of twelve sessions. The training included deep diaphragmatic breathing, progressive muscle contraction and relaxation, and an overall relaxation protocol. Participants were assessed twice, at baseline and after the six-week intervention, using the Occupational Self-Assessment (OSA) scale, the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2 (WHO-DAS 2), and the Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS). The results of the study showed that progressive relaxation training can improve activity participation, pain interference, and pain intensity in women with chronic tension-type headaches, as well as reduce activity interference in migraine symptoms. No statistically significant differences were found in pain intensity, frequency, and duration between migraine and TTH. The authors concluded that progressive relaxation training can have beneficial effects on both migraine and TTH and may be a low-cost alternative to non-pharmacological approaches to improving the condition of women with these headache disorders."
898,"[/INST] The objective of this study is to explore the microRNA (miRNA) response to neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome (NOWS) by examining the miRNAs of infants diagnosed with NOWS. The miRNAs of infants exposed to opioids in-utero will be compared with the miRNAs of infants who do not exhibit any drug exposure or withdrawal symptoms at birth. This will be done using a case-control study where the case subjects are those who have diagnosed with NOWS. The control subjects are infants who do not exhibit any drug exposure or withdrawal symptoms at birth. The miRNA responses will be analyzed through biomarkers that have already been identified, such as miRNA-192, miR-146a, and miR-let 7a. These miRNAs are all up-regulated in NOWS cases, which suggests that they may be biomarkers of neonatal withdrawal from opioids. By examining the miRNAs of infants that are exposed to opioids in-utero, there is a greater understanding of their response to the opioid. This can aid in the development of better clinical interventions for NOWS."
899,"[/INST] The aim of the study is to determine the effect of patient education on pain level and fear of pain in orthopedic and traumatology patients. The study included 52 patients in two groups: intervention and control group through simple random sampling. The intervention group received patient education from nursing staff on the day before the operation and the morning of the operation, and the control group received preoperative preparatory information on the morning of the operation. Pain and fear of pain levels were then measured and compared between the two groups. The study found that the intervention group had lower pain and pain fear levels compared to the control group throughout the study period, with the results remaining statistically significant. The researchers concluded that pain education reduced the pain and pain fear scores, and that such education should be included in pre-hospital preparation. The study also found that increasing the intervention group's educational information before the surgery, and in the hospital wards, resulted in significantly lower pain level and intensity compared to the control group. Overall, the study demonstrates the importance of patient education to effectively manage pain and fear in orthopedics and traumatology patients."

920,"[/INST] This trial's primary objective is to examine the impact of a health communication message designed to educate parents about their child's bedtime symptoms on increasing the number of children identified and treated for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The health communication message was tested against usual care alone on the proportion of children who were referred to sleep medicine specialist and referred to polysomnogram (PSG) within the following month for their symptoms of snoring, snorting, breathing cessations. Intervention: Parents were randomly assigned to receive health communication messages targeting parents with children who had completed OSA screenings. It comprised a brief description of symptoms and consequences of OSA in children, as well as instructions to discuss their concern with the provider during the visit. Primary/Secondary Objectives: To assess whether receiving the health communication message before the doctor's visit will increase the number of children who received sleep-disordered breathing referrals or evaluations, compared to receiving no message. A 2-tiered definition is used: Tier 1 children who were referred and completed one referral type (ENT or sleep specialist). Tier 2 children who either 1) were referred and received at least one follow-up type of referral evaluation, e.g., completing an empirical trial of CPAP before progressing to PSG, or 2) referred and no direct referrals were made, but child was diagnosed and treated for sleep-disordered breathing. Study Design: Randomized, parallel group. The participants were parents whose children required OSA screening, were assigned to either the health communication message intervention or to no message control groups. The primary outcome was the proportion of children who had completed OSA-screening tools and were referred to a specialist or had one form of documented, evidence-based follow-up evaluation. The secondary outcome was the proportion of children who successfully completed 1) their OSA referral, and 2) Tier 2-level of OSA evaluation. All study participants were randomized into two groups. The group that included parents who received the health communication message before the doctor's visit was termed as intervention, while the parents who were scheduled to see the doctor for a routine visit, without any message, was termed as the control group. Eligibility Criteria: Parents whose children aged 2-13 years were required to complete OSA-screening tools; if there was a positive screen, parents will be randomized to either health communication message or usual care.

979,"[/INST] The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effects of pTTL (Personalized tumor-trained lymphocytes), a novel personalized cancer cell therapy in a cohort of adult patients with advanced CRC. Part I is a non-randomized first-in human dose escalation trial to determine the maximum feasible dose and safety of pTTL treatment in humans, as well as the best manufacturing practice for pTTL production. The production of pTTL begins with surgical removal of RLNs, which are then cryopreserved to allow time to initiate lymphodepletion-based cancer immunotherapy. Peripheral blood is collected from patients 2 to 4 weeks later, when leukocytes in lymphodepleted patients are predicted to maximally proliferate in response to stimulation via T cell receptors of tumor-derived neoepitopes contained in biopsied RLN tissue. T cells expanded from patient RLNs under these conditions are called pTTL. pTTL doses are administered to patients, and monitored for efficacy and adverse events. In addition to evaluating the maximum feasible pTTL dose, the study aims to investigate neoepitopes used to stimulate lymphodepleted patients' T cells, and establish the most reliable method of harvesting T cells for pTTL therapy. The manufacturing method established in this study could be a first step towards large scale production of pTTL for treatment of patients with advanced CRC."

Objective: to establish whether there is a correlation between serum concentrations of SAA in patients newly diagnosed with intrathoracic sarcoidosis and healthy controls. Methods: Intrathoracic sarcoidosis cohort containing 69 patients with confirmed sarcoidosis, according to ERS/WASOG criteria. Healthy control group of 20. Serum SAA concentrations are measured, using Immunoturbidimetric method. Results: The mean serum concentration of SAA was higher in patients than in controls. It was also significantly higher in patients with stage 1 and 2 and 5 stages than in healthy controls. A statistically significant correlation was found between mean SAA concentrations and Scadding staging system in 0-4 stages. Further studies are planned. Discussion: The results suggest the possibility of using SAA serum concentration measurement in clinical practice as an initial biomarker in patients with suspected sarcoidosis. The main limitation of the study is the small number of participants and a lack of a control group of patients with other non-sarcoid granulomatous pathologies."

985,"[/INST] This summary is based on the abstract provided in the text. This clinical trial focused on evaluating the effects of paroxetine, an antidepressant drug, on cardiovascular function in adult patients who have a septic shock. To accomplish this, patients over 18 years of age who have septic shock and have been prescribed a specific dose of norepinephrine, with a dose maintained under 0.01 mcg/kg/min for 48 hours or less, were enrolled. These patients were then randomly assigned to one of two arms: a placebo arm or a paroxetine arm. Paroxetine is typically administered in increments of 20 mg and in this study, the target drug level for this dose was 1.98 ng/mL. Blood samples were analyzed several times and patients were followed up for 28 days. The primary outcome of the study was the time it took for paroxetine to discontinue vasopressor treatments. The following were secondary outcomes: the cumulative dose of vasopressors administered within the first 48 h of treatment, variation in the cardiovascular component of the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, cumulative dose of vasopressors provided within the first 120 hours, the variation of the SOFA score from 24 to 120 hours, and length of stay and mortality rates in the intensive care unit following admission."
