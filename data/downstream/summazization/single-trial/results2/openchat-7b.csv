62,"GPT4 Correct Assistant: This study is a monocentric, 18-month randomized, rater-blinded trial evaluating the influence of a multidisciplinary, personalized symptomatic treatment plan with integrated mobile palliative care and telemedicine on the quality of life (QoL) of individuals with Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) compared to a historical European MSA cohort. The study aims to recruit 46 individuals with MSA who will undergo baseline examinations and then receive personalized treatment plans, including telemedicine visits for wheelchair-bound individuals. The primary outcome measure is the change in the EQ-5D-5L score from baseline to 18 months. Secondary outcome measures include changes in the MSA-QoL score, motor and non-motor scales, time to clinical milestones, changes in individual healthcare preferences, in-person and telemedicine medical, psychological, and neurorehabilitation interventional needs, changes in patient and healthcare professional satisfaction, medical complications, and healthcare costs.
