This clinical trial aims to investigate the psychological factors associated with nociplastic pain (NP) in women with chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia. The study will use a cluster analysis approach to identify specific psychological factors, including personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences, that are associated with each condition. The study will also assess the presence and intensity of psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosomatics, as well as physical and psychological quality of life, alexithymic traits, perceived social support, sexual satisfaction, and genital pain.

The study will recruit 150 women with a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, 150 women with a diagnosis of chronic migraine, 150 women with a diagnosis of vulvodynia, and 150 healthy controls. Participants will complete a protocol of self-report questionnaires, including measures of central sensitivity, traumatic experiences, personality traits, defense mechanisms, mental pain, environmental sensitivity, and other psychological and physical symptoms. The study will use a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data.

The primary outcome measures will include the Central Sensitivity Index, Traumatic Experiences Index, Personality Traits, Defense Mechanisms, Mental Pain, and Environmental Sensitivity. The secondary outcome measures will include the presence and intensity of psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety, and psychosomatics, as well as physical and psychological quality of life, alexithymic traits, perceived social support, sexual satisfaction, and genital pain.

The study aims to identify specific psychological factors that are associated with each condition and to provide a better understanding of the complex relationships between psychological and physical symptoms in women with chronic pain. The study will also provide insights into the development of tailored interventions for each condition, taking into account the unique psychological and physical characteristics of each patient."

Here is a clear, concise, and accurate summary of the clinical trial:

This randomized, parallel-group trial compares the effectiveness of two mattresses with different support surfaces in preventing pressure ulcers in bedridden patients. Patients with a low risk of pressure ulcers, as determined by the Braden Scale, were randomly assigned to either a group using a massage mattress with a cube/block system or a standard of care mattress. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients without pressure ulcers, which was assessed daily for four weeks. The study aimed to determine whether the massage mattress with a cube/block system is more effective in preventing pressure ulcers than the standard of care mattress."

The study aims to evaluate the effect of virtual reality on preoperative anxiety in patients undergoing abdominal surgery. The study will recruit 96 patients, aged 18-70 years, who will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: an experimental group using virtual reality glasses, a placebo group watching a video without virtual reality glasses, and a control group receiving anxiety control by a researcher. The primary outcome measures will be the preoperative anxiety level, measured using a smart wristband and the Visual Anxiety Scale (VAS-A) before and after watching a video. The study will use a parallel assignment design, with no masking, and will collect data using a patient information form, VAS-A, and a smart wristband with stress level measurement feature. The study is expected to provide insights into the effect of virtual reality on anxiety management before abdominal surgery."

Primary Outcome Measures:

* Changes in an established immune matrix (intratumoral and systemic)
* Longitudinal immunophenotyping of patients
* Analysis of cytokines in peripheral blood
* Analysis of patient's metabolic state
* Analysis of patient's microbiomic state

The study aims to identify potential biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment of salivary gland carcinoma and to understand the immune characteristics of patients with benign and malignant salivary gland tumors. The study will enroll patients aged 18 years or older and will follow them for up to 5 years."

This clinical trial aims to investigate the relationship between compliance with the Mediterranean diet, physical activity habits, walking-related problems, and quality of life in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). The study will enroll patients aged 18-65 with a diagnosis of MS and assess their diet, physical activity, and quality of life using various scales and questionnaires. The primary outcome measures include Mediterranean diet compliance status, quality of life, impacts on walking, and expanded disability status scale. The study will evaluate whether there is a significant relationship between these parameters and explore the potential benefits of the Mediterranean diet on MS symptoms and quality of life."

The SIIT-CD Study is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of selective intensive induction therapy based on ustekinumab clinical decision-making tools (UST-CDST) in patients with Crohn's Disease (CD). The study aims to compare the clinical response rate at week 24 between the experimental group receiving selective intensive induction therapy and the control group receiving non-intensive induction therapy. Eligible patients must be between 18-75 years old, have active CD, and have moderate to low responsive activity according to UST-CDST scores. The experimental group will receive ustekinumab induction therapy intravenously or subcutaneously at weeks 0, 8, and 16, while the control group will not receive any intervention. The primary outcome measure is the difference in clinical response rate at week 24 between the two groups."

The SMILER study is a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of a serious game (SG) as an e-health intervention for young people with neurologic or respiratory disorders, specifically asthma in children. The study aims to evaluate the impact of SG on the quality of life and skills of children with controlled asthma.

Eligible participants are children aged 12-17 years with controlled asthma, who are not experiencing flare-ups or using oral corticosteroids, leukotriene receptor antagonists, or therapy. Exclusion criteria include respiratory infections, immunological, metabolic, cardiac, or neurological diseases, obesity, preterm birth, major malformations of the respiratory system, active smoking, and pregnancy.

The study consists of two arms: Group 1, which receives the SG intervention to support their asthma treatment plan, and Group 2, which follows the standard treatment plan without SG. The SG is a running game that tracks the child's movements using an Azure's Kinect sensor and adapts to their specific motor skills.

The primary outcome measures include the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL) and the Skills and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ-Ita), which will be assessed at 6 months. Secondary outcome measures include the Conserved Transcriptional Response to Adversity (CTRA) also assessed at 6 months."
