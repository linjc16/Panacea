This prospective observational study aimed to investigate the use of a water-soluble contrast-based protocol to assist in the management of pediatric adhesive small bowel obstruction (ASBO). The study enrolled 314 patients aged 1-20 years who were diagnosed with ASBO and underwent a trial of non-operative management (NOM) on hospital admission. The primary outcome measure was the number of patients who required an operation, and the secondary outcomes included total hospital length of stay and adverse events related to contrast administration.

The study found that the use of enteral contrast challenge was not standardized across sites, but the protocol was standardized across sites for other aspects. The contrast agent used was Diatrizoate meglumine or Ioversol, and patients received 30-200ml of enteral contrast followed by X-rays at 8-12 hours and 24 hours after contrast administration.

The study showed that the use of enteral contrast challenge did not significantly affect the need for operation, but it may have affected the total hospital length of stay and the rate of adverse events related to contrast administration. The study also found that the type of contrast agent used and the final osmolality of the contrast administered did not significantly affect the outcomes.

Overall, the study suggests that the use of enteral contrast challenge may be useful in the management of pediatric ASBO, but further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal protocol for its use."

Design: A randomized controlled trial with three groups: control group (no intervention), fruit leather on the tongue, and celluloid matrix group. A total of 270 patients were included in the study.

Methods: Patients were randomly assigned to one of the three groups and instructed to place the corresponding strip on their tongue before panoramic imaging. The strips were positioned in the anterior-posterior dimension at the middle third of the tongue and in the transverse dimension in the central groove of the tongue. The radiographs were assessed by an oral and maxillofacial radiologist for the presence of palatoglossal air space shadow error.

Results: The study found that the use of celluloid matrix tapes and oral tapes significantly reduced the palatoglossal air space shadow error in panoramic imaging compared to the control group.

Conclusion: The study suggests that using celluloid matrix tapes and oral tapes can be an effective method for reducing the palatoglossal air space shadow error in panoramic imaging, improving the quality of radiographs and reducing diagnostic errors."

The ""Pain Rating Challenges and Patterns"" study aims to improve pain communication between patients and healthcare nurses. The study explores patients' and nurses' mental effort when choosing or understanding pain intensity ratings, and their confidence in the accuracy of these ratings. The study consists of five aims:

Aim 1 compares the mental effort of using different pain intensity rating scales, with a focus on the worst pain you have ever felt scale, 7-day recall period, and focus on one body area.

Aim 2 compares patients' and nurses' perceptions of mental effort when choosing or understanding pain intensity ratings.

Aim 3 examines the relationship between perceptions of mental effort and the importance of decreasing mental effort for patients and nurses.

Aim 4 evaluates the equivalence of patients' and nurses' confidence in the accuracy of fictional pain intensity rating patterns.

Aim 5 tests the relationship between confidence in the accuracy of fictional pain intensity rating patterns and the importance of increasing confidence for patients and nurses.

The study includes patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain and healthcare nurses who regularly assess patients' pain. Participants complete a survey to assess mental effort and confidence in pain intensity ratings.
