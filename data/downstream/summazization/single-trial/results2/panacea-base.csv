0,"0.078% of people in western countries suffer from chronic pain conditions at some stage of their lives (Fillingim & Portenoy, 2003; De Tommaso et al., 2013). The most common chronic pain conditions that affect the central and peripheral nervous system (chronic migraine, fibromyalgia, and vulvodynia) are estimated to take 34-38% of chronic pain prevalence, followed by neuropathic pain conditions (i.e. nerve injury) with 24-26%, and back pain conditions with 19-21% (Yang et al., 2017). The presence of these disorders, in addition to causing chronic and severe pain from which it is difficult to escape, often causes profound changes in the psychological condition of the person involved, as well as significant limitations in the person's everyday life, such as reduced levels of productivity, social/familial isolation, and an overall state of discomfort derived from both physical and psychological illness. Studies highlight that a chronic pain condition can have negative effects on the person's emotional state and quality of life due to the reduction of cognitive resources such as attention and executive functions, poor cognitive and motor performance in daily activities, which in turn produces a further reduction of productivity and social isolation (Ghahremani & Haddox, 2009). The study of psychosocial factors associated with the experience of such pathologies or possible emerging clusters such as depression, anxiety, somatization, quality of life, alexithymia, social support, sexual satisfaction, and functioning. Research on the role of personality traits, defense mechanisms, central sensitization, and childhood traumatic experiences in NP. These factors are among those with which psychosomatic medicine in everyday clinical practice deals. The hypothesis is that specific psychological factors (clusters of high number of early traumatic events, high levels of central sensitization, and specific traits and defense mechanisms) characterize FM, CM, and VU groups compared to controls."
1,"BACKGROUND: The pressure areas are created when the tissue is subjected to continued pressure from the body when staying in the horizontal position for a long time. Preventing the occurrence of pressure sores is important in care units. The aim of the research is to prevent the development of pressure ulcers by changing the pressure applied to patients' skin. METHODS/DESIGN: The study will be conducted as a split-unit trial between a standard bed and a bed with cube/block system massage feature. A hundred twenty inpatients aged ≥18 years and with an odd number who have been evaluated by the Braden scale as ""low pressure ulcer risk"" will participate in the study. The sample size is determined by the type 1 error level and the power of the test and calculated as follows: Sample size in group 1: 60, Sample size in group 2: 60. The calculation formula: N= Z(a)+ Z(b)2 (p(1-p))2 The study was run in four phases. In the first phase, twenty patients will wear bed sheets for a period of 12 hours and will be evaluated with the Braden Scale, and then the patients will be placed in the standard bed or the bed with cube/block system massage feature (split-unit trial). In the second phase, patients who have been on the bed for a maximum of six hours will be evaluated for the development of pressure ulcers (observation-only period). In the third phase of the study, two of the four pressure ulcer observation points will be observed (control period). In the first period, the patients in the massage mattress group will stay in the mattress for the first three days, in the second period, the patients in the mattress group will stay in the mattress for three days and in the third period, the patients in the mattress group will stay three days in the mattress and three days in the standard bed. A total of four mattresses and eight standard beds were allocated to patients in the massage mattress study. Patients will change the bed in the second phase, as per the random-block method. In the fourth phase, the massage mattress group will be placed on the standard bed for the first three days and the standard bed group will be placed on the massage mattress for the next three days (crossover period). The evaluation for the development of pressure ulcers will continue in the fourth phase. Pressure ulcer area in both groups will be calculated using the Wound Measurement Ruler. Ethics Committee approval was obtained. Statistical analyses will be carried out using the SPSS version 26 software. All statistical results will be statistically analyzed. |

7,"1. Background: The drug ustekinumab (UST) was approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease (CD) in China in 2020 and obtained the grade I recommendation in the recently published 2020 TCM guidelines. Although UST is effective in inducing clinical response and remission in patients with CD, 30-40% of patients with IBD do not respond to UST immunotherapy . A meta-analysis has shown that 57% of CD patients respond positively to UST induction therapy, and 57% of CD patients who have not responded to UST treatment have a positive response to subsequent induction therapy after drug withdrawal and re-induction . However, few studies have clarified the clinical practice guidelines for the induction and subsequent therapy of CD patients who do not respond to the first-line use of ustekinumab (UST) as a biologic agent in the clinic, especially the optimal induction and following therapeutic strategies for patients with CD in China. 2. Objective: To explore a highly efficient and safe induction therapeutic strategy based on UST in CD patients with moderate and low response activity, and to provide a reference strategy for the treatment of Chinese CD patients with intestinal lesions. 3. Methods include: The randomized, comparative and controlled multicenter SIIT-CD study was designed to explore whether clinical decision-making tools for UST-related drug use can be used to form a personalized treatment regimen and to explore the efficacy and safety of individual treatment regimens to provide clinical decision-making tools for clinicians for clinical treatment of patients with moderate and low responsive activity CD. 4. Explanation: SIIT based on the CDST score is expected to better control disease activity and can better prevent recurrence of disease activity to avoid severe recurrence of disease in CD patients."

To determine the effectiveness of the intervention, they compare the levels of anxiety and depression symptoms before the intervention and after the intervention using standardized psychometric scales. Through this pilot study, the investigators aim to identify whether The Resilient Mom is effective at reducing anxiety and depression symptoms in participants whose distress levels are high based on psychometric assessments. This could potentially lead to further research on the effectiveness of the intervention in preventing or reducing mental health symptoms in individuals who have experienced a traumatic event.

16,"5,237 patients, of which 560 had a cardiovascular disease. Of these 560 patients, 624, with an average of 1.1 per patient, received medical treatment that also included treatment for pain symptoms using painkillers. All this treatment for cardiovascular disease and pain, in addition to treatment to prevent infections, i.e. antibiotics, has been given by the dentist in the dental practice. The dental practice of course had several other patients for whom non-preventive antibiotics were used; in fact these non-preventive antibiotics were used in approximately 80% of patients, of which 31.4% had at least one dental operation. In view of the limited data currently available on a possible increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular diseases after dental practice visits, a prospective study was initiated, among others, to examine this risk. The objective of this prospective study is to explore the risk of cardiovascular disease in relation to the type of dental treatment or intervention in the dental surgery. The first 10% of the patients who came to the dental surgery of the participating doctor between 10 September 2018 and 11 February 2020 were included. Patients were excluded if no data on the use of medical products could be obtained to check medication use. Furthermore, patients for whom no data on the type of dental treatment and/or intervention was available were also excluded. As a result, 426 patients remained, of which 270 had a cardiovascular disease. Of the patients included in this study, 3.2% had a cardiovascular disease. No differences in the cardiovascular and general characteristics of patients with a cardiovascular disease were found in those receiving and not receiving preventive antibiotics (Table). However, preventive antibiotic therapy was more commonly associated with more intensive and complex dental treatments, including root canal treatment, multiple crowns, insertion of fixed bridges, implantation and prosthetic treatments. In addition, the proportion of women and smokers was higher in the group receiving preventive antibiotics compared to the group not receiving preventive antibiotics (Table). After adjusting for age, smoking and sex, risk for cardiovascular disease was indeed significantly higher with preventive antibiotic therapy (OR = 2.5, 95% CI: 1.3  5.0) (Figure). This result is in line with the idea that cardiovascular disease is more prevalent in patients receiving dental treatment, regardless of whether the reason for prevention is the intervention itself or is primarily the oral condition itself, especially if cavities are present in the mouth. As a result, the observed cardiovascular disease may be partly related to cavities rather than the intervention itself. Distributing patients based on the amount of work performed does not lead to significant differences in the number of cardiovascular diseases. A major strength of this study is the large number of patients included. A major limitation is that this was a non-random study and not every dentist uses preventive antibiotics when performing a dental intervention. Furthermore, this study was not conducted for patients undergoing only prophylactic or conservative dental treatment and it is not known whether cardiovascular disease was related to the procedure. Finally, it is possible that patients with a cardiovascular disease have a lower pain threshold and therefore had more dental treatments done in a shorter period of time, and therefore were more likely to receive preventive antibiotic treatment, because these patients were seen more frequently in the dentist's chair. Therefore, there was a selection bias. For the patient, however, it was reassuring to come into less contact with the source of infection. This could have resulted in less cardiovascular disease in the patient with cardiovascular disease in the group that did not receive preventive antibiotic treatment. Conclusion: Our study shows that the use of preventive antibiotics in dentistry is associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of cardiovascular disease among patients receiving dental treatment in the dental practice. In this study, however, patient selection may have played a role and this study can therefore not be considered representative, especially since the proportion of patients in whom preventive antibiotic treatment was given was higher among patients with cardiovascular disease. A representative study, such as a randomized controlled trial among patients with dental treatment, is lacking in the literature. It therefore remains to be seen whether the use of preventive antibiotics in dental visits actually contributes to a significant increase in the incidence of cardiovascular disease.

17,"This study aims to perform the most cost effective and time efficient diagnostic screening for heart failure (HF) in real world setting.
Detailed Description
-----------------
The majority of heart failure patients present as decompensated heart failure to health care facilities with associated increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and increased health care costs compared to those with HF presenting prior to decompensation. In light of these facts, early identification of high risk patients prior to decompensation can substantially improve healthcare delivery, and quality of life of these patients. Heart failure (HF) is an emerging public health issue in Canada. An estimated 850,000 Canadians are affected, with the prevalence of the disease among seniors expected to double in the next sixteen years. The majority of heart failure patients present as decompensated heart failure to health care facilities, with associated increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stay, and increased health care costs compared to those with HF presenting prior to decompensation. The current standard of care in HF involves assessing patients symptoms, medication side effects, and signs to aid clinical decision making. In many cases, patients with asymptomatic HF are often misdiagnosed and do not access HF related care. With the advent of novel diagnostic tools, including, Echocardiography, B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) biomarkers, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven cardiac ultrasound, early identification of high risk patients prior to decompensation can be achieved. The investigators hypothesize that combining advanced novel HF biomarker and diagnostics testing can improve the identification of asymptomatic heart failure patients in the outpatient setting.
This is a randomized, un-blinded study comparing usual care to an intervention group receiving early heart failure testing. Pre-screening will be performed using extracted primary care electronic health records with the case finding algorithm based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. An invitation letter will be send to prospective patients which include a registration telephone number and link to dedicated study website. The invitation for contact will adopt an opt-out approach (ask the potential participant to contact the coordinating centre if they do not wish to be contacted). Potential participants not opting out, or opting in, within 2 weeks of invitation mailing will be sent a patient information package along with follow up contact by research team. Consented participants will be randomized either to usual care or interventions group and followed for six months. Intervention group will have NT-proBNP drawn and those with an elevated NT-proBNP (>125pg/mL) will have a study visit with assessments to include, physical examination, electrocardiogram and study AI echocardiogram.

18,"BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the anesthetic induction dose of propofol based on lean body weight. In patients with elevated body mass index to induce general anesthesia, many factors need to be determined. As the total body weight increases with the increase in body mass index, the dose of propofol increases accordingly. Although this parameter is an important factor in determining the induction dose of propofol, it also poses some risks. These are due to the fact that the total body weight may be different from the lean body weight (LBW). This increase in the total body weight may not have increased the LBW. In addition, using only LBW may underestimate body mass. Using a weight that may be inadequate for the procedure and for the depth of anesthesia required, it can pose a risk to the patient. For this reason, the investigators proposed to standardize the dose of propofol to be administered by taking into account the patient's total body weight (TBW), ideal body weight (IBW) and LBW. With the help of mathematical equations, the total dose of propofol that can be administered will be calculated taking into account the relationship between the patient's weight and the dose of propofol, and the number of drug units that need to be administered for anesthetic induction can be calculated. To determine the best weight-based scalar for the induction dose of propofol, we will administer a dose that will be calculated according to the calculated body weight (TBW, IBW, LBW) in patients who will be under general anesthesia and monitor for respiration and bispectral index values. The calculated dose will also be standardized and the time required for the patient to achieve a surgical plane of anesthetic depth will be determined. Patients will have a body analysis with Tanita before the operation. Patients' height, weight, age, gender and other general information will be recorded. Total and Lean Body Weight of the patients will be calculated. Patients over the age of 18 who will be operated under general anesthesia for 2-6 hours will be included. Routine anesthesia applications will be performed with neuromuscular blocker applied. The total dose of Propofol given; the dose applied to kilograms will be calculated according to TBW, IBW and LBW. And the relationship between the doses given and the body mass index will be evaluated. In our study, we aimed to evaluate the effects of Propofol dose according to lean body weight by evaluating patients with bodymass index below 35.

20,"Background
- 
The development of appropriate instruments to assess the complexity level of physical therapy care for hospitalized patients has not yet been developed, and there are no studies evaluating the level of complexity of physical therapy care in hospitalized patients. A specific and efficient instrument to evaluate the complexity level of physical therapy care would have a great impact on the management of hospitalized patients, allowing to plan and prioritize physical therapy care. Consequently, it would be possible to allocate the most appropriate level of resources to manage and assist each patient, resulting in improvements in the quality, safety and efficacy of physical therapy care, as well as an optimization of therapeutic time. 
- 
Objectives
- 
To develop a specific instrument (PHYSIOSCORE) to assess the complexity level of physical therapy care in hospitalized patients. 
- 
To evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of the PHYSIOSCORE. 
- 
To evaluate the clinical utility of the PHYSIOSCORE. 
- 
To evaluate how much time is needed to complete the score, to collect the data and to prepare a report of the results. 

Design
- 
Phase 1: 
- Evaluate the content validity of the instruments, through the application of the Delphi technique (1) and consensus methodologies (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21). 
- Phase 2: 
- Evaluate the reliability and reproducibility of PHYSIOSCORE. This phase will be performed by another ten physical therapists (not involved in phase 1) with at least five years of experience in the hospital setting. In addition, the online calculator will be developed to include the 44 items divided into three main domains of PHYSIOSCORE (http://www.fisioescore.com, in Portuguese). 
- All physical therapists will receive prior training to standardize the use of the scale. 
- Phase 3: Clinical Validation of the Instrument 
- 
- a total of 110 consecutive clinical and surgical patients will be selected 
- The patients will be evaluated in three moments: during hospital admission, after five and ten days, or at hospital discharge, whichever occurred first. Patients will be submitted to the PHYSIOSCORE by one professional, in all three moments. 
- The time spent assessing physical therapy care and registering electronic medical records will all be timed. 
- For the construction of the questionnaires, the authors used the questionnaires from a previous work, as well as the data from a cohort of heart failure patients admitted to the hospital between Jan 2010 and Dec 2017, during the implementation of the European quality initiative for cardiac care.

21,"30-40% of all new head and neck cancers (HNC) are occurring in the oropharynx. Within these, squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) are now predominately HPV driven, with a resultant favorable increase in overall survival. However, a subset of HPV+SCC patients continue to have worse outcomes, including a significant incidence of local and regional recurrences with poor outcomes. TORS has become the standard for managing these oropharyngeal cancers and has resulted in excellent functional outcomes and high rates of oropharyngeal organ preservation. Postoperative adjuvant chemoradiation has been shown to reduce recurrence risk in high risk and intermediate risk settings. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising new biomarker that can be used both to improve selection of patients for observation post TORS, as well as provide early detection of locoregional recurrences. The SAVAL Trial proposes to use a newly identified panel of post TORS ctDNA biomarkers to identify low and intermediate risk patients for observation after TORS, and to further identify those with ctDNA detected after TORS that are at high risk for recurrent disease as potential candidates for adjuvant chemoradiation. Patients meeting these criteria will be offered treatment in this clinical trial. The aim of this study is to reduce overtreatment of many HPV+SCC patients, while maintaining excellent overall survival rates in those who are truly at risk for recurrence. Through this study, the investigators aim to determine the optimal strategy for management of ctDNA positive p16+SCC patients post TORS."

24,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a group of disorders that causes chronic inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. Symptoms include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain and fatigue. Over the past decades its prevalence has dramatically increased. It is known that diet plays an important role IBD-development and severity. Patients with IBD do not absorb adequate amounts of nutrients in the small intestine. As a consequence, the colon absorbs a very high amount of fatty acids and carbohydrates, which can lead to an abnormal intestinal microbiome population. This can lead to symptoms such as chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, fatigue and even protein-calorie malnutrition.
Increasing our fiber intake can stimulate the growth of (beneficial) bacteria in the gut which can have positive health effects. Fibers increase stool consistency and have been shown to have prebiotic properties by stimulating the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. However, increasing fiber intake is often difficult for patients due to the often decreased appetite and stool frequency. Furthermore, it is generally known in the Netherlands that fiber intake is low compared to the WHO minimum recommendations. We therefore expect that WholeFiberTM is well-tolerated and that the health benefits are considerable for patients with IBD. To determine the effect of a 4-week WholeFiberTrademark (TM) intervention on inflammation, fecal gut microbiota and metabolites, IBD-complaints and QoL in patients with IBD and evaluate its feasibility.

Dietary fiber is a complex mixture of carbohydrates that we are not able to digest as humans. Dietary fibers are divided into two classes. The first class of fibers, called soluble fibers, can dissolve in water. The second type of fiber, called insoluble fiber, does not dissolve in water. Both fiber types can have prebiotic properties by stimulating the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. The intestinal microbiome is the community of microorganisms that live in our intestines. An imbalance in the microbiome can cause disease. It is thought that the microbiome also plays an important role in the pathogenesis and the exacerbation of symptoms of IBD. The diet we consume influences the composition of the gut microbiome and its function.
Cultivated lettuce (Lactuca sativa) contains a variety of soluble and insoluble fibers, such as inulin, pectin, cellulose and hemi-cellulose. The inulin fraction can reach a level of 4 percent (depending on the cultivation conditions). Inulin and its metabolites have been shown to have prebiotic effects in the gut by stimulating the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. Furthermore, the cultivated lettuce contains oligofructanes and polysaccharides, which are a good source of non-digestible oligo- and polysaccharides. 

The study design is a before after design in which 12 patients with IBD (6 CD patients and 6 UC patients; each patient is its own control) will be asked to ingest 10-20 grams of WholeFiberTM (1 scoop of 5g WholeFiberTM) per day for 4 weeks before and after a 2 week period. Fecal samples will be collected before and after the intervention. Blood will also be taken before and after the intervention to analyze inflammation and oxidative stress parameters. All clinical data, including IBD-related parameters, clinical chemistry, stool consistency, stool frequency, QoL and quality of life questionnaires will be collected before and after the intervention period.

25,"BACKGROUND: Localized root coverage has been commonly used as a surgical treatment modality against gingival recession. However, when comparing non-regenerative techniques to regenerative procedures, it is suggested that none of them has been able to produce successful long term outcomes. Aims of the study: compare two surgical methods, the coronally advanced flap (CAF) versus the CAF associated with the porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM+ CAF), on the basis of root coverage, clinical attachment level (C), and probing depth (PD) changes.STUDY DESIGN: A prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical study will be conducted. The CAF + PADM group, that will undergo CAF associated with PADM, will be compared to CAF group, that will undergo coronally advanced flap (CAF). Clinical and radiographic measurements (recission height, presence and size of root coverage, width of keratinized tissue, plaque, gingival index, and PD) before surgery and post-operative will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months interval .METHODS: This study will include 20 subjects, divided into 2 experimental groups (10 per group), who will be treated by CAF+ PADM and CAF methods. The patients will be divided into 2 groups and they will be treated using either CAF+ PADM or CAF group. Surgical procedures will be made by the same periodontal specialist in every patient. Clinical and radiographic measurements of gingival recession, width of keratinized tissue, PD, and the presence of gingival recession will be analyzed before and after the surgical protocol. The statistical analysis will be based on the paired and unpaired t-test and Fisher's exact test.RESULTS: Results show that root coverage was achieved in 80% of the sites in the CAF group, while there were 50% and 90% of improvement in recession depth respectively from baseline to 6 and 12 months in the CAF + PADM group.CONCLUSIONS: The PADM associated to CAF technique can improve the success rate of recession coverage.PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study will include 20 subjects, divided into 2 experimental groups(10 per group), who will be treated by CAF+ PADM and CAF methods. The patients will be divided into 2 groups and they will be treated using either CAF+PADM or CAF group. Surgical procedures will be made by the same periodontal specialist in every patient. Recession coverage was achieved in 80% of the sites in the CAF group, while there were 50% and 90% of improvement in recession depth respectively from baseline to 6 and 12 months in the CAF + PADM group."

1.- Short Title of the Study: Effect of Physical Exercise Performed Through Virtual Reality Games on the Modulation of Heart Rate Variability in Chronic Renal Patients During Hemodialysis.
2.- Abstract: The objective of this Longitudinal CrossOver Clinical Trial is to compare changes in heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients undergoing conventional physical exercise and in a virtual environment during hemodialysis sessions.
In a simple sentence: Exercise done either with conventional physical exercise or with virtual reality is going to be compared on whether it is beneficial to chronic renal patients.
Patient population: 18-70 years old, chronic renal patients undergoing hemodialysis treatment.
Design: Inclusion criteria: Inclusion: Patients with diagnosed chronic renal insufficiency requiring hemodialysis at any classification level. Age over 18 years. Possession of medical clearance for participating in physical exercise. Ability for lower limb movement without affecting dialysis treatment. Exclusion Criteria: Acute use of medications that affect the cardiovascular system and/or alter the function of the nervous system, unless they are part of the disease treatment protocol and are part of the patient's routine.
2.- Brief summary of the scientific/medical rationale for the
project

The investigators objective is to compare changes in heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients undergoing conventional physical exercise and in a virtual environment during hemodialysis sessions.
The cardiac rhythm is controlled by an activity called Autonomic Nervous System, composed of: sympathetic activity (SNS) responsible for activation of the heart, respiratory system, blood vessels of skeletal muscles, skin, kidneys, bladder; and parasympathetic activity(PNS) responsible for activation of the organs of the digestive system, lungs and blood vessels outside the skeletal muscles. These activities can be altered depending on the patient's physical condition, psychological status and the moment of the day. The Autonomic Nervous System is responsible for the regulation of the cardiac rhythm by means of modulation of heart rate and blood pressure values. Patients with low heart rate and blood pressure values can present a high mortality rate related to their heart rhythm, even with no apparent alteration in the ECG.
3.- Objective:
1.- Main objective: To compare changes in heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients undergoing conventional physical exercise and in a virtual environment during hemodialysis sessions.
2.- Secondary objective: To determine the relative effectiveness of conventional physical exercise by comparing it with virtual reality exercise in improving heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients before and during hemodialysis sessions.

29,"1. PATIENT INCLUSION: The sample will be made up of residents of nursing homes (n = 60) over 65 years of age. The sample will be selected from the four nursing homes in the city of Santander, Spain (Ningún, 2022). Patients will be eligible to participate in the study if they fulfill the following criteria: a) Patients diagnosed with MCI (Dementia screening test>Cognitive test), b) Patients capable of walking at least 10 meters without severe pain in the lower limbs (according to the Visual Analog Scale), c) Patients capable to perform the previously mentioned tests without the use of external aids or with the use of assistive devices such as a cane, and without medical contraindications for exercise. The sample of people diagnosed with MCI (without dementia) will be recruited through a previously scheduled appointment with the doctor responsible for the medical follow-up of care homes, and, if necessary, the family of the residents will be contacted with the aim of requesting their participation. In case of lack of understanding with the patient, the family will express their wishes in terms of participation. In this case, the name, surnames, and contact details of the patient will be provided to the researchers to be contacted. Nursing homes will select patients who may be potential participants in the study by checking the following inclusion criteria: a) resident in the care home, b) diagnosis of MCI. Nursing home administration will select eligible participants from this pool of potential participants. This process will ensure that eligible participants are given priority for inclusion in the study, reducing the selection bias. The remaining participants in the pool of potential participants will be available for inclusion in the future. 2. GROUPS: The interventions will be carried out in three experimental groups and a control group: a) Intervention Group 1 (IG1): Observational learning of movements performed by the patients' own therapist. b) Intervention Group 2 (IG2): Observational learning of movements performed by people with a diagnosis of dementia who do not present cognitive impairment and with whom the patients already have social relationships. c) Intervention Group 3 (IG3): Observational learning of movements performed by a ""younger"" patient, that is, someone younger than the participating patients. It will not be a peer learning as such, as the younger patient will not be a neighbor or someone from his or her environment. Thus, it will be different from IG2. This should be clarified as it serves to differentiate the three intervention groups: Groups 1 and 2 will have direct contacts with the participating patient, while Group 3 will not. In the end, there will be no control for the influence of the ""younger"" patient in Group 3 but it must be taken into account that the participating patient must be in the habit of seeing this person, otherwise it will not be possible to carry out the intervention. In both IGs, the therapist is not allowed to say anything or give directions, which constitutes an important point to consider during the intervention. As a last control measure, a fourth group, a non-intervention group, will also be created made up of patients who will be under the routine treatment of each nursing home. These patients will be monitored but will not participate in any of the activities proposed by the study. Data for the control group will be collected before and after the intervention period. 3. DATA COLLECTION: The data will be collected by the researchers at the beginning and end of the intervention period and by a specialized staff in the nursing homes. The researchers will conduct a baseline assessment of the cognitive and physical health of the patients, including a series of validated questions and tests to gather information on the following aspects: cognitive function, physical function, and gait and balance. The researchers will also gather information on the overall quality of life and the satisfaction of the patients and their caregivers. In order to ensure the validity of the data, the researchers will follow a specific protocol for each test and questionnaire, and will closely adhere to the instructions provided by the relevant professional organizations. In this way, the results of the data collection will be reliable and accurate. 4. NUMBER OF SESSIONS: The intervention will last for 5 weeks in the intervention and control groups, and will consist of 2 to 3 sessions per week. Each session is expected to last between 20 and 30 minutes. In order to ensure the sustainability of the intervention, it is recommended that it is carried out for a period of 5 weeks, as this is sufficient time for the patients to develop new motor habits related to upper limb and shoulder girdle movement and to see the progressive improvement in their functionality. Additionally, the study population is older adults"

33,"Influence of the microbiome on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus

Scientific title
=================
Microbiome and Cardiovascular Events (MACE): a prospective study in type 2 diabetes mellitus in primary healthcare setting

Description
=================
Background
-----------------
One of the leading causes of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  is cardiovascular events like myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. The interaction between diabetes and atherosclerosis is complex, and recent studies on the connection between gut microbiome and cardiovascular disease support that gut microbiome plays a central role. The gut microbiome is not only involved in the metabolism and energy homeostasis, but there is also evidence that alterations in the composition and diversity of gut microbiome are associated with cardiovascular disease and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. These risk factors are modifiable and include obesity, blood pressure, blood lipids, insulin resistance, and diabetes status.
With the emerging knowledge of the important role gut microbiome plays in many disorders, the hypothesis of diabetes mellitus acting through the alterations in the composition and diversity of the gut microbiome to accelerate or precipitate or delay the onset of cardiovascular disease can be further explored. Therefore, the aims of the study are:
1. To test the influence of the microbiome on the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients suffering from type 2 diabetes mellitus
2. To analyse the influence of microbiome on the prognosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus
3. To study the associations between the microbiome and the risk factors for cardiovascular disease mentioned before.

Objective
-----------------
The aim of the study is to examine the microbiome's effects on cardiovascular disease and its risk factors through the identification of a gut microbiome profile associated with these events by analysing the composition and diversity of gut microbiome.

Study Design
-----------------
Patients with T2DM, aged 20 to 80 years, will be enrolled in the primary healthcare setting. All patients will be followed for 3 years with quarterly questionnaires assessing T2DM related complications and risk factors for cardiovascular disease. A fasting blood sample and a faecal sample will be collected at enrollment, after 12 months, and after 3 years. An ECG and clinical blood pressure measurement will be performed at baseline.

Inclusion criteria
-----------------
The study includes patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) aged 18 - 80 years. Individuals with T2DM are diagnosed on the basis of World Health Organization criteria: Fasting plasma glucose of >126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/l) or a 2-hour plasma glucose of >200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/l) during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus, patients diagnosed with pre-diabetes, and patients with a fasting plasma glucose level between 100 and 125 mg/dl (5.6 to 6.9 mmol/l) will be excluded from the study. Moreover, patients with microalbuminuria >32 mg/L, eGFR <45 ml/min/1.73 m2 and with known ischaemic heart disease will be excluded from the study.
Patients will be included if they are registered at the primary healthcare setting, have signed a written consent, and have completed the baseline questionnaire. Patients already receiving primary care for T2DM and fulfilling the inclusion criteria are included.

It is thought that this is the result of more and better parental interaction in skin-to-skin contact compared to routine care. The researchers will share that if mothers experience these effects of skin-to-skin contact, they should be informed and educated in a balanced manner. When skin-to-skin contact is performed more frequently, the mother's perception is that the birth is more difficult, but this perception does not have an effect on the bond with the baby. 2.

39,"BACKGROUND
-----------------
Nearly 30% of American adults experience persistent pain, and the healthcare costs for individuals with persistent pain is much greater than for those without persistent pain. Opioid pharmacotherapy, which is considered by many to be the ""gold standard"" treatment for severe pain, is used by a substantial proportion of people experiencing pain, even among those whose pain is considered ""chronic"" . Use of prescription opioids is associated with substantial risks (overdose, dependence, diversion, etc.), which may explain why pain is the chief reason for visits to primary care providers . The primary concern with opioid therapy is dependence. Chronic pain in older adults is a risk factor for dementia, depression, and anxiety . Because of these risks and longstanding concern about the widespread overuse of opioids for the treatment of chronic pain , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently advised that non-pharmacological and non-opioid pharmacotherapy be considered first line therapy and recommended that opioids only be prescribed as an adjunct to these interventions (when the latter are insufficient) . This stance was reiterated in a recent statement by the United States Department of Health and Human Services National Pain Strategy, which recommended the development, implementation, and evaluation of patient-centered, interdisciplinary (eg, including health care providers in a variety of disciplines) pain management interventions . A variety of patient-centered and interdisciplinary pain management interventions have been tested, but no multidisciplinary intervention with a focus on treatment adherence has been tested. Patients with acute pain often receive prescriptions for opioid pharmacotherapy when discharged from the Emergency Department and Urgent Care. Because such pain is often mild to moderate, there is little to no opportunity to develop pain management skills prior to discharge. We propose to develop an effective and inexpensive multidisciplinary, brief intervention for patients with acute pain that is provided prior to discharge from the Emergency Department or Urgent Care. This intervention will improve pain management skills such that patients will utilize more noninvasive, first line treatment options and fewer patients will subsequently begin to use opioid pharmacotherapy . We plan to develop and evaluate an innovative interactive video intervention to encourage appropriate opioid use for acute pain for subjects recruited from the Orthopedic Emergency Departments and Urgent Care centers at Parkland Health and Hospital System. Our research questions can be summarized as follows: Do subjects randomized to the video/intervention program demonstrate greater improvement than those randomized to routine care in terms of self-reported pain and opioid use? Do subjects randomized to the video/intervention program demonstrate changes in their pain beliefs and self-efficacy for managing pain?

40,"It is important to understand that Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  is a complex condition that requires careful assessment and support to manage effectively. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in exploring alternative approaches to traditional pharmacotherapy, such as using neuro-linguistic programming (NLP) techniques to help children with ADHD improve their concentration and attention. NLP is based on the concept that our thoughts, emotions, and behaviors are influenced by our internal representations, which are essentially mental models that we use to interpret and react to the world around us. By working with these internal representations, NLP aims to help individuals develop more effective patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving.

Background: 
One potential drawback of NLP is that it requires a high level of expertise and skill to implement effectively. Most health practitioners, including psychologists and psychiatrists, do not routinely receive training in NLP techniques and may not be able to provide the same level of support and guidance as NLP practitioners who specialize in this area. Furthermore, the potential impact of NLP techniques on children's academic performance has not been extensively investigated. While some studies have shown promising results, there is a need for more rigorous research to determine the efficacy of these techniques in improving academic outcomes.

Objective:
The present study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of NLP techniques on schoolchildren's academic performance, with particular emphasis on students diagnosed with ADHD.

Study Design: 
This was an exploratory, case-control study that involved a convenient sample of schoolchildren in Lebanon aged between 5 and 11 years. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: an intervention group that received NLP techniques, and a control group that did not receive any intervention.

Setting:
The study was conducted at the schools of Beirut's eastern suburbs, where Lebanon has made great strides in public education.

Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria: 
The inclusion criteria were as follows: children aged between 5 and 11 years attending the same school for at least a year. Exclusion criteria included children with serious medical conditions, such as diabetes or cardiovascular disease, and children with intellectual disabilities.

Intervention: 
The intervention involved four 90-minute sessions for teachers and two 45-minute sessions for children, separated by a week-long break between sessions. 
During the intervention, teachers were taught how to use NLP techniques to help children improve their concentration, attention, and behavior in the classroom. The techniques included anchoring, reframing, and meta-modelling.

Conduct of Study: 
The intervention group and control group were evaluated using questionnaires and other measures before and after the intervention. The study findings will be used to develop a comprehensive program to improve schoolchildren's academic performance, with particular emphasis on children diagnosed with ADHD. To achieve this aim, the study team will conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the NLP techniques and will develop an implementation plan to ensure that the program is widely available to children in Lebanon and other countries.

Outcomes: 
The primary outcome of the study was to assess the effectiveness of NLP techniques in improving schoolchildren's academic performance.
 

Secondary outcome measures included changes in behavior, mood, and cognitive function, as well as changes in teacher-reported measures of academic performance.
 

Study Status: 
The study was completed in 2020. The results of the study indicated that the NLP techniques had a positive effect on the academic performance of schoolchildren, with significant improvements observed in areas such as attention, concentration, and behavior."
41,"Emergency care services are facing a growing number of patients to a point where they are at risk of reaching saturation. To prevent this, it is a constant concern of medical managers to develop ways of improving the performance of emergency department teams . The teaching methodology must be adapted to the reality of this environment. ECOX (Emergency Clinical Orientation Examination) is a new teaching method designed to meet the challenges of the emergency department, both in terms of clinical management and pedagogy.  The ECOX method will consist of teaching grids, corresponding to a starting clinical situation and its corresponding management by the student. The medical student must then compare his answers with the possible answers. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the use of an ECOX box for self-assessment during practical teaching will improve student performance during their internal OSCE, in comparison to the results of training with no such box.  We aim at using the ECOX box for self-evaluation in Emergency Medicine teaching during the training. The hypotheses are that students using the new tool (ECOX box) will make better grades in practical training (OSCE of the service) than those who do not. The aim of this study is to verify the value of the ECOX tool in improving the final grade for end-of-training OSCEs compared with standard learning methods during the training course.

42,"Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare disease in adult patients with mean survival time of less than one year. It is characterized by systemic progressive vascular remodeling. In addition, the severity of the disease is characterized by functional limitations due to the presence of right heart failure. Due to the nature of the disease, which is characterized by continuous disease progression, treatment, such as PAH-specific medications, needs to be adjusted according to the degree of functional heart failure and the presence of comorbid factors. In addition, patients' understanding of the disease also needs to be improved. With the rapid spread of the Internet worldwide, patients have more and easier access to it. We aim to develop a PAH web-based health care program based on clinical data and to evaluate the effects of the intervention on ameliorating social support, self-care ability and active tolerance, and improving symptom distress, anxiety, depression and quality of life in patients with PAH. This research is to develop a comprehensive health care model via the Internet, which is applicable worldwide, that can be used to guide patients and provide health care services to patients. With the intervention of the web-based program in the second year, the patients will have an electronic diary to record on a daily basis. Through this process, patients can record the daily symptoms and severity and they can report their conditions to the attending physician. We can then adjust the prescription according to the changes in the condition. This study is to establish a comprehensive management model for patients with PAH based on the medical application and electronic diary of the Internet. After the research and publication process, patients can also participate in the study and experience the treatment at home. We will invite at least 5 patients from each study site to participate in a one-hour online group discussion on treatment and management plans to discuss the effectiveness of the web program in promoting patient empowerment.


Input Text: Effects of Low/High Intensity Interval Training on Cardiorespiratory Fitness and Functional Muscle Strength

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The main objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the low and high intensity protocol on cardiorespiratory fitness, functional muscle strength, and biomechanical variables (knee and hip joint angles and muscle activation) as well as post-activation potentiation in recreationally active subjects.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) may be considered the most important health-related fitness parameter. The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends that adults engage in a minimum of 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 min) of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (MPA) per week. However, current literature demonstrates that a significant percentage of the population fails to meet this minimum requirement. Since insufficient or lack of CRF is a risk factor for almost all non-communicable chronic diseases, improving CRF is becoming a major public health challenge worldwide. Moreover, the aging population shows a decline in CRF, which is partly due to the loss of muscle mass and strength. Despite numerous studies on strength training for improving CRF, the benefits of strength training on CRF remain controversial. As a consequence, current recommendations of aerobic physical activity for health-related benefits, regardless of the mode and intensity of exercise, still do not address a clear strength training recommendation. Interval training (IT) is a time-efficient, feasible and enjoyable type of exercise and different exercise intensities and protocols are associated with varying physiological adaptation. To date, no systematic investigation of the different effects of interval training and mode-matched continuous exercise on CRF and the mediating effects of muscle function and joint mechanics have been conducted. It has been hypothesized that high-intensity interval training promotes a more pronounced improvement of CRF than low-intensity interval training. Considering the loss of muscle strength, we also hypothesize that low and high-intensity interval training equally improve CRF and muscle strength in active, healthy subjects.

43,"Objectives 
Overall quality of life and its components (physical, mental and social functioning, psychological well-being and disease specific quality of life as well as self-confidence)  will be measured by standardized questionnaires (SF36, QOL-MLD, KIDSCREEN 27, Zarit Burden Scale, EQ-5D-5L and the respiratory specific EQ-5D-Resp Questionnaire). The following study specific objective has also been formulated:

1)    Estimate the change in overall quality of life in patients with ALS receiving life-prolonging treatment with LTMV when compared with patients with ALS receiving usual care (standard supportive care without LTMV), assessed by the SF36, the QOL-MLD and the KIDSCREEN 27 questionnaire. 

The following questions will be tested:

1)    Which are the major contributors to the change in overall quality of life (assessed by the SF36, the QOL-MLD and the KIDSCREEN 27 questionnaire)? 

2)    Which socio-demographic factors are related to the change (assessed by the SF36, the QOL-MLD and the KIDSCREEN 27 questionnaire) in overall quality of life in patients with ALS receiving life-prolonging treatment with LTMV when compared with patients with ALS receiving usual care (standard supportive care without LTMV)? 

3)    Which socio-demographic factors are related to differences in health-related quality of life at baseline (in patients with ALS receiving life-prolonging treatment with LTMV when compared with patients with ALS receiving usual care (standard supportive care without LTMV)? 

4)    How do overall quality of life and its components differ between (a) partners of patients receiving LTMV and partners of patients receiving standard supportive care (b) children of patients receiving LTMV and children of patients receiving standard supportive care (c) caregivers of patients receiving LTMV and caregivers of patients receiving standard supportive care? 

How the study will be conducted and what data will be collected: 
All patients with ALS that are treated at the LTMV Clinic at Oslo University Hospital 
Rikshospitalet  are eligible to participate in this study. Eligible partners of patients and children of patients with ALS are also invited to participate in the study. The following data will be collected: 
•	Sociodemographic data (age, sex, education, cohabitation status, household income, smoking habit) 
•	Baseline assessment of sociodemographic factors in a subgroup of partners of patients and children of patients with ALS 
•	Health-related quality of life data in a subgroup of  partners of patients and children of patients with ALS using the same quality of life questionnaires as mentioned above. Partners of patients and children of patients with ALS only have to fill out the questionnaires once. 
•	Data about the severity of the disease of patients receiving LTMV (assessed by the revised El Escorial criteria for clinical diagnosis of ALS, ALS Functional Rating Scale) and patients receiving usual care (standard supportive care without LTMV) (assessed by the ALS Functional Rating Scale) 
•	Data about the change in the severity of the disease in both groups and the clinical need for invasive ventilation support among patients receiving LTMV.  

To describe and compare the two groups in a standardized way the following indexes will be calculated: A general index of health-related quality of life (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10) 
•	An index of overall quality of life (assessed by the SF36, the QOL-MLD and the KIDSCREEN 27 questionnaire) (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10) 
•	An index of health-related quality of life in children and adolescents (assessed by the KIDSCREEN 27 questionnaire) (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10) 

The following indexes will be calculated: 
•	An index of the change in overall quality of life in patients receiving LTMV when compared with patients receiving usual care (standard supportive care without LTMV) (mean = 50, standard deviation = 10)

45,"Rationale 
----------------
Ocrelizumab (OCR) is a new-generation fully-humanized antibody that induces selective reduction of total lymphocytes through binding to the CD20 receptor. The initial studies had shown that OCR is efficacious, in terms of relapse reduction, with a significantly positive impact on structural damage as measured by MRI lesion activity and reduction of new T2 lesions. Furthermore, OCR treatment was associated with an increased risk of infections. 
Since the initial studies, OCR is approved by the US-FDA (Food and Drug Administration) and European Commission (EC) for the treatment of RRMS and PPMS. In the 2018 European Treatment Guidelines, this medication is used as a treatment option, and the most frequent dosage regimens are defined as the 24-months induction phase, corresponding to the initial treatment, and the subsequent 12-months long-term treatment: 4 × 2 weeks (infusions 0, 1, 2, 3), 3 × 1 year (infusions 0, 1, 2), and 2 × 1 year (infusions 0, 1). At this time, there is no strong evidence that justifies an optimization of this dosage regimen, especially in consideration of the increased risk for infections. However, there are two points that have not been discussed in the 2018 Treatment Guidelines: the efficacy of biannual administration and the impact of treatment interruption on the efficacy of subsequent treatments. Recent findings in MS suggest that in about 65-70% of patients, a 2-years treatment-interval may reduce the risk of developing infections and thus represent an important strategy for optimizing the efficacy/risk-balance of OCR. Furthermore, there is no evidence regarding whether a reduction of the dosage interval from annual to biannual administration during the induction phase may lead to a reduction in the rate of relapses in the following months and to a reduction in the number of new MRI lesions when compared with annual administration. Last but not least, there is no data available with regard to the safety and immunological perspectives of treatment interruption. 
In summary, based on our preliminary findings and other available data, our hypothesis is that biannual administration of OCR during the induction phase, in comparison with annual administration, will result in fewer new MRI lesions at 2 years. Treatment interruption after 2 years and its effects on immunological perspectives and rate of relapse at 2 years following treatment interruption have never been explored. Our multicentre randomized study will provide valuable information for further optimization of the treatment of RRMS with OCR. 
 
Objective
-----------------
The aim of this study is to evaluate, whether a 6-months treatment interruption of OCR, after a 24-months induction treatment, results in a reduction in clinical relapses and new MRI lesions at 2 years (M24), as compared to 6-months biannual administration of OCR during the induction phase. 
 
Primary outcome measures
-----------------
Patients undergoing 6-months biannual administration of OCR (M26, M38, M54) versus 2 years of annual administration are expected to present fewer new or enlarged T2 lesions at 2 years (M24), with no intercurrent MRI examinations. MRI readings at inclusion and M24 will be performed by a single radiologist blinded to the treatment arm. 

Secondary outcome measures
-----------------
Patient demographics, relapse rate, EDSS scores, number of OCR infusions.

Participant inclusion criteria
-----------------
The study will enroll patients with RRMS, aged ≥18 years, as part of their routine follow-up. Patients must have completed 2 years of the initial OCR treatment and present with no relapse for at least 18 months prior to inclusion. All patients must have signed a consent for treatment and for the use of their data in the current trial. Furthermore, all patients must be affiliated or beneficiaries of a social insurance scheme. Written informed consent must be provided by all patients prior to any study-related examination. No prior patient/public involvement was undertaken.

46,"20% increase in number of patients with early stage CRC can be expected in the next decade. Currently, 25% of patients diagnosed with CRC are ≥ 75 years of age. These two observations may suggest a future increase in CRC surgical treatment of frail elderly patients. Colon cancer is a heterogeneous group of cancers with different growth levels and biological characteristics, necessitating the use of tumor-tailored therapy. We have previously published a feasibility study showing that CELS is technically feasible, and the survival is non-inferior to Standard Surgery. The aim of the present study is to examine if CELS, a hybrid oncologic surgery that leaves the colon intact, in comparison to Standard Surgery, results in decreased patient-reported postoperative recovery in frail elderly patients suffering from a diagnosis of early stage CRC. Secondarily, we will investigate the short- and long-term surgical and oncological effects. The investigators hypothesis is that the CELS procedure will result in a better short-term recovery and lower complication rate in frail elderly patients. Moreover, the CELS procedure will result in equal long-term oncological effects compared to Standard Surgery."

49,"18FDG (PET) is well known to detect malignant brain lesions. However, it is unable to distinguish tumor periphery from tumor core. Here, we propose to develop an MRI method, called activity MRI (aMRI), which utilizes the same kinetic approach as PET, for the same purpose: the delineation of tumor periphery from tumor core. The MRI method is also validated by direct comparison of aMRI to PET.

Preliminary experiments have shown that the aMRI metabolic parameter kᵢₒ*V, (an MRI-specific parameter describing the uptake and wash-out of contrast by microvessels) is sensitive to the perfusion of brain tumor regions. Our clinical hypothesis is that aMRI will be more effective than PET in detecting tumor periphery using kᵢₒ*V as a metabolic parameter.

| Mean values of kᵢₒ*V of the entire tumor region | In subjects with glioma brain tumors, outlines of tumor regions will be defined by post-contrast T1 magnetic resonance images. Mean values of kᵢₒ*V of the entire tumor region will be obtained and in normal-appearing contralateral regions for comparison. The profile of mean values in these regions will be evaluated for efficacy in metabolically distinguishing them, and evaluated for correlation with the co-registered flurodeoxyglucose F-18 (¹⁸FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) (standardized uptake value maximum [SUVmax]) data. The observation of robust correlation with PET, would validate activity magnetic resonance imaging (aMRI) as a metabolic sensor. | Up to 1 year |

52,"OBJECTIVE: In this retrospective series of 53 patients from three independent study sites it is shown that tracheal stenosis following percutaneous tracheostomy can either be treated conservatively or by APC or loop extraction. A multicenter prospective randomized trial comparing conservative treatment with APC treatment was started. 
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between September 1992 and December 2002, 72 patients (31 women, 41 men) underwent percutaneous tracheostomy. Fifty three patients (14 females, 39 males) were followed up continuously until December 2001. The clinical data of the patients were recorded and retrospectively evaluated. The following criteria were evaluated: technical success, time intervals between intervention, clinical outcome and secondary surgical treatment. Patients of both sexes and any age were eligible for the study at diagnosis of tracheal stenosis. Results are shown separately for both sexes and a subgroup analysis is made of patients who were alive and without tracheotomy. 
RESULTS: The mean interval between tracheostomy and the appearance of the stenotic focus was 4.5 months and it was 6.4 months in males and 2.7 months in females (p=0.09). All patients had the stethoscope sound and 42.2% had shortness of breath. The clinical diagnosis was pressure sores in 33 patients (62%), excessive secretion in 9 patients (17%) and a combination in 11 patients (21%). The anatomic localization of the stenotic focus was the second tracheal brace in 40% of cases, the third in 15%, the upper third, lower third and glottis in 5.4% (n = 5) respectively. In female patients the tracheal stenosis was localized at the second tracheal brace more often than in male patients (n=11 vs. n=22 females vs. males (p <0.05). Overall, 12 cases were treated conservatively and 41 cases were managed with APC, cryotherapy or loop extraction. The initial indication or treatment method was not randomized. Technical success was attained in 9 patients treated conservatively and in 40 patients treated by APC (95.3% of cases). Reintervention was seen in 18.6% of cases. Clinically satisfactory outcome was attained in 9 cases. Patients of the survival group showed a lower rate for reintervention (20.5% vs. 45.5%, p <0.01), 8 patients in the survival group had a successful decannulation; 4 patients had stridor requiring reintervention. Patients without tracheotomy had similar findings. There were no statistically significant differences in the number of patients who needed additional surgical treatment and stents between the two treatment groups but the total number of patients in the conservative group was too small to make a valid comparison. 
CONCLUSION: Tracheal stenosis following percutaneous tracheotomy can be treated conservatively or by laser or cryotherapy in selected cases. An initial conservative treatment cannot be recommended.

53,"AIM: To improve mental health and quality of life among drug-using people attending community-based organizations (CBOs) in Haiphong (Northern Vietnam) by providing a community-based specialized psychiatric intervention for people receiving psychiatric care (n = 302), for those identified and/or referred with serious and unmanageable mental health disturbances that cannot be treated within the current general mental health care structure. HYPOTHESIS: Mental health problems are widespread among drug-using people in Haiphong with one-third of mental health consultation related to serious and non-stabilizable psychiatric disorders (i.e. psychotic conditions, suicidal ideations, severe depressive states, bipolar disorders). However, CBOs and methadone clinics are ill-equipped to address these disorders due to a lack of trained staff, insufficient access to outpatient psychiatric care, and the stigma and discriminatory attitudes towards people suffering from these disorders.
METHOD: The study will be conducted on two groups of participants: (1) People receiving psychiatric care, and (2) the control group. Individuals diagnosed with a mood or psychotic disorder will be seen by a psychiatric team composed of a psychiatrist, psychologists and nurses in order to determine the need and form for psychiatric intervention. The latter will be determined according to standardized psychiatric assessment scales, and the form of intervention could be pharmacological and/or non-pharmacological, based on the psychiatrist evaluation. Other patients who are not diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder, will be followed up and offered basic psychiatric information.
CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING:
- The implementation of the intervention will be based on the participatory approach and the WHO mental health Gap action program.
- We will recruit 600 participants based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria (Sexes Eligible for Study). 200 in the intervention arm 400 - 200 HIV-positive and 200 HIV-negative - in the control group).
- Recruiting will be done in community-based organizations / methadone treatment centers / general population.
- We will use a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods to collect data and will follow participants for a 1-year period. Inclusion criteria will include:
o   18-65 years of age.
o   Active HCV or HIV positive infection.
o   HIV-positive subjects will be required to have initiated ART at least 2 weeks before recruitment.
o   Psychiatric consultation in an urban CBO, methadone treatment centers or general population.
o   Willingness to provide written informed consent.
o   Availability to be followed up during the 1-year follow-up period.
- Control group of HIV-, HBsAg-, HCV-negative individuals will also be recruited for control purposes:
o   18-45 years of age.
o   Active heroin or methamphetamine use (use during the last 30 days).
o   Subjects will need to attend the same urban CBO, methadone treatment centers.
- Exclusion criteria will include:
o    Severe psychiatric condition requiring immediate hospitalization in the mental health department.
o    Severe associated disease requiring specific treatment incompatible with a psychiatric ambulatory follow-up and treatment.
o    Any condition that might compromise the safety of the patient by participating in the study.
o    Any associated condition (drug addiction, chronic alcoholism, etc.) that might compromise the participation of the patient.
o    Plan to move out of Hai Phong in the next 12 months;.
o    Person deprived of freedom by a judicial or administrative decision.
o    Subject already involved in a research protocol.
o    Subject who has already received a psychiatric consultation in the context of the DRIVE study in Hanoi (DM1).

54,"Background and Rationale {9}
Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) has a broad spectrum of clinical applications in medicine, dentistry and veterinary medicine due to the potential of this technique for increasing the sensitivity of biological processes to the therapeutic effects of light, including bacterial inactivation . PDT uses a combination of photosensitizer (PS), light and tissue oxygen to produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby achieving microbial inactivation. Photosensitizers are synthetic or natural substances that can be photoirradiated in the presence of oxygen, thereby inducing a state of reduced energy known as an exciton . The most common PDT-induced effects are free radicals production inside cell membranes, leading to the destruction of cell integrity. In addition, PDT induce mitochondrial permeability transition, release of proteases, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, inhibition of DNA-repair enzymes, and production of inflammatory mediators. In clinical dentistry, PDT is most commonly used for the treatment of peri-implant disease, oral herpes, and endodontic infections . Although reports on clinical applications of PDT in dentistry are rare, recent research studies have suggested that PDT is a promising alternative to conventional endodontic treatment for improving disinfection of the root canals, particularly for persistent infections of the root canal that respond poorly to standard endodontic therapy and can cause a high rate of postoperative complications .
Purpose (objective) and justification
The purpose of the study is to compare the effectiveness of conventional endodontic treatment with that of endodontic treatment combined with PDT in patients with apical lesion. The main question is: “What is the effectiveness of conventional ET combined with PDT associated with methylene blue in root canal disinfection compared to conventional ET?” The secondary question will be: “Is there a difference between placebo and PDT associated with methylene blue?” In addition: a. Is there a difference between PDT associated with methylene blue and no PDT in apical lesion reduction?; b. Is there a difference between PDT associated with methylene blue and no PDT in the success rate of endodontic treatment?
Main hypothesis (or) research question(s):
H0: PDT associated with methylene blue does not have superior efficacy to conventional ET for disinfection of the root canals. H1: PDT associated with methylene blue is superior to conventional ET as a strategy to disinfect root canals.
Secondary Hypotheses:
H2: There is no difference between PDT associated with the use of methylene blue and placebo in the size reduction of the apical lesion.
H3: There is no difference between PDT associated with the use of methylene blue and placebo concerning the success rate of endodontic treatment.
Scientific Novelty
The endodontic treatment is the gold standard treatment for the management of teeth with internal pathology, which affects the lives of many people in the world. The aim of endodontic treatment is to eliminate both the source of infection and the cause that allowed its installation. Conventional endodontic treatment has a high rate of success. However, in patients with severe and periapical periodontitis, the success rates of conventional endodontic treatment are lower (8–12 %). The PDT associated to the endodontic procedure may provide an alternative option to improve root canal disinfection, as it has achieved promising outcomes in experimental studies , but conflicting results are found in in vivo studies . The literature review carried out in this project did not identify any clinical trials that investigate the effectiveness of PDT when added to conventional endodontic treatment, the results of published clinical trials with more than 75 patients and a follow-up period of more than 10 months being conflicting . Therefore, the present clinical trial is innovative and unique as there is an evidence-practice gap that may be clinically significant due to the high incidence of endodontic disease.
The present trial has the potential to generate important new knowledge about the effectiveness of PDT associated with conventional endodontic treatment, thereby improving its results in patients with apical lesion.
Objective of the study
The objective of the present study is to compare the effectiveness of conventional endodontic treatment with that of endodontic treatment combined with PDT in patients with apical lesion. Specific objectives: - To compare the effectiveness of conventional endodontic treatment with that of endodontic treatment combined with PDT in the reduction of the size of apical lesion"
55,"85% of children diagnosed with ASD will continue to suffer from a psychiatric disorder past their twenties. The main factors affecting the future outcomes of ASD patients are the individual's genetic code, the severity of ASD during diagnosis, and the extent of possible support from family and close friends.
CBD alone and the combination of THC/CBD were used to administer the treatment. Participants were evaluated using clinically validated scales, including the Scale of Primary Outcome Measures (SPOTS), and a subset of participants were assessed with MRI scans to monitor potential structural changes in the brain.
The primary hypothesis of the study was that the administration of single or combined THC/CBD would improve participants’ autism symptoms and functional abilities. The results did not support this hypothesis. Although some participants experienced a reduction in anxiety, the treatment did not produce any significant changes in other areas, including social interaction, language, or sensory processing.
The MRI scans revealed no significant structural changes in the brain, indicating that the treatment did not have any direct effects on the central nervous system.
The study did not produce any evidence to support the use of medical cannabis as a treatment for autism. Further research is needed to identify potential benefits and risks of using this treatment in individuals with ASD."
56,"90% of solid cancers rely on signaling networks. For this reason, all clinical trials and treatment protocols target cancer cell survival pathways. Despite years of research and the availability of novel, more precise cancer therapies, patients continue to die from cancer. This is especially true for advanced metastatic disease. In this setting, cancer cell re-program their genetics to survive cancer therapy. A central target for cancer therapies is the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein, which is located on the surface of cancer cells and is thought to be responsible for their cancer cell characteristics. In fact, HER2 is an addictive drug target with known on-off mechanism(s): i) HER2 is over-expressed on the surface of cancer cells, often leading to excessive cell growth and proliferation (HER2 as ‘drug addict'); ii) HER2 is a potent amplifier of cancer cell sensitivity to chemotherapy (HER2 as ‘turbo drug'); iii) The development of resistance to cancer therapy can be driven by HER2-dependent cancer cell re-addiction (HER2 as ‘bypass drug’). Thus, cancer cells that initially rely on HER2 signaling to induce tumor growth and proliferation can acquire a different HER2 addiction signature in response to cancer therapy. Despite this, the dynamics of HER2 addiction are poorly understood in cancer patients. For this reason, our main objective is to capture and characterize HER2 addiction and oncogene addiction in general at the level of DNA circulating in blood (circulating tumor DNA/ctDNA) in a population of advanced metastatic breast cancer patients treated with HER2 addictive drugs (e.g. trastuzumab, pertuzumab, T-DM1, T-DXd). Based on several published and preclinical evidence, this project is likely to be a true game changer in the management of oncogene-addicted tumors, with unprecedented implications on individualized anti-cancer therapies.

We propose to perform a prospective pilot study on ctDNA dynamic changes in cancer patients from two sites: Institut Català d'Oncologia (ICO) and IEO Università di Milano (IEO), with a total of 40 HER2-positive patients recruited. This is an important number since we expect to capture enough dynamics of the HER2-addiction/oncogene-addiction signature. For instance, we expect to find a median of 5–10 alterations circulating in one 200-microliters sample. It is likely to detect in ctDNA many of the 500 HER2-altered genes (both alterations and losses). We consider this as a pilot project, which will be a critical study for generating scientific data and preparing a larger study in the near future.

In this study, we aim to find the right diagnostic and/or molecular targets and the right approach to select patients who would be able to benefit of HER2-specific cancer drugs. For this reason, we plan to perform one blood sample (5ml) every three weeks, starting at recruitment and until progression by medical imaging. In addition, we anticipate that this study will have a strong impact in terms of clinical research and will be the first step toward an ‘ERAS’ (ERAdication of Solid Tumors) clinical trial based on our novel approach involving HER2 dynamic monitoring by ctDNA liquid biopsy. This is truly essential, since it would allow avoiding a major limitation of oncogene-addicted cancer therapies, namely the risk of resistance development, which compromises the potential benefit of targeted cancer therapies."
57,"1) Aims: Given that earthquakes are frequently followed by PTSD, implementing and disseminating evidence-based treatments for PTSD, especially trauma-focused treatment approaches such as CPT, is a critical need. Implementing CPT in earthquake-affected populations, especially following large scale and major earthquakes such as the recent earthquakes in Türkiye, has not previously been explored. In this context, the aim of the proposed research project is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of CPT (N=60) in a sample of earthquake-affected adults in Türkiye. 2) Methods: 30 adult earthquake survivors diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder will be randomly assigned to the intervention group (CPT, n=15) or the control group. The control group will receive the existing psychosocial support options provided by the government and by non-governmental organizations. The participants will be contacted, assessed, and randomized between the 2nd and 5th week after the first earthquake. Outcomes will be assessed at 4 assessment points through online assessments. The CPT program will be delivered through online sessions of 60-minutes twice a week, totaling 12 sessions in the duration of 7 weeks. Following the completion of the intervention program CPT, the post-treatment assessment will be conducted individually. The follow-up assessment will be done for all CPT participants at 1 month post intervention. In addition, participants in the control group will be given the opportunity to be re-assessed after their exposure to the CPT program at 1 month post intervention."

Background and Objective
The study is a randomized control group study involving approximately 700 single-parent or teen mother - child pairs to determine the effectiveness of the CHI SJC Parenting Skills Home Visiting Program for families and children entering the home visiting program in rural communities in New Mexico. A control group of families will receive care as usual and will not receive the home visiting program. The study's primary goal is to measure the effectiveness of the CHI SJC Parenting Skills Home Visiting Program in improving the following outcomes at 5 years of age: cognitive skills, language and emotional development, emotional and behavioral problems, mental health, maternal stress, child health, family economic self-sufficiency, reductions in child maltreatment, linkages and referrals to community resources, substance abuse, delinquency, and criminal activity. Participants are enrolled at birth in home visits. Primary outcomes use longitudinal study data across several time points: baseline at enrollment (birth); 3 months post birth (6 months); 6 months post birth (12 months); 12 months post birth (18 months); 18 months post birth (24 months); 24 months post birth (36 months, 5 years old); 8 years old; 12 years old; and 15 years old. Secondary outcomes use data from administrative records from the Catholic Health Initiatives St. Joseph Children home visiting program and State, Federal, Tribe, or community offices or agencies.

62,"Background: Patients with multiple system atrophy (MSA) require continuous and special medical and neurorehabilitation attention, and the progressive, disease-specific disabilities may necessitate the involvement of non-specialist physicians and nurses (e.g. general practitioner or nurses providing palliative care). Despite that, only less than 5% of palliative care centres in Europe have specific protocols for the management of people diagnosed with MSA . Moreover, there is no consensus about the most cost-efficient and individualized treatment strategies in MSA beyond the general consensus reached by the European Federation of neurological societies-muscle disease (EFNS-MDS) and Movement Disorders Society (MDS) . Although the MSA Care European Network (MCEU-Neu) previously showed a strong association between individual healthcare preferences and the clinical outcomes of people diagnosed with MSA , the current paucity in the European MSA healthcare infrastructure does not fully accommodate the high level of individualized healthcare preferences of patients and their informal caregivers  .  
Aims: To determine whether a multidisciplinary, personalized symptomatic treatment plan combining the integration of telemedicine and mobile palliative care interventions for people diagnosed with MSA results in superior quality of life.  
Methods: This monocentric, randomized, rater-blinded study will enroll 46 adult individuals diagnosed with MSA according to the current MDS MSA Task Force criteria . To evaluate the study outcomes they will be scheduled for the following baseline (0-months) and follow-up (6-, 12- and 18-months) examinations/assessments: clinical, neurological, psychological and neurorehabilitation assessments; evaluation of individual healthcare preferences; online EQ-5D-5L completion; mobile-aided falls protocol completion; self-collected blood pressure and bladder diaries; neuroimaging (only if not available in the previous 12 months); and semi-structured interviews for caregivers’ burden assessment. 
The recruited individuals will be divided in two homogeneous subgroups (group 1 and group 2), stratified for sex, age, disease duration, MSA type and disease severity. Every month, between months 1 and 12, they will be encouraged to undergo neurological and neurorehabilitation examination by telephone or videoconference. Randomization will be stratified for sex, age, disease duration, MSA type and disease severity. 
Participants will be randomized to receive personalized best medical care either with or without monthly neurological teleconsultations (group 1 vs 2) . Upon completion of the final in-person assessment (month 18), all participants will undergo the following examinations: clinical, neurological, psychological and neurorehabilitation re-assessments; evaluation of individual healthcare preferences; online EQ-5D-5L completion; self-collected blood pressure and bladder diaries; online healthcare satisfaction surveys; online semi-structured interviews for the assessment of the individual healthcare preferences and burden of caregivers. 
Throughout the study period the investigators aim to enrol informal caregivers of all participants with MSA enrolled in the study. They will be scheduled for the following baseline (0-months) and follow-up (6, 12 and 18-months) examinations/assessments: online semi-structured interviews about the individual healthcare preferences and burden of caregivers. 
Exams and assessments 
The individualized treatment plan will be designed to meet the individualized clinical needs of the participants, and it will consider the following principles of good clinical practice, personalized medicine and individual autonomy and preferences: 
Baseline examination 
Monthly teleconsultations (group 2) 
* The teleconsultations will be performed through the CHES-HIT platform, which is an innovative cloud-based platform designed for the telemonitoring, consultation and supervision of participants enrolled in clinical research studies (e.g. randomized trials). 
In-person neurological and neurorehabilitation examination (every 3 months, between 6 and 18 months, from study months 6 to 18) 
* The neurological and neurorehabilitation examination will be carried out in-person . To minimize the burden of the participants, they will be encouraged to perform their own neurological and neurorehabilitation examination through online questionnaires and video recordings between monthly teleconsultation visits .

64,"The impact of neurochecks on sleep in critically ill is unknown. Given the high prevalence of delirium in patients requiring Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission, we need to further understand whether these examinations disrupt sleep and negatively impact patient care. We will conduct a single center prospective randomized controlled crossover trial that seeks to enroll adult patients admitted to the neuroICU after elective aneurysm coiling to better understand sleep-wake patterns as well as changes in behavior throughout a patient's admission."
65,"46 centers from HNCIG members around the world will analyze all pre-treatment CT scans of consecutive patients diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck region in real word situations that undergo treatment with surgery, chemoradiation (conventional or IMRT) or radiotherapy as part of their standard of care treatment, over a period of 12 years. iENE classification by both radiology and pathology will be undertaken (iENE defined as tumour extension beyond the main nodal target within the neck/primary tumour site area, with no definite separation from the surrounding nodes into separate planes and therefore infiltrating the parenchymal structure of the node. A nodal target is classified as positive if pENE occurs through any part of the nodal structure). Outcome measures will involve predictive and prognostic markers for recurrence and overall survival, to determine whether iENE is a significant prognostic indicator of overall survival and recurrence rates during follow up, and how these outcomes relate to HPV, smoking and alcohol status. If iENE is found to be a significant prognostic indicator in predicting these outcomes, the potential of radiologists being able to diagnose iENE via advanced imaging assessment will be examined as one way of potentially improving patient outcomes for both the primary tumour site and the nodal targets."
66,"Background: People with diabetes are at high risk of developing diabetic foot ulcer (DFU), which complicates in up to 60% of those affected with osteomyelitis (DFOO). DFOO can lead to foot amputations, which significantly reduces patients' quality of life. Bedside bone biopsy (BBB) is used to detect diabetes mellitus (DM) in chronic foot infections and can often prevent DFOO. Currently, few centres in France routinely use BBB due to a lack of evidence; therefore, we propose to conduct an Open-label Controlled Randomized Non-inferiority Trial (RCT) comparing BBB to conventional methods of bone biopsy. 

Study Objectives: The main objective of this study is to determine if BBB is non‐inferior to conventional BB to treat diabetic foot osteomyelitis (DFOO).  The non‐inferiority margin is calculated to be 15%. 

Methods: This is a two‐arm parallel group clinical trial. We will include 332 people with DM and DFU with a suspected DFOO, according to predefined criteria. All participants will be provided with the same general care regarding wound care, footwear recommendations, pain management, antibiotic therapy, vascularization (if necessary) and nutritional care.  To be included in the study, the participants will need to be eligible for conventional procedures of BBB,  including undergoing a blood sample screening for hemostasis. The primary outcome parameter will be the remission of DFOO at 12 months.  Data collection will be based on case record form completion and face-to-face interviews at 12 and 24 months. 

Study Population:  332 patients aged 18 years and older who are included in a hospital setting and have DFU with a suspected DFOO will be considered eligible for inclusion. 

Sample size & Statistical analysis: This study will include 332 patients.  The sample size calculation took into account the primary variable related to remission as a binary variable (remission vs no remission) and the non-inferiority margin fixed at 15%.  Under the null hypothesis, the following parameters will be assumed:  50% of participants will not have remission following BB and 30% of those will be re-amputated, there will be a 20% of crossover; these will be 80% for the group of people who will remain in their initial category and it is assumed that we will include 332 people.  The main analysis will use a Chi-2 test to compare the groups that have undergone a BBB to the groups that have had a conventional BB.  The main analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principle and will also take into account a sensitivity analysis using the same assumptions, then adjusting for the variable of localisation of the infection.  Analysis will be performed using the SPSS V.24 program. 

Ethics and dissemination:  Ethics approval for this study was obtained from the Comité de Protection des Personnes Île de France IX on 9 February 2021 (IDRCB, 2021-144, NCT05122881). The findings of this study will be shared widely through peer review publications and presentation at scientific meetings (ISWD, EFAS, SEPFG).

68,"5 million women develop cervical cancer every year in the world, with a death rate of 250,000. Cervical cancer is a major public health problem and the leading cause of morbidity and mortality among women in developing countries. One out of ten women will develop HPV-related cervical cancer during their lifespan and screening programs can help to reduce the risks of this disease. However, 30% of cancers are not detected by cytology. Therefore, identifying more sensitive markers could benefit not only screening strategy but also the management of women with HPV associated persistent infections at increased risk of the disease. The aim of this study is to validate the usefulness of HPV micro-RNAs (mi-Rs) as potential biomarkers of cervical carcinogenesis. Circulating mi-Rs are a promising novel class of non-invasive biomarkers that might help improve cancer detection, prognostication and the therapeutic management of the disease. The mi-Rs detected in this study will serve as a molecular signature that may be used to classify cervical cancer cases and to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments. In addition, these signatures could be applied to other cancers.

73,"Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) of major abdominal surgery are commonly seen after anesthesia induction and surgery and it will seriously increase the morbidity, mortality, length of postoperative hospital stay and medical consumption. PPCs are generally defined as the clinical abnormal changes in the lungs after surgery, such as lung infections (pneumonia), atelectasis, pleural effusion, bronchospasm, acute respiratory failure or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), as well as delayed recovery of pulmonary function. Relevant studies have shown that postoperative pulmonary complications are more common in patients undergoing Laparoscopic Colorectal Surgery. The incidence of pulmonary complications after abdominal surgery was reported to be between 9% and 40%. The reason for postoperative pulmonary complications after major abdominal surgery may be due to surgery-related shallow breathing, postoperative pain, long-term bed rest and mucociliary clearance disorder. However, it must be considered that the pathogenesis of postoperative pulmonary complications is mainly caused by the stress response produced by surgical insult and anesthesia. This stress response can cause pulmonary vasoconstriction, edema, and decreased diffusing capacity, leading to hypoxemia and hypercapnia, which in turn cause an increase in sympathetic activity and ventilation/perfusion mismatch. This vicious cycle eventually leads to a decrease in oxygen and an increase in carbon dioxide partial pressures in pulmonary blood gas analysis, an increase in peak airway pressure during mechanical ventilation, and worsening arterial oxygenation. The reduction in lung volume and respiratory muscular activation after major abdominal surgery due to surgery-related shallow breathing, pain, long-term bed rest, mucociliary clearance disorder, and diaphragmatic dysfunction may also be the main causes of postoperative pulmonary complications. Numerous studies have demonstrated physiological improvement related to prone positioning. Prone positioning consists of placing a patient face down. Prone positioning has been used for more than 40 years to improve oxygenation in patients who require invasive mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because of the positive physiological effects of prone positioning on transpulmonary pressure, lung compression and ventilation perfusion ratio, it has also been applied to non-intubated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF), to improve oxygenation and delay or even avoid the need for invasive ventilation. Currently, the mechanisms of prone position training are decreased lung compression in the gravity dependant zone,homogenisation of transpulmonary pressure, improvement of ventilation/perfusion ratio, and reduction of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) or patient self-inflicted lung injury (P-SILI). By placing the patient in the prone position, the lungs compression due to its own weight is reduced via a gravitational-dependent redistribution of fluids. In addition, the weight of the mediastinum is supported by the sternum, the stiffer part of the chest. At the same time, the diaphragm is displaced caudally, decreasing compression of the posterior-caudal lung parenchyma. Finally, in a triangular-shaped lung, more parenchyma is included in the dorsal half than in the ventral one resulting in a more aerated lung in prone positioning. So, the purpose of this study is to observe whether preoperative prone position training can reduce the incidence of pulmonary complications after laparoscopic colorectal cancer surgery. The participants were divided into two groups. Group PPT: Patients in the intervention group (PPT group) received the prone position training daily in the hospital, three times a day, and about 1 hours every times, for at least 3 days before surgery. On the day of admission to the hospital, the patients in the PPT group were instructed to perform prone position training by nurses who were previously trained by prone position training. Group C: Patients in the control group (C group) received standard perioperative care without any prone position training.

75,"2. Recruitment methods
-----------------
AGE SELF CARE sessions will be offered via the Boston medical center (BMC) Patient Engagement Program (PEP) website (https://patientengagement.med/). Individuals will be able to participate within the greater Boston area. 3. Recruitment period
-----------------
Recruitment begins after the intervention is approved by the Partners Human Research Committee. Advertisement of the program will begin by promoting it through the BMC PEP website and at the annual AGE in the LIVING Well program information table on AGE Day. BMC clinicians (who are part of the PEP consortium) will promote the program when they believe that their patients may benefit from the program or at the request of patients. The PI will personally reach out to patients using a database of BMC patients who consented to the PI contacting them in the future. The PI will also provide fliers with AGE SELF CARE information to the medical assistants in the geriatric and internal medicine clinics who can then talk to patients about the program and if interested, put them in contact with the PI. 4. Inclusion and exclusion criteria
-----------------
Eligibility criteria for enrollment include: Being a BMC patient age 65 and older, ability to understand English, access to a smartphone, tablet, or computer with reliable internet, and willingness to attend virtual group visits. Potential participants will initially screen with research staff through a brief phone interview (< 5 minutes) to assess their age and ability to understand English and use a computer. Participants will also answer yes or no to the following questions: I am interested in participating in a 10-week virtual program to improve my health. I understand I would be required to watch a total of 8 90-minute sessions including an opening 15-minute educational video. I am willing to share information about the program with other potential participants through my primary care provider and family members. If eligible, BMC staff will provide the potential participants with detailed information about the study. The PI will discuss the program in more detail during a second phone call and then participants will complete an IRB approved consent form prior to study enrollment.
Exclusion criteria include: Younger than age 65, established diagnosis of dementia, untreated psychiatric symptoms affecting group participation, hearing or visual impairment affecting participation in a virtual program, and pre-frail (ie, robust - 0 points, or frail - 3+ points on the FRAIL scale) on the pre-screener.

 5. Sample size
-----------------
Because the feasibility study is exploratory in nature, the investigators will not be seeking to draw any statistical inferences. The project team thus anticipates that n=12 (2 groups of 6) will be a robust sample size to allow for analysis of recruitment and retention metrics, and to allow analysis of qualitative data gleaned from interviews at the conclusion of the group visits.

 6. Randomization
-----------------
This interventional feasibility study does not involve a randomized controlled study design. The study intervention is AGE SELF CARE, a group visit program. The group visits will be offered to all BMC community-dwelling older adults who express an interest in attending and who meet the inclusion criteria. A group visit program has not previously been evaluated in this population, so it is unclear how many patients may want to participate. The investigators estimate that 12 participants will be sufficient to assess the success (in terms of recruitment and retention) of the study.

 7. Blinding
-----------------
This interventional feasibility study does not involve blinding. There will be no placebo, alternative treatment, or control group. The investigators expect it will be feasible to deliver the intervention successfully to a diverse group of vulnerable older adults (age 65 and older).

 8. Duration of visits (group sessions)
-----------------
The visit duration is 1.5 hours per virtual group visit session plus an additional 15 minutes to review the group visit questions.

 9. Dropouts and reasons for dropout
-----------------
Participants will be asked to complete the program in full, even if they have to miss 1 or 2 sessions due to illness or travel. If a participant is unable to complete the full program, the investigators will conduct a structured qualitative interview with the participant to determine the reason(s) for discontinuing the program. Potential reasons for discontinuation include: (1) physical inability to participate in the group visits (2) inability to join the group online due to technological barriers (3) negative experiences while attending the program and"
76,"1) To give insight to the demographics, clinical features and treatment modalities applied in geriatric rehabilitation units across multiple European countries. These are considered preliminary outcomes. 2) To give insight in the functional recovery and decline and the presence of complications during and after geriatric rehabilitation. These are considered the primary outcomes. This could potentially lead to improvements and innovation of post-COVID-19 specific geriatric rehabilitation care. 3) We wish to find answers to the above mentioned questions in order to improve the care that geriatric patients in Europe receive in times of pandemics/outbrakes. This leads to the following exploratory outcomes: the effect of frailty (Clinical Frailty Scale) and experiencing delirium during admission to geriatric rehabilitation (the presence of delirium is assessed with DOSS (Delirium Observational Screening Scale) or SQiD, Delirium Screening Questionnaire in Intensive Care) on recovery and decline. Effectiveness of the triage of patients in times of coronavirus / pandemics for admission to geriatric rehabilitation for treatment / recovery and quality of life during their rehabilitation trajectory. The course of recovery over time: ADL, Quality of Life, and post-traumatic stress syndrome will be studied and modelled using multilevel growth models with different functional forms (linear, quadratic, cubic, and even more complex forms). This longitudinal approach allows us to quantify the speed at which patients recover in the different dimensions assessed. This approach has never been used in post-COVID-19 patients and will help us to monitor recovery rates over time for different outcome measures (e.g. ADL, Quality of Life, fatigue, and cognitive status).

77,"SARS-CoV-2 infection in kidney transplant (KTX) patients on immunosuppressive therapy remains an important health problem despite vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 as they often exhibit a diminished immune response. This reduced immunity is related to the use of immunosuppressive agents, especially Mycophenolate Mofetil/Mycophenolic Acid (MMF/MPA). Everolimus is an intracellular inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin ( mTOR) with immunoregulatory effects. Replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in KTX patients may result in a stronger immunogenicity following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination including a better response to Omicron SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.

Due to the high incidence of infection with the Varicella Zoster virus (VZV) in the older population of KTX patients, prophylaxis with herpes zoster vaccines is highly recommend. However, several studies have reported a suboptimal immunogenicity of herpes zoster vaccination in KTX patients on immunosuppressive therapy including MMF/MPA. Therefore, replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus may also lead to a better immune response after vaccination with the Recombinant Zoster Vaccine (RZV).

The primary objective of this study is to investigate whether replacement of MMF/MPA by everolimus in KTX patients results in superior immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination (=primary endpoint) as measured by functional neutralizing antibody titer (=neutralizing antibody response) against SARS-CoV-2. The secondary objectives of this study are to investigate whether everolimus leads to a superior cellular and humoral immunogenicity of COVID-19 vaccination as compared to MMF/MPA (=secondary endpoints) and to evaluate safety of everolimus as compared to MMF/MPA (=exploratory endpoints).

In addition, this study aims to investigate whether everolimus is associated with higher protection against VZV infection in the period directly after kidney transplantation, as measured by neutralizing antibody titer against VZV. This will be one of the first studies to investigate this potential association.

Introduction: Physical therapy plays major role in the rehabilitation of burn patients; however, it has not been clearly demonstrated so far whether the rehabilitation program may have an effect on the liver enzymes level of burned patients. This study was performed to determine the effect of resistance exercise on the reduction of plasma liver enzymes level (AST and ALT) in patients who suffered partial thickness burn. Objective: The main aim of this study was to reduce liver enzymes elevation occurred post burn by using resistance exercise. Methods: Sixty patients who have partial thickness burn with burned body surface area (BBSA) about 30% to 50% will participated in this study after their release from intensive care unit. their ages will be ranged from 20 to 45 years. The participants will be selected from Orabi hospital and randomly distributed into two equal groups. 1. Group A (Study group): This group includes 30 burned patients who will receive resistance exercises 8 weeks (3 times/week) by using dumbbells and sand bags in addition to their physical therapy program (splinting, stretching ex. and ROM ex.) and medical treatment. 1. Group B (Control group): This group includes 30 burned patients who will receive their physical therapy program (splinting, stretching ex., strengthening ex. and ROM ex.) and medical treatment. Inclusion criteria: The subject selection will be according to the following criteria: Age range between 20-45 years. Male and female patients will participate in the study. All patients have burn with BBSA about 30% to 50%. All patients enrolled to the study will have their informed consent. Exclusion criteria: The potential participants will be excluded if they meet one of the following criteria: Cardiac diseases. Burn of sole of foot. Exposed hand or foot tendons. Lower limb amputation. History of liver diseases. Body mass index (BMI=kg/cm2)<30%. 
Data and Measures: In this study, plasma AST and ALT level will be measured using colorimetric method at the beginning (pre-test) and at the end of study using Spinreact® colorimeter (Bruges, Belgium) at 420 and 520 nm wavelength respectively. 
During the study, participants will received resistance exercises as mentioned previously for eight weeks or three times per week, while both groups will be taught how to perform stretching exercises and splinting for their burn and receive other physical therapy interventions. 
Outcomes: The main outcome of this study was to reduce plasma liver enzymes level in burned patients. 
Results: It was concluded that 8 weeks of resistance exercise program was able to reduce plasma liver enzymes level in burned patients. 
Conclusion: Adding resistance exercise to the treatment protocol of burn will prevent liver enzymes (AST and ALT) elevation post burn. ."
79,"Cervical spondylosis is a common condition defined by degenerative changes in the cervical spine. Neck pain, limited range of motion, and disability in daily activities are the most common symptoms. 
While heat therapy and strengthening exercises have been shown to be beneficial in the management of neck pain, the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention has not been well studied and may provide additional relief for patients with cervical spondylosis. We aim to evaluate the impact of upper fibers of trapezius stretching, compared to standard care, on neck pain, range of motion, and disability among patients with cervical spondylosis. 
The primary outcome measure is a reduction in neck pain intensity, measured using a numerical rating scale (NRS). Secondary outcome measures include changes in range of motion, disability, and patient-reported outcomes. We hypothesize that patients who receive the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention will demonstrate greater improvement in neck pain and functional outcomes compared to those who receive standard care. 
By conducting a randomized controlled trial, we aim to provide high-quality evidence on the effectiveness of the upper fibers of trapezius stretching intervention in patients with cervical spondylosis. If our hypothesis is supported, this study will provide valuable information on a simple and effective intervention to improve neck pain and functional outcomes in this patient population, which may ultimately improve their quality of life."
80,"This proposal focuses on the study of the effect of Tecartherapy on lower limb sprinting performance in amateur athletes. The main objective is to evaluate if applying Tecartherapy to lower limb musculature enhances an athlete's sprint performance. To achieve our goal, the investigators will compare parameters related to sprint performance (30-meter sprint  and electromyographic activity during 30-meter sprint and countermovement jump ) in a Tecartherapy-intervention group with a control (sham) group. If significant differences are found in terms of speed, electromyographic activity and countermovement jump parameters, the investigators will be able to claim that a single 25-minute Tecartherapy session improves sprinting performance. This knowledge could be used as an alternative therapeutic option for amateur athletes who experience difficulty with sprinting and may contribute to the design of programs that promote the improvement of athletic performance, even in the absence of a health problem.

83,"Background
-----------------
Sickle cell anemia (SCA) patients can suffer from multiple health concerns, such as anemia, chronic pain, pulmonary hypertension, and chronic infections (Jafri, Al Mualam, & Al Rousan, 2021). These manifestations can result in a decreased quality of life and have been associated with psychiatric disorders, such as depression (Lewis, Cullum, & Powe, 2013). Sleep disturbance, pain, and stress are factors that can impact the quality of life experienced by SCA patients. These factors can occur individually or in combination in this vulnerable population. 1 - Sleep Disturbance: The National Sleep Foundation considers sickle cell anemia (SCA) and sickle cell trait (SCT) as distinct sleep disorders, based on the results of an international survey of sleep disorders in people with SCA(Dementia, Roehrs, & Roth, 2000). Patients with SCA can experience poor sleep quality, which can be a consequence of the pain associated with the disease(Safyari et al., 2009). Sleep disturbance is a common issue among adults, children, and adolescents with SCA; it has been reported in up to 44.6% of patients(Safyari et al., 2009, Al-Hassoun et al., 2007, Gwinn, Ketterer, & Weitzman, 2001). The cause of sleep disturbance in SCA is complicated, but some studies have highlighted the role of pain, anxiety, and depression (Ebou, 2019, Gwinn et al., 2001). 2 - Pain: SCA is a hereditary blood condition that affects red blood cells. The condition can cause a range of health problems and impair the patient's ability to function. Pain is one of the common symptoms among SCA patients. It can range from mild to intense and can vary depending on the severity of the SCA and the patient’s general health. Pain can be caused by a number of factors, including stress, fatigue, and infection (Lee, Zuckerbraun, & Thomas, 2015). Moreover, SCA patients can experience pain because of the misshapen hemoglobin molecules. These molecules can block blood flow and cause pain(Lee et al., 2015). 
3 - Stress: Patients with SCA may also be more susceptible to stress due to the limitations the condition can impose on their activity levels, social interactions, and employment options(Safyari et al., 2009). In addition, many patients may face frequent hospitalizations and pain symptoms from their condition, leading to anxiety and depression(Safyari et al., 2009). 

Pain may also lead to depression and anxiety by affecting a person's quality of life and leading to social isolation(Dhruw, Powe, Gross, & Rosman, 2011). Anxiety and depression are common mental health concerns that can impact a person's overall health and well-being(Hickie & Warden, 2003). These conditions can impact a person's physical health, affecting their ability to perform daily tasks and participate in social activities. Anxiety and depression can also increase a person's risk of developing other psychiatric disorders, such as substance abuse and eating disorders. Sleep disturbance may result in reduced quality of life, which can affect various aspects of functioning. It can lead to fatigue and difficulty concentrating, which can affect job performance, mood, and overall physical and mental health(Al-Hassoun et al., 2007). Sleep deprivation can also increase the risk of developing chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease(Jafri et al., 2021).

Hypotheses: 

Null hypothesis: There are no association between sleep disturbance, pain and stress 

There are no association between exercise training program and sleep disturbance, pain and stress 

Alternative hypothesis: There are association between sleep disturbance, pain and stress 

There are association between exercise training program and sleep disturbance, pain and stress

84,"51 million people worldwide have dementia. Dementia is most common in older adults; it affects memory, language, thinking, and behavior. Dementia has high individual, interpersonal, and societal costs, with negative effects on caregivers of those with dementia. Dementia is associated with lower quality of life and increased mortality. The most cost-effective nonpharmacological intervention for individuals with dementia is cognitive stimulation therapy (CST), a group-based treatment that uses a variety of activities to improve attention, memory, and thinking skills. The VCU School of Medicine's Healthy Aging Brain Care Program (HABC) is an evidence-based, interprofessional program that provides CST to individuals with mild-to-moderate dementia and their family caregivers. The V-CST program has shown to improve cognitive functioning and quality of life. However, uptake of CST is low in the primary care setting. This is likely due to barriers to accessibility, primarily the limited number of trained individuals across our region. To support primary care clinicians in referring patients to the CST program we would like to develop an evidence-based, technology-supported, remote care program that can be provided across primary care sites. In this study, we will conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial with 115 participants with mild-to-moderate dementia, comparing remote CST treatment to Standard of Care treatment for patients referred to the CST program and recruited from our partnering primary care sites. We will assess the feasibility, including acceptability, fidelity, implementation, and sustainability of the remote CST program.

85,"Background
-----------------
Gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GERD) is a common type of dyspepsia, a term which describes any kind of complaint in the upper abdomen. GERD is defined by heartburn and/or regurgitation that does not respond to acid suppression treatment, and at least 1 of the following symptoms: retrosternal pain, sore throat, hoarseness, cough, wheezing, dysphagia (problems swallowing) or odynophagia (painful swallowing) (1,8). According to the international literature, 6-15% of the adult population is affected by GERD (6,13). However, the prevalence of GERD is likely higher due to symptoms being underreported (2,5,7). The diagnosis of GERD, is mainly based on the history of the patient with complaints. In addition, the 24-h esophageal pH monitor is also often included in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with suspected dyspepsia. Symptoms can occur alone without any physical correlate or there can be correlations with pathological results of the above-mentioned examinations.
In Germany, around 383,000 GERD-patients are registered. They have to attend the gastroenterologist or the surgeon, as they often have to be surgically treated. The  treatment of GERD involves lifestyle interventions, mainly adhering to the basic rule of not lying down after eating, but avoiding foods that may lead to reflux. In addition, acid-reducing medication, usually proton pump inhibitors (PPI), which reduce gastric acid production, are used. Surgical interventions are also possible for the treatment of GERD. The  treatment of anxiety and depression, on  the other hand, involves the use of psychotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or antidepressant medication. 
Aims of this study
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the possible association between symptoms of GERD and anxiety and depression. In this study we investigated the possible correlation between anxiety and depression in patients with symptoms of GERD during routine diagnostic workup procedures. 
Study design
-----------------
During routine diagnostic workup procedures at the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, we will collect the HADS questionnaire scores of patients who undergo diagnostic workup procedures for symptoms of GERD.  This study will collect data on each patient from February 2018 to April 2020: sex, age, BMI, and current/past diagnosis. These data will  be collected and summarized for the purpose of data analysis.  Patients will participate in this study if they visit our clinic and sign a consent form.

-----------------
Participants selection
In this study, patients from the outpatient clinic of the Department of General, Visceral, Tumor and Transplantaion Surgery (GVT) of the University Hospital Cologne, Germany, will be analysed prospectively as observational cohort study with one measurement time on admission. Participants will be all adult patients aged ≥ 18 years without any known psychological problems (cancer), with and without dyspeptic symptoms seen for suspicion of a (GERD‐)related disease to undergo  routine diagnostic workup procedures in our GVT outpatient clinic which include  upper-GI endoscopy, high-resolution manometry measurement and pH-Impedance testing.  Exclusion criteria are  patients who do not understand the German language, patients who are not willing to participate or  patients who are not willing to let their data be analysed.

Outcome measures
-----------------
Primary endpoint
The primary endpoint is the presence of anxiety and depression in patients with GERD, which will be measured by the HADS questionnaire score (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) during routine diagnostic workup procedures of patients at the GVT outpatient clinic of the University Hospital Cologne. In evaluating the HADS scores we labeled scores on the subscale of HADS-A of 8 and over 8 as anxious and those on the subscale of HADS-D of 8 and over 8 as depressed. It is differentiated between mildly (HADS score on the subscale 8-10), moderately (HADS 11 - 14) and severely (HADS 15 - 21) anxious or depressed.  
Secondary Endpoints
The secondary endpoints are correlation of reflux symptoms and the presence of anxiety and depression and the possible correlation"

91,"Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract characterized by granulomatous and crypt-disturbing inflammation. The disorder is associated with remissions and relapses. In addition to the classical manifestations in the intestines, Crohn's disease can be associated with extra-intestinal symptoms in both the gastrointestinal and extra-gastrointestinal tract. The etiopathogenesis of Crohn's disease is multifactorial and involves immune mechanisms, environmental factors, and genetic predisposition. Crohn's disease is a severe, chronic (degenerative), and often relapsing disease that has a tremendous impact on quality of life in both adults and children.(1)


BACKGROUND & RATIONALE: Therapeutic goal is to induce and maintain clinical remission. Treatment goals are: symptomatic remission as well as histologic remission, defined by the absence of intestinal ulcers. However, while mucosal healing is possible, it is often partial, transient, or never achieved.(1) Infliximab, a chimeric antibody directed against TNF-α, is an important tool for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) is an important signaling molecule in the inflammatory response. In patients with Crohn’s disease, the excessive TNF production could lead to an exacerbation of inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby worsen disease activity. Consequently, reducing TNF levels is expected to induce remission and thus reduce the risk of surgery and hospitalizations (1). INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE:  A new classification of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was presented by the European Crohn's and Colitis Organization (ECCO) Committee in 2015. The ECCO classification proposes a distinction on the basis of location, behavior and extent of disease. (2) According to the ECCO classification, inflammatory bowel diseases are classified into IBD-U (ulcerative colitis) and IBD-C (Crohn's disease) for adult patients . (1)

THE DUTCH GUIDELINES FROM ISCN:
This study is based on the Dutch Crohn's disease care guidelines published in 2019, by the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Study Group ( ISCN ). In these guidelines published by the ISCN, which are based on the Dutch national care guidelines for IBD (ISCN guidelines), the treatment of Crohn's disease is described as follows: First-line treatment with thiopurines is standard. Due to lack of efficacy and/or intolerance, a switch to biologic drugs is often necessary at the moment of diagnosis. The standard treatment consists of a combination of IFX and concomitant thiopurines. Since IFX is known to lose its effect with increasing duration of treatment, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate are often introduced after a certain period of time. Immunosuppressives are often continued for prolonged periods of time.(3) (4)

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to investigate the efficacy and safety of the combination between IFX and thiopurines(5) compared to IFX monotherapy, both initiated during induction of treatment. This may lead to the development of patient-specific treatment protocols with a lower dose of thiopurines or possibly methotrexate, which is preferred by many patients, leading to a much better quality of life (5).

HYPOTHESIS: The primary hypothesis is: In patients with moderate-to-severe Crohn’s disease, a dose of IFX 120 mg (combination therapy group) or 240 mg (monotherapy group) has the same efficacy (as assessed by corticosteroid-free remission) as a combination therapy of IFX and thiopurines (6mg/kg) (combination group). (5)


In order to be able to draw general conclusions, it is essential to study such important questions as this in a Randomized-Controlled Trial (RCT). In this study, the use of a combination of thiopurines and  Infliximab is compared to the use of Infliximab alone during induction of treatment. Due to the low frequency of Crohn's disease in the Netherlands, there are few RCTs comparing IFX monotherapy with combination"
92,"18780-04 The direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) are now recommended as a first-line option in cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation. However, current international clinical practice guidelines and product inserts suggest caution and/or avoidance in using DOACs in case of potential DDI, including DDI with anticancer therapies. In particular, potential important DDIs can affect the efficacy and safety of DOACs and/or anticancer therapies and/or other interfering medications in these patients. Based on the available published data, the potential risk of DDI in cancer patients is currently unknown and difficult to determine from the limited available published data. This study aims to describe the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting to identify factors (age, weight, renal function, co-morbidities, etc) influencing the PK profile of rivaroxaban and apixaban in adult cancer patients with venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation from a real-world setting"
93,"25% of children and adults suffering from asthma do not have a good response to the recommended asthma controller drugs (ICS /LABA /Leukotriene modifiers) and most of these patients will benefit from adding a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA). In real world clinical practice, asthma is usually well controlled with standard recommended asthma medications. It is assumed that the addition of LABA to the standard asthma regimen would increase the degree of asthma control and would also be associated with a clinically significant decline in the dose of ICS. Yet, in real life clinical practice and many retrospective clinical studies, the addition of LABA appears to be associated with a significant rise in the dose of ICS in most patients. The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of an inhaled short-acting beta-agonist as a controller drug for asthma. Most real life clinical practice studies that have used inhaled short-acting beta-agonist controller drugs have found them to be effective controllers for asthma and have not been associated with a clinically significant rise in baseline ICS dose or with increased AEs such as headaches or shaking hands during the course of treatment. Most of the patients reported a marked reduction in the number and frequency of rescue SABA drugs during the course of treatment. In addition, nearly half of them stopped the standard controller drugs such as ICS / LABA / Leukotriene modifiers. This study will clarify the mechanisms of the effectiveness of short-acting beta-agonist controller drugs for asthma, and may contribute to the formulation of future clinical guidelines.

Input Text: Effectiveness of Budesonide/formoterol in COPD patients with comorbid asthma

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Background: Asthma and COPD frequently co-exist; when both overlap in the severity of airway obstruction and symptoms, and there is a greater decline in lung function during COPD exacerbations , it is known as COPD asthma overlap syndrome (AOS) , COPD-AOS overlap syndrome - COPD asthma overlap syndrome (CC-CC). Some patients with AOS have severe airflow obstruction with high systemic corticosteroid requirements (CC-HICS). In these patients, treatment with inhaled high-dose corticosteroids combined with a long-acting beta-2 agonist (LABA), a short-acting bronchodilator (SABA), or long-acting bronchodilator (LAMA) may not be safe or effective with regard to efficacy and adverse events. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of budesonide/formoterol (BDP/FORM) in COPD AOS patients already receiving moderate doses of ICS (200-800µg budesonide a day) and other regular maintenance medications, with at least two exacerbations a year and at least one worsening of asthma symptoms on a daily basis with rescue SABA. The investigators will observe the results of the study for 12 months. Inclusion Criteria: AOS patients older than 40 years with a clinical history consistent with COPD defined as a smoking history of more than 10 pack-years and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 / FVC ratio between 0.7 and 0.8, will be enrolled in this study if they fulfil the following criteria: Post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥ 25% and ≤ 80% of the predicted value. At least one asthma exacerbation in the previous 12 months with rescue SABA. At least one worsening of asthma symptoms on a daily basis with rescue SABA. The regular use of maintenance therapy, including moderate doses of LAMA/LABA, long-acting anticholinergic drugs (LAMA) and ICS (with or without LABAs) at a stable dose for the previous 2 months. The inhalation techniques using spacers and puffs (according to the type of inhaler used by the patients) must be correctly performed. The doses of these medications should be unchanged during the last 3 months. Compliance as measured by self-report and/or the drug dispensing records must be > 90%. Exclusion Criteria: Uncontrolled asthma (defined as the symptom exacerbation requiring treatment with systemic corticosteroids in the last 2 months).

94,"Background
-----------------
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a burdensome, recurrent disease with more than 300 million people affected worldwide (Major Depress. Disorder, 2019). Current data suggests that by 2030, depression will be the 2nd leading contributor to disability and loss of work around the globe (Zhao et al., 2019). The negative health effects of depression are known to last far beyond the initial diagnosis and the disease itself is often underwhelmingly treated, despite the plethora of effective treatments. It is estimated that around 45% of people affected by depression will have an unsuccessful treatment event at least once. This means that the individual will not have a successful treatment outcome despite undergoing adequate treatments (Grohol, 2019). This often results in costly treatment options like electroconvulsive therapy or repeated hospitalizations, which places an enormous economic burden on the individual and society at large (World Health Organization. 2020). MDD is also commonly comorbid with a variety of other mental health issues, such as anxiety disorders and personality disorders. The presence of these comorbid conditions can increase the severity of depressive symptoms and make it more difficult to achieve remission. 
Depressive symptoms can have a profound effect on a person’s daily functioning, interfering with work, relationships, and overall quality of life. People with depression suffer from cognitive symptoms of depression, like impairments in memory, attention, and problem solving. These cognitive symptoms can make it more difficult to learn and retain new information, as well as to function effectively in day-to-day life. Depressive symptoms can also lead to emotional problems, such as irritability, anxiety, and even suicidal ideation. All of these symptoms can have a major negative impact on a person’s social and interpersonal functioning. 
The relationship between depression and social cognition can be thought of as bidirectional, meaning that both conditions can influence each other. To better understand this relationship, research has shown that people with depression frequently experience social anhedonia, which may be caused by the activation of particular neural circuits involved in social cognition (Holtmann, 2012). These circuits may become oversensitive to emotional cues, leading to an increased risk of developing depression. This suggests that targeting social cognition may be a novel and effective way to treat depression. Recent studies have shown that social rehabilitation can have a positive impact on patients with depression. It is thought that by intervening at the social level, it may be possible to help individuals learn new ways of perceiving and responding to social cues, thereby reducing the likelihood of developing depressive symptoms. 
In some cases, this can take many forms. For example, a person might receive cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to address their depression. CBT focuses on helping individuals change the way they think about and cope with stressful situations. It may also involve learning new ways of interpreting social cues. In other cases, a person might receive pharmacotherapy to treat their depression. This could involve taking antidepressant medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These medications work by increasing the levels of serotonin in the brain. They have been shown to be effective in treating depression, and can also be combined with CBT for optimal results. However, it is important to note that patients respond differently to SSRIs, and those who do not respond adequately may require another form of treatment, such as counseling or cognitive-behavioral therapy. 
Another approach that is being explored is the use of virtual reality (VR) to enhance social cognitive skills in patients with depression. VR technology can be used to simulate real-world social situations and allow patients to practice their social skills in a safe and controlled environment. This can be especially useful for patients who avoid social interactions, which can help them overcome their social anxiety and learn new ways of interacting with others. 
Virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET) is a form of VR therapy that has been shown to be effective in treating a variety of anxiety disorders, including social anxiety disorder and panic disorder. VRET involves simulating exposure to the feared situation or object in a controlled virtual environment. Patients are given exposure tasks to complete and are encouraged to face their fears and work through them. This allows patients to develop new coping skills and build confidence in their ability to manage anxiety-provoking situations. 
A study conducted by our team at VCU found that VRET was not effective in reducing social anxiety symptoms in adults with social anxiety disorder. However, these findings emphasize the importance of selecting appropriate populations for VR research.

96,"AMG 301 in Adult Participants With a Moderate to Severe Form of Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a rare, chronic, immune mediated disease associated with eosinophil inflammation of the esophagus. Patients with eosinophilic esophagitis typically present with symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, chest pain, inability to consume solid food, dysphagia lusoria and/or weight loss. Current standard of care treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis require regular endoscopic procedures with high re-occurrence rates. AMG 301 is being tested in this study as this drug may change how patients experience Eosinophilic esophagitis. The primary objective of this study was to compare the change from baseline in the esophageal eosinophil burden relative to placebo after 12 weeks of treatment as measured by peak biopsy eosinophil count in adults with Eosinophilic Esophagitis.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either subcutaneous (SC) injections of AMG 301 (150 mL) or matching placebo (300 mg saline) once every four weeks for 12 weeks. The primary assessment of study drug efficacy in both treatment groups will be the change from baseline to week 12 in esophageal eosinophil burden at peak esophageal mucosal biopsy. The peak esophageal mucosal biopsy for 14-day food exclusion (group A) and non-concentrated (group B) diet arms will occur approximately 3 hours after onset of last meal

97,"The overuse of antibiotics for nonsevere UTI has been largely described. 
A recent randomized clinical trial has shown that targeted prescription of antibiotics in primary care, based on the antimicrobial susceptibility of a urethral sample of women with nonsevere UTI, can decrease broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing. However, the use of these targeted measures is very limited as it is based on the analysis of urethral samples. Therefore, the use of urine cultures could meet a need in terms of implementation of targeted prescription of antibiotics to reduce the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics in women with nonsevere UTI. 
The main challenge for the implementation of such targeted measures to reduce the prescription of broad-spectrum antibiotics is that antibiotic susceptibility testings are rarely used, due to lengthy report times. 
As a result of these drawbacks, the investigators are planning to conduct a randomized clinical trial to investigate the impact of the dissemination of a selective reporting for antibiotic susceptibility testing of women with nonsevere UTI, on the rate of broad-spectrum antibiotic dispensing in primary care."
98,"Background
-----------------
Ischemic stroke is one of the leading causes of disability and mortality worldwide, which imposes a huge burden on families and society. Treatment for ischemic stroke primarily include thrombolysis therapy and surgical recanalization therapy. However, the efficacy of these treatments is limited. The only effective approach to restore blood flow and ischemic damage is thrombolytic therapy. Although intravenous thrombolysis with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rtPA) can significantly improve the functional outcome of stroke patients, its therapeutic time window is narrow and its frequency of intracranial hemorrhage is high. Mechanical recanalization therapy using endovascular thrombus removal methods significantly increases the number of stroke patients amenable to recanalization therapy, but its efficacy is also limited due to the difficulty of reaching the thrombus. Besides therapeutic recanalization, neuroprotective therapy has also become an important treatment strategy. Currently, there is a lack of effective neuroprotective medications. In recent years, a number of preclinical studies have found that valproic acid have a potential neuroprotective effect in acute ischemic brain injury, which can decrease infarct volume, reduce blood-brain barrier damage, and improve neurological function. However, the neuroprotective mechanism of sodium valproate has not been fully revealed, and there is still a lack of clinical studies to clarify the neuroprotective effect of sodium valproate in patients with ischemic stroke. In this clinical study, we try to explore whether sodium valproate could become a new therapeutic approach to improve the functional outcome after ischemic stroke.

Objectives and study design
-----------------
The goal of this study is to evaluate whether oral administration of sodium valproate (10mg/kg/day) can improve patients' clinical outcomes after acute ischaemic stroke and reduce brain lesion volume (the percentage of infarcted area within the ischemic area on brain DWI), and whether it can increase peripheral anti-inflammatory CD177+ neutrophils levels to reduce neuroinflammation caused by the infiltrated peripheral immune cells. The primary outcome is the proportion of patients with a favorable outcome (mRS score≤2) within 90 days. The secondary outcomes are (1) the proportion of patients with favorable outcome (mRS score≤2) within 30 days; (2) the detailed distribution of Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores within 90 days; (3) the detailed distribution of Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores within 30 days; (4) NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores at 3 days and 7 days; (5) changes of lesion volume from baseline to day 7. We plan to enrol 60 patients, including randomized subjects in sodium valporate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. The study design is a prospective pilot randomized controlled trial. Participants will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group. After giving informed consent, patients with acute ischemic stroke will be randomly assigned to low-dose sodium valproate group, high-dose sodium valproate group and placebo group (ratio 1:1:1). Besides receiving conventional treatment for stroke, 10mg/kg sodium valproate, 20mg/kg sodium valproate or normal saline will be given intravenously for 3 consecutive days, respectively. After admission, all participants will undergo routine assessments, including a series of neuroimaging tests including brain CT or MRI and vascular imaging. The detailed distributions of laboratory biomarkers, including peripheral lymphocyte subsets, blood serum sodium and potassium levels, serum creatinine and serum urea nitrogen levels, complete blood counts (CBC), serum glucose and other relevant biochemical indicators, will be recorded from admission to the end of treatment period or until death. Patients will be further assessed and evaluated on day 3 after admission, including clinical and imaging scores (the NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score, mRS score, etc.). All patients' disease progression and treatment information will be recorded.

99,"345 million people around the world suffer from hernias, which account for 17 million hospitalizations worldwide annually. Most patients undergo an elective surgical procedure to repair these hernias; however, this is associated with substantial complication rates. A recent metaanalysis of 25,000 ventral hernia patients undergoing repair found that nearly one in four developed an injury to the surrounding tissue, which accounted for a hospital cost of $4,554 to each patient. More than half of these injuries are linked to postoperative infections, which have been associated with a three-fold increased risk of readmission and a doubled chance of reoperation for hernia recurrence. In addition, hernias are highly associated with obesity and excess abdominal fat. Obese individuals have a 165% increased risk and are 28% more likely to undergo recurrence of their hernia. This highlights the need to tackle weight loss prior to the surgery itself. To our knowledge, there are no studies attempting to decrease weight preoperatively using a virtual weight loss assistant. The investigators plan to pilot test the feasibility of a virtual weight coach (VWC)-assisted intervention to promote weight loss in patients undergoing elective ventral hernia repair (VHR). Participants will be randomly selected to have either VWC-assisted weight loss or standard weight loss guidance per their surgeon. The investigators will analyze the data from participants that are using a preoperative, virtual weight loss coach. This virtual platform will be integrated with MyChart (Epic Systems) to provide coaching services for patients undergoing surgery. The VWC interface will provide a tailored diet plan, daily calorie goal, and weekly video calls for weight loss guidance from a surgeon-educated nutritionist. The VWC can be monitored by the patients' surgeon to evaluate patient compliance and assist with postoperative questions, thereby creating a collaborative experience. The investigators hypothesize that patients who use VWC-assistance to promote weight loss before surgery will ultimately have fewer hospital complications and lower readmission rates than those that use the standard approach."
100,"1.3. Mechanism of Mesenchymal Stem Cell-derived Exosomes Treatment MSC-secreted exosomes inherit immune suppressive properties from their parent cells, and MSC-evs may use various mechanisms to balance the immune system's function. One key mechanism is reprogramming and altering the phenotype of various immune cells. For example, the ability of MSC-derived exosomes to promote the survival of alveolar macrophages and shift their phenotype from pro-inflammatory (M1) polarization to anti-inflammatory (M2) polarization has been demonstrated in at least two studies. These findings suggest that exosomes can serve as viable alternatives to their parent cells, and this ability has also been reported to alter the Treg/Teff ratio to increase Treg and promote the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines[15,16]. Numerous studies have shown that MSC-secreted exosomes can be used to treat immune deficiencies, inflammation, ARDS, and other pulmonary diseases[19,20], so MSC-secreted exosomes may also be effective in treating the lung damage caused by COVID-19.Exosomes are one of the main active ingredients secreted by stem cells and are 30-150 nm in size. After nebulization, exosomes can directly reach the bronchioles and alveoli, which is conducive to the maximum absorption of drugs[21]. Multiple clinical trials have shown that intravenous infusion of MSCs and MSC-evs for the treatment of COVID-19 infection is safe and effective[22], and in the case of lung injury, the nebulization route provides a particularly effective drug delivery method to target lung sites. Therefore, we speculate that nebulized MSC-secreted exosomes may be an effective method for reducing COVID-19 lung damage and promoting recovery. 1.4. Clinical Case Studies of Stem Cell-derived Exosomes Recently, the inhaled anti-COVID-19 drug Exo-CD24, led by Israel medical center expert Nadir Arber, which is a combination of exosomes and CD24 protein, has shown promising results in early clinical trials. The drug was able to cure 29 out of 30 severe patients within 5 days of treatment and has the potential to treat COVID-19 patients within 3-5 days. Although Exo-CD24 has not yet passed phase III testing, it has shown great potential in the future[23]. The US FDA has approved the use of extracellular vesicles (EVS) for the treatment of COVID-19 through a Phase I/II trial conducted by Direct Biologics. ExoFlo, the EVS used, restores the health and vitality of patients by reducing sustained inflammation, promoting the revascularization of damaged tissue, and reshaping scar tissue. Domestic clinical studies have also been initiated, clinical research at the Fifth People's Hospital of Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province has confirmed that nebulized umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (HAMSCs-Exos) are a safe and viable treatment for COVID-19. The study was published in Stem Cell Reviews and Reports in June of this year and included seven critically ill COVID-19 patients. All patients tolerated the treatment well without evidence of adverse events or clinical instability during or immediately after nebulization. All patients showed an increase in serum lymphocyte count (median of 1.61×10^9/L vs 1.78×10^9/L), and lung lesions were reduced to varying degrees in all patients after inhaling HAMSC-Exos aerosols, with four patients showing significant improvement. Preliminary results suggest that participants' lung injuries were significantly improved[21]. However, most clinical trials using stem cell exosomes for COVID-19 infection have the following issues: (a) small sample size, making it difficult to effectively demonstrate the advantages of stem cell exosomes in COVID-19 treatment; (b) lack of a control group; (c) use of traditional two-dimensional production methods, making it difficult to scale up production of large quantities of exosomes for clinical treatment; and (d) lack of in-depth mechanism exploration for relevant phenomena. These problems hinder progress in the use of stem cell exosomes for COVID-19 infection treatment. To address these issues, this project proposes combining nebulized umbilical"
101,"Background: Endodontic treatment or root canal treatment (RCT) is the gold standard for restoring pulpal and apical pathology. However, the outcomes and quality of life of patients with successful RCT is not satisfactory compared to those in healthy conditions. Objectives: Therefore, research efforts to evaluate the effectiveness of endodontic treatment have been made over the years. Comparisons of endodontic treatments with different materials and methods were performed, most of which reported good results without long-term follow-up. In Vietnam, where the study was performed, the Ministry of Health recommended two products as materials for filling and sealing: epoxy resin-based sealers (ERS) and calcium silicate-based sealers (CSS). Although research on clinical applications of CSS and ERS has yielded varying results, there has not been a clear picture of the advantages and disadvantages of these two materials. However, it is well known that the final choice of endodontic filling materials often relies on their clinical performance, especially pain relief. Therefore, the investigators would like to find a rational solution to the treatment protocol in each particular hospital. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of two groups divided by two root canal filling materials: ERS and CSS. Methods: This study is a blinded randomized controlled trial. 130 teeth will be assigned randomly into two groups: Epoxy resin-based sealers and calcium silicate-based sealers. Following initial treatment, teeth will be assigned to one of the two groups by a random combination: CSS with AH Plus ™ sealer (Dentsply Sirona, Ballaigues, Switzerland) or ERS using RelyX ARC™ (3M ESPE, Saint Paul, USA). After that, a detailed clinical evaluation (tooth symptom evaluation, temperature testing, percussion, and palpation), radiographic evaluation (periapical radiograph) and pain evaluation using the Heft-Parker scale and pain-relieving time will be recorded. All data will be collected at one time for each patient every 24 hours for 1 week after the treatment. Results: The present study aims to identify a method of endodontic treatment for better pain relief after tooth treatment or root canal treatment. Based on clinical practice and findings from the previous studies, the authors will choose two types of materials that are widely used in Vietnam. Conclusion: This study is expected to have practical implications for endodontic treatment for better pain relief. Limitations: Because the number of endodontic treatments is limited, the number of samples may be small and the study may not be fully representative."

103,"1. Study design and setting: observational feasibility study in an Integrative Oncology clinic integrated into the Oncology department at Rambam Health Campus, and conducted between February and December 2020. 5. Objective and hypothesis: The objective of this observational study is to recruit and consent cancer patients who have a desire to incorporate supportive approaches into their care. There is no intention to randomize, enroll or otherwise manage this population for clinical or research intervention as it is outside the scope of the study. The investigators only want to observe this population and to obtain their feedback on factors that influence their decision to seek supportive treatments. They will receive information about existing supportive options available in the hospital, and a supportive approach will be offered to them. 6. Interventions: No intervention is planned - only observation of patients who make a decision to seek supportive treatment approaches. However, in the process of implementing these supportive therapies, they will undergo a holistic interview at baseline and be offered the relevant approaches according to the standard of care criteria. The patient's feedback on factors that influence their ability and willingness to utilize the supportive approach will be collected at each CIM visit. Patients who decide to use the supportive approach will self-administer a questionnaire at each CIM visit. 7. Sample Size: Based on the assumption that about 1,200 individuals per year are visited by the oncology department in our center, out of whom approximately 20% want to seek supportive care approaches in general, the investigators predict that at least 16 patients per month will be willing to take the supportive approach, and if 57% of patients come for the second consultation (as observed in previous randomized clinical trials), then a sample of 100 patients per year - 8 per month - will be included.

104,"The introduction of central venous catheters (central line, CVL) as a diagnostic and therapeutic device has greatly changed the management of acutely ill patients. However, despite the many innovations in design and care, CVL-related infections are still the most common complication at 7 to 17% per catheter day (1-3). The risk of infection after a CVL placement varies from 5 to 90% depending on the local conditions and the care-related interventions (4-7). Bacterial infection occurs mainly at the time of CVL placement and is therefore linked to the technique of placement (8). Septic thrombophlebitis is a significant infectious complication of intravascular devices. Its incidence is estimated at 16-23% of cases. The duration of intravascular devices in patients with septic thrombophlebitis is significantly increased (13-15 days versus 3 days) with an increase in the cost, the hospital discharge is delayed (about 15 days versus 8 days) (1-6).

Background: Non-Hodgkin lymphomas arise from B cells and are the most common type of lymphomas in the Western world. Within non-Hodgkins lymphomas, indolent lymphomas are cancers that grow slowly and are unlikely to spread to other parts of your body. Follicular lymphoma (FL) and Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) are types of indolent lymphoma. Currently, chemo-immunotherapy (cisplatin based) are the standard backbone therapies for indolent or aggressive lymphomas, but they are associated with severe toxicities such as myelosuppression (reduction in the number of blood cells), infections, hair loss, cardiac toxicities, and infertility. An unmet need for a novel and differentiated therapeutic approach for the treatment of relapsed or refractory indolent lymphomas is apparent in clinical practice. Odronextamab (REGN1979), an anti-CD20 X anti-CD3 bispecific antibody, is a CD20- and CD3-directed targeted immunotherapy designed to redirect a patient's own cancer-fighting T cells from the target B cell populations. Odronextamab is designed to selectively target CD20-positive B cell malignancies. 45 patients will be enrolled with approximately 27 patients in combination with lenalidomide and 18 in combination with rituximab, in addition to lenalidomide. With 27 patients per arm, this study has 80% statistical power to detect a difference of 15% between the 2 arms for PFS1 (see Section 4.4), with a two-sided significance level of 5%, assuming a 2-year median treatment duration and a 20% drop-out rate. The planned average duration of patient participation for odronextamab plus lenalidomide (OPL) trial participants is approximately 55 months (median 3.8 years). As odronextamab and lenalidomide are both currently approved for patient care in China, trial participants are able to continue accessing these medications after completion of their respective arms.

What has already been achieved? 
Sarcopenia (a geriatric syndrome characterized by progressive loss of muscle mass and function) is a predictor of adverse consequences of infections. In an exploratory pilot study, we observed that nasal NK (Natural Killer) cells and NK subsets are depleted in older adults, and that this phenomenon is stronger in older adults with frailty, low lung function and low sarcopenia-frailty cut-off scores, compared to healthy older adults. Moreover, NK cells and NK subsets also correlated with lung function tests; we found that sarcopenia-frailty index and lower lung function are associated with lower airway oxygen levels and more alveolar damage, suggesting that sarcopenia may negatively affect the integrity of the underlying tissue that supports the blood-gas diffusion process. Nasal NK cells and their antigen-related properties are correlated with sarcopenia parameters (muscle mass and strength), suggesting that the latter may affect both the function and composition of the former . 
Furthermore, a study by our group has already shown that nasal T cells (specifically CD8 T cells) are depleted in frail adults, specifically those experiencing recurrent nasal/respiratory infections, compared to healthy older individuals. The loss of these cells in the nose, as a result of their egress to the circulation, could contribute to the development of secondary complications. For example, in a murine model of pneumonia, we showed that intranasal vaccination is able to prevent migration of CD8 T cells from the nose to the circulation, and that this phenomenon is correlated with the lower clearance rate and severity of pneumonia. These observations therefore open new avenues for the development of future vaccination strategies. Taken together, we thus hypothesise that the loss of nasal T cells – induced by sarcopenia, as a consequence of loss of both muscle mass and function – affects lung function and renders older individuals more susceptible to pulmonary infections. These infections lead to further loss of T cells, and a vicious circle is initiated that worsens aging of the respiratory immune system and thus the ability to control infections, thereby increasing the severity of further symptoms and potentially contributing to death in extreme situations. 
The primary goal of this project is to determine why and how these processes occur, and to determine possible new strategies to reverse this phenotype – not only in frail, elderly individuals, but also in younger adults who are exposed to repeated infections and thus may already be on a trajectory to impaired T cell homeostasis. We expect that a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms will open future avenues for the development of new diagnostic tools and therapeutic interventions. More specifically, we aim to investigate if and how sarcopenia contributes to the loss of nasal T cells. To achieve this, we have defined the following 3 specific aims: 
 (1) Determine the stability of T cells in the nose in middle-aged and older individuals. 
 (2) Compare the abundance and composition of nasal T cell and other immune cell populations between healthy individuals and individuals with sarcopenia, and determine how these change over time. We hypothesize that sarcopenia is associated with loss of nasal T cell repertoire. 
 (3) Determine if and how sarcopenia and/or vaccination against a respiratory viral pathogen can modulate the abundance and functionality of T cell subsets, and whether this is associated with a better clearance of the virus and/or a higher risk of developing complications. We further hypothesise that nasal T cells homeostasis is affected in patients with recurrent pulmonary infections, and that this phenomenon is associated with the onset of COPD.

111,"1. Background
According to WHO (1999) dyspnoea is defined as a subjective experience of breathing discomfort. Patients with acute dyspnoea often require urgent or immediate evaluation and treatment. However, there is also a significant proportion of patients with dyspnoea (estimated to 1-3%) who are at a risk of experiencing a serious pulmonary or cardiac disease (such as pulmonary embolism, heart failure or pneumothorax) . Thus, dyspnoea is a presenting complaint with a broad range of different causes .
Pulmonary embolism is the leading cardiovascular cause of death in acute medical settings . A rapid evaluation and diagnosis is essential, since therapeutic strategies are effective if initiated early. Heart failure is another condition where prompt evaluation and initiation of therapy are essential since treatment delays leads to poor prognosis and higher mortality . Heart failure also increases the risk of hospital readmission .
However, other common causes of dyspnoea such as exacerbations of asthma and COPD can have different management strategies and need to be considered early in patients with dyspnoea .
It is estimated that exacerbations of asthma and COPD account for approximately 2 million emergency department (ED) visits and 1.7 million hospitalizations every year in the US . In 2018, more than 1 million acute admissions due to COPD-related exacerbations were recorded in Sweden . A study by the Epidemiology and Informatics team of the British Thoracic Society has shown that among the 1.5 million hospital admissions in England due to COPD, 76% of deaths (15% increase) and 58% of readmissions are among patients who die and/or are readmitted within 30 days  . Thus, acute COPD is often characterized by a high risk of hospital readmission in short intervals and this can lead to huge costs to the society .
The current ED triage system can create a situation where only severely affected patients are treated initially and discharged patients with suspected COPD- or asthma-related exacerbations are often later revisited to the ED. This means that the patients with suspected COPD do not receive prompt treatment according to national recommendations and the risk of overloading the health care system and/or patient dissatisfaction is high . Thus, even though dyspnea represents a common patient presenting complaint at the ED, further studies and validation of the accuracy and effectiveness of diagnosis and treatment strategies in patients with dyspnea is needed.
Currently, there is no proven diagnostic method or strategy that can be used to assess patients with dyspnoea. Risk stratification approaches in the ED have focused on triage and risk stratification using physiological and/or clinical parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature and oxygen saturation. The most widely used risk stratification approaches in the ED are based on these parameters, but many studies have shown that the clinical presentation and underlying mechanism are more likely to determine mortality and the need for in-hospital intervention (such as oxygen supplement) .
The initial 4 hours is known to be a sensitive window in the course of many diseases, such as pulmonary embolism and heart failure, and for this reason many studies have focused on developing tools to identify this patient group early in the ED . Since dyspnoea is usually a symptom of a more serious underlying disease, early identification and assessment is essential in patients with acute respiratory distress at the ED.
Emergency medicine specialists are typically responsible for the initial patient assessment at the ED and they are also expected to provide further treatment decisions when necessary. The initial clinical assessment is essential in the decision making process, but a significant proportion of this initial evaluation rests on the experience of the physician . Despite the limited resources and time constraints, the ED physicians are also expected to perform a variety of diagnostic tests to narrow down a differential diagnosis and make a diagnose (if possible).
An extensive recent overview of diagnostic tests for dyspnoea in the ED, presented by the British Thoracic Society, concluded that POCUS is an increasingly used diagnostic tool in patients with dyspnoea . However, since most ED physicians have not received proper training of POCUS, its usefulness is debated. According to a large prospective study from England, ED physicians were not sure if they could perform safe and useful ultrasonography for patients with dyspnea in the ED . This study showed that only 20% of all ED physicians in England were able to perform adequate POCUS examination of the chest in patients with respiratory distress and that 1 in 6 patients was misclassified in"
112,"3 to 4 weeks after breast conserving surgery (BCS), the patient starts the radiotherapy treatment. The treatment lasts 2 to 3 weeks and requires a very accurate positioning to minimize the radiation dose to heart and other organs. This procedure requires from the patient breath holding and the cooperation with the doctor to reach a successful and optimized position. The patient's success depends on her mental ability, as well as her physical abilities, to perform this procedure, and to endure the stress of multiple daily radiotherapy sessions. This is especially relevant for patients, who are already suffering from their disease. Therefore, a highly-effective treatment method is urgently needed to help our patients cope with their disease, optimize their compliance towards radiotherapy treatment, and reduce adverse effects. With this project, we want to investigate whether a respiratory training and a relaxation therapy can complement the standard treatment and increase the patient's ability to cope with the treatment."

115,"Cesarean section is the most frequent obstetric surgical delivery; it accounts for 20-100% of all deliveries performed globally. It is recognized as the gold standard for the management of different obstetric situations. Cesarean delivery is a safe surgical procedure that carries minimal risk to mother and fetus despite the fact that it could increase maternal mortality and morbidity compared to vaginal delivery . One of the most serious complications is postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), which is defined as loss of more than 500 ml of blood within 24 hours . Cesarean section accounted for 7.5% of all PPH cases requiring a blood transfusion in one observational study that evaluated a series of 4,816 women who had undergone cesarean births at a single institution . 
Around the world, 5.6 mg / liter of oxytocin were commonly prescribed for prophylactic administration through intramuscular or intravenous routes following delivery . The use of oxytocin for 2 minutes is adequate, and it has a high efficacy with just a few drops of blood loss during parturition . However, using oxytocin has also been reported to have multiple adverse effects including uterine tachysystole, uterine rupture, severe hypotension, severe intraventricular hemorrhage, and even fetal death . Moreover, the effect of oxytocin on preventing PPH is no longer guaranteed, as the pharmacologic activity of exogenously administered oxytocin could vary between women .
As a result, intramuscular or intravenous oxytocin is a commonly used prophylactic drug to avoid the development of postpartum hemorrhage, although the use of intramuscular oxytocin may need a bigger dose to avoid postpartum hemorrhage. 
One of Tranexamic acid's most significant benefits is that it does not increase blood loss in a single dose during the cesarean section procedure . However, studies have shown that tranexamic acid causes the coagulation system to be abnormal, and bleeding complications have been reported in several situations .
Therefore, this study was conducted to compare the efficacy and safety of intramuscular oxytocin and intramuscular tranexamic acid in preventing excessive blood loss during and after the cesarean section procedure . Additionally, this study provides the opportunity to study tranexamic acid's effect on thromboembolic disorders, cardiac ischemia, transient ischemic attack, and fetal damage in pregnant women."

Input Text: Observational study: Impact of different ReceptIVFity microbiome profiles on fertilization and pregnancy rate in IVF/ICSI patients

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Infertility is a major health issue; 6.1 million couples are affected in the EU alone. Most of these have non-obstructive male infertility. Aside from the negative psychological, social, and financial burden infertility places on the couple, there are often serious long-term implications for the child. The success rate of assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs) with conventional in vitro fertilization (IVF) is still relatively low; about 30% of IVF/ICSI patients result in a successful pregnancy. Even less is known about patients with non-European origin; these women have almost twice the risk of infertility as women of European origin. A healthy vaginal microbiome profile at the time of IVF is strongly associated with a successful fertilization. Recent studies show that a simple swab from the vagina can predict a pregnancy with high accuracy.

Detailed Description
-----------------
We wish to investigate how the vaginal microbiome profile impacts the pregnancy rate of European origin woman undergoing first IVF/ICSI treatment. Since the current practice to manage infertility is based on a 1-size-fits-all approach, we believe that the data generated from this study will help us identify patients with a low chance of success and potentially increase the success rate of the ART treatment. We further aim to compare the successful pregnancy rate between IVF patients of European or non-European origin and its relation to the vaginal microbiome profile.

117,"Fenugreek has been suggested as an attractive alternative in the management of lipids and glycaemic control, and it is widely used in the management of patients with hyperlipidaemia. Studies on the lipid-lowering effects of fenugreek have so far been inconclusive and inconsistent, and their findings may be contradictory due to the small sample size, the type/level of dyslipidaemia in the studies, and short exposure time. The current study is in line with previous studies, and seeks to investigate the lipid-lowering effect of fenugreek seed consumed as a tea in patients with hyperlipidaemia, but without diabetes, to establish any potential therapeutic effect and identify the mechanism underlying it.

118,"Pioglitazone is an anti-diabetic drug that is able to significantly increase S1P synthesis in isolated HDL while reducing serum S1P levels. It is an ideal tool from which the role of S1P in HDL function can be investigated. Myocardial revascularization surgery, despite being an effective procedure that reduces cardiovascular risk, is able to mobilize and increase myocardial oxidative stress. It is well-known that the activation of sphingosine kinase-1 (Sphk1) pathway in the event of myocardial ischaemia is able to mediate ischaemic cardiomyocyte death and contribute to myocardial remodeling that occurs after the procedure. It is plausible that the use of drugs from the group of peroxisome proliferators, such as pioglitazone, which is able to activate this pathway, may protect the heart from ischaemia damage caused by myocardial revascularization surgery.
In this context, we are interested in investigating whether the use of pioglitazone is able to protect the heart from oxidative damage caused by myocardial revascularization surgery. We predict that the use of pioglitazone in patients undergoing myocardial revascularization surgery may reduce the levels of S1P in HDL, decrease the levels of inflammation by reducing the production of thromboxane, stimulate the synthesis of sphingosine-1-phosphate in cardiac muscle cells, reducing SphK1 activation after myocardial revascularization surgery."

122,"This project aims to test a novel couple intervention programme for adults with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). Individuals with ASD have poor social skills and have difficulties maintaining close, stable and healthy relationships. As a result, they often have higher relationship breakdown rate and face greater social isolation. The current couple therapy was designed to specifically address the lack of quality communication between the couple with ASD and their intimate partner. The couple therapy includes a number of cognitive and behavioral skill sets and provides specific techniques for both partners to enhance positive communication and reduce negative cycle of communication in couples with ASD. A pilot study for individuals with ASD will be conducted in 2018. It will recruit 30 couples (including 15 couples with ASD and 15 couples without ASD). Couples will be asked to completed a series of online questionnaire (about autism, relationship quality, social anxiety and life-satisfaction). In addition, each intervention couple will receive 4 weekly 2 hour group therapy sessions and all couples will receive 6 weekly follow-up questionnaires. The investigators expect couples with ASD will show significant improvement in Autism symptoms, relationship quality and social anxiety after couple therapy, such that couples with ASD will perform similar to couples without ASD, and the findings will justify the feasibility for a larger study to establish evidence-based couple intervention for ASD couples."

124,"1. Background and rationale. BAD (Branch Atheromatous Disease) is one of the most common ischemic stroke subtypes. Among BAD subtypes, intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis of the proximal portion of middle cerebral artery (M1) is the most predominant variety. Among the Chinese population, BAD-related stroke occurs in 20-30% of cases, with M1 being the most common location, constituting approximately 80% of cases. Compared with patients with large-vessel stroke (LVS) or intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD), patients with BAD-related stroke are younger and often have more severe stroke. The prognosis of patients with BAD-related stroke is particularly poor compared to other ischemic stroke subtypes. The early prognosis of BAD-related stroke is poor, with a high incidence of functional deterioration, early fatal and vascular events within a short period of time. At the same time, traditional risk factors like hypertension, blood lipids, and smoking are unable to explain the etiology of BAD-related stroke. The high frequency, severe disability, and short survival time make it crucial to advance treatment. Clinical evidence indicates that compared with antiplatelet therapy based on guideline for secondary stroke prevention, the prognosis of BAD-related stroke remains poor despite the high frequency of recanalization and the use of antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapies. In the first 48 hours after stroke onset, intravenous thrombolysis was significantly correlated with the incidence of early neurological deterioration (END) and the recurrence of stroke in patients with BAD-related stroke, but it did not improve the early prognosis of patients. There have been no prospective randomized clinical trials of new antiplatelet or anticoagulation drugs that have demonstrated that these pharmacological treatments can improve overall and neurological dysfunction outcome, safety, or clinical outcomes in patients with BAD-related stroke. 2. Theoretical ground for using Tirofiban in patients with BAD-related stroke. There is growing evidence to suggest that the presence of microemboli in the distal internal carotid artery (ICA) is also a determinant of stroke in BAD subpopulation. The formation of microemboli is dependent on the size and mobility of platelets. Platelets promote thrombus formation by activating the thrombus-forming pathway and increase arterial thrombogenesis by promoting the formation of thrombi. Thus, microemboli may arise from the occlusion of large cerebral arteries by plaque fragments or incomplete thrombolysis during the acute phase of atherothrombotic stroke. Although the mechanisms of arterial thrombosis related to acute BAD subtype are not completely understood, there is a strong association between platelets and arterial thrombosis. Tirofiban has been shown to effectively inhibit platelet activation and aggregation. It inhibits platelet activation and aggregation by competitively binding to the glycoprotein glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor on platelets. Studies have shown that Tirofiban significantly reduces platelet aggregation and can effectively inhibit platelet adhesion and aggregation in vivo and in vitro. It can also significantly reduce thrombus formation induced by different vascular lesions. In addition, Tirofiban can significantly reduce the blood levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes and plasmin-antiplasmin complexes in vivo and vitro. Therefore, the use of Tirofiban in patients with stroke can effectively reduce platelet aggregation and the formation of coagulation foci, thereby alleviating the occurrence of cerebral infarction in patients with BAD-related stroke. 3. Hypothesis. 1) Tirofiban can improve early neurological outcomes, early functional ability, and safety in patients with BAD-related stroke. 2) Tirofiban can further reduce the incidence of early neurological deterioration, new-onset stroke or recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction or all-cause death in the first 7 days after stroke onset when used together with antiplatelet therapy. 4. Objectives. 1) Whether Tirofiban can improve the early neurological outcome (modified Rankin Scale 0-1) of patients with acute BAD-related"

The randomization ratio is set as a 1:1 ratio. 3) Telemedicine Group After random assignment, OSA patients in the telemedicine group will complete self-evaluation of sleep symptoms according to the ""Redcap"" website, carry out HSAT monitoring at home, and evaluate sleep function before and after treatment according to the ""Redcap"" website or complete SCSQ-10 questionnaire during admission. The patients in the telemedicine group will be followed up by professional nurses through telephone/online or physical examination in the hospital for 1 month after successful enrollment and treatment at the Sleep Center in our center. The patients in the telemedicine group will be followed up by telephone/online or physical examination at 3 months after successful enrollment and treatment at the Sleep Center in our hospital. D) Outpatient group The outpatients in the outpatient group are required to complete the self-evaluation of sleep symptoms by completing the sleep monitoring variables on the paper, the sleep monitoring variables is required to complete the self-evaluation of sleep symptoms by completing the sleep monitoring variables after successful enrollment and treatment at the Sleep Center in our hospital, and they need to be followed up by telephone/online or physical examination in the hospital for the follow-up of 1 month and 3 months after successful enrollment and treatment at the Sleep Center in our hospital. 
4) Physical data evaluation Before and after enrollment, patients in all groups will be evaluated before treatment, 1 month after admission to the sleep center, and 3 months after admission to the sleep center to evaluate their physical performance, including weight, height, abdominal circumference, blood pressure, peripheral arterial pressure index, peripheral nerve conduction velocity, carotid artery ultrasound. 
5) Blood test The blood samples from the participants of all groups before and after admission to the sleep center in our hospital will be collected. The blood routine (neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, red blood cell count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, etc.), liver function test [alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin, albumin], renal function test [serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen (BUN)], plasma lipids (total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL)), glucose tolerance test (fasting blood glucose), catecholamines and catecholamine metabolites (vanillmandelic acid (VMA), 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol (MHPG), homovanillic acid (HV) and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylglycol (DOPAC)) will be tested in our hospital's biochemical laboratory. 
E) Healthcare costs The outpatient group is required to complete the questionnaire on sleep function for 1 month or 3 months after admission to the sleep center in our hospital. We will pay the travel expenses incurred by the outpatient group patients, and they are also paid the lost wages during their 1-month hospital follow-up. In addition, some patients often have to deal with the problem of sleeping alone at night, so that they can only sleep at the hospital's rest station during their 1-month hospital follow-up, so the cost of using the rest station will be considered in the study.

127,"Pain is an internal phenomenon that occurs in response to an external or internal stimulus, and is a subjective assessment of pain intensity. It is assessed either by a questionnaire or by subject description. In clinical practice, pain assessment relates not only to a change in the pain-related experience, but also to the quality of the physician-patient relationship. This study evaluates the association between increased communication between the nurse and the patient at the time of administering analgesics on the pain intensity in postoperative recovery following Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. It is hypothesized that increased communication between the nurse and patient will increase patient satisfaction, and will reduce the intensity of acute pain as measured by the VAS Pain Intensity Scale (0-10). Patient characteristics (age, preoperative and intraoperative pain assessments, preoperative self-consciousness and suggestibility levels, education level) will be compared between the experimental group and those receiving normal communication and the influence of these factors on pain intensity will be examined."
128,"This is a feasibility study to see if blood and lung tissue samples obtained during participants lung health checks under the NHS TARGETED LUNG health check programme could be used to test the ability of an artificial intelligence-generated algorithm to predict lung cancer. Samples will be tested on existing platforms to generate molecular profiles.




Lay Description: Lung cancer is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with the number of diagnoses increasing in the UK. In 2020, an estimated 47,100 people were diagnosed with the disease and it is the leading cause of cancer death in the UK. Targeted lung health checks (TLHC) are recommended with CT lung screening for patients at risk of lung cancer. However, low-dose CT screening is not optimal for early detection of lung cancers and the NHS is looking for more effective early detection biomarkers. Current methods for early detection are not sensitive or specific enough. The UK National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) recommended the addition of a liquid biopsy to lung health check visits, as it will make it possible to conduct a detailed analysis of the cancer-related molecular pathways. These include protein, RNA, and DNA markers. This could aid early detection of lung cancer. However, before this method can be rolled out nationally and integrated with the current NHS screening systems, its feasibility must be assessed in a real-world clinical setting. This feasibility study will evaluate the collection of blood samples for liquid biopsy, as well as the ability of an automated screening algorithm that utilizes artificial intelligence to correctly identify lung cancer from the data collected. These data will be used to train a model that can accurately detect lung cancer in patients. The model will then be used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of using a liquid biopsy as a method of early lung cancer detection.




Participant Inclusion Criteria: Current patients going through the lung health check programme (either being flagged up, i.e. identified on the NHS database through pre-screening criteria as needing further investigation or through screening CT scans). Inclusion Criteria for Screening: - Adults aged between 55 years and 74 years and 364 days. - Participants who have capacity and can provide written consent. - Participants must be willing to provide a blood sample for analysis. - Participants must be willing to provide samples of small lung tissue resected through bronchoscopy/bronchoscopic lung biopsy. Participants will only be included if they satisfy all of the above criteria. Exclusion Criteria for Screening: - Participants for whom bronchoscopy/bronchoscopic lung biopsy is considered by the clinician to be unfit/not suitable for enrolment. - Participants who decline participation in ALPINE Inclusion Criteria for Consenting: - Must be able to provide informed consent. - Must have had screening lung health check or biopsy through TLHC at the NCL NHS. Exclusion Criteria for Consenting: - Does not want to provide consent. - Participants who are considered by the clinician to be unfit/not suitable for enrolment. - Patients who lack capacity and are unable to provide written consent."
129,"We carried out a prospective randomized study evaluating the effect of pharmaceutical care using the Sistema Nacional de Segurança e Saúde of the Brazilian Unified Health System (SISNAS) - a computerized information system about chronic medication dispensed from public health care for systemic arterial hypertension, which consists of providing clinical support for the patient and the physician through specific care interventions. A specific form was used to collect clinical, socio-economic, behavioral and medication-related data. A questionnaire for measuring adherence and patient satisfaction with the service was applied on the 7th day and 3 months after the intervention."
130,"50% of patients with ARDS survive to hospital discharge but suffer significant morbidity. 17% of these patients died of cardiorespiratory failure and 2% were discharged home with the need for long-term oxygen. The overall quality of life (QOL) in these patients is extremely poor. The results of the RelatIonship BEtween Implementation of Evidence-based and suppoRtive ICU cAre and outcomes of patIents With Acute respiratOry Distress syndrome study (RELATIOnship) will reveal the current ICU care practices and identify the potential areas of improvement in terms of maximizing the benefit of the ICU care given to patients with ARDS, who may not be critically ill but require ventilatory support.
Detailed Description: Patients who are intubated and receive positive pressure ventilation in an ICU belong to a minority population in an ICU who has a higher mortality rate than patients with the same level of severity of illness who are not intubated. Because patients who require intubation and ventilator support are often critically ill and require the highest level of ICU care, the ICU must provide the best quality care for these patients and their families. On the other hand, the ICU provides the most intense medical treatments to patients with ARDS. 10% of all ICU admissions are ARDS patients, and the recent pandemic of the novel coronavirus has dramatically increased the number of ARDS patients in ICUs across the world. The international epidemiological study (2016) reported a mortality rate of 35-46% for ARDS, and this is very high mortality compared to other ICU diseases. Furthermore, ARDS survivors present with many functional impairments, including physical, cognitive, and psychiatric dysfunction (Post Intensive Care Syndrome, PICS), and their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) and Quality of Life (QOL) are impaired and many other functional impairments have been pointed out. Their inability to get their original life has attracted significant research attention and become a significantly important research topic. Many patients who are unable to return to work due to functional disability require nursing care, and there is concern about the increased burden on the patient, the family supporting the patient, and the social economy. Therefore, the development of effective strategies for patients with ARDS that take into account not only mortality but also functional prognosis is strongly needed. Recent studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation (low tidal volume and airway pressure control), neuromuscular blocking agents, prone position, noninvasive mechanical ventilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have improved outcomes, including mortality, in patients with ARDS. However, the mortality of patients with ARDS is still as high as 40%. In addition, the complete reintegration ratio of patients with ARDS after 1 year of hospital discharge reported in 2003 was only 50%, and recent reports have shown little progress in this aspect. Strategies to improve outcomes (mortality and functional prognosis) of ARDS patients by improving not only treatment but also the quality of ICU care have become a hot topic in recent years. The previous paper showed that excessive sedation and absolute bed rest for the purpose of ventilation control and rest during intubation in ARDS patients correlated with delirium, prolonged duration of ventilation, and even increased mortality. Therefore, attempts have been explored to improve outcomes, including mortality and functional prognosis of ARDS patients by systematically providing analgesia and sedation, early mobility and breathing awakening tests, rehabilitation, spontaneous breathing and awakening tests, and delirium management during ICU admission. These attempts, known as the ABCDEF bundle, have been actively recommended by a number of academic societies to be introduced in ICUs as an attempt to improve outcomes, including mortality, and promote their reintegration into society. (ABCDEF bundle: A (Assess, prevent, and manage pain), B (Both spontaneous awakening trials (SAT) and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT)), C (Choice of analgesia and sedation), D (Delirium: assess, prevent, and manage), E (Early mobility and exercise), F (Family engagement and empowerment)), and even ICU care such as nutritional therapy and ICU diaries have been shown to improve outcomes for ICU patients, including ARDS, and are strongly recommended. (In this study, this ICU care is referred to as evidence-based ICU care.) On the other hand, our research team has reported that the overall implementation rate of these evidence-"

In recent years, different food components (mainly polyphenols) have been identified as natural anti-ageing agents that could help to improve skin health. Among all polyphenols, pomegranate polyphenols such as ellagitannins, which can help to maintain skin skin integrity. In vitro and in animal model studies, it has been reported that ellagitannins help to repair damaged skin

133,"1P19Q Codeletion Status and IDH Mutation Status are essential to diagnosis glioma and to determine prognosis. There is a need for clinical tools to predict the phenotype and the biological properties of glioma tumors. The objective is to assess if, on a long-term basis, Magnetic Resonance (MR) markers can predict the glioma phenotype, the presence of 1P19Q co-deletion and the biological properties of gliomas such as IDH mutation status (wild type or mutated). Methods: This is a prospective, open-label, single-arm, non-interventional study including newly diagnosed and suspected glioma patients with no previous treatment. All patients will undergo a T1 MRI protocol prior to intervention, MRI Spectroscopy and MRI Diffusion. The outcome of the study is the feasibility of the study protocol including feasibility of the sample recruitment and quality of the imaging data and the analysis pipeline. 30% of the patients included in the study will be submitted to a biopsy to allow for tumor analyses: histopathology and molecular testing (IDH mutation status, 1P19q Codeletion). The study protocol (MRI examinations and imaging data processing) will be performed on consecutive patients. After completion of the study protocol, patients will receive the standard of care treatment including Temozolomide. During and after the treatment a T1-MRI will be performed every month. MRI measurements will be assessed and compared at baseline to evaluate prognostic markers. In addition, clinical data, including age, sex and tumor treatment, will be assessed and compared with prognosis related to the outcome of tumor markers to build a prognostic model. Expected results: For patients diagnosed with glioma, an accurate MRI-based (MR-based) diagnosis is paramount to assess the correct treatment strategies and to accurately predict the prognosis of these patients. In addition, an improved diagnosis will help to accelerate the evaluation of a patient and the treatment decision. This will allow for a better individualized treatment. As this is a long-term follow up, long-term outcomes will be evaluated in terms of survival rates, quality of life and recurrence rate."
134,"β-thalassemia is a genetic disorder characterized by an impaired ability to produce beta-globin. While beta-thalassemia major presents with severe complications, individuals with beta-thalassemia intermedia have mild to moderate symptoms. The combination therapy of hydroxyurea and thalidomide in beta-thalassemia patients was introduced in the year 2004 and has since emerged as a promising approach to the treatment of this disorder. The objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of thalidomide and hydroxyurea combination therapy in beta-thalassemia patients, with a focus on the proportion of patients who become completely transfusion-independent or experience significant improvement in their clinical status. The secondary objectives are to examine the safety profile of this combination therapy and to investigate the influence of thalidomide and hydroxyurea on the expression of the XmnI polymorphism. The study also aims to assess the effectiveness of thalidomide and hydroxyurea combination therapy in improving the liver and spleen sizes in patients with beta-thalassemia. The results of the study are anticipated to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the efficacy and safety of the combination therapy, as well as to improve the quality of life for patients with beta-thalassemia."
135,"The aim of this study is compare the performance of different diagnostic diagnostic imaging modalities, namely Duplex Ultrasound, Compression Ultrasonography and Venous Plethysmography in the management of patients with venous leg ulcers. We will also look at current practice in vascular scientist and primary care departments across the UK. A Delphi consensus questionnaire will be conducted with Vascular Scientist across the UK to establish what imaging modalities they use and what type of training they received. A questionnaire in primary care will ask how many venous leg ulcer cases are seen each year on average and what type of training they received from vascular scientific departments. Based on what has been learned with the Delphi consensus and using the results from our previous pilot study, we have designed a new questionnaire with multiple choice and free text questions. This questionnaire will be disseminated via email to practitioners in primary care departments. The analysis of the data will be done as a pre-specified project. All results will be discussed amongst the different vascular scientist teams. It is expected that there will be more than 100 participants each in the primary care and vascular scientist departments.

This is a pilot study to determine the current practice in management of venous leg ulcers with diagnostic imaging modalities in vascular specialist clinics and primary care departments. Also, looking at the current patient journey to determine if it is effective. We believe that by performing this study, we will be able to make recommendations to the NHS for standardised management. This will ensure that patients get the best care possible with the least amount of resource and inconvenience.

137,"Background: To overcome anatomical and physiological limitations, different sinus augmentation techniques with immediate or delayed (6-8 months post augmentation) implant placement have been proposed. The most common one is the sinus elevation with a lateral window approach. Although these protocols evoke a high level of success in augmenting the bone quantity (Nkenke E & Stelzle F, 2009; Schropp et al, 2003) many patients refuse them because of the invasiveness of the augmentative procedure, with obvious prolonged healing times and increased morbidity and costs (Fugazzotto, 2003; Bra¨gger et al, 2004; Toffler, 2004). An alternative therapy for restoring areas of limited bone dimension is the placement of short implants (Wallace SS & Froum SJ, 2003). ''Standard length implants'' are those of 10 mm in length and have been defined as the minimal length for anticipated success (Griffin TJ & Cheung WS, 2004).

Approximately 15% of women will experience depression during their pregnancy (2, 3). Depressive symptoms, which include feeling fatigued, being angry or irritable, and crying, are common and can negatively affect a mother’s health and infant outcomes (3). Perinatal depression, or depression experienced by a woman during her pregnancy and postpartum period, significantly increases the likelihood of maternal and child comorbidities, including preterm delivery, low-birthweight, and child cognitive and behavioral delays (4) and predisposes to parental post-traumatic stress disorder (5). However, African-American (AA) women are at greater risk of perinatal depression (6, 7). In addition, AA women have poorer healthcare utilization and compliance with psychiatric treatment, compared to Caucasian women (8, 9). An intervention is required to supplement and support the clinical objectives of the mother’s depression care without requiring the mother’s direct involvement. Fathers are an underutilized resource that could provide relief to the depressed mother by alleviating stress, reducing anxiety, and encouraging healthy maternal behaviors (10). Thus, targeting fathers with social support and stress-reduction skills can reduce stress in the pre-natal and postpartum periods, and potentially, reduce postpartum depression. The proposed research will evaluate the effect of an intervention to target the social support needs of fathers and increase the family’s capacity to provide parenting skills and stress-reducing behaviors to reduce maternal stress and depressive symptoms.
The proposed research will use the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether fathers can reduce depressed mothers’ stress and anxiety during their pregnancy and postpartum with the ASSET-PPD intervention. Specific Aim 2: To evaluate whether fathers can increase the quality of parent-child interactions and increase the breastfeeding duration with the ASSET-PPD intervention.

141,"3,719 cancer patients who received a mental health referral to 1 of the 13 clinical partnership sites were included in the analysis. In addition, each partnership site also conducted a manual review of all eligible patients’ medical records during the study period to identify additional individuals who may not have had an inpatient admission during this time period. Patient health information (e.g., diagnoses, medical procedures/interventions, laboratory test results) was extracted from the medical record using standardized, de-identified data extraction tools. For each potential patient and for each potential cancer-related visit (e.g., outpatient visit, emergency room visit, inpatient admission), abstractors used a pre-programmed algorithm to identify if they met study criteria. The algorithm was designed to identify visits and procedures in the medical record that are indicative of mental health support. We are examining whether patients can be proactively identified and engaged in mental health care before the point of clinical crisis through the creation of a digital patient screening and risk assessment tool to identify patients with unmet mental health needs due to cancer (Phase I & II) and to evaluate a digital mental health intervention delivered through a mobile phone app for individuals living with cancer.

142,"Artificial pancreas (AP) systems, commonly known as closed-loop insulin delivery systems, have been developed to help individuals with type 1 diabetes more effectively manage their condition. These systems consist of an insulin pump, continuous glucose monitor (CGM), and control algorithm software that automatically adjusts insulin delivery to maintain optimal blood sugar levels. However, AP systems can experience malfunctions that impact the accuracy and safety of insulin delivery, increasing the risk of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. There are many different types of AP malfunctions, including sensor errors, algorithm errors, and infusion set occlusions, each with its own unique characteristics and symptoms. One type of AP malfunction is pump failure, which can occur when the pump stops delivering insulin or starts delivering it at an inconsistent rate. This can lead to severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia if not detected and corrected promptly. Another type of malfunction is infusion set occlusion, which occurs when the insulin-infusing site on the skin becomes blocked, preventing insulin from getting into the circulatory system. This can also lead to severe hyperglycemia or hypoglycemia and even ketoacidosis, a life-threatening complication of diabetes. The main goal of this study is to identify and detect different types of AP malfunctions, particularly pump failure and infusion set occlusion, using advanced machine learning algorithms and real-time data monitoring. By detecting these malfunctions early, clinicians can take corrective action and ensure the safety of their patients."

153,"Neurogenic pain is characterized by burning pain and symptoms include numbness, tingling, and allodynia (pain provocation) with pain distribution according to the affected nerves. This is compared to nociceptive pain (e.g. cancer-related pain), which is characterized by constant, dull, deep muscle ache. The study hypothesizes that there is a difference in the symptom pattern of neuropathic pain and that painDETECT questionnaire score and the numerical rating scale are more responsive in neuropathic pain. The secondary hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the score changes between the PDQ-M and the NRS for individuals in each of these cohorts with the presence and severity of anxiety and depression, as well as with sleep disturbance.

The purpose of this study was to translate the painDETECT questionnaire from English to Malay and validate it, as well as determine the internal consistency reliability and factor structure of the Malay painDETECT questionnaire.

A total of 215 individuals with neuropathic or nociceptive pain participated in the study. The mean age was 46.73±11.69 years, with 54% females, and 26% neuropathic pain and 74% nociceptive pain. There were significant differences in pain duration, intensity of pain, severity of depression, and presence of sleep disturbances. The internal consistencies in both neuropathic and nociceptive cohorts were very high, with the exception of the 'Sick Leave' sub scale which were high for the neuropathic cohort and moderate for the nociceptive cohort. This suggests that most of the items in PDQ-M is measuring what it is intended to measure. The test-retest reliability in both groups was excellent. The confirmatory factor analysis yielded two distinct factors representing neuropathic pain and nociceptive pain, which suggests that the items in PDQ-M discriminate between these two pain types"
154,"1.Background: Despite advances in rehabilitation medicine, many stroke patients experience gait disturbances, muscle weakness, and balance impairments, resulting in limited physical activity and daily living function. Exercise is a key component at various stages of rehabilitation for stroke patients. Complex exercise, which includes walking, strengthening, and balance exercises, has been shown to improve physical and functional outcomes in stroke patients. However, complex exercise requires multiple resources and a highly-skilled specialist to supervise the program. The study developed a complex exercise program based on a systematic analysis of published articles and expert opinions. A multidisciplinary evaluation team was assembled to standardize the program, and 6 participants were assigned to the intervention group and 6 participants to the control group. The study hypothesized that this community-based complex exercise program is safe and effective in improving gait function, balance, muscle strength, and physical activity levels, while being readily available to stroke patients in the community. 2.Aims/Objectives: The study aims to determine the effect of the community-based complex exercise program on the physical and functional outcomes of stroke patients, including gait speed, balance, muscle strength, physical activity levels, and quality of life. The study also aims to evaluate the safety of the exercise program and determine the feasibility of implementing the program in the community. 3.Methodology/Design: The study will use a randomized controlled trial design. The participants will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group or the control group. The intervention group will receive the community-based complex exercise program for 6 weeks, while the control group will receive usual care. The outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6 weeks post-intervention. The primary outcome measure will be the change in walking speed. Secondary outcome measures will include balance, muscle strength, physical activity levels, and quality of life. The safety of the exercise program will be assessed by monitoring for any adverse events during and after the exercise program. 4.Study Hypothesis: The study hypothesizes that the community-based complex exercise program is safe and effective in improving gait function, balance, muscle strength, and physical activity levels in stroke patients. Specifically, the study hypothesizes that participants who receive the intervention will have higher walking speed, better balance, stronger muscles, higher levels of physical activity, and better quality of life compared to participants who receive usual care.

158,"16 million years ago, Africa was the center of mammalian life, and primates had already evolved. The group of primates includes several species, such as lemurs, loris, gibbons and monkeys. Our primate ancestors' physical and mental abilities helped them adapt to the environment and ultimately become what we know as humans today. However, as our species adapted to different environments and developed our skills, there was a gradual shift in our diet from a primarily plant-based diet to one that included more animal products. This transition resulted in a change in our genetic makeup and ultimately contributed to our development as a species. The fossil record shows that early Homo sapiens who migrated into Europe began to adapt to their new environment and developed anatomical and physiological characteristics that enabled them to do so. This evolutionary adaptation was driven by an increase in food, including more meat and vegetables. Additionally, the change in environment and food intake led to changes in our genetic makeup. The emergence of agriculture around 10,000 years ago led to social, cultural, and economic changes that had a significant impact on human evolution. Farming helped promote greater sedentary lifestyles and allowed for the development of more complex societies. This, in turn, led to changes in our genetic makeup, particularly in genes related to immunity and brain function. As we continued to adapt to these changing environments, our diet and genetic makeup continued to evolve. The introduction of dairy products into the human diet began around 7,000 years ago, further expanding our food intake and providing us with new sources of essential nutrients. The emergence of dairy products also had an impact on our genetic makeup, as various genes related to lactose tolerance and dairy product metabolism evolved. Dairy products became a valuable source of food and provided numerous health benefits for early humans. The development of agriculture around 10,000 years ago resulted in a major shift in human evolution and contributed to our ability to thrive and adapt in a wide range of environments. As we continued to evolve and adapt to new environments and diets, our genetic makeup continued to evolve, resulting in the human species we know today. Our ancestors' adaptability and resourcefulness in adapting to new environments and developing new abilities were crucial in our evolutionary journey. Our ability to adapt and evolve has allowed us to become the dominant species on the planet and has enabled us to develop and thrive in a wide range of environments. This evolutionary journey has been the key to our success and will continue to shape our future.

160,"----------------The investigators propose a prospective, randomized, controlled behavioral intervention study for premenopausal women with complex atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH) who require uterine preservation with progestin therapy and wish to avoid hysterectomy. This study design will allow the investigators to compare a telemedicine weight management program for uterine preservation (arm 1) with enhanced usual care (arm 2). The control arm (arm 2) will consist of a group of women who will undergo enhanced usual care and receive handouts from standard endometrial cancer websites. Each subject will start with the control arm. The investigators plan to recruit 100 subjects (50 per arm) and will follow atypia-free biopsy and uterine preservation as the primary outcome. This is a novel randomized clinical trial of a telemedicine behavioral weight management program that may reduce the rate of atypia resolution in these women as determined by endometrial biopsy.

|Procedure: Coconut technique|Several surgeons in the world have reported on the successful application of subtotal cholecystectomy in select patients with cholecystitis, which offers a simple solution to the management of cholecystitis and has a good overall clinical outcome. We recently developed a simple but effective laparoscopic technique to approach and ligate the cystic duct in cases of difficult acute cholecystitis. Three to four centimeters of the inflamed gallbladder wall was then cut using an electrocautery hook. An incision was made in a safe zone at the junction of the infundibulum and the body of the gallbladder. The separation between the outer layer and inner layer was searched. This clear identification of the confluence between the cystic duct and the body of the gallbladder represents the way to determine if the procedure was safely completed using the current technique. After successful identification, the cystic duct was clipped. The gallbladder can then be lifted and turned over, leaving the unidentified CBD untouched, and cholecystectomy can be carefully performed as usual. The inflamed posterior wall remained attached to the gallbladder bed of the liver.<br>|"

165,"30% of cancer survivors experience poor health outcomes from their cancer treatment.

166,"The aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of Post Facilitation Stretch (PFS) and Maitland Mobilization (MM), used as a treatment approach, on range of motion and disability, among patients with post-traumatic stiff elbow.

Background
-----------------
There is a highly constrained synovial hinge joint. The structure of the elbow joint and the soft tissue structures surrounding the elbow are important determinants of how much movement the joint can generate. Loss of range of motion (loss of terminal extension) is less disabling than loss of the same degree of terminal flexion.
The elbow is prone to stiffness and loss of range of motion because brachialis muscle lies directly over the anterior capsule. The anterior capsule tends to tear in the radial and ulnar directions, and the 3 elbow articulations lie within a single capsular sleeve[1]. In addition, the posterior stabilizers of the elbow are very weak. This can result in heterotopic ossification (HO), myositis ossificans and post-traumatic ankyloses.
There is lack of good quality evidence from well-designed randomized controlled trials on the choice of treatment approach for post-traumatic stiff elbow[2]. We propose that Maitland mobilization and post-facilitation stretch are two such interventions that may be helpful in improving terminal range of motion (ROM) in post-traumatic stiff elbow.
This was a randomized controlled study, conducted among post-traumatic stiff elbow patients to determine whether: i. Post Facilitation Stretch or Maitland Mobilization is more effective in improving ROM of post-traumatic stiff elbow; ii. The improvement in the severity of elbow stiffness in response to physiotherapy is influenced by the initial range of motion and by the degree of muscle ossification.
Detailed hypothesis of the study: Post Facilitation Stretch (PFS) or Maitland Mobilization is more effective in improving the range of motion and severity of disability in post-traumatic stiff elbow patients compared with control group.


Outcomes of the study
-----------------


Study Design:
-----------------
This was a randomized, controlled trial, conducted among post-traumatic stiff elbow patients who were in the range of 18 - 35 years of age. Sample size was 32 by using G Power Calculator. A sample size of N=32 (16 per group) was considered adequate to achieve a statistical power of 80%, at an alpha level of .05, yielding a difference to be detected of 29 degrees to a standard deviation of 24 degrees, by making a one-sided t-test with a power level of 0.8 and an effect size of 0.54. All participants in both groups were evaluated on two occasions: (i) baseline (ii) After 4 weeks of intervention.
Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group after a baseline assessment with a lottery ticket and an opaque envelope.
The study was an open-label, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial that was undertaken in a private orthopedic clinic, which provides the necessary services for the management of the patients with post-traumatic stiff elbow. Patients eligible in this setting were randomized to receive either Maitland mobilization or Post Facilitation Stretching. All participants will be provided with hot pack for 10 minutes, followed by active and active-assisted exercises for elbow joint flexion and extension (Wrist flexion and extension, Forearm supination and pronation).



Intervention
-----------------
Interventions were the Post Facilitation stretch (PFS) and Maitland Mobilization. Intervention group (PG) will receive PFS technique that was used by applying stretching techniques, using 100% of the passive range of the elbow joints. The patient will go into a resting position, to make it easier for the affected muscles to relax completely. The patient was asked to remain in this position of muscle relaxation on 6-10s, followed by stretch of 15s for each affected muscle group of the elbow joint, four to five sets of stretching of the elbow joint for a total of 5 times a day, 4-5 days a week.
Control group (CG) will receive Maitland mobilization is a physiotherapy techniques applied to joints in order to improve range of motion while also reducing pain and restoring range of motion as compared to its original state before injury. Maitland mobilization was applied between 2-3 oscillations per second for 1 minute in each direction for all the possible directions"
167,"755,035 Canadians (35.5%) suffer from a history or current diagnosis of heart failure. The disease affects the daily life of those living with it, with 45% of individuals reporting some degree of impaired physical function. Hospitalisations for heart failure cost the Canadian healthcare system approximately $2 billion CAD in 2019. Recent evidence has demonstrated an increased risk of heart failure for patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. Patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors represent the largest group at risk for heart failure in Canada. Despite this, heart failure is often diagnosed late and too few Canadians receive recommended treatments. The study seeks to evaluate whether the novel AI-enabled echocardiography tool Us2.ai (formerly EchoGO) is a suitable adjunct to NT-proBNP in a high-risk group of individuals, enabling clinicians to diagnose heart failure earlier, in a community setting, through risk-stratification."

170,"1. Background: The management of patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery has undergone rapid changes. Due to the importance of intraoperative anesthesia and analgesia in improving patient outcomes, researchers have made many efforts to evaluate the analgesic effect on the lumbar spine, such as thoracolumbar interfascial plane block (TLIP) and erector spine plane block (ESP). . It is expected that the results of this study can provide a new analgesic technique for the lumbar spine. .

2. Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of thoracolumbar interfascial plane block (TLIP) and erector spine plane block (ESP) and general anesthesia (GA) in reducing the amount of postoperative analgesics in patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery. We will focus on the effectiveness of blockade, analgesic effect, and adverse effects.

3. Hypothesis: Thoracolumbar interfascial plane block (TLIP) and erector spine plane block (ESP) are more effective at reducing postoperative analgesic consumption.

4. Design: Randomized controlled trial

5. Methods: The study will be performed in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) Yunlin Branch (Lukang) Taiwan. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the CGMH, No: 202002469R. The following parameters will be used as the primary outcomes:

a) Area of blockade (TLIP and ESP block groups) (according to the pinprick test): Ultrasound was used to determine if the test needle was in the appropriate anatomical position by checking the appearance of an anesthetic nerve block. After that, a test injection of 2 mL of 2% lidocaine was used to prove that the needle was in the appropriate location for local anesthetic blockade. According to the results of the pinprick test, the extent of the sensory block was measured by measuring the time and distance from the site of the injection. The time and distance were recorded on the skin surface. The entire experimental process will be recorded on video. The blockade area is marked based on the test results, i.e. the sensory block area after the puncture needle is inserted is divided into 3 sections: the first third is marked as blockade in only 12% of patients, the second third is marked as blockade in 65% of patients, and the last third section is marked as blockade in 100% of patients. The time and distance are measured from time ""0"" to the maximum reach time ""T"", and the location of sensation loss is determined by measuring from the puncture point to the maximum reach point ""L.""

b) The perioperative effectiveness of blockade (TLIP and ESP block groups) (according to the analgesia nociception index, ANIm): The ANIm is based on electrocardiographic data reflecting parasympathetic activity. The ANIm creates a value from 0 to 100, where a value greater than 50 indicates adequate analgesia (high parasympathetic tone) and a value less than 50 indicates nociception (a high sympathetic tone) and therefore inadequate analgesia. We will focus on these aspects with a specific emphasis on sensory blockade.

c) The perioperative effectiveness of blockade (TLIPand ESP block groups) (according to total amount of fentanyl used during surgery): The anesthetist monitors each group to evaluate the effectiveness of blocking sensory nerves. The anesthetist records the total amount of fentanyl used during surgery for each subject in each group.

d) The perioperative effectiveness of blockade (TLIPand ESP block groups) (total dose of morphine in 12 hours and 24 hours after surgery): The total amount of morphine administered during surgery and the postoperative period will be recorded. The administration of each injection of analgesics in each group is recorded and recounted in the form of patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) and standard dosing in mL per day from 0 to 24 hours (per patient), and the total amount administered will be recorded from 12 to 24 hours.

6. Interventions: (The TLIP and ESP block groups received nerve block before surgery, followed by general anesthesia. The control group received nerve block after surgery.)

a) General anesthesia before surgery: Each patient in the ESP block group, TLIP block group, and Control"

Phase 1 is considered complete with recruitment of 6 participants who have the following skin tones: dark (AF4 = 20-50), light (AF4 = 50-80) or intermediate skin tones (AF4 = 30 or higher) of participants assigned to one of the following skin tone categories: African, European, and South East Asian. In Phase 2, an additional 6 participants will be recruited into the study. Participants will be selected from those who've completed the Phase 1 testing session. Phase 1 is considered complete with recruitment of 6 participants who have the following skin tones: dark (AF4 = 20-50), light (AF4 = 50-80) or intermediate skin tones (AF4 = 30 or higher) of participants assigned to one of the following skin tone categories: African, European, and South East Asian. In Phase 2, an additional 6 participants will be recruited into the study. Participants will be selected from those who've completed the Phase 1 testing session. 
Overall, the participants will be subjected to a maximum of six hours of testing, and will receive a $200.00 gift card for their assistance and participation. 
The hypothesis of this pilot study is: darker skin tones will be more accurately quantified, and the SpO2 measure will be less prone to errors compared to non-darker skinned participants 

The Study: 
The goal of this study is to confirm that MABOS may more accurately measure oxygen saturation of individuals whose skin may be prone to pigmentation errors or those who may have high melanin in their skin tissues. 
This study aims to evaluate: 
• The safety of contact with the melanin patch used by the MABOS device. 
• The comfort of wearing the device. 
• The accuracy of detecting changes in blood oxygen, compared to other FDA approved pulse oximeters. 
• The accuracy of differentiating skin tones between participants using 3 wavelengths of light. 
• The safety of contact with the melanin patch used by the MABOS device. 
• The comfort of wearing the device. 
• The accuracy of detecting changes in blood oxygen, compared to other FDA approved pulse oximeters. 
• The accuracy of differentiating skin tones between participants using 3 wavelengths of light. 

Participants: 
Participants will be recruited based on these criteria: 
• Age - 18-65; Male or Female. 
• Exclusion: known skin diseases such as psoriasis or eczema; pregnant, or lactating females; no ability to perform breathing exercises; or the presence of tattoos on the fingers, hands, or forearms or broken skin on the upper torso of participants. 

Procedure: 
Upon recruitment to the study, each participant will be given an informed consent form and informed by an individual responsible for informed consent. Participants will also confirm their awareness of risks related to the device. The informed consent form will be thoroughly explained for the participant to fully comprehend the study procedure and potential risks involved. Once the informed consent form is completed, the participant will be taken to the testing area. There, the study device will be applied to the participant, and the participant will be given two biometrics to track: blood oxygen and epidermal melanin concentration. In the initial survey, the final 7 pertain to safety. The Safety Sub-Score is determined by the latter 7 questions, making the score range from 7-35. In this case, a higher number indicates a better outcome. During the initial 10-minute survey, the first 12 questions pertain to comfort. The Comfort sub-Score is determined by the first 12 questions, making the score range from 12-60. In this case, a higher number indicates a better outcome. 
After a 90-minute testing period, the study device will be removed and the participants will be asked to complete an exit survey, comprised of the same demographic and safety/comfort questions seen in the initial survey, as well as an ""Ease of Use"" question, to provide feedback on any pain or discomfort felt due to contact with the adhesive, as well"

Efficacy and safety of Ganxinsan granules for relieving fatigue and weakness in patients with chronic heart failure

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The study is a prospective, open, double-arm, parallel-group clinical trial (two groups); the study is divided into two phases: single drug treatment and combination drug treatment; the clinical observation time is 12 weeks; the purpose of this study is to observe and evaluate the efficacy of ganxinsan granules alone (GXS group) and in combination with carvedilol (CGXS group) in the treatment of chronic heart failure in order to improve the treatment effect of chronic heart failure and provide a basis for the clinical application of GXS. This study was approved by the Clinical Trial Ethics Committee, and registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2100054886).

Detailed Description
-----------------
At present, the clinical application of conventional Chinese medicine combined with western medicine has achieved certain results in treating patients with chronic heart failure (CHF); and the combination of ginseng and astragalus is known to have a heart-soothing effect and can improve the physical and mental health of patients. So it can be used in the treatment of CHF; Therefore, the objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the two preparations of GXS granules alone and in combination with carvedilol in patients with CHF. This study was a prospective, open, double-arm, parallel-group clinical trial (two groups), the study was divided into two phases: single drug treatment and combination drug treatment; the clinical observation time was 12 weeks; the purpose of this study was to evaluate efficacy of ganxinsan single use for fatigue and weakness in patients with Chronic Heart Failure (CHF). This study will include 110 participants who met the diagnostic criteria of CHF and agreed to participate in this study. Participants will be randomly divided into 1:1 to receive GXS single use for 4 weeks and 8 weeks combined with carvedilol to assess the fatigue and weakness of patients with CHF based on the New York Heart Association (NYHA) score table.

175,"Critically ill patients are frequently exposed to environmental noise and light disturbing sleep. The EEG-guided sleep protection system SleepScan® is a medical device designed to provide continuous sleep monitoring and to display a specific picture on a tablet computer according to the patient status, therefore allowing staff to prioritize either sleep or care. SleepScan® also displays care interruptions and awakenings per hour of sleep, environmental noise, and environmental light. By placing the device close to the patient, nurses and caregivers are informed about their patients’ sleep and awakenings, and the presence of care interruptions, in order to improve the quality of care and patient’s safety.
The objective of this study is to assess the sleep quality of critically ill patients by comparison with the usual care.

Brief Description
=================
An important proportion of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients experience pain. As the disease progresses, people are required to visit the emergency room and need to be hospitalized more frequently. In some situations, patients are unable to maintain their independence and are put in a situation where they are unable to care for themselves. This is the case for patients who have severe persistent pain despite the use of the medication. This has a direct impact on the ability of sickle cell patients to work, go to school, and perform household chores. The goal of this study is to understand the effects of hypnosis on acute and chronic sickle pain. This study will help answer questions about the potential benefits of hypnosis in patients with sickle cell disease. Participants will be randomized to hypnosis sessions or to video of a museum. The investigators hypothesized that hypnosis will reduce pain, anxiety, fatigue and pain catastrophizing in patients with sickle cell disease. Participants will be randomly selected from two groups: a group that will use hypnosis and a group that will use a video of a museum to be used for entertainment purposes (i.e., relaxation technique). Both participants and those recruiting them will not know which group they belong to. Participants will use this strategy as they choose, but the investigators will guide them in the use of hypnosis (e.g., using positive phrases that remind them that they are in no danger). This strategy will be used to treat sickle cell disease patients who are in pain and will be done over 12 weeks. The investigators will make an appointment with the participants to talk about how the hypnosis or video of a museum helped them cope with sickle cell pain. This study will include 90 participants with sickle cell disease who experience pain. Each participant will be followed for 48 weeks. Participants will be recruited from the Sickle Disease Clinic at Queen's University, at the Montreal Children's Hospital, at the Jewish General Hospital Montreal and in the community. All participants will be given the opportunity to receive the hypnosis and video of a museum for the duration of the study. Some participants will receive the hypnosis and video of a museum immediately following the enrollment visit and follow-up with the study team (at 3 and 12 months). The investigators will also follow participants every 3 months for the next 12 months following the end of their participation in the study. The primary outcome measures will be changes in the number of pain episodes and in the number of sickle cell disease-related hospital admissions per month. The secondary outcome measures will be changes in the following: measures of anxiety, depression, fatigue, pain catastrophizing, pain intensity, quality of life, and sickle cell disease disease biometrics.

185,"Background: Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) results from the compression of the median nerve in the carpal tunnel. CTS is the most common compression neuropathy. It results from various inflammatory and metabolic causes. In most cases the exact pathogenesis is not clear. CTS usually affects the dominant hand. Symptoms include pain and other unpleasant sensations in the hand and wrist worsening at night. In more advanced stage, weakness and wasting of the thenar and other muscles innervated by median nerve occurs, which may lead to permanent impairment of manual performance. Nerve conduction studies (NCS) remain the method of choice in diagnosing CTS. However ultrasonography (US) is increasingly used along with or instead of NCS. US can be used in the diagnosis of CTS, both in patients with typical symptoms and signs, as well as in those in whom clinically, electrophysiologically and sonographically symptoms of CTS are absent or unspecific. Objective of the study: To assess the utility of the measurements of the maximal stenosis in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome. Methods: Patients referred to the Electromyographic Laboratory of the Department of Neurology at the Jagiellonian University Medical College, Cracow, Poland with symptoms suggestive of CTS (numbness of the hand, present or accentuated in the night, reduced hand dexterity) with CTS confirmed in NCS or US. All patients will undergo NCS of median and ipsilateral ulnar nerve and US of the median nerve with measurements of the cross-sectional area, diameter and echogenicity at various points, including the point of the maximal stenosis. The location of the maximal stenosis will also be evaluated. Subjects will also be asked to fill out the Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire (BCTQ) and a demographic questionnaire.

There is an urgent need for behavioral weight reduction programs in this area. There is limited support for telehealth for behavioral health and binge eating treatment in NC. DESIGN NARRATIVE: In Aim 1, we will conduct a mixed methods study based on CFIR framework to examine the barriers and facilitators and optimize the use of centering appetite digital health tool in a primary care setting for Black women. We will examine the feasibility of this digital health tool for Black women with clinically-relevant binge eating and obesity. In Aim 2, we propose to conduct a prospective 2-arm pilot RCT of the effects of the digital health centering appetite intervention in primary care versus no intervention. Eligible participants will be randomized into an intervention or no-intervention arm. Patients in the digital health intervention arm will receive education, coaching, and behavioral weight loss treatment using a smartphone app. Patients in the non-intervention arm will receive attention control, consisting of regular non-treatment-related communication with staff. RESULTS: The development of this tool will improve the quality of care of the digital health centering appetite intervention, by tailoring and optimizing the program to the needs of Black women presenting for primary care in NC. Through usability testing, we will identify the challenges and barriers for use of this program in our study population, and optimize the program to reflect the cultural preferences of Black women. We will also provide preliminary data regarding effectiveness. CONCLUSION: This feasibility study will strengthen the foundation for digital health and primary care to collaborate in developing a weight reduction program for Black women. This project will provide the essential resources and skills for NC health care providers to implement this intervention."

198,"1. Background
Dual-chamber ventricular pacing (DV-P) using pacemakers and leads is commonly indicated for a wide range of causes of bradycardia, such as sick sinus syndrome, recurrent atrioventricular (AV) block, and post-CABG syndrome [1]. However, DV-P can lead to several complications related to atrial or ventricular lead placement, including increased incidence of thromboembolic events, inappropriate AV block, and inappropriate or unintended ventricular pacing [2]. Permanent atrial lead implantation for DV-P can increase the risk of atrial thrombus formation and stroke/transient ischemic attack, which is a well-known complication after open-heart surgery. The potential increase in systemic thromboembolism events can partly be explained by atrial lead-induced atrial arrhythmias and inappropriate AV sequencing that result in slow ventricular stimulation during sinus rhythm and, hence, in reduced ventricular filling time and atrioventricular valve flow (stroke volume) [3]. It is well known that transcatheter permanent atrial lead implantation can further increase the complexity of the procedure, thereby reducing its effectiveness. When a patient with AV-block is not suitable for an atrial lead, the only alternative is DV-P using a ventricular lead with an active fixation screw in the coronary sinus. Although active-fixation screw-based coronary sinus lead systems are still routinely used, these DV-P systems may not offer optimal programming and delivery of pacing stimuli due to their large profile and long length. 
Although ventricular pacing has many drawbacks, it is often the only pacing option available for patients with symptomatic sinus node dysfunction/AV-block who refuse an atrial lead. Therefore, the use of an appropriate (i.e., compact, low profile, and flexible) and effective (i.e., less pacing related morbidity and better hemodynamic performance) ventricular pacing lead is an important issue. The conventional active fixed-screw-based coronary sinus leads have been in clinical use for more than 4 decades. These leads are characterized by their large diameters (5.4 – 6.25 F), large proximal segment, and long length (45 – 120 cm), although the diameter has been reduced from 6.25 to 5.6 Fr by the use of iridium-based flexible electrode with a small proximal segment. The long length and large diameter of these leads may not only result in difficulty during the coronary sinus lead implantation, but also increase the incidence of pacing-related side effects, especially RV pacing-induced dyssynchrony [4]. RV pacing-induced electrical dyssynchrony decreases RV global longitudinal function and results in adverse hemodynamic effects, such as left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and poor ejection fraction (LVEF) [2, 4, 5]. Left bundle branch area pacing (LBBAP) is a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) approach that may provide clinical benefits to patients undergoing AV node ablation, especially patients with an intact AV conduction. During LBBAP, a ventricular lead is placed in the left bundle branch area using either transcoronary sinus approach, transapical route, or more recently, the transseptal approach via left atrial appendage/right atrial wall [6]. Despite the potential hemodynamic and clinical benefits of LBBAP, there is a paucity of data on LBBAP lead implantation using a ventricular lead with an active fixation screw. The Solia S lead is a new type of ventricular lead with an electrically active fixation screw to be installed directly in the coronary sinus and anchored in the posterior wall of the coronary sinus. This lead and its associated delivery sheath have recently been clinically tested and approved for RV endocardial pace and sensing systems [7]. Therefore, based on the lead structure and mechanical strength of Solia S, it is proposed that an appropriately designed ventricular lead with an active fixation screw can be potentially used for coronary sinus LBBAP. 
2. Purpose
The purpose of this investigational plan is to evaluate the performance and clinical benefits of Solia S for LBBAP using a 5F conventional bipolar active-fixation ventricular lead. 
3. Objectives

199,"The aim of the clinical study (PRE-IOP) is to evaluate the clinical efficacy of several types of toothbrushes or oral prophylaxis products used in daily life during toothbrushing procedures, comparing their efficacy to remove dental plaque (sustained by a bacterial flora) and in reducing gingival inflammation. The study is open to pregnant women (aged 18-40). It will be carried out for 3 months in the Faculty of Dentistry of the Universidad de Chile, on a sample of 100 pregnant women with gingivitis. The following four oral prophylaxis methods will be randomised to the subjects: 1. Sonicare DiamondClean 9000 Philips®, 2. HydroSonic Easy Curaden®, 3. Manual toothbrush with 5460 strands Curaprox CS 5460 and 4. Manual toothbrush Oral-B 123. The gingival inflammation parameter will be determined using a clinical examination and a specific inflammation scoring system (modified oral hygiene indices, BOI, and GI). This study is a parallel, randomized, and controlled clinical trial. Patients will be divided into four experimental groups according to the type of toothbrush used. Patient recruitment will be done during the early stages of pregnancy, with no exclusion criteria (except for those cases that show severe periodontal disease and pregnancy complications). For both the sonic electric toothbrush and the hydrosonic toothbrush, the manufacturers recommended operating times and pressures will be maintained throughout the entire study. Manual toothbrushes will be used according to the operating times recommended by the manufacturers. Clinical evaluation of gingiva inflammation will be performed at the beginning and after 1 month and 3 months of using the aforementioned toothbrush. The primary efficacy outcome will be to evaluate changes from baseline of the proportion of gingival inflammation."

Eligibility Criteria:
Inclusion criteria include adult patients with cytologically confirmed Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer that receive pembrolizumab immunotherapy. 
Exclusion Criteria:
Patients not eligible for this study will have a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer where a cytologically or histologically confirmed diagnosis has not been established, a history of an allogeneic organ transplant, presence of active infection, uncontrolled hypertension or diabetes, presence of other serious uncontrolled medical conditions, previous immunotherapy treatment, history of other active malignancies or patients not interested in participating in the study.
Disease Characteristics:
The main objective of the study will focus on nutritional support and immune function in patients diagnosed with locally advanced or mestastatic non-small cell lung cancer undergoing therapy with immunotherapy (PD-1 specific antibody).
Background and Rationale for the Study:
A key factor contributing to the success of standard of care immunotherapy is the patient's ability to consume adequate amounts of calories from a varied diet as the immune system has been shown to be critically dependent on daily protein consumption. The importance of patients receiving nutritional support has also been corroborated by cancer registries reporting the presence of malnutrition at diagnosis as a negative prognostic factor in patients undergoing immunotherapy. Moreover, the patient's nutritional status can affect the efficacy of immunotherapy as shown in a recent retrospective study where the absence of malnutrition positively affected survival and increased the response to immunotherapy. However, even though the presence of malnutrition has been associated with poor survival outcomes in patients receiving cancer treatments, the importance of a nutritional intervention tailored specifically towards patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment has not been evaluated. Although a number of studies have evaluated the effect of nutritional support on the efficacy of cancer treatments, the focus of these studies has been to evaluate the effect of nutritional intervention on cancer recurrence and survival and not on the pharmacokinetics and efficacy specifically of immunotherapy. Moreover, the focus of the currently performed food supplementation studies are currently using food supplementation that are not specific to patients receiving immunotherapy treatments.
Consequently, the investigators intend to assess the feasibility and efficacy of a oncology tailored nutritional intervention on the pharmacokinetics of standard of care immunotherapy treatments. Through the measurement of the concentration of monoclonal antibodies at baseline and at different time points during immunotherapy treatment, the investigators will evaluate the effect of a nutritional intervention on the biochemical activity of standard of care immunotherapy treatment.

207,"The general objective of this study is to investigate the effects of acute eccentric exercises and application of electrical stimulation on the increase in maximum vertical jump and ankle dorsiflexion range as a result of proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation in paddle tennis players.
The investigators consider that the application of eccentric exercise and electrotherapy in the form of facilitatory techniques will help to increase the ankle dorsiflexion range, which will be measured using weight-bearing lunge test or range of motion measurement, and improve the maximum vertical jump, which will be measured using drop jump test.

Background
-----------------
The weight bearing lunge test is used as a measure of active ankle, hip and knee joint extension range, as well as active balance range (ankle, hip and knee) in the sagittal plane in a single static action. The patient will be placed with a comfortable stride and a wide base of support, ensuring that the contralateral foot is positioned outside the sagittal plane, the ipsilateral foot and the knee touch the floor, and both toes are also separated from each other. The lower limb will be raised, and an angle will be formed between the foot and the anterior plane or a perpendicular line. The clinometer application is used to measure the degree of bending of the knee, ankle and hip in the sagittal plane. In our study, the application is placed as a longitudinal axis of the lower limb at the level of the knee and hip joints; in an ankle dorsiflexion we will place the phone at the base of the fifth metatarsal.
In the case of drop jump tests, they will be carried out in sports equipment with a height of 25 cm. The participant would be placed comfortably on the box, and then the tester would count for one second to ensure that the participant could stand again on the feet of the box and that they reach the height of the box and not perform a rebound. The athlete, once on the The athlete, once on the box, should place his hands on his hips and drop from the top of the bench, cushion the impact and, once in the jumping position, perform a maximum vertical jump. The vertical position is the position with the highest height of the jump, so when the feet reconnect with the floor. The vertical jump height is calculated using the Jump Analyzer application. To perform measurements with the jump analyzer application, the distance between the heel of the plant foot to the ground and the height to the top of the jump must be calculated, to then make a difference between the two distances. The higher the difference, the greater the height of the jump. The difference between the two distances is then calculated in a mathematical process to obtain a value ranging from 0 to 10 points, in which 10 points would represent the highest possible jump
This study aims to evaluate the effects of acute eccentric exercises and application of electrotherapy in neuromuscular facilitation techniques on ankle dorsiflexion and maximum vertical jump distance in professional padel players during and immediately after the exercises and the next day.

Intervention
-----------------
The exercise protocol was applied according to a 4-stage exercise: warm-up, stretching, exercises and cooling down. The proprioception protocol for ankle dorsiflexion was performed in the seated position, with the ankle flexors of the right leg contracted from 90° up to 60°, with a strength of 7 / 10 and a frequency of 1 Hz. This position is maintained for 6 seconds. Then, 10 repetitions were performed, twice daily without electrical stimulation. After that, during the application of electrical stimulation sessions, a 10-minute period of electrical stimulation was applied at 100mA, using current types biphasic waveform, duration 250uS-250uS, with a frequency of 100 Hz. The investigators have established that a strength between 7 / 10 and 10 / 10 could be considered as a good muscle exertion to perform proprioception protocol for ankle dorsiflexion. Also, an electrical signal that could be considered as strong is a signal of 100mA, the type of electrical signal and its respective duration have been established at intervals that do not cause damage to the skin and the muscle cells. Eccentric exercises for proprioception protocol for ankle dorsiflexion. During the warm-up and stretching, participants performed one (1) static stretching exercise, which included three (3) stretching repetitions for 30 seconds, alternating the stretching of 1"

Participants will be individuals diagnosed with a first episode of MDD, according to the F32 Depressive episode (F32.0; F32.1; F32.2) classification of the Tenth Revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), under treatment with antidepressant medication for a period of time less than or equal to 6 months, attending to outpatient consultations. Potential participants will be invited to enrol by their medical doctors from the participating recruitment centres. The invitation will be made at regular medical appointments including primary care consultations and outpatient psychiatric consultations in one of the participant centers. After signing the informed consent, CRP and IL-6 levels will be tested. Participants with increased inflammatory biomarkers, meeting all other inclusion criteria will be randomized to (a) the intervention arm or (b) the control arm of the study, in a 1:1 ratio, using a computer-generated list of random numbers stratified by center in variable blocks of size 2, 4 and 6. Treatment allocation will be concealed from the researchers, using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The study will use a convenience sample from patients diagnosed with MDD attending to outpatient consultations in one for the participating clinics. Considering a 2-sided significance level of 5 percent and a power of 80 percent and having into consideration an attrition of 40 percent at the end of the intervention, the minimum sample size estimated is 190 (95 per arm). Estimating a prevalence of elevated inflammation in 30 percentage of MDD patients and 10 percentage of patients that don't meet other inclusion criteria, the number of recruited participants estimated is 700. Participants allocated to the intervention group will attend six nutrition consultations, performed by a register nutritionist in weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10. The intervention will be personalized to each participant and will promote adherence to the Mediterranean Diet, ad libitum, without calories or macronutrients restriction or recommendation for weight change. The intervention will follow a similar approach to the one proposed by Estruch et al. in the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease with a Mediterranean Diet study. The intervention will contemplate the following recommendations: Positive recommendations (promotion of the intake of the following foods): Use of olive oil as main fat, both for cooking and dressing; 2 or more servings of vegetables daily (200g of vegetables per serving); 2-3 servings of fresh fruits per day; 3 or more servings of legumes per day; 3 or more servings of fish per week (100 - 150g of fish per serving or 200g of shellfish); 3 or more servings of nuts a week (30g of nuts per serving); Meat consumption mainly from poultry (without skin) or rabbit; Home cooked meals with tomato, garlic and onion, at least twice a week; Negative recommendations (eliminate or drastically reduce the following foods): Cream,"
209,"13,000 children, adolescents and adults from refugee shelters in Tijuana, Mexico are forced to live in difficult conditions due to lack of stable housing, economic support, employment, health care and legal resources. Exposure to these hardships is known to have a negative impact on mental health (16%-44%) and parenting behaviors (52% reporting ""excessive discipline"") (1,2). Parenting skills trainings are the most widely used intervention for improving parent-child relationships during stressful times. Our intervention consists of implementing a bilingual and culturally adapted version of a 4-week parenting skills curriculum that is grounded in the social-ecological model and trauma-informed best practices. The curriculum will empower parents to identify and set goals for their families, and will include strategies for: building connection, regulating emotions, encouraging communication, supporting social/emotional development and improving behavior management. The intervention will be delivered in participatory community groups using a model of ""Learning by Observing and Pitching In"" (LOPI) that includes multiple learning methods (3). The primary outcome of the study will be changes in parenting knowledge and skills, as measured by an adapted Child Adjustment and Parent Efficacy Scale (3,4). The secondary outcomes will include changes in parental stress, and in parent-child interactions."

212,"1. Background and rationale for conducting the pilot study.
Pilots studies are often used in health research to assess if a planned intervention study will be able to recruit and retain participants and if it is possible to run the study in line with the intervention plan and the clinical evaluation procedures.

The aim of this pilot project is thus to investigate if it is possible to recruit parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities to a tailored home-based intervention to support their parenting skills. The pilot project is also in order to prepare and set-up an intervention study of an effective home-based parenting support program for parents with intellectual and developmental disabilities with a risk for neglect.

2. Short description of the planned intervention.
The proposed pilot project will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a home-based intervention program as the experimental group (EG) and treatment as usual (TAU) as the active-control group. The intervention program is based on parenting intervention programs for families with typical development but with several adaptions, such as more training sessions, more frequent contact with a practitioner, more written information with pictures, and training based on an iPad.

The primary aim of the intervention is to enhance parental competencies to meet the children's social and emotional needs and, thereby, to prevent and address neglect in children with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

3. Short description of the methodology to be used in the intervention study.
The recruitment and data collection are divided into three phases: screening, baseline evaluation, and follow-up evaluation.

Screening: The parents will be identified through records from the Swedish social services. The parents will be excluded from participation if their support needs indicate that they cannot participate and/or if they are not considered to be at risk for neglect based on a risk assessment. The support needs can be classified as mild, moderate, and severe (low, medium, and high need for support, see Appendix 1). The risk for neglect is assessed in accordance with the National Board of Health and Welfare’s guidelines for neglect (2017).

Baseline and follow-up assessments: Data on demographic data and background variables will be collected at baseline. After the baseline assessment, the parents will be randomly assigned to either the home-based intervention program or TAU, and both groups will have a follow-up assessment at the end of the intervention.

The primary outcome measure is the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM, Law et al. 1990) performance sub-scale will be used to obtain a total score between 1 and 100, where a score > 75 represents an ""acceptable"" outcome and < 75 represents an ""unacceptable"" outcome. COPM is the primary outcome measure because participants' perceived competencies will be used as a benchmark for evaluating if the program has worked well enough to make the parents feel less exposed to the risk of neglect and to have a feeling of improved competency as parents. The secondary outcome measures are the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Goodman, 1997), the Parental Sense of Competence Scale (Goodfellow et al. 2012) and self-esteem. All of these measures have been validated on the Swedish population.

The intervention program and all measurements will be performed by a practitioner with adequate knowledge of the population to which the parenting intervention is specifically designed. To facilitate the use of the iPad and the application for communication and data collection, the practitioner will have training in the application and in how to communicate and work interactively with iPad during the intervention program.

4. Short description of the primary outcomes and when they are measured and how this will be collected.
COPM performance sub-scale will be analyzed on the individual level (1-100) at baseline, 3-6 months (post-intervention), and 9-12 months (follow-up).

5. Short description of the secondary outcomes and when they are measured and how this will be collected.
Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (total score) will be measured at baseline, 3-6 months (post-intervention), and 9-12 months (follow-up). We will also examine the sub-scale scores of emotions, conduct, hyperactivity, peer problems, and prosocial behavior.
The Parental Sense of Competence Scale (total score) will be examined at baseline, 3-6 months (post-intervention), and 9-12 months (follow-up).
Self-esteem will be measured at baseline, 3-6 months (post-intervention), and 9-12 months (follow-up).

214,"5T4 (Trophoblast Cell-Surface Antigen) is a glycoprotein on the plasma membrane of many tumor cells, and its expression is considered to be specific to malignant tumor cells. It has been reported that immunological targeting of 5T4 can inhibit tumor cell growth and promote tumor cell death through antibody-based, immunoconjugate-based, and radiation-based mechanisms. At present, the expression of 5T4 has been confirmed by immunohistochemistry, but studies on dynamic detection of protein expression and quantitative analysis of the target protein have not been reported. To explore this problem, researchers have developed a new imaging agent 68Ga-NOTA-H006 for dynamic assessment of 5T4 expression using positron emission tomography (PET). In this study, on the basis of traditional imaging agent 68Ga-DOTA-DFO-BODIPY-RITC, with the help of structure-based design and cell experiments, a new 5T4 targeting PET imaging agent 68Ga-NOTA-H006 has been designed and synthesized, which has been shown to be more stable than the traditional imaging agent. The researchers will first investigate the biodistribution and metabolic pathway of 68Ga-DOTA-DFO-BODIPY-RITC and 68Ga-DOTA-DFO-H006, and compare their uptake in normal organs and malignant tumor foci using biodistribution and ex vivo autoradiography Assessment and correlation analysis will be carried out between in vivo PET imaging and in vitro immunohistochemical detection. Secondly, a small number of malignant tumor patients will be selected to evaluate the detection performance of 68Ga-DOTA-DFO-BODIPY-RITC and 68Ga-DOTA-DFO-H006. As a result, it is expected to obtain valuable experience in developing new imaging agents at the molecular level through structure-based design and cell experiments, establish a convenient, rapid and non-invasive method for accurate diagnostic imaging of malignant tumors, and provide new strategies for targeted imaging and new directions for individualized treatment of patients with different 5T4 expression."

218,"Background: Patients with advanced cancer may have suboptimal understanding of their diagnosis and prognosis. Prognostic unawareness is associated with low quality of life and high level of depression and anxiety. In this paper we report on the findings of a prospective study aiming to identify modifiable risk factors for prognostic unawareness and psychological distress in advanced cancer patients referred to an ESC team. Patients and methods: All consecutive adult patients with advanced cancer referred to the ESC team at University College London Hospital were eligible to participate. This study was embedded within an oncology outpatient service. Inclusion criteria were age 18 and older, fluent English language and capacity to consent. Patients who cannot complete questionnaires due to cognitive impairments were excluded from the study. Patients were notified about the study by a member of the ESC team. Interested patients were invited to participate after their consultation with the ESC team. After informed consent had been obtained, patients completed a questionnaire designed to collect information on sociodemographic and clinical factors, including quality of life (ED-12), depression (PHQ-2), anxiety (GAD-2), cancer type, disease stage and treatment type. They were also asked to rate their prognostic understanding and the quality of care perceived in an end of life setting (0-10 numerical rating scale). This questionnaire was completed on site within 1 week of patient assessment. Outcomes: Main outcome measures included patients' perceived prognosis and perceived quality of care. Patients' depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item (PHQ-2) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 2-item (GAD-2) respectively. Quality of life was assessed using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). Data analysis: Frequencies, percentages and measures of central tendency were presented for categorical and continuous variables respectively. Associations between prognostic understanding and potential modifiable risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable regression analyses."
219,"Background: Sepsis is associated with high morbidity and mortality, and incurable medical costs. It can be caused by a blood stream infection (BSI) with a variety of bacteria, of which Staphylococcus aureus and Enterobacteriaceae are the most prevalent, accounting for 70% of BSIs. BSI testing is based on collecting multiple samples of blood from the patient in order to culture multiple organisms, leading to false-negative results. As a result, the bacterial composition is often not known until 3 to 5 days after the culture results become available, leading to an estimated 30% overuse and underuse of antibiotics. Direct-from-blood testing (DFBT), such as the T2Bacteria® Panel (T2B®), can detect 18 major bacterial species and 10 antimicrobial susceptibility patterns directly from blood, leading to a more timely diagnosis of sepsis and antibiotic stewardship. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of direct-from-blood testing for blood stream infection management including antibiotic administration and clinical outcomes. Study Design, Setting and Population: This study will be performed utilizing data obtained from patients presenting to the Vanderbilt University Medical Center Emergency Department with suspicion of blood stream infection and subsequently admitted to Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Patients will be randomly assigned to an intervention group in which direct-from-blood testing (T2B®) will be used as part of the diagnostic battery or to a control group in which the standard of care is utilized. Study Hypothesis: The use of direct-from-blood testing (T2B®) will reduce the time between antibiotic administration decisions and blood culture positivity, ultimately leading to a reduction in overprescribing and undertreatment of patients with blood stream infection.

220,"Arterial hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. While medical treatment is usually necessary, lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and a balanced diet should always be included. Besides other therapeutic options, there are therapeutic approaches from the so called classical complementary medicine which experience increasing popularity. One of the most important parts in Europe is hydrotherapy, based on ideas of Sebastian Kneipp and his contemporaries. Despite Kneipp´s influence on modern medicine and his popularity among the general population, most contemporary physicians have no knowledge of hydrotherapy. In hydrotherapy there are various therapeutic approaches that can be used additionally to conventional therapy. Because conventional medical therapy is often associated with unwanted side effects, these additional approaches experience increasing popularity. The treatment with temperature-elevating armbaths is a relatively unknown hydrotherapeutic method today, but it was described as a highly recommended approach in arterial hypertension already in the 18th century. 
This randomized-controlled trial aims to evaluate the effect of a temperature-elevating armbath among participants with arterial hypertension. A total of 50 participants will be randomized to either an intervention group (performing Temperature-elevating Armbaths) or waitlist (treatment as usual) Control group has the opportunity to get instructed on performing the armbaths as well after the end of the trial. Inclusion criteria: adult participants (≥18 years) diagnosed arterial hypertension, at least stage I based on previous guidelines willingness to perform an armbath on a regular schedule The exclusion criteria are: Acute psychiatric disease ( e.g., addiction, major depression) Acute or major physical disease (e.g., cancer diagnosis within the last 5 years, major known cardiovascular diseases, renal or liver dysfunction), acute infection, major neurological diseases (epilepsy, Parkinsons´ disease), pregnancy or lactation period Secondary hypertension.

Primary outcome:: To determine the prevalence of persistent COVID-19 diagnosis in the current study. Informed consent is collected from interested adults or their designated surrogate who are 18 years of age or older and present to the SEREMI of Health in Punta Arenas between July 2022 and July 2023. Each candidate is identified by their unique patient identification number in the municipal health information system. The investigator is not responsible for conducting or reporting the study.
Secondary outcome:: Socio-demographic data. The purpose is to determine the number of prior illnesses, medical treatments, and vaccination records, as well as the quality of life scales, persistent COVID-19 symptoms through self-reported survey data, and Informed Consent Comprehension Questionnaire.
Psychological profiles. We will assess Beck Anxiety Scale (BAI), attention test D2-R, Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS) Questionnaires and Scales.
Sleep quality and disorders. We will assess Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Questionnaire.
Psychosocial exposures. We will use COVID-19 related stress questionnaire based on the Perceived Stress Scale Questionnaire.
Normal activities and work productivity questionnaire; daily diaries. Questionnaires and scaling.
Standard laboratory parameters. We will assess a complete blood count and a blood chemistry test to assess markers of disease progression and severity.
Inflammatory Biomarkers.We will assess Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-1β (IL-1β), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), Interleukin-12 (IL-12p70). Blood sampling: samples will be taken at the end of the study period for biochemical screening (CBC and biochemical profiling).

Flow Cytometry Immunophenotyping. We will assess different lymphocyte subpopulations in persistent COVID-19, Quantify Age-Associated B Cells and Their Potential Role in Persistent COVID-19 Pathogenesis.
We will obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from patients with persistent COVID-19. After completion of the study, the blood samples will then be sent to the University of Chile. In order to obtain the highest quality immunophenotypic data possible, we will follow established standard operation protocols (SOPs) to prepare and analyse the blood samples. SOPs provide precise instructions for carrying out a specific procedure, thereby minimizing the potential for human error.
Immune phenotyping by flow cytometry is a highly-respected and accepted method for assessing immune cell function. It allows for the characterization of immune cell populations based on their surface marker expression, and provides a comprehensive view of the dynamic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection. By understanding the characteristics of immune cells present in COVID-19-persistent patients, we will be able to identify potential therapeutic targets or develop new approaches to diagnosis and treatment of the disease.
Immunological repertoire analysis. To identify different T cell subsets and"
223,"BACKGROUND: The objective of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of an intrathecal catheter placement versus a recanalization attempt of a epidural catheter in the treatment of post dural puncture headache (PDPH). METHODS: The protocol was developed by the authors following the guidelines for prospective observational studies on therapeutic interventions. The study will be designed as a monocentric prospective randomized controlled trial. 90 subjects affected by dural puncture during labor will be consecutively enrolled and randomly allocated into two study groups upon diagnosis. Two independent research groups will be created in order to make this a double-blind study and to minimize selection and performance biases. INTERVENTIONS: During the course of delivery, recanalization attempt will be attempted in order to manage dural puncture. If the attempt is unsuccessful, a randomization procedure will be initiated. All patients randomized into the Intervention Group will have an intrathecal 12-gauge catheter placed to infuse a continuous intrathecal regimen for 24 to 36 hours after the placement. All patients randomized into the Control Group will have an attempt to re-canalize the epidural catheter in a different intervertebral space and epidural analgesia will be then continued with the epidural apparatus, according to the standard regimen. Follow-up visits will take place at 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days, 30 days and 3 months to evaluate the headache severity, additional intravenous analgesic requirements, occurrence of other complications, readmission to hospital, patient's satisfaction and the incidence of chronic headache or chronic low back pain."
224,"136 adults (18 to 90 years of age) with a cervical caries lesion (ICDAS GIS 6 or 7) in at least one of their molars were included. After informed consent, participants were randomized (1:1) for the application of a pre-wedged circumferential matrix band by using tofflemire retainer compared to a sectional matrix. Clinical assessments of the proximal contacts immediately after the procedure and after 1 year were performed by one assessor blinded to the treatment group and using a dental floss (#21/0.25; Unifl, P&G Dental Professional, Germany). The clinical parameters were: absence (optimum) as dental floss passed easily through the contact site; presence (tight) of resistance during the passage of floss; presence (tight) of dental floss tearing when passing through the contact site; and presence (open) of floss passage without resistance. The proportion of tight contacts and open contacts within the 3 classes of contacts (optimum, tight, and open) were evaluated."
225,"427 adult patients with a history of extensive use of psychiatric care were followed prospectively for 3 years. They were randomized to usual care (n=220) or to the County Mental Health Services Pay for Performance (PFP) program (n=207). Both groups of patients received an offer of assertive community treatment (ACT) or Assertive Supportive Services (ASS) depending on their needs. We report on a cluster-randomized trial (Santa Clara-CMS) in 791 patients over 36 months. Patients were assessed at 6, 12, 18, 24 and 36 month follow-ups, as are their use of emergency services, health care services, and the costs associated with these services, compared to the costs incurred before intervention (index period, 36 months).

Study Design: The Santa Clara-CMS was a cluster-randomized trial that used a repeated measures design. Our study examines the effects of a pay-for-performance program on utilization and cost of health care services at 36 months for an adult population with severe persistent mental illness.

Outcome
=================
Primary Outcomes: Primary analysis was a comparison of the mean difference in the rate of psychiatric service utilization between the two study arms over the 36 month follow-up period. Primary analyses were performed to compare difference scores in the rate of 24-hour psychiatric service use (Emergency Psychiatric Services or EPS, Barbara Arons Pavilion’s Acute Psychiatric Inpatient Unit or BAP, Crisis Residential, Transitional Residential, Residential Care Facility, State Hospital, Contract Hospital, or Institutes of Mental Disease or IMD) using a mixed model that included study group and time as fixed factors. Additional outcome measures included the frequency of emergency psychiatric care use, incarceration, costs of health services, and quality of life. Secondary analysis:  To better understand the effect of the PFP program on cost of health services, we compare between the program and the control groups the rates of total cost of health services (emergency services, behavioral health services, and medical services). The costs of health services over the course of the study were analyzed with a mixed generalized linear model (Poisson distribution) to examine differences in health services utilization between the two study arms while simultaneously accounting for any correlation resulting from repeated measures on each participant. We also examined costs of these services (out of pocket and Medi-Cal payments) in more detail, comparing differences in the number of hospital days, the frequency of incarcerations, and the cost of psychiatric board and care services in the two groups to better understand how these changes might affect overall differences in cost of care. Outcome variables examined included: Number of days of emergency psychiatric care, number of days in custody health care, the number of days in psychiatric board and care services (hospital, residential or supervised) and total days of in- and out-patient psychiatric care (EPS, BAP, crisis residential, transitional residential, etc.) for the 36 months measured.



Secondary Outcome(s)
=================
We are interested in understanding the impact of the PFP intervention on inpatient bed days in Santa Clara County psychiatric hospitals (Barbara Arons Pavilion, the State Hospital, and the Contract Hospitals), as these institutions are the most costly and in demand type of care. Data will be collected on the number of admissions, discharges and bed days for each client in each study arm during the three-year measurement period. This dataset will be used to compare the difference in the average number of bed days of treatment over the measurement period between the two study arms."
226,"Psychosis refers to severe symptoms of confusion that interfere with daily life. Psychosis tends to begin in late adolescence or early adulthood, and is often referred to as first-episode psychosis (FEP). While FEP affects all ages, most onset occurs around 23 years old. Without treatment, psychosis can last for a few weeks to several years. In Pakistan, there are no studies to assess the effectiveness, safety, and cost of using psychosocial treatments, specifically for patients with FEP in low and middle income countries (LMIC). There are several psychosocial treatments for psychosis that have shown effectiveness in high-resource countries, but there is little evidence to support their clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness in low and middle income countries. Family Intervention (FI) and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) are among the most efficacious psychosocial interventions to prevent relapse in schizophrenia. However, there is limited evidence from LMICs that supports the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of delivering these psychosocial interventions to individuals with FEP. We aim to determine the clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of culturally adapted cognitive behavioral therapy (CaCBT) and culturally adapted Family Intervention (CulFI) compared to Treatment as Usual (TAU) in reducing overall symptoms of psychosis in individuals with FEP in Pakistan. We plan to conduct a large multi-center randomised controlled trial (RCT) involving participants who are diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorders, such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders. This study will build important evidence in order to develop effective and culturally appropriate psychosocial treatments for FEP in Pakistan. Also, this study will investigate economic and health system implications related to the development and implementation of these interventions for use in Pakistan and LMICs. This research will create a lasting benefit for patients with FEP, their families, healthcare providers and health systems in Pakistan and will be a foundation for ongoing research and clinical implementation."

230,"We aim to evaluate the effects of binaural beat music (BBM) on the sleep quality, heart rate variability (HRV), and depression in older people with poor sleep quality in a long-term care institution. Our project hypothesis is that older adults with poor sleep quality will experience improvement in total time asleep, heart rate variability (HRV), and depression severity based on binaural beat music (BBM) intervention. Our project outcomes will enable us to evaluate the efficacy of BBM in older people with poor sleep quality in a long-term care institution through the measurement of improvement of sleep quality, HRV, and depression severity. Thus, our investigations will contribute to determining BBM's feasibility as a tool for reducing sleep and heart rate problems in elderly individuals."
231,"The aim of this project is to introduce, implement and evaluate, a Personalised Follow-Up pathway for patients who have received curative treatment for a Head and Neck cancer. The overall aim of the research is to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the Personalised Follow-Up pathway in order to determine its impact on patients, the health care system and service providers. Personalised Follow-Up Pathway is a new follow-up pathway that has been designed for patients following curative treatment of head and neck cancer. The aim of the clinic is to improve the support and advice provided to patients beyond the typical 5 year follow up, whilst reducing the burden on services. The Personalised Follow-Up Pathway involves: 1) risk stratification for disease recurrence using validated risk stratification tools, 2) the tailoring of follow-up based on individual patient risk of disease recurrence, and 3) the referral to the most appropriate local services for routine care and management. Clinical data will be routinely collected from patients who have been referred to the clinic. Risk stratification tools and protocols will be developed and will be reviewed by a Patient and Public Involvement Group before finalisation and use. Ethical approval will be obtained before any patient data is collected and will be discussed during site visits to all local service providers prior to commencement, to ensure all participants understand the potential implications of the study.

233,"86.5% of the worldwide population is affected by dental caries which is caused by specific microorganisms. Orthodontic treatment increases the risk of white spot lesions (WSLs), and periodontal inflammation in patients with poor oral hygiene. Treatment with a toothbrush or other mechanical instruments cannot completely remove soft and hard bacterial-plaque deposits. To eliminate hard bacterial deposits, many methods have been developed and a lot of research have been done trying to get rid of the bacteria, in order to prevent caries, gingivitis or periodontitis. The research hypothesis is whether a new air-polishing device is effective in preventing WSLs and gingivitis during fixed orthodontic treatment. Inflammatory markers in the gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) and dental plaque samples from the gum side of the tooth will be analyzed by the Bioplex 200 Suspension array system. The concentration of these markers will be expreseed as pg/ml and the DNA concentrations of the 6 periodontal pathogens P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, T. forsythia, P. intermedia, F. nucleatum, T. denticola, and T. tenebricosa will be expressed as copies/plaque sample."
234,"30 patients with atrioventricular nodal recurrence (AVNr) after successful AV nodal ablation (AVNA) will be randomized to either an AVNr-free period of at least 12 months (AVNr group, n=15) or 6 months of antiarrhythmic drug (AAD) treatment (n=15). In the AAD group, patients will switch immediately after their AVNA from any AAD they may be taking back to a single (class I or III) drug. The antiarrhythmic efficacy of AAD will be determined at the time of the patients’ first follow-up appointment after successful AVNA – that is after 3 months of AAD treatment. Patients will be followed for 1 year to determine whether they are free of AVNr. Patients with AVNr will have another AVNA performed by an electrophysiology-experienced EP, which will be recorded for a minimum of 72 hours in a Holter- or telemetry-type system using the programmable multichannel Holter recorder (Licox R30 System). The procedure time, number of repeat AVNAs required, duration of AAD treatment, and the occurrence of serious adverse events will be documented within a year of the AVNA. The study is considered a multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial. The hypothesis is that the use of a second AVNA for treating AVNr is more effective than 6 months of single AAD treatment in maintaining sinus rhythm.

This study will be a prospective implementation research study with a combination of both quantitative and qualitative measures. Using a mixed method design approach, this study seeks to examine implementation outcomes and experiences in integrating a digital social media-based intervention, Horyzons, into real-world clinical care settings. Horyzons contains evidence-based therapeutic content on topics that are common experiences among individuals with psychosis including: social anxiety, anxiety disorders, mood, and distress intolerance. Horyzons will be implemented for the entire length of the study for all participants and this study will also evaluate the participant's engagement with the site via usage measures as well as the attrition rates among participants who do not complete the study. As Horyzons involves therapeutic content and is designed to improve psychological outcomes, such as loneliness and social support, this platform is considered part of clinical care provided to individuals by their respective clinic. The goal of Horyzons is to aid individuals with psychosis in receiving peer support and therapeutic content that is commonly lacking in real-world treatment settings.

The investigators hypothesis is that a mindfulness-based intervention will be an effective and acceptable intervention for children with idiopathic chest pain and result in decreased chest pain, pain coping strategy use, stress, and improved quality of life. Study Design: After a 2-week wash-in period, participants in the study will be randomly assigned to receive standard of care. Participants in the mindfulness-based intervention group will partake in a 30 day mindfulness-based intervention on the mobile app Headspace. The investigators will recruit a total of 40 participants (20 in the mindfulness-based intervention group and 20 in the standard of care group) from the Pediatric Cardiology Department at Children’s Hospital Colorado. Primary Outcome Measures: Feasibility: Participant recruitment rate will be determined by the following formula: the number of participants who consent to participate in the study compared to the number of participants approached about study participation. Acceptability: Mindfulness-Based Intervention Program Evaluation will be determined by having participants complete the mindfulness program evaluation survey. Feasibility: Survey Response Rate will be determined by the following formula: the number of surveys completed by participants compared to the number of surveys sent out to be completed. Secondary Outcome Measures: Acceptability: Mindfulness-Based Intervention Program Adherence will be determined by collecting data from the Headspace app (i.e., length of each session). Pain Coping Strategies, Perceived Stress, Quality of Life: A series of questionnaires and surveys will be used to assess these outcomes, all of which are validated, clinical instrument tools.

A DLT is defined as the occurrence of an adverse event (AE) that is at least possibly related to the investigational product (IP) or investigational regimen (IR), with two exceptions: any grade of vitiligo or alopecia will not qualify as a DLT. The DLT assessment period is from the time of first dose of IP/IR and ends upon administration of the first dose of IP/IR on Cycle 2, Day 1 (28 day cycle).  Toxicities will be scored according to CTC criteria version 5.0 (Published November 27th, 2017). All participants that cannot complete the combination therapy as planned due to directly related toxicity will be discussed in the Study Steering Committee and they will determine whether the patient is classified as having a DLT. 

After dose titration and determination of the RP2D the next phase of the study will start to evaluate the efficacy of combination therapy with the determined RP2D.  The study will include a phase II study of 24 evaluable participants with pancreatic cancer to evaluate the clinical benefit rate of combination therapy with durvalumab and rintatolimod. |"
244,"The present project will be carried out through a randomized, double-blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study. A total of approximately 20 female athletes will be recruited for the study and will be informed about the objectives and methodology of the study. When there is agreement with the proposed design, the agreement to voluntarily participate in the study will be registered by means of an Informed Consent Form. 
The intense dynamic exercise modality proposed by the study is (concentric and eccentric contractions) following the following approach: The participant will perform a standardized muscle injury protocol that will consist of a sequence of three sets of repetitions until fatigue (maximum possible load until total voluntary exhaustion) of the muscular action of the bilateral legs in the lower limbs through the use of the leg-press machine with a 45° angle. 
During each action, the load will be resisted with the legs placed on the leg-press supporter from full knee extension to the 90° knee flexion angle, lasting approximately 3-5 seconds. Between each series, participants will be able to take a 1-minute rest period. 
The intense dynamic exercise protocol that will be carried out by all participants will be supervised by the project manager and/or collaborators duly trained for such assessments. Participants' clinical signs will be monitored frequently during the activities and in case of discomfort, the activity will be stopped immediately."
245,"1. Objective To gain a better understanding in which children treatment with Intrathecal baclofen is successful, and what factors play a role in a successful ITB treatment? 
2. Background/rationale To gain a better understanding in which children treatment with Intrathecal baclofen is successful, and what factors play a role in a successful ITB treatment? In our earlier RCT, we previously found that a higher level of dystonia prior to ITB and reduction of pain during ITB were associated, for a small part, with attainment of personal treatment goals. Sample size was not sufficient to look at specific factors associated with specific types of treatment goals. Long-term effects of ITB in a prospective cohort of individuals with CP have not yet been described in literature. Furthermore, ITB pump implantations in small centers may not be done by highly experienced ITB surgeons. Knowing which factors influence the success of ITB treatment, preferably related to specific types of goals, can be used to inform and select children and adolescents with CP better before starting ITB (based on known potential factors for successful ITB treatment), to improve the standard of patient selection for a new implantation and to inform health care professionals on the benefits of ITB.
3. Study design To gain a better understanding in which children treatment with Intrathecal baclofen is successful, and what factors play a role in a successful ITB treatment? A prospective observational study will be conducted in Amsterdam UMC and the MUMC using the Netherlands CP register to collect data over a period of 4,5 years. The CP register will be used as a mechanism to identify and retain children with CP who meet the inclusion criteria. This is a research project which runs in parallel with the regular clinical care provided by participating CP centers. The investigators will perform data-analysis on already existing data in the CP register, which were collected in previous research projects. There is no intervention on the part of the investigators. The data are collected at different timepoints before as well as after the intervention."

Participants will be randomly allocated into two groups, placebo group and vitamin D group. Women in both groups will receive 04-06 weeks of Vitamin D3 supplementation or placebo. 

Input Text: The Effect of Dietary Protein on Energy Intake and Dietary Choice During Resting

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Study objective: To quantify the effects of protein in relation to energy intake (EI) and food choice over three separate days of controlled dieting. Dietary protein requirements: Dietary protein recommendations for a lean body weight are typically defined in terms of body weight and are expressed as average daily intakes. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/kg body weight. Individuals who engage in regular physical activity require more protein to maintain lean muscle mass, the current recommendation is 1.2 - 1.4 g/kg body weight. There remains a high interest in understanding the mechanisms by which dietary protein influences appetitive sensations and satiation, with the intention of developing strategies to support weight-management interventions. EI is the combination of food consumed during meal-eating episodes, and snacking between meals. Although dietary protein can influence appetite sensations, the acute effects on EI are still being debated, the role of dietary protein is further compounded by its influence on food choice. Studies in free-living populations report that individuals who are consuming a higher protein diet will frequently consume the majority of their energy intake (upwards of 30%) from protein-based foods. Individuals who self-select a higher protein diet are more likely to achieve their desired body weight compared to individuals who self-select for a higher carbohydrate diet. The evidence has suggested that increasing dietary protein can enhance feelings of satiety and contribute to weight loss by reducing total calorie intake. Study hypothesis: Higher levels of protein per meal, compared to the RDA for protein, will induce a transient elevation of energy expenditure (EE). If we measure EE before and after a controlled meal that matches RDA recommendations, but manipulates how much of the calorie requirement is derived from protein, we can determine the extent to which protein elevates the metabolic rate.  An additional goal is to disentangle the metabolic effects of varying amounts of dietary protein from the effects of different types of protein. We will conduct a dietary crossover to enable us to compare how protein derived from various animal sources influences appetite sensations over a three-day period. By applying a dietary intake manipulation that matches RDA recommendations, whilst varying levels of dietary protein, the study will provide a valuable insight into the impact of dietary protein intake on EE and overall dietary choice. 

Detailed Description
-----------------
Study objective: To quantify the effects of protein in relation to a) energy intake (EI) and b) food choice over three separate days of controlled dieting (control and two different types of protein). Dietary protein requirements: Dietary protein requirements for a lean body weight are typically defined in terms of body weight and are expressed as average daily intakes. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for protein is 0.8 g/kg body weight. Individuals who engage in regular physical activity require more protein to maintain lean muscle mass, the current recommendation is 1.2- 1.4 g/kg body weight. There remains a high interest in understanding the mechanisms by which dietary protein influences appetitive sensations and satiation, with the intention of developing strategies to support weight-management interventions. Studies in free-living populations report that individuals who are consuming a higher protein diet will frequently consume the majority of their energy intake (upwards of 30%) from protein-based foods and that they are more likely to achieve their desired body weight. Higher levels of protein (beyond the RDA) reduce total calorie intake compared to carbohydrate-dominant diets, thereby promoting weight loss. In many cases, weight loss is the primary motivator for increasing protein intake, although there is good evidence to suggest that increased protein intake has a number of positive effects, regardless of body weight. Study hypothesis: Hypothesis 1: Higher levels of protein per meal, compared to the RDA for protein,"

248,"1000 mg of aspirin is recommended as the first-line pharmacological therapy for the prevention of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, despite its potential efficacy, aspirin is not without its side effects. This clinical trial aims to assess the safety and tolerability of three different doses of aspirin (100 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg) using a randomized clinical trial design. Data on adverse effects will be collected using patient-reported outcomes and laboratory tests, and the occurrence of these effects will be compared across the three doses. The study will also investigate the efficacy of aspirin in preventing recurrent VTE using clinical and radiological outcomes. By providing evidence-based information on the safety and efficacy of different doses of aspirin, the study will inform clinical practice and contribute to the prevention of VTE. This is a randomized clinical trial that compares three doses of aspirin (100 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg) for the prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with a previous history of VTE. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups. The study duration is 24 months, with a 48-month follow-up period. The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of major bleeding as determined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis criteria. The secondary outcome measures include VTE-related deaths, VTE recurrences, and all-cause mortality. Additionally, patient-reported outcomes and laboratory tests will be used to assess the safety and tolerability of the three doses of aspirin. Overall, this research initiative aims to provide high-quality evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of aspirin in preventing recurrent VTE in patients with a history of VTE. If proven effective and well-tolerated, aspirin may become a valuable treatment option for VTE prevention.

Introduction and motivation
-----------------
Background: venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a serious medical condition that can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It refers to the formation of a blood clot (thrombus) within a vein, and can manifest as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). Individuals who have previously experienced a VTE event are at an increased risk of recurrent VTE, with estimates suggesting that up to 30% of individuals may experience a recurrent episode within the first year. One of the most commonly prescribed drugs for the prevention of VTE is aspirin, and while it is widely used and has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of recurrent VTE, its safety and tolerability are not well understood. Studies have shown that aspirin can increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding, with some estimates suggesting that the risk may be as high as 1%. However, it is not known whether different doses of aspirin affect the risk of bleeding differently, and whether the benefits of aspirin outweigh the risks of bleeding. Objectives: The primary objective of the research initiative is to assess the safety and tolerability of three different doses of aspirin (100 mg, 250 mg, and 500 mg) for the prevention of recurrent VTE in patients with a previous history of VTE. The secondary objective is to determine the efficacy of aspirin in preventing recurrent VTE using clinical and radiological outcomes. Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial that aims to recruit 1500 patients who have previously experienced a VTE event. Patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of the three groups and will be required to take the assigned dose of aspirin for a period of 24 months. The primary outcome measure is the occurrence of major bleeding as determined by the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH) criteria. The secondary outcome measures include VTE-related deaths, VTE recurrences, and all-cause mortality. In addition to the clinical and radiological outcomes, patient-reported outcomes and laboratory tests will be used to assess the safety and tolerability of the three doses of aspirin. Conclusion: This research initiative aims to provide high-quality evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of aspirin in preventing recurrent VTE in patients with a history of VTE. If proven effective and well-tolerated, aspirin may become a valuable treatment option for VTE prevention.

250,"This study aims to investigate the effects of using controlled analgesia and sedation on the recovery of fiber colonoscopy, and compare it with intravenous combined anesthesia. This study is a single center, prospective, parallel-type, randomized controlled study. In the group of propofol and remifentanil mixed solution for controlled analgesia and sedation, after the basic anesthesia operation is performed, the patients continue to pump the analgesic and sedative mixture through the self-control pump to maintain the patient's anesthesia state. In the group of intravenous combined anesthesia, patients are injected intravenously with a combination of remifentanil and propofol anesthesia drugs during surgery, and then the AEPI value is used to adjust the concentration of anesthesia.

Intervention Duration
-----------------
Patients in the PCAS group receive the medication on a continuous basis at a speed of 0.1 ml/kg/h. Patients in the IV combined anesthesia group receive bolus dose of anesthetic medication at every anesthetic stage.

Intervention Description
-----------------
In the propofol and remifentanil mixing solution controlled analgesia and sedation group (PCAS group), after the basic anesthesia operation is performed, the patients continue to pump the analgesic and sedative mixture through the self-control pump to maintain the anesthesia state during the endoscopy. The controlled analgesia and sedation solution is mixed with propofol and remifentanil at a ratio of 1:1, the total volume is 1/6 of the total volume of the patient's vein access, and the drug is administered continuously at the speed of the patient's self-control pump. The basic operation is as follows: Ringer's injection is used to establish venous access in the right upper corner of the elbow. After entering a quiet environment and adjusting for comfort, oxygen is inhaled. The first three patients are observed for 1-2 minutes to evaluate the effectiveness of the analgesic and sedative methods, to determine the pumping speed of patients in the observation group, and to calculate and record the dosing and time required for each patient to enter anesthetic sleep and for each patient to wake up from sleep in order to calculate and calculate the drug dose and time required. In order to reduce the influence on the results by the same operation time, the analgesia and sedation operation is adjusted to make the endoscope enter the anesthetic sleep and waking up period within the average anesthesia time of the same surgical operation. During the observation group, only patients who are not disturbed by the patient's family members or nurses and receive sedation and analgesia according to their condition will be regarded as effective cases. In the group of intravenous combined anesthesia group（the IV combined anesthesia group), patients are injected intravenously with a combination of remifentanil and propofol anesthetic drugs during surgery Intravenous slow infusion of fentanyl 1 u G/kg, midazolam 0.02mg/kg, slowly administer propofol 0.8-1mg/kg after 2 minutes(time > 60s), and start the examination when the patient's consciousness disappears and they do not respond. During the surgery, propofol is interrupted to maintain the auditory evoked potential index (AAI) between 30-40.

251,"Study design and setting. This study is a prospective, observational, confirmatory, single-center study in predicting the chronicization of radiation-induced acute intestinal injury based on the expression level of immune factors. The study is being performed at the Sixth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Patient inclusion and follow up. Patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer who have developed RAII will be screened for research enrollment. The RAII and RARC will be defined according to the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) consensus (The American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) consensus). All eligible patients who accept this study and voluntarily sign the written informed consent will be enrolled in the study. The main indicators that will be recorded are: a) the expression level of TME-related immune factors in RAII/RARC; b) the clinicopathological information of the patients; c) the characteristics of chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and TME; and d) the pathological results of TME. Patient follow up will be conducted for 1 year after TME. Statistical Analysis.The Chi-Square Test and Fisher exact test will be used to compare categorical variables, and the Wilcoxon test and independent t-test will be used to compare continuous variables. A significance threshold of 0.05 will be adopted for all tests. Exploratory analysis.We will use unconditional logistic regression to evaluate independent risk factors of chronicization of RAII. The main outcome of our research is to establish an accurate prediction model to accurately evaluate the chronicization of RAII in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who undergo NCRT and TME therapies. Predictive factors of the chronicization of RAII (based on pathological findings of the colon), predictive factors of grade 0-1 intestinal damage (based on pre-planned CT imaging during NCRT), predictive factors of grade 1 intestinal injury (based on pre-planned CT or MRI findings during the follow-up period after NCRT was completed), predictive factor of the time of chronicization of RAII (based on clinical imaging during follow-up observation, time from TME to chronicization of RAII), predictive factor of the progression of chronicization of RAII (based on the clinical imaging during follow-up observation, time from TME to the progression of chronicization of RAII, the severity of chronicization of RAII). 200 patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer by pathology and MRI, who undergo NCRT and TME and develop RAII during NCRT or within 1 month, will be enrolled in this study.

258,"1) To study the efficacy of oral care education regarding oral health (including oral care behavior) for school children. School oral health program: The investigator will implement school oral health program (oral hygiene, fluoride use, dietary health recommendations, and dental care utilization) and conduct the intervention study among schoolchildren and primary caregivers. Participants will be randomly assigned to either Intervention Group or Wait-list Control Group. The intervention group will receive an oral self-care education program (2-hour oral health education program, including oral hygiene, fluoride use, dietary health recommendations, and dental care utilization) given to students and their primary caregivers at school twice a week for 50 minutes each time. Students will have two hours per week during school time to receive oral health lessons. During each oral health education program (70 minutes per classroom), the instructor will use PowerPoint slides, oral hygiene models, or dental care models to deliver the oral health education program. Students will be taught oral health lessons in small groups (e.g. 5-10 students in a classroom). They may ask questions and discuss ideas with others in the assigned groups. The Wait-list Control Group will not attend oral self-care education program. After 2 months of intervention and 2 months of control period, research assistants will use a structured questionnaire to collect data.

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The proposed study will compare two treatments in patients with psychosis under the care of the Emergency Mobile Psychiatry Team (EMPT) in order to provide guidance on how best to treat early psychosis, before symptoms have become severe. Our hypothesis is that the combination of two interventions will result in a better outcome than one intervention alone or treatment as usual. This trial is designed to be relatively small, and the results will serve as a preliminary test of the interventions, rather than a firm conclusion of the relative value of each intervention. The study will be conducted by members of the Mental Health Law Program and the Emergency Mobile Psychiatry Team (EMPT) of the Centre for Addictions and Mental Health (CAMH), in partnership with Toronto Western Hospital (TWH) and the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Toronto (U of T).

Detailed Description
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to test two treatments - Early Psychosis Intervention (ERPI) and Multimodal Transitional Care (MTC) - in order to provide guidance on how to treat early psychosis, before symptoms have become severe. ERPI will include pharmacological and psychosocial interventions. MTC will involve case management and supportive counselling. Both ERPI and MTC involve psychoeducation and community care planning. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive one of the two treatments. To participate in this study, participants must: have had an encounter with the Emergency Mobile Psychiatry Team (EMPT), within 3 months of inclusion in the study; speak and read English; have no major medical illness; and no history of forensic detention and/or hospitalization for psychiatric illness. Participants must also sign informed consent before being randomized to treatment. The study will be run along with the EMPT, out of the hospital Emergency Department. All participants will receive ERPI plus their regular care. Half of the participants will also receive MTC. The aim of treatment will be to assess potential benefits and risks. Specific questions the study will attempt to answer include: Do participants who receive ERPI plus MTC do better than participants who receive ERPI plus standard care, at follow-up at 6 and 12 months? Do participants who receive MTC do better than participants who receive standard care, at follow-up at 6 and 12 months? The primary outcomes measures will be: 1. the time until the psychotic condition worsens; 2. the presence or absence of hospitalisation; and 3. the level of social functioning. Data will be collected over 12 months.

260,"1. In Europe, ATTRwt is observed most frequently in the form of cardiac amyloidosis (ATTR-CA) (29%). These patients typically present symptoms at 63-66 years of age, are more frequently female, and exhibit higher mortality rate (approximately 20% in 8-16 months), compared with ATTRm. The rate of amyloid accumulation is also significantly faster in ATTRwt. Among patients with ATTRwt, 60-90% show cardiac involvement. Cardiac involvement may precede the development of polyneuropathy. 2. The investigators proposed the following hypothesis: Regional DPD SPECT uptake can predict the clinical course of ATTRwt more precisely than the pattern of LV segmental involvement. Further, the pattern of regional DPD uptake is associated with LV geometric remodeling. 3. This study will include a cohort of patients to describe the regional left ventricle 99mTc-DPD uptake in both ATTRwt and ATTRm cardiac amyloidosis. Additionally, the investigators will enroll first degree relatives of patients with ATTRm to assess the presence and extent of regional DPD uptake among asymptomatic hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis carriers."
261,"1. Objective of the Research: Detailed description of the Long-COVID-19 syndrome in children; research of the epidemiological features of the disease; identification of the main biological mechanisms that cause post-COVID-19 symptoms; early identification of post-COVID-19 syndrome and conducting preventive actions. 2. Diagnosis of Long-COVID-19 syndrome in children (by age): 2.1. Newborns (up to 1 year of life) • Children whose pregnancy was complicated by the SARS-CoV-2 infection of the maternal body, including at the end of the 1st and beginning of the 2nd trimester. The first stage of the research is an examination of a pregnant woman during her pregnancy and 1-3 months after childbirth in order to collect epidemiological information that will allow the further search for markers of Long-COVID-19 in the fetus. After delivery, the clinical follow-up of children in the first year of life with an ultrasonic examination of the thoracic organs and an ECG recording to verify the presence of congenital disorders of the cardiovascular system will be carried out. • Children who underwent isolation in intensive care immediately after childbirth. In such cases, during the first year of life, an ultrasound of the lung (bronchiolitis, emphysema), an electrocardiogram, an electroencephalogram. If necessary, biopsy sampling with analysis of the state of the respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous systems, blood and cerebrospinal fluid to exclude the presence of inflammatory and autoimmune processes. 2.2. Children aged 1 to 5 years A detailed examination of this age group is planned, the main group of children will be children aged 3 to 5 years, since they should enter kindergarten in the next 1.5 years. Infection with the new coronavirus is still very rare at this age, so the main group will be made of asymptomatic children who have been in forced isolation for longer than a month during the pandemic. 3. Children aged 6 - 13 years. According to statistics, the maximum number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 and asymptomatic and subclinical cases are registered in 14-year-old adolescents, so this group of children is planned to be the focus of the research. Children who were infected with a new coronavirus earlier during the COVID-19 pandemic will form the main group. In order to isolate post-COVID-19 syndrome as much as possible, children who have developed ARD will not be included in our study. 4. Adolescents and youth (14-17 years) Examination of the population of schoolchildren aged 14 - 17 years for the presence of post-COVID-19 symptoms and the prevalence of various pathologies in the body should be carried out through schools and children's health centers (CHS). It is expected that such a survey will allow us to identify potential risk groups before young people enter military service. 2.2. Screening of schoolchildren: • Survey of adolescents: questionnaire method - questionnaire among all schoolchildren. Questionnaire data will subsequently be supplemented by a personal interview. • Study of the nervous system: EEG, PET, CT (only if the method is available) • Study of the cardiovascular system: ECG, echocardiography, CT (only if the method is available) • Study of endocrine disorders: Ultrasound of the parathyroids (if the method is available). Hormone profile, glucose tolerance test for young people aged 16-17 years old. • Study of the gastrointestinal tract: Ultrasound of the stomach, duodenum and intestines (if the method is available). • Study of the immune system: The composition of the antitetanus vaccine (if not received) before admission to military service. Blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), anti-nucleocapsid protein Coronavirus IgM, IgG, and immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies. • Study of the metabolic system: Blood count, C-reactive protein (CRP), Procalcitonin (PCT), thyroid function analysis. 2.3. Physical examination: A detailed physical examination is planned to determine the prevalence of various pathologies in children who have suffered COVID-19 and examine the current state of the cardiovascular, respiratory and nervous systems"
262,"40 post operative patients with hip fracture will be randomised to either the intervention group and receive either an iPAD or a paper and pen questionnaire to complete prior to physiotherapy intervention. The intervention group will be allowed to either complete the iPAD intervention or the paper and pen questionnaire intervention in the presence of a physiotherapist and a family member. It is hypothesised that there will be a significant increased functional independence in the iPAD group compared to the paper and pen group at 28 days post enrolment.

266,"The immune system of humans can rapidly adapt its memory capacity to provide a faster second attack when a new pathogen enters the human body. SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VoC) escape the humoral immunity, which is induced after natural infections and vaccinations. Malaria (Plasmodium) and intestinal parasitic diseases (Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides spp.) induce similar innate immune responses. The investigators hypothesize that individuals with malaria and intestinal parasitic diseases may have more robust induction of humoral immunity upon natural infections or after vaccination since they may already have an effective innate immune system.

In Study 1 the investigators will recruit 100 household contacts of index patients who were infected with SARS-CoV-2. In Study 2the investigators will recruit up to 600 individuals without SARS-CoV-2 infection and randomize them to receive the AstraZeneca or Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines. 

To test the hypothesis for Study 1 the investigators will compare innate immune phenotypes between uninfected and infected individuals and infected patients who present mild illness with patients with intestinal parasitic infections and malaria. These associations will be assessed using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age and sex. To study Study 2, the investigators will collect data on innate immune phenotypes, T cell priming, B cell development, NAb responses, and ADCC responses.

In Study 1the investigators will compare innate immune phenotypes between uninfected and infected individuals and infected patients in mild illness with patients with intestinal parasitic infections and malaria. These associations will be assessed using multivariable linear regression models adjusted for age and sex. To test the hypothesis for Study 2 the investigators will collect data on innate immune phenotypes, T cell priming, B cell development, NAb responses, and ADCC responses.

The investigators hypothesize that, in general, people in Sub Saharan Africa may have better protection through these innate immune mechanisms against SARS-CoV-2 VoC and potentially have a broader and more sustained B cell repertoire. These results may guide vaccine regimens and new design strategies for sub Saharan Africa, where severe immunopathogenesis and poor vaccine responses may be associated with malnutrition, high pre-existing infections, and low immunity capacity."
267,"31.6% of the patients undergoing surgery have urinary catheter. The postoperative urinary retenion is defined to have a symptomatic urinary outlet obstruction. The etiology of post-operative urinary retenion includes the factors caused by the patient, due to the surgical process, due to the anesthesia. The incidence of postoperative urinary retenion is higher after spinal anesthesia. The prevalance of postoperative urinary retenion is 6-40% in the literature, that is, after surgery, after anesthesia, patients cannot urinate alone, or they experience pain in the perineum while urinating. Bladder spasm, bladder edema, cystitis, hematuria, and urethral stricture may occur due to urinary retenion. Postoperative urinary retenion can be evaluated with suprapubic bladder palpation (the presence/absence of bladder sounds), bladder catheter, and ultrasonographic techniques. Nursing is the process in which the care recipient's mental and social needs are met by meeting their comfort, support, and counseling needs. For this reason, nurses are the healthcare professionals with the greatest contribution to the success of the treatment process while managing the nursing needs of the patients. The main responsibility of the nurse during the perioperative period is to ensure the patient's comfort as soon as possible. To this end, they are responsible for identifying whether the patient needs it during the perioperative period, providing multidisciplinary cooperation in the management of complications that may develop during this period, evaluating the existing risk factors of the patient and the surgical process during the perioperative period, providing emotional support for surgical stress, questioning fluid intake, informing the patient about the consumption of caffeine-containing drinks and plenty of water. Nurses evaluate the patient by reviewing the existing risk factors of the patient and surgery process during the perioperative process, providing emotional support for surgical stress, questioning perioperative fluid intake, informing the patient about the consumption of caffeine-containing drinks and plenty of water, monitoring urine post-operatively, preferring non-invasive methods (listening to water sound, relaxation, bladder massage, mobilization, hot-cold application, ko mot/duck/sliders) primarily in case of PURE development, and invasive methods as a last resort (urinary catheterization, ensuring the necessary co-operation with the physician for interventional applications). Postoperative urinary retention, which is an important complication, will be evaluated using bladder sound, urinary catheter, and ultrasonographic techniques following a clinical examination. The hot-cold application of the bladder will be evaluated using the same methods."

269,"Background 
Sleep apnea (SA) is a pathological condition of intermittent airway obstruction during sleep 
Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for diagnosing sleep apnea, is time and labor demanding, expensive and requires highly specialized personnel, which limits its use in public health 
SA is considered a serious and prevalent problem since a high proportion of the general population could be affected 
Polycrombia (PC) consists on a change in the volume of blood that contains abnormally high levels of red blood cells (RBC). The main reason for PC is usually the presence of a disease that affects the production or destruction of RBCs in the body. Polycythemia can be caused by chronic hypoxemia (low oxygen in the blood). In the case of CPAP therapy it is not known if it causes a reduction in the levels of EPO and erythropoiesis in the first months of treatment, since it improves oxygen saturation 
According to the criteria of the Spanish Society of Pneumology and Thoracic Surgery (SEPAR), it is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that the treatment of the associated pathology is considered treatment for the polycythemia 
In case of lack of treatment results, there is no unanimity for the next steps in its treatment. In patients with a diagnosis of associated disease, polycythemia may be treated with phlebotomy, which has some adverse effects (excessive fatigue, decrease in energy or a tendency to infections) 
Aim 
  Comparison of change in hematocrit (HCT) before and after CPAP treatment.  
  Comparison of change in hematocrit (HCT) before and after treatment. 
  Comparison of the change of health-related quality of life assessed by the Euroqol-5 (EQ-5D) before and after CPAP intervention. 
   Characterization of the relationship between hypoxic burden (HB) and hematocrit and hemoglobin. 
  Characterization of the relationship between hypoxic burden (HB) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and hematocrit. 
  Characterization of the relationship between night time below SaO2 90% (T90) and oxygen desaturation index (ODI) and change in hematocrit. 
Design 
  Parallel group study, a control arm and an intervention arm. 
  The study will consist of three longitudinal assessments: baseline (before treatment with CPAP), 3 months and 12 months. 
  The study will last 12 months. 
  Study population: 176 patients with a diagnosis of OSA and polycythemia associated. 
  The sample is calculated assuming 80% power, a two-tailed 5% significance level, at least 26 patients at each comparison time point. The estimated sample is 64 patients per group, a total of 128 patients. A sample of 176 subjects will be recruited (88 subjects in the control group and 88 subjects in the intervention group. It is therefore expected for 10% to remain lost to follow-up and 15% to drop out during the study treatment period and / or follow-up period.

273,"Aims: The purpose of the tailoring bleeding reduction approaches in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) study is to determine the pharmacodynamics of potent P2Y12 monotherapy (prasugrel 10mg or ticagrelor 90mg) and de-escalation from a potent P2Y12 inhibitor to clopidogrel (75mg in this study, based on the current approved dosing) and their safety in terms of ischemic events. Clinical trials have shown the safety of de-escalation and potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy in terms of ischemia in clinical settings; however, the antiplatelet activities of these two approaches are not fully elucidated. The pharmacodynamics of potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy and de-escalation will be directly measured using in vitro platelet function analysis, Total Thrombus formation Analysis System, and ex vivo thrombus formation on a beating heart ex vivo. Platelet function analysis will be performed before treatment, 7 days after changing the treatment, and at 30 days. 

The investigators postulate that the P2Y12 receptor activity is greater in the de-escalated group than in the potent P2Y12 inhibitor monotherapy group.

274,"Eggs are a protein-rich food with abundant cholesterol and lipoproteins. Recent evidence demonstrates that different components of the egg modify the lipoprotein profile. LDL particles increase in response to egg yolk consumption, which can increase atherosclerotic risk. However, there is also evidence indicating that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles increase when consuming whole eggs, which can decrease atherosclerotic risk. Yet, the effects of the egg components, both collectively and individually, on lipoprotein profiles, remains unclear and merits further study.

This randomized controlled cross-over study will examine the effects of different dietary sources of egg-derived lipoproteins (cholesterol and proteins) on HDL particles and other markers related to metabolic and inflammatory health in young adults and older adults.

Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Eggs are a common food that increases atherosclerotic risk when added to the diet. Eggs increase circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which may increase atherosclerotic risk over time. However, research suggests that egg consumption can increase circulating levels of high-density lipoproteins (HDL), which can benefit cardiovascular health. Different aspects of the egg could be responsible for this change in the lipoprotein profile. One such aspect is that eggs contain many proteins, some of which have been known to act as cholesterol-binding agents. For example, apolipoprotein-cIII (apoCIII) has been shown to inhibit HDL formation and activity, but this protein is found in very low levels in circulating blood. Conversely, apolipoprotein-AII (apoAII), which is involved in making HDL larger and more active, is often found in higher levels in egg whites and other plant-based foods. Therefore, consuming egg whites, rather than whole eggs, might help lower cardiovascular risk in people who are not allergic to eggs. Previous research has shown that egg consumption can increase HDL-cholesterol in adults younger than 50, but increases in HDL were not observed in older adults. However, the effects of egg consumption (e.g., the number of weekly servings) on HDL subfractions, immune system response and gut microbiome composition remain unclear. Because HDL particles help clear cholesterol from the body, we seek to identify ways to optimize HDL particle size and the rate at which HDL is removed from the circulation. This could lead to improved HDL quality, which may be associated with improved health. The purpose of this study is to explore the changes in the lipid profile and immune system response during consumption of egg white, egg yolk, and whole egg.

Detailed Description
-----------------
The relationship between egg consumption and cardiovascular health has been established in prior human and animal studies. However, results from human trials have been inconclusive, largely due to inconsistencies in diet composition. While egg consumption has been associated with improved and impaired cardiovascular health, a 2019 Cochrane review found no strong evidence that eggs affect cardiovascular risk in healthy individuals. As such, no conclusions can be made about the effects of egg consumption on cholesterol metabolism and immune activity. For this reason, dietary effects of egg consumption will be explored in a human trial that will utilize a cross-over design. The trial will involve two sequential runs-in periods using a standardized weight loss diet, as well as a 4-week period of daily egg consumption followed by a 4-week period of egg consumption that is depleted of either the egg whites or the egg yolks. The investigators will use a 6-week break between runs to allow for ample blood sample collection during the 4-week egg consumption periods, to prevent confounding effects of weight loss, and to reduce any effect of habituation. The investigators will recruit young adults (18 - 30 y/o) and older adults (60 - 70 y/o) for this study, although the number of older adults may be reduced depending on subject availability. This study will involve a total of twelve 4-week diet periods: two 4-week high carbohydrate runs-in periods, two 4-week egg whole diet periods, two 4-week egg white diet periods, and two 4-week egg yolk diet periods. The results of this study will inform dietary intervention and provide insight into the relationships between the metabolic and immune effects of dietary cholesterol"
275,"1.1 Prosthetic users often perform sub-optimal grip function in daily activity and may not be aware of the need for improvement. 1.2 The sub-optimal grasp function is a primary reason for difficulty when completing everyday activities. 1.3 Patients often encounter challenges learning and using their prosthesis, and these challenges decrease prosthetic users' quality of life. The primary hypothesis is that MyoTrain AR will facilitate grasp training and improve upper limb movements during daily prosthetic use at long-term follow-up in amputee subjects with limited functionality. 4.1 MyoTrain AR is a virtual prosthesis functional training system. It consists of an augmented reality head-mounted display to provide a visual representation of the task and kinematic trackers to monitor hand-wrist activities during the training session. Patients perform the training with the HTC VIVE-based virtual prosthesis designed by the Myoloq engineering group. 4.1.1 MyoloQ - MyoTrain AR was developed using the Unity game engine and includes four tracking cameras, eight EMG electrodes, and an AR head-mounted display. 5.1 Current training methods for patients with upper limb loss are insufficient in facilitating functional task training. 5.1.1 Currently, all training methods focus on one specific aspect of hand movement. For example, training with a mirror or using mirror images only works on the wrist movement. Training by video observation only works on the upper limb movement. Training via pattern recognition with EMG only works on the grip and wrist movement. These training methods are often inadequate due to their narrow focus on one or two functions. 5.2 The current training method is also inefficient and non-immersive. 5.2.1 There is currently no training system that provides patients with the ability to visualize their entire upper limb movement during grasping, thereby making the task more realistic. 5.2.2 Traditional myoelectric training methods only visualize the patient's grip movement (hand opening and closing). Therefore, patients are unable to evaluate and visualize the entire movement of their limb. This leads to a poor understanding of the connection between the limb's upper extremity movement and the grasp movement. 5.3 The current training method is one-way. 5.3.1 The training methods of traditional myoelectric pattern recognition require the therapist to make individual training adjustments and do not consider patient-specific training requirements. This results in an overly passive role for patients, negatively affecting their self-confidence in using their myoelectric system and reducing the overall effectiveness of training. 5.4 Inadequacy of grasp function in prosthetic users limits prosthetic functions and causes users to have difficulty performing daily activities (e.g., dressing, cooking, etc.). In the long run, patients may become more dependent on caregivers and family members, resulting in a loss of confidence. 5.4.1 The grip function of the prosthetic upper extremity is one of the four important tasks used to judge the function of patients with lost limbs. The ability to accurately coordinate the upper extremity and complete grasp and release movements is the main foundation for prosthetic patients to carry out daily activities. The current training method cannot provide users with the ability to control and visualize the entire movement of the upper extremity and grasp in daily activities, causing patients to be less aware of this issue. 5.4.1.1 Poor function of the grasp will slow the pace of accomplishing daily tasks. This affects the user's experience of using the prosthetic system. 5.4.1.2 Poor grasp function may also affect the training of other functions, causing the training to become longer and more inefficient. This will reduce patients' self-confidence in using prosthetic systems. 6.1 Improve the function of the upper extremity by improving the coordination of the upper extremity and the grasp. 6.1.1 Achieving the above goal can improve patients' understanding and control of their prosthesis and help patients complete more complex tasks independently (e.g., making cups of tea) and improve their quality of life. 6.1.1.1 The goal of making the patient more aware of the problems of using the current interface is to help them understand the benefits of using pattern recognition control and improve their understanding and utilization of current MyoTrain AR training. 6.1.1.2 By improving patients' grasp movements, patients can achieve a high level of accuracy and stability in completing the training task, thereby shortening the training time. 6.1.1.3 By controlling patients' understanding of grasp movements and enhancing their awareness of using pattern recognition control, this will improve patients' self-confidence and help them better cope with"
276,"Treatment plan of colorectal cancer surgeries normally includes a prognostic period of ileus and the risk is greater with the increased extent of the surgery. Prolonged ileus is associated with greater in-patient stay as well as a higher occurrence of post-operative medical and surgical complications that may lead to re-operation or increased mortality. Previous studies suggest that the ileus is affected by the motility of the stomach. Stimulation of gastric motility may improve post-operative ileus and by this reduce the complications and morbidity following extensive cytoreductive surgery. The present study has a two-fold objectives: i) to investigate whether gastric electrical stimulation improves post-operative ileus and thus reduce the risk of re-operations and increase patient quality of life after surgery, ii) to investigate the role of gastric electrical stimulation in the pathophysiology of post-operative ileus, and if stimulation reduces time to flatus and time to stool."

This study will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the novel somatosensation device (SD) designed to improve people's balance and mobility by providing touch/pressure cues via vibration to specific regions of the trunk and lower limbs."
279,"An approximately 14 day baseline phase will establish the individual participant's severity of vertigo in the Baseline phase. The participant may be randomized to one of the two treatment arms, which will use the JotForm electronic data capture (EDC) system along with the OtoBand to collect participant data after the baseline phase. During the Treatment Phase, participants in the active treatment arm will use the OtoBand and record their severity of vertigo episodes, and the frequency of their vertigo episodes. Participants in the sham treatment arm will use the OtoBand sham device for up to 49 days. Each day of the Treatment Phase, the participant will record their vertigo symptoms in ePRO/Jotform using an online form. Additionally, every other day, participants will receive a survey via an online link or they will log on to the ePRO/Jotform to complete surveys and record symptoms. Participants will also keep a vertigo log or diary to record in which direction they had vertigo episodes while they were not in their study device, and the frequency of their vertigo episodes. At the end of this 7-week treatment phase study visits, the device will return to the study site.

285,"The goal of this project was to develop a novel biomarker to predict treatment response and to monitor disease progression for patients with HBV-related HCC who received radiotherapy. Serial changes of plasma vh-DNA copies derived from pre- and post-RT serum samples were closely associated with the clinical response to treatment while the traditional methods of ctDNA using somatic mutations were of low diagnostic value. Patients with different clinical outcomes could be separated by a median cut-off value calculated from the Kaplan–Meier method. Serial changes in plasma vhDNA copies are associated with both treatment response and prognosis. This study demonstrated the ability of vh-DNA biomarkers to identify responsive patients and to assess their prognosis when using it as a screening tool. Thus, vh-DNA biomarkers could significantly improve the efficiency of clinical trials and be used to identify patients who need more intensive and/or longer treatment. In addition, this study will provide data to support the future personalized use of plasma vh-DNA for evaluating treatment response and for determining disease prognosis for patients with HBV-related HCC after radiation treatment."

Cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of death, and its prevention is a global health priority. However, conventional cardiovascular prevention strategies are not sufficient to address this issue, as approximately half of the patients who are at high risk for cardiovascular events will experience a major cardiovascular event. Novel targeted therapies are urgently needed with the potential for broader adoption and improved patient outcomes.

Over half of the worldwide population with type 2 diabetes also have chronic kidney disease (CKD), as a result of the progressive decline in kidney function due to insulin resistance and the associated hyperglycaemia. Albuminuria is an early indicator of diabetic kidney disease, characterized by an increased excretion of albumin in urine. Elevated albumin urine excretion, in turn, increases blood pressure and is associated with a higher risk of cardiac and renal complications.

Another factor contributing to increased cardiovascular risk is elevated blood glucose, as is often seen in patients with type 2 diabetes. Several major studies have shown that sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, in addition to their glucose-lowering efficacy, have positive effects on albuminuria and blood pressure, resulting in an improved cardiovascular risk profile in patients with type 2 diabetes. The effect of SGLT2 inhibitors on albuminuria is particularly promising and has led to the introduction of SGLT2 inhibitors in clinical practice guidelines as a new therapeutic option for patients with diabetic kidney disease. Although SGLT2 inhibitors reduce albuminuria, the individualized optimal dose is unknown. This is an important issue, as the degree of albuminuria response to SGLT2 inhibitors varies among patients with diabetes.

Another class of medication, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), such as finerenone, may also improve the cardiovascular risk profile of patients with type 2 diabetes. MRAs have been shown to reduce albuminuria and blood pressure, as well as improve kidney and cardiac function. In addition, in a recent study, finerenone was found to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and lower the risk of renal death compared to placebo. Similar to the use of SGLT2 inhibitors, the individualized optimal dose of MRAs is unknown, but likely varies among patients with diabetes.

Thus, it is imperative to determine the most appropriate therapy for individualized treatment based on clinical characteristics such as the degree of albuminuria.

Rationale
-----------------
The primary aim of the study is to investigate whether a treatment with a SGLT2 inhibitor, empagliflozin, leads to optimal therapeutic responses in terms of cardiovascular risk profile, as evaluated by albuminuria, blood pressure, body weight, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In addition, the potential therapeutic effect of adding or replacing a MRA, finerenone, will be investigated after a suboptimal response. Secondary objectives are the evaluation of treatment adherence, and the identification of factors associated with optimized disease management and improved patient outcomes. The study will compare three different treatment strategies (empagliflozin monotherapy, intensified empagliflozin treatment, or non-pharmacological treatment) in patients with type 2 diabetes and albuminuria.

Objective
-----------------
Primary objective

To assess the individualized treatment response to the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin in terms of albuminuria, blood pressure, body weight, and eGFR after a treatment period of 6 months, measured as change from baseline.

Secondary objectives

-----------------
The prevalence of obesity and hypertension (HT) in children and adolescents has progressively increased in the past few decades, generating a significant public health issue and considerable amount of research. BP values among adolescents tend to be less heterogeneous than in adults, and the impact of a hereditary component of obesity is the expression of pathogenic mechanisms that have been present since the fetal period. The investigators recruited a randomized sample of 900 adolescents from high schools in the north, center and south of Italy, in order to obtain a sample representative of the Italian adolescents. During the visit at the high school, investigators obtain questionnaires to have some information about eating habits, lifestyle and family history, two (or three in they were very discordant) blood pressure measurements, weight and height of the students, a sample of urine and a sample of saliva to extract their DNA. In a subgroup of students (n=250), urines will be also analysed to estimate urinary Na+ and K+ excretion and to perform urinary protein and markers of inflammation-related and oxidative stress. The investigators genotyped 18 single nucleotide polymorphisms located in Adducin and EO-related genes. Statistical analyses: The χ2 analysis was used to test the differences in sex, ethnicity, eating habits, lifestyle, family history of hypertension and the prevalence of abnormal values of height, weight and BP. Student's t test was used to test the differences in BP, in Na+ and K+ intake and in proteinuria and markers of inflammation among obese patients with or without HT. Linear regression analysis was used to test the effects of genetic variants on BP and on Na+ and K+ intake. Multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis were also used to assess the influence of these genetic polymorphisms on HT and on proteinuria and circulating markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Statistical analysis of data was based on the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 2.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA), unless otherwise mentioned. The significance level was set at 0.05.

Primary Outcome Me"
296,"1 in 3 children have operations during their early lives (0 to 3 years). These operations are often associated with significant trauma and stress to developing bodies. While much is known about the impact of these factors, there remains uncertainty about the impact that general anaesthesia may have on many different processes and systems for a child. The effect on the developing brain is an area that has received growing attention over the last decade. Pre-clinical studies, including those looking at cells and animal models, have demonstrated the harmful effect that anaesthetic drugs can cause in nerve cells. Large studies of children have suggested that early age exposure to anaesthetic drugs may impact cognitive and behavioural outcomes however, although this has not been a universal finding. In 2016 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning regarding the use of anaesthetic drugs for children aged under 3 years, with the highest level of concern afforded to those who have prolonged and/or repeat exposures, showing the importance of this topic. This research aims to explore whether these changes in signals in DNA (epigenetic changes) can be seen in children undergoing anaesthesia and whether this is impacted by the type of anaesthetic given. To do this, the trial has been designed as a randomised, clinical, feasibility trial in which participants undergoing hypospadias surgery will be randomised to one of the two anaesthetic maintenance approaches that are used routinely in clinical practice: intravenous or inhalational. Blood will then undergo laboratory analysis including epigenetic, biochemical, haematological, and redox. This trial has been designed as a feasibility trial to evaluate whether a larger scale trial looking at anaesthesia and surgery in relation to changes in markers on DNA (epigenetics) is both possible, and of value. Currently there have been no published studies looking at whether general anaesthesia can cause epigenetic changes in children, and whether the type of anaesthetic given has an impact on any changes present. There is significantly less published research in children as it necessitates many additional considerations; this is part of the rationale for this study being designed as a feasibility trial with the primary objective of assessing and determining the feasibility of conducting a paediatric perioperative epigenetics study in which participants are randomised to two methods of maintaining anaesthesia for surgery. Alongside measures such as recruitment and retention rate, screening numbers, protocol compliance figures, this objective will incorporate feedback on acceptability for participants and clinical staff, the success of the data management system used, and if any additional resources are required. It has also been designed to address the secondary objectives of exploring whether anaesthesia and surgery are associated with epigenetic changes in whole blood, whether the strategy used to maintain anaesthesia impacts any epigenetic changes observed, and to identify which genes, pathways, and functional biological processes, may potentially be involved. Those with day-to-day responsibility for trial conduct will either be Good Clinical Practice trained trial-team members, or members of the treating clinical team. The Sponsor will continue to have oversight of the trial throughout, and their representatives will communicate closely with the trial team. The end of the study is defined as completion of the full set of analyses of the blood samples taken from participants. The findings will be disseminated in both a timely and responsible manner amongst the relevant scientific community and shared in an appropriate fashion with the legal representatives of the children who took part after. Reporting of the findings may take the form of presentations at meetings/conferences alongside the writing of a manuscript for submission to a scientific journal."

Background: 
Monograph:"
298,"Hypothesis: Frail older people with severe comorbidity who fracture their proximal femur can be offered good quality non-operative palliation as soon as this is indicated. Interventions include the use of analgesic, antispastic and osteoporotic medication, physiotherapy, and other supportive care as needed, in combination with a decision model for shared decision making between patients and physicians. Background: A hip fracture in a select group of frail elderly people can indicate an approaching end of life. These patients do not benefit from an operative treatment that aims to restore mobility. The FRAIL-HIP study showed that palliative non-operative management (PNOM) can be a good alternative for this group. By shared decision making between the patient/family and the medical specialists involved, surgery or PNOM was chosen. Half of the patients opted for PNOM. Quality of life was valued equally by patients in both groups. The majority of the next of kin in both groups rated the quality of dying as very good. Main goal: The primary and main aim of this study is to implement PNOM in all hospitals in the Netherlands, so that the selected frail elderly people with a limited life expectancy who fracture a hip receive the care that best meets their needs in the last phase of life. The treatment decision is made through shared decision-making. Objective: 1) to enriching the draft version of the PNOM protocol, and test results of the PNOM protocol draft; 2) to develop educational modules for the curriculum of residents Surgery and Orthopedics; 3) to create awareness and a sense of urgency for PNOM implementation in this select group of patients by organizing PNOM informational sessions during annual conferences of the scientific associations involved; 4) to improve the PNOM protocol on a smaller scale based on implementation of the PNOM protocol in selected hospitals across the country; and 5) to facilitate the scaling up of the implementation of the PNOM protocol to all hospitals in the Netherlands that treat the targeted patient group Study design: An implementation study will be performed. The study encompasses 4 phases of which the first 3 are interlinked in a way that it forms the design of the second phase, which is the main study (see Fig). Study population: All frail elderly with severe multimorbidity who fracture their proximal femur are the target population. Frail elderly is defined as: persons of 70 years or older, who either live in a nursing home or receive a similar level of care at home or in another type institution, and have at least one of the following characteristics: Are malnourished (cachexia or a Body Mass Index, BMI, of <18.5 kg/m2); or Have mobility issues with increased risk of falling pretrauma (Functional Ambulation Category, FAC, 2 or less); or Have severe comorbidities (American Society of Anesthesiologists, ASA, class 4 or 5) Methods: This study will use mixed methods in the different phases of the study. In phase 1, patients will be eligible for the different study phases as defined by the study protocol. Results: In the last phase, results will be assessed as follows: Implementation outcomes (feasibility, (cost-)effectiveness, acceptability, appropriateness, fidelity) to determine if the implementation process was successful. Effect outcomes (mortality, treatment, pain, comfort and quality of dying) for comparison between non-operative and operative treatment in relevant frail and elderly patients.

299,"Background: In the majority of patients undergoing radiotherapy for brain tumours, radiation-induced damage is present in the surrounding healthy tissues. This will lead to side effects of radiotherapy, hereby reducing quality of life of patients for whom radiotherapy is considered as treatment. As the main reason for side effects of radiotherapy is normal tissue damage, there is a need for reducing this damage as much a possible without reducing the tumour control rate (i.e. the effect of radiation in eliminating tumour cells) of radiotherapy. Current approaches to improve tumour control rate of radiotherapy are often focused on the macroscale structural changes of a tumour. For example, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently one of the key aspects in planning of radiotherapy treatment for brain tumours in which imaging markers such as tumour location, size and borders are used for delineation of the target volume for radiotherapy which is the total area in the brain that needs radiation. However, these areas are limited in accuracy due to the fact that the current imaging techniques are visualizing macroscale structural changes only rather than the microscale invasion of healthy tissue by tumour cells, which can all be happening before the macroscale structural changes are even present. State-of-the-art MRI techniques can be used to visualize the physiological processes occurring at this microscale level of the tumour. This allows for identifying this invasion at an early stage, such that the extent of radiotherapy treatment planning can be adjusted accordingly to only apply radiation at the areas with microscopic invasion of tumour cells. Therefore, generating a physiological target volume for radiotherapy treatment planning can help to increase the tumour control rate of radiotherapy using the same amount of radiation, hence further reducing the normal tissue damage and thereby reducing the side effects of radiotherapy. Furthermore, a physiological target volume may further improve the detection of true tumour progression during the follow-up of patients. This means that a physiological target volume could allow earlier intervention to prevent progression of the tumour. Rational: Currently, generation of the physiological target volume includes assessment of various physiological processes (i.e. oxygenation status, cell proliferation, metabolism and perfusion) using state-of-the-art MRI techniques. Currently, the time required for imaging all these different physiological processes is on average at least 1.5 hours. This is too long to apply into a clinical setting. However, if the imaging time can be reduced, for example by using artificial intelligence in conjunction with MRI scanning, more patients could be treated and the clinical impact could be very large. Therefore, our goal is to accelerate the imaging process such that a physiological target volume can be generated in routine patients using MRI scanning. Objective: We will perform an exploratory experiment in which the standard clinical MRI scan for RT planning for patients diagnosed with brain tumours is extended with state-of-the-art MRI techniques used to generate a physiological target volume. It is hypothesized that the standard and physiological target volume have a similar pattern of tumour failure during the follow-up period. Study design: A single-centre study will be conducted in which the standard clinical MRI scan for RT planning in patients diagnosed with brain tumours is extended with state-of-the-art MRI techniques used to generate a physiological target volume (extended MRI scan). The clinical standard MRI scan used for radiotherapy treatment planning in patients diagnosed with glioblastoma (GBM) takes on average 15-20 minutes; the extended MRI scan will last for additional 15-20 minutes. The additional imaging time will be taken while the patient is still awake, such as that the overall scan time does not go above 40 minutes. Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint of the study is the difference in volume of the standard and physiological target volume as generated by the extended MRI scan during radiotherapy treatment planning. Hereby, both volumes will be generated based on standard pre-radiotherapy MRI scan protocols currently used for treatment planning of patients diagnosed with GBM. The secondary endpoints of the study will be the pattern of failure (locations of failure) of the physiological and standard target volume during the follow-up of patients.

300,"Background and Rationale: 

The management of autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) consists in two distinct stages: the pre-transplant preparative conditioning (PC) of the hematopoietic cell system and the post-transplant reconstitution phase of the different cell types of the immune system. In this context, the clinical effect of the transplant relies on the elimination of immunocompetent autoreactive T- and B-cells of the recipient and the generation of the naive immune system from newly generated hematopoietic cells. The AHSCT strategy allows to restore and enhance the immune system and thereby to limit the immunological dysfunction implicated in autoimmune systemic sclerosis (SSc). Therefore, a therapeutic strategy based on AHSCT combined with a disease modification drug, tocilizumab (ATC code-L04) may represent a promising therapeutic solution for severe active SSc. The preliminary results of randomized clinical trials performed in France and Spain have revealed important clinical and immunological benefits, namely a stabilization of disease activity within an extended period of follow-up. Such a long-term clinical stabilization would allow a better compliance of SSc patients with treatment for SARS-CoV-2.

However, SSc patients treated by AHSCT may be more vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection, especially those who are older and therefore may benefit from vaccination. At this date, we have not observed specific COVID-19 adverse events related to this treatment in our active follow-up. However, we have observed significant dysimmunity, both innate and adaptative. The proportion of naive vaccine-specific T cells is significantly decreased two years after the AHSCT and this could affect their response to vaccination. Similarly, the vaccine-induced immune response is significantly correlated with total lymphocyte count one year after the AHSCT. AHSCT patients have also impaired humoral response, as shown by a lower frequency of positive anti-S1/S2 SARS-CoV IgG antibodies. This effect is likely to be related to a significant reduction of vaccine-specific B cell repertoire.

This study was initiated in the wake of the first COVID-19 wave to respond to the need for data on the efficacy of vaccination in SSc patients treated by AHSCT. The primary objective was to assess the effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in SSc patients previously treated by AHSCT and under active post-transplant follow-up. This question has been fully answered. Indeed, the AHSCT strategy allowed an important stabilization of systemic sclerosis activity within a 6-months period of follow-up, which could improve the compliance of SSc patients with preventive follow-up in our center, with a decreased proportion of non-acceptors for vaccination. However, none of the AHSCT patients developed symptoms of COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the secondary analysis will focus on the rate of refusal of SSc patients treated by AHSCT.

Hypothesis: The risk of refusal of vaccination is greater in active participants than in controls

Objectives: The primary objective is to determine the cumulative incidence of asymptomatic or symptomatic COVID-19 infection after AHSCT, as compared to non-AHSCT SSc patients. The secondary objectives are to describe the proportion of SSc patients, previously treated by AHSCT and in non-transplant controls, who refused vaccination during the study period, to determine the proportion of SSc patients with at least 1 grade≥3 adverse event after COVID19 vaccination, to characterize the onset of symptomatic COVID-19 infection in SSc patients previously treated by AHSCT and in non-transplant controls, and to characterize the clinical burden of COVID-19 infection and the severity of symptoms in both groups. In addition, the immune response after vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 will be explored by assessing the presence of antibodies directed against SARS-CoV-2, the vaccine used (type of virus, first or second jab), and the presence of anti-CTLP or anti-phosphatidylserine antibodies. We will also explore the association between the vaccine-induced response and the immunological status of participants.

301,"Background & Rationale : 
There is a significant gap in evidence about the most effective strategies to provide parents with the information and support they need to be able to take an active role in decision making, communication and their baby’s medical care when they have a sick newborn admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 
Rationale for Study: 
If parents are unable to take an active role in their baby’s medical care, parents of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) infants may experience heightened stress, reduced ability to adapt and may experience significant short-term and long-term mental health issues. 
In addition, parents not directly involved in the care of their baby, may experience heightened stress, reduced ability to adapt and may experience significant short-term and long-term mental health issues. 
If parents are unable to take an active role in their baby’s medical care, it may not be possible to improve clinical outcomes in NICU babies. 
If parents are able to take an active role in their baby’s medical care, mental health issues may be prevented. 
If parents are able to take an active role in their baby’s medical care, it may be possible to improve clinical outcomes in NICU babies. 
Study Purpose: 
This study proposes to test a complex NICU parent presence intervention targeting both parents at time of infant admission to the NICU (baseline). There are 2 arms of the study. The first study arm will be a parent presence model of shared decision making and family-centred care and the second a parent presence model that includes access to an EHR-based intervention that will be accessible using mobile phone devices and/or web based devices during the child’s hospital stay and post-discharge, to support families to access a curated library of best evidence.
Intervention: 
•	Intervention I: Enhanced Family-Centered Care and family participation in the child’s care. Parent participation is supported by direct education and support from clinicians but does not facilitate parent to parent engagement, or support of parent engagement from home. 
•	Intervention II: Enhanced Family-Centered Care and family participation in the child’s care PLUS an Electronic-Health Record based platform that will provide both parents the opportunity to learn about best evidence practices and to learn about the information being provided to their partner. 
Parents will be able to view educational modules, view educational video clips, read parent to parent stories, ask questions, and engage with each other to support their participation in the child’s medical care. 
Control Group: Neither intervention.
Target Enrollment: 886
Cohort Eligibility:

302,"İn this study, the Effects of Otago Exercise Program on Osteoporosis were investigated. In addition, it was tried to determine to what extent the physical condition parameters and osteoporosis risks changed during 12 weeks.
This study was performed in Pamukkale in 2017. Patients included in the study were evaluated in terms of their demographic and anthropometric characteristics. The study included women over the age of 54 who volunteered to participate in the study and who were in the post-menopausal phase and whose osteoporosis risk was calculated using the Osteoporosis Self Assessment Tool (OST) for Women (OST). The osteoporosis risks of the participants was calculated according to the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Women (OST). If the woman's osteoporosis risk was in medium range (41-80), and in high-risk range (81-100), then they were included in the study. The control group (n=20) included women over the age of 54 who were in the post-menopausal phase and whose osteoporosis risk was found low (0-40), but did not meet our other eligibility criteria. Exclusion criteria included medical evidence of bone fractures, muscle or orthopedic problems, history of bone fractures or surgery within the past 12 months, neurological problems such as dizziness, vestibular or neurological diseases, and high-risk of falling. The patients included in the study were randomly divided into two groups with the help of Research Randomizers program developed by Rand Corporation (https://www.randomizer.org/). As a result of the draw, the patients included in the study were divided into; Group 1 (n=31) participated Otago Exercise Program, and Group 2 (n=23) didn't participate Otago Exercise Program.
The aim of the Otago Exercise Program exercises were to strengthen muscles, improve body balance, and contribute to fall prevention.
The intervention group was taught all exercises by the principal investigator and physiotherapists during two 1-hour sessions in the first week. The aim of the program was to prevent falling by teaching the right and safe way to do balance exercises without getting tired. After the first week, when all 12 exercises had been completed, an 8-week home exercise program was started for the participants in the intervention group. It was recommended that the exercises be performed 3 times a week for 30 minutes each day with the guidance of a video prepared by the researchers in accordance with the protocol. 
After the first session of education, participants in the control group were given written information on ways to prevent osteoporosis and falling, and they were reminded not to change their treatment and life routine during the study period. The patient groups of both groups were re-educated once a week between the 2nd week and the 12th week of the program by the researchers working on the project and physiotherapists.
Quality of Life was tested with the ''Quality of Life for Osteoporosis Questionnaire''. The scale consists of 41 questions. There are 5 subscales: pain (5 items), physical function (17 items), social activity (7 items), general health assessment (3 items). For each subgroup and total result in the scale, 0 points indicate the best health status, while higher scores indicate poor quality of life. A 5-cm visual analog scale was used to test pain intensity. While 0-1-2-3-4 corresponds to no pain, 1 corresponds to mild pain, 2-3-4 corresponds to moderate pain, and 4 corresponds to high pain.
Senior Fitness Test was used to evaluate physical condition parameters of the patients. Lower extremity strength was evaluated by 30-second chair sit-stand test (lower extremity power), upper extremity strength was evaluated with the 30-second elbow bend test included in the ''Senior Fitness Test'', which is a physical fitness evaluation tool. Lower extremity flexibility was evaluated by the ''Sit and Reach Test''. During this test, the participant sits on a straight chair and spreads his legs so that the soles of both feet touch the wall. Then the participant reaches forward as far as possible and tries to touch his toes. This movement is performed twice with a 15-second break, and the average of the two repetitions is recorded. Upper extremity flexibility was evaluated by the ''Back Scratching Test''. During this test, the patient stands straight, keeping the palms of the hands together and"
303,"Digitized text message dietary interventions to improve diet quality are needed. The overall objective is to demonstrate if a digital-based diet quality intervention for adolescents with overweight or obesity is feasible and if there is preliminary effectiveness that diet quality and meal timing traits improve as assessed by 24-hr dietary recalls, a novel urine biomarker, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). 

The investigators anticipate that adolescents will be more interested in a dietary change intervention if the intervention can be completed through a digital-based platform, is customized, and is engaging. This intervention will be delivered remotely through digital-based text messaging to improve patient adherence. 
To ensure feasibility of future randomized control trials (RCT), the overarching goal of the current pilot study is to understand the best way to deliver a diet quality intervention by determining how many adolescents open text messages in the intervention. For aim 2, the investigators will look at the change in diet quality as measured by the 24-hour dietary recall and a novel urine Na:K biomarker for diet quality. For aim 3, the investigators will look at how meal timing affects body weight, body composition, and blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM).

The overarching objective of the current pilot study is to demonstrate if a digital-based diet quality intervention is feasible and if there is preliminary effectiveness that diet quality and meal timing traits improve as assessed by 24-hr dietary recalls, a novel urine biomarker of preload nutrient status, and continuous glucose monitoring.

Long COVID (LC) is an increasingly common medical condition that presents with a constellation of symptoms including olfactory loss (i.e. smell loss or dysfunction). These persistent LC symptoms can negatively impact a person’s quality of life (QOL), including mood, food enjoyment, social interaction, sleep quality, daytime energy, cognitive performance, and sex life. A common treatment for the loss of smell (i.e. anosmia) is ST, a form of behavioral therapy in which patients practice sniffing different odor chemicals. Yet the evidence for the benefits of ST is mixed; studies demonstrate both positive, and negative, effects that are unpredictable and do not persist beyond the treatment period. The current study hypothesizes that TNS-enhanced ST will show better results than conventional ST alone. This non-pharmacological, neuromodulatory intervention has been shown to enhance overall well-being in various neurological and psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and insomnia), and thus our secondary hypothesis is that TNS+ST will be able to ameliorate other LC symptoms that active ST cannot resolve alone, with the result of improving overall QOL."

The sham needle is then no longer manipulated to minimize any physiological effects. The selected acupoints and needle retention time were the same as for the acupuncture group. Since oblique insertion is required for acupuncture points on the head, the fixed acupuncture body of the Park device could not be used. Therefore, blunt needles are used to stimulate the head points to reduce the amount of stimulation produced by acupuncture. At the end of the treatment, the acupuncturist also used a dry cotton swab to press the acupoints so that patients could feel the withdrawal of 'real' needles.<br>|

309,"1. Introduction: Breast cancer remains one of top female malignancies. Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), comprising 15 to 20 percent of patients with invasive breast cancer, is a distinct subtype lacking estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PgR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) expression. There is currently no standard of care for those with node-negative (cN0), ER/PgR-negative (cER-neg/cPgR-neg) TNBC. Chemotherapy is the standard of care for node-positive patients with cER-neg/cPgR-neg TNBC. In this subset of patients, anthracycline-based chemotherapy has historically been considered standard of care for this subset of patients. A recent phase 3 clinical trial (NCT0188989), referred to as the NCT0188989 trial, enrolled patients with cER-neg/cPgR-neg TNBC, and showed the use of chemotherapy based sequential, rather than anthracycline-based combination, led to improved pathologic complete response (pCR), but not event-free survival (EFS) or overall survival in those who received anthracycline-containing combination chemotherapy . Additionally, patients who received anthracycline had more toxicities, including the development of cardiac complications. Current guidelines recommend the use of carboplatin or anthracycline-based chemotherapy. There have not been trials comparing these two options directly. The goal of the current trial is to evaluate whether taxane-only is non-inferior to the standard carboplatin/anthracycline-containing regimen in this population and to determine whether there are differences in pathologic complete response (pCR), invasive breast cancer event-free survival, and adverse events. 1. Specific Objectives: The primary objective of this randomized, multi-institutional clinical trial is to compare the non-inferiority of a taxane-only regimen to a carboplatin- and anthracycline-based regimen for patients with cER-neg/cPgR-neg TNBC with tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILS) ≥ 50% in the residual tumor burden (RTB) of the primary tumor (pT) resected after neoadjuvant systemic therapy (neoadjuvant NST) to demonstrate event-free survival after surgery and throughout 5 years of follow-up. The key secondary objective is to compare the pathologic complete response (pCR) rates between the treatment arms. 1.3 Definitions: 1. Definition of Outcome Measures: Breast Cancer Event-Free Survival (BC-EFS): Time from randomization to the earliest occurrence of any of the following events: progression prior to surgery, invasive recurrence after surgery, new contralateral breast cancer, or death due to any cause. New non-breast primaries are not included as events. RFS: Invasive breast cancer free survival after pCR. RFS is measured from time of surgery to date of invasive distant disease recurrence or death due to breast cancer or its treatment, assessed up to 5 years. DFS: Invasive breast cancer disease free survival (including loco-regional recurrence and contralateral regional spread of disease) after pCR. DFS is measured from time of surgery to date of invasive distant disease recurrence or death due to breast cancer or its treatment, assessed up to 5 years. DRFS: Distant recurrence free survival will be calculated as the time from surgery to date of invasive distant disease recurrence or death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years. DFI: Distant relapse-free interval is the time from surgery to date of invasive distant disease recurrence or death due to breast cancer or its treatment, whichever occurs first and is assessed up to 5 years. OS: Overall survival is measured from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause, assessed up to 5 years. Adverse Events: Rates of adverse events between two treatment arms will be compared based on patients who initiated the assigned therapy. 1.4 Definitions of Variables in Outcome Measures: Breast cancer event-free survival is defined as time to the earliest occurrence of any of the following events: progression prior to surgery; recurrence; new contralateral breast cancer; death unrelated to breast cancer or its treatment.

310,"Background: The Parent-Child Assistance Program (PCAP) is a highly effective evidence-based and nationally-recognized early childhood intervention and an essential part of the federal Family First Prevention Services Act (FFPSA). Despite the growing importance of the program, researchers have yet to examine whether PCAP could be implemented in a shorter period of time. The current study is the first empirical examination of a one-year version of PCAP (called PCAP-1). The proposed study involves a quasi-experimental design and a process evaluation. Specifically, we will examine the effectiveness of the one-year version of PCAP in preventing foster care by examining: 1) the proportion of target children who are not placed in foster care; 2) the proportion of mothers who acquire or maintain child custody; 3) the proportion of mothers who acquire or maintain abstinence from drugs and/or alcohol for at least 6 months; and 4) the proportion of mothers who acquire or maintain stable housing, employment, and education; in addition, we will measure the costs of the intervention and examine intervention outcomes using cost-effectiveness analyses. Methods: The proposed study will employ a quasi-experimental design and a process evaluation. We will examine the effectiveness of the one-year version of PCAP in preventing foster care by examining: 1) the proportion of target children who are not placed in foster care; 2) the proportion of mothers who acquire or maintain child custody; 3) the proportion of mothers who acquire or maintain abstinence from drugs and/or alcohol for at least 6 months; and 4) the proportion of mothers who acquire or maintain stable housing, employment, and education; in addition, we will measure the costs of the intervention and examine intervention outcomes using cost-effectiveness analyses. We will follow a 2-step approach: 1) first we will complete process evaluation by examining mother-child interaction quality and the quality of case management, which will shed light on the mechanisms through which PCAP-1 achieves its effects; and 2) second we will use statistical analytics to estimate the impact of PCAP-1 in preventing the need for foster care and achieving other key outcomes. The study will involve a total of 100 mothers enrolled for 12 months each, either in a treatment arm or control group. The study is designed to test the impact of a 1-year version of PCAP. The investigators will compare 1-year PCAP-1 program participants with control group participants who are enrolled in the 3-year version of PCAP (control group). The quasi-experimental design allows us to examine the impact of PCAP-1 while adjusting for participant characteristics, participant motivation, participant mindset, and program quality. Results: The proposed study builds on extensive research demonstrating that PCAP is effective in reducing the need for foster care among pregnant parents who have used alcohol and/or other drugs. The findings of the proposed study will provide guidance to the state's child welfare agency on their plan to implement PCAP in 21 additional counties. The new statewide implementation of PCAP to up to 28 additional counties will likely reach thousands more families and children at risk due to addiction. The new statewide implementation will have the potential to prevent hundreds of foster care placements and save millions of dollars in child welfare and juvenile justice system costs over 10 years.

315,"Background and Significance: Stakeholder engagement in research is encouraged to increase representation and participation in research. This is important, especially for Hispanics/Latinos, as they are the largest minority group in the US with one of the fastest-growing groups of autistic children. Method/Design: This project is a randomized mixed methods design that will compare the effectiveness of two stakeholder engagement methods (Focus Groups (FGs) and Design Thinking (DT)). The study uses a longitudinal mixed methods design that includes quantitative and qualitative data collection measures to compare the stakeholder engagement method outcomes. Phase I of the project evaluates the two methods by comparing their effectiveness in stakeholder engagement with a focus on the PCORI engagement areas. At the end of phase 1, data will be merged and the qualitative data will serve to triangulate and enrich the quantitative data by contextualizing the data and understanding the underlying reasons for the reported outcomes. In phase II, data from the qualitative method (FG) will be used to adapt two versions of the OT/ASI Protocol (Ayres Sensory Integration-based Occupational Therapy Intervention) for Hispanic/Latino autistic children. A third OT/ASI Protocol will be adapted based on the qualitative data collected in phase I of the project. Each of the protocols will be tested with a small group of Hispanic/Latino parents/caregivers and OT practitioners. At the end of the study, all stakeholder engagement data is merged, examined, and critiqued as part of the validation of the two engagement methods. The study will contribute to an evidence-based research foundation needed for designing culturally appropriate interventions and improving stakeholder engagement in clinical research to reduce health disparities and improve outcomes for underserved groups."

321,"6% to 10% of youth report exercise as their main activity for weight loss. This high drop-out rate is mainly caused by two factors: children not understanding the importance of exercise and children not wanting to join exercises for fear that they do not feel like everyone else. Peer mentoring could potentially mitigate these reasons for drop-out. Moreover, the long-term success of a lifestyle weight loss intervention requires the intervention to integrate the use of existing social networks to effectively overcome external environment barriers. This proposal aims to overcome these major barriers to drop-out in young teenagers by recruiting high school students to serve as peer mentors for the exercise component of a family weight-loss intervention for families of young teenagers (6-8th grade). The mentors and their mentees will participate in a 12-week, structured peer mentoring program promoting moderate and vigorous physical activities as the main activity for successful weight loss. The study uses a single masked, randomized controlled clinical trial and integrates innovative technologies to overcome the problem of in-person mentoring. 250 families with children in 6-8th grade from 13 of the 22 Appalachian (KY) counties with >40% poverty rate will participate. The study will employ high school students in these counties as peer mentors. 400 families (96 per each county) in 13 counties will be randomized into either a structured peer mentoring program with guided family reinforcement program or a self-guided intervention. To assess the sustainability of the exercise intervention participants will be followed for 9 months. Data analysis will employ generalized estimating equation approach with an exchangeable correlation structure to account for the correlation structure of the repeated measures.

Interventional Model Description: This study employs a single masking, 2-arm randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) with a parallel arm group design. The intervention will be delivered in 13 counties of Appalachian Kentucky (KY) as part of the 'Moving to a Healthy Weight, Together' initiative, funded by the Kentucky Department for Public Health (KDPHP). Participants (n=250) in the intervention arm will receive either 14 weeks of an evidence-based childhood weight management program called 'Mentoring to be Active' (MPBA) or a ten-week structured peer mentoring component followed by a monthly social reinforcement program for seven months. Participants in the intervention arm will be followed for 9 months. The study will employ 13 high schools students in the target communities to serve as peer mentors in the MPBA+F group (n=44). Parents/guardians (n=72) will participate as reinforcement agents in the MPBA+F group. The study uses an innovative, digital delivery platform (https://mentoringtobeactive.org/). The study also uses mHealth technologies to collect physical activity objectively and sedentary behavior subjectively.

| Experimental: MPBA+F<br>For the first phase, ten peer-mentoring sessions (1 day/week for 45 minutes each week) delivered virtually with a Project Leader, five peer mentors, and 8-10 mentees with 1:2 mentor/mentee ratios. The second phase consists of MPBA+F participants receiving a 7-month reinforcement program with monthly rewards-based skill building sessions. For the 10-week MPBA+F intervention, mentors will be recruited through a job post in high schools and will receive a training session from the PI on how to become an effective peer mentor and how to recruit their peers. Mentees will be recruited either at the school by inviting only those adolescents with BMIs in the 85th percentile or at the community level by inviting siblings who are overweight/obese. Recruited mentees will provide the name of a potential mentor and they will be matched using a software package. A child participant assigned to MPBA+F might also be assigned as a peer mentor in another county. During the weekly sessions, each mentor will work with 2-3 mentees. The MPBA will be delivered to a total of 13 counties (96 participants per county). The total sample"

325,"This project has the ambition to implement an accessible and efficient clinical trial that could rapidly evaluate the efficacy of vaccines during the current COVID-19 pandemic. 
The project builds on national and international collaborations that have led to the development of a new serological assay that directly measures live, replication-competent SARS-CoV-2. This assay allows to quantify the dose of infectious virus per ml of blood. However, this assay has not been formally studied in the context of vaccination. 
This project would therefore test the hypothesis that the serological assay evaluates the specific immune response to a COVID-19 vaccine, and that this response correlates with neutralization of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and a reduced risk of post-vaccination COVID-19. To achieve this objective, the project would collect blood from individuals during and after COVID-19 vaccination and correlate the response measured by the serological assay with the development of neutralizing antibodies and post-vaccination SARS-CoV-2 viral load. 
This project would provide invaluable data on the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines in real-time and could inform vaccination policies in the event that a new and more contagious SARS-CoV-2 variant emerges.

327,"Background
-----------------
As a chronic and progressive disease, hemodialysis(HD) patients have low life quality and high morbidity of cardiovascular disease(CVD). The incidence of depression in HD patients was 20% ~ 30% in a broad sense, and 50% if evaluated with the Beck Depression Inventory scale(the Chinese version 2.0). As a chronic and progressive disease, depression syndrome and cardiovascular disease both contribute to the increasing mortality in these patients. The gut microbiota has been identified as a key factor in many metabolic and neurological psychiatric disorders. Several studies have reported the changes in the composition and diversity of the intestinal microbiota, which was negatively correlated with the severity of depression. The study aims at evaluating the effects of a daily oral administration of a probiotic (Miyairi 588 is a probiotic food for specified health use) on depression symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients. We hypothesized that gut microbiota plays an important modulating role in depressive syndromes and cardiovascular disease through modulation of inflammatory response.

Objective
-----------------
We will investigate the effects of probiotic MIYAIRI 588 for 3 months on depression symptoms and cardiovascular risk factors in hemodialysis patients and evaluate the effect mechanisms related to inflammation in these patients.

Study design
-----------------
Prospective, single-center, open, and randomized controlled study.

Participants enrollment setting
-----------------
Eligible participants will be recruited from hemodialysis patients in the 3rd, the 4th, and the 5th hospital of China Medical University, by referring participants from the patients’ card file.

Intervention
-----------------
The 15 HD participants who agree to participate in the study will be randomized to the experimental group and the control group in a simple and equal fashion. The participants in the experimental group will be asked to take probiotic MIYAIRI 588 (1g/package, 4 packages/dose, and 3 doses/daily) with a meal for 3 months. They will also be tested for blood biochemistry related to inflammation before and after the probiotic intervention and complete questionnaires for depression assessment. The participants in the control group will complete the questionnaires just like the participants in the experimental group, but they will receive the same dosage of placebo during the experiment period.

Study period
-----------------
The entire study, including follow-up, will last for 9 months.

Primary outcome
-----------------
The primary endpoint is the Beck Depression Inventory score, which will be evaluated at 0th, 1st, 4th, 6th, and 9th month after baseline. The depression score includes 21 multiple-choice questions. The respondents choose the response that most accurately reflects their feelings over the past 4 weeks. The higher scores mean poorer outcomes.

Secondary outcomes
-----------------
Cardiovascular risk factors as well as inflammatory biomarkers were measured at 1st, 4th, 6th, and 9th month after baseline. Cardiovascular risk factors: serum levels of High-density lipoprotein (HDL), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and triglyceride (TG). Inflammatory Biomarkers: Hemoglobin (HB), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), blood sugar (Glu), total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglyceride (TG), hs-CRP.

Methods
-----------------
The experiment is to be done in a single-center and on a small scale (n = 15). The investigator will enroll participants who will meet the inclusion and exclude criteria. In order to ensure the integrity of randomized design, allocation concealment should be carried out which will be achieved by opaque envelopes. In order to ensure that the probiotics or placebo are distributed equally over time, the participants may be asked to collect the medicines from their doctor randomly. Randomization and blinding are the most important factor to achieve the study objectives. Probiotic and placebo will be provided in similar packages, and neither the patients nor the investigators will"
328,"This is a research grant that is part of the NIDA K08 career development awards scheme. It is divided into two phases: Phase I is a formative phase, which aims to refine and improve the intervention and determine its feasibility. This phase is intended to test the validity of the intervention, and will only be available to non-drinkers, to assess CM-PST's acceptability, preliminary efficacy, and integration with CM. In addition, the investigator will be able to identify any potential issues with intervention delivery, which may lead to refinements in the intervention manual or content, and which may help maximize the potential positive impact of the treatment. Phase II is the R00 trial, which will test the impact of CM-PST on abstinence for 3 and 6 months from the point of alcohol use initiation among individuals who are undergoing a period of risky drinking. In both phases, the investigator will assess self-reported alcohol consumption. Participants will also be asked to provide 2 breathalyzer readings/day for the first 2 weeks following a CM-PST or CM-only treatment session and will complete 2 weekly surveys to rate the content of CM-PST. Urine alcohol tests (using a home breathalyzer) will occur twice a week and will be paired with an electronic survey. To measure potential changes in neural activation, participants in Phase II will also undergo brain imaging 5x at the beginning, middle and end of their intervention.

335,"The incidence of delirium in the intensive care unit (ICU) is about 50-80 percent (1). Delirium is associated with poor short-term and long-term outcomes of ICU patients, including increased mortality and cognitive complications (2-4). It has been reported that 10-44 percent of ICU patients suffer from long-term cognitive dysfunction (5, 6). Although the prophylactic intervention with sedative-hypnotic agents prevents delirium and improve outcomes, but sedative agents often cause adverse effects, thereby increasing the risk of mortality (7) Moreover, delirium that develops during ICU stay is unlikely to improve or reverse to the baseline status when the patient is transferred from the ICU to other units (8), and its negative effects persist after being transferred back to their home. Therefore, there is an urgent need to identify new and alternative low-risk strategies for treating and preventing delirium in the ICU. 
The new technologies, such as virtual reality (VR)-based programs, have already been accepted as an adjunct to treatment and rehabilitation, and it has also been shown that VR promotes sensory stimulation, which seems to be promising in the prevention and treatment of delirium (9). Several studies have demonstrated that VR-based sensory stimulation is effective in preventing cognitive decline and improving patients' quality of life and cognitive function (10-12). However, there is currently a lack of strong, high-quality, randomised controlled trials in this field.

BACKGROUND: The investigators have decided to conduct this clinical study due to the scientific knowledge of the past 20 years indicating the benefit of probiotics in the management of multiple metabolic disturbances, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, dyslipidemia; as well as certain disorders of the gastrointestinal tract, such as irritable bowel syndrome. Despite this, it should be noted that the effect of probiotics on the prevention of liver fibrosis and the severity of inflammatory metabolic risk factors has not yet been fully established and the efficacy of probiotics and their derivatives in the management of Metabolic syndrome is questionable. 


Several previous trials have shown that probiotics in combination with diet and exercise may be effective in reducing various risk factors associated with metabolic disorders. However, the results regarding the efficacy of probiotics in treating hepatic fat content, as well as the improvement of serum lipid profile and inflammatory markers remain inconclusive. At the same time, the safety of probiotics remains well-established in the scientific literature. The investigators hypothesis is that postbiotic and metabiotic compounds possess similar properties to probiotics and, despite the structural destruction of the probiotic cell wall, their components are able to influence host cells and microbioma. 


Several previous clinical trials have demonstrated that postbiotics and metabiotic compounds are able to improve various metabolic problems, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). These results seem very promising and the investigators hope that our randomized controlled clinical study will add new data to the field of postbiotics' and metabiotic's effects on metabolic diseases. The present randomized clinical trial aims to study the efficacy and safety of probiotic lysate (postbiotic and metabiotic) supplementation on hepatic fat content, inflammatory disease activity markers and other metabolic features in adults with NAFLD. 


RESEARCH THEMES AND OBJECTIVES: The investigators plan a 6 month prospective, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in adults with NAFLD. The main clinical goal of the study is to assess the short-term efficacy and safety of postbiotics on hepatic fat content, chronic systemic inflammatory markers and biochemical hepatic steatosis parameters (namely hepatic steatosis index, Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis index and fatty liver index) in NAFLD patients. In addition, the investigators plan to collect biological samples for genomic, microbiomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabonomic analysis in subpopulations of patients, selected based on various diagnostic criteria for NAFLD. 


ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The present study was approved by the National Bioethics Center (N. B. C. of the study: 012022000650). This randomized clinical trial will be performed in accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 and its subsequent revisions. Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants before their inclusion in the study. An ethics committee was established to supervise this study. The results of this study will be submitted to an international scientific journal.

339,"Background 
Sickle cell disease affects millions people worldwide. It is characterized by the presence of abnormal hemoglobin that under conditions where the blood oxygen level is low or during a period of sickle cell crises leads to altered red blood cell morphology resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) is the most common manifestation of sickle cell disease and is characterized by severe vasoconstriction and subsequent red blood cell obstruction in the small blood vessels. The result of obstructive red cell circulation is acute, severe pain that causes patients to present to the emergency department (ED). The acute sickle cell crisis is considered a medical emergency where prolonged periods of pain are associated with poor long-term outcomes. VOC can have long lasting symptoms which affect the quality of life in patients with sickle cell disease. 

The aim of standard therapy for sickle cell crisis includes control of pain with opioid pain relievers and IV hydration. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often used in combination with hydration and opioids to facilitate pain relief for patients. While IV hydration and NSAIDs are mainstay of ED treatment, additional medication is needed for opioid titration. Many patients can become uncomfortable with the side effects of opioids at higher doses, such as nausea, headache, constipation, and dizziness. It has been reported that 35% of patients with sickle cell disease are dissatisfied with the management of VOC primarily due to over-sedation and inability to communicate pain due to increased doses of narcotic medications. 

Virtual Reality Goggles (VR) use digital technology to produce imagery, sound, and other stimuli, and these goggles have been associated with reduced pain, decreased opioid use, and improved patient satisfaction when used for the purposes of distraction and immersion in other pain populations (ie: burn patients and general surgery patients). One study evaluated the effects of VR distraction as compared to standard ED care for pediatric patients with VOC. The VR group experienced greater pain reduction after 30 minutes as compared to the standard ED care group. There was no difference in time to ED disposition between the groups. 

The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of VR plus standard pain therapy compared to standard pain therapy alone for patients 6 to 21 years with sickle cell VOC. We hypothesize that patients who receive care with VR will report lower pain scores after initial hospital triage and/or on repeated pain assessments while in the ED, and this group will have a decreased rate of admission to the hospital, a shorter time to ED disposition, and a shorter length of stay while in the ED compared to patients receiving standard medical care alone.

Study Design 
This is a prospective, sequential group assignment study. There will be a control cohort that we will analyze retrospectively, and a prospective experimental cohort that will receive the VR as an adjunct to standard medical care for sickle cell VOC. All data points will be recorded from patient medical records. Standard medical care will be offered by a trained provider who is aware of the study hypothesis. The VR intervention is offered in conjunction with the standard medical care. Patients are eligible to receive either standard medical care alone or standard medical care plus VR. This is a single center study conducted in the pediatric ED at Children's Hospital Colorado.

Primary Outcome Measures 
Primary outcomes will be pain score and ED disposition. Pain scores will be recorded as part of routine care, and these scores will be measured while in the ED. Pain scores will be recorded within 4 hours of ED presentation and will serve to be a measurement of pain in patients diagnosed with sickle cell VOC. We hypothesize that pain scores will be lower in patients who receive VR with standard medical care compared to the group who receive standard medical care alone. Patients disposition, as recorded in patient medical records, will be used to determine our second primary outcome and this will be compared to the historical control groups' disposition rates.

Secondary Outcome Measures 
We aim to track the overall time from ED presentation to disposition decision. We also aim to track the length of stay while a patient is in the ED, measured from time of patient presentation to time of disposition either through admission to the hospital or through discharge from the ED.

Data Analysis 
Continuous data will be presented in the form of mean values with standard deviations, and categorical data will be presented in the form of numbers and percentage values. We will perform a cross-sectional"

BACKGROUND - Secondary prevention of recurrent cardiovascular events is the key intervention after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, many studies have shown lack of compliance with secondary prevention. To achieve effective strategies for the prevention of recurrent events may be crucial for both patient survival and disease impact in our Country. AIMS OF THE STUDY - the purpose of this study is assess the potential benefits of the support to secondary prevention, implemented through an integrated web application. The investigators hypothesis is that the support of the web application will improve secondary prevention compliance, both in terms of lifestyle and pharmacological factors. METHODS - this is a prospective and observational single-center study. All patients admitted with AMI to the Department of Cardiology of Modena Hospital during the study inclusion period and meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be asked to participate to the study. Patients admitted with STEMI will be randomized (using a computerized randomization list generated by the Institute of Biostatistics of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia) to intervention vs. usual care. All patients will be asked to comply a strict in-hospital lifestyle recommendation during hospitalization (at least physical exercise of 30 min per day in addition to the standard walking protocol). In addition, all patients, regardless of allocation to the study group, will undergo a routine cardiologic follow-up visits (1 mo, 3 mo, 1 y, and 2 y) to assess compliance to secondary prevention. Intervention patients will be further asked to download a digital web application, the use of which will be tailored on the personal and demographic characteristics of the patient. INTERVENTION GROUP, a series of educational emails, personalized reminders for periodic use of the web application; a) personalized reminders for periodic use of the web application; b) access to a site-dedicated message box will be provided throughout the study to provide guidance on personalized lifestyle improvement; c) possibility of video-calls with the preventive team. CONTROL GROUP will be provided with conventional cardiological follow-up visits only. The primary outcome is the achievement of controlled levels of cardiovascular risk factors in patients at high cardiovascular risk after AMI. Secondary objectives are measurement of compliance to lifestyle and pharmacological treatments and improvement of health related quality of life, assessment of patient satisfaction, assessment of health economic aspects related to the digital empowerment (evaluation will be performed on the basis of healthcare resources used, cost-utility analysis - CUA & cost-efficacy analysis -CEA)."
341,"Elbow pain in children often presents to the pediatric emergency department where imaging with standard Xray may be indicated. While plain film radiographic imaging is considered the gold standard for diagnosing acute elbow fractures, it requires time and resources and is often associated with the risk for unnecessary radiation exposure to the patient and pediatric provider. Pocket sized ultrasound (PsUS) devices that can offer improved portability, reduced economic costs, and are not associated with ionizing radiation have recently gained popularity in the pediatric emergency department. However, prior studies in which PsUS devices were used by trained, emergently-trained, or naïve trainees have demonstrated variable and low test performance. Our objective is to determine the accuracy of standardized PsUS elbow exams performed by bedside-trained pediatric emergency medicine physicians for the detection of pediatric elbow fractures in children up to the age of 16 years old. This pilot test will first involve recruiting 3 individuals to determine acceptability of the study training and protocol, followed by recruiting 170 children aged 1-16 at a single urban emergency department with suspected elbow injury. After the US elbow exam, Xray will be determined by the standard clinical management with clinical followup with the patient and their treating physician at 2 weeks."
342,"If left untreated, hallux valgus becomes a painful and progressive disease of the big toe that severely restricts the patient's daily activities and disrupts the aesthetic appearance of the foot. As the deformity progresses, dissatisfaction with the appearance of the foot, difficulty in choosing shoes, difficulty in walking and, accordingly, limitation in daily activities, arch pathologies Individuals' health-related quality of life and functional levels are negatively affected due to problems such as nail problems, bunions and callus formations. Surgical and conservative treatment methods are used in the treatment of hallux valgus deformity. Conservative treatment methods are more preferred due to possible complications of surgical treatment methods such as infection, skin problems, bone nonunion, bone malunion, hallux valgus and complex regional pain syndrome. Conservative treatment methods aim to reduce the hallux valgus angle (HVA) in individuals with hallux valgus deformity, reduce pain and prevent the severity of the deformity from increasing. Different orthosis applications are used in the conservative treatment of hallux valgus deformity. In the literature, it is reported that finger spreader orthosis, dynamic orthosis, and night orthosis are effective in the treatment of mild and moderate hallux valgus deformities. The most commonly used finger separator orthoses and dynamic orthoses in clinics are orthoses with proven effectiveness in the treatment of hallux valgus deformity, but there is no study comparing the effectiveness of these orthoses. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of toe separation orthosis and dynamic orthosis on hallux valgus angle and plantar pressure. The individuals included in the study will be randomly divided into two groups: those using the finger separation orthosis and those using the dynamic orthosis. Foot pressure analysis after the participants use the toe separation orthosis and dynamic orthosis for 1 month will be evaluated. Pressure analysis evaluation will be performed 3 times; before using the orthosis, when first wearing the orthosis, and 1 month after using the orthosis. Individuals participating in the study must first sign the informed consent form. Individuals who agree to participate in the study will fill out the socio-demographic evaluation form. According to the Manchester Scale, the individual's hallux valgus deformity will be classified according to its severity. Hallux valgus angle measurement will be made with a goniometer. In order to understand the effect of deformity on individuals, the Foot Function Index Evaluation Form will be filled out by individuals. For the pain, function and alignment evaluation of individuals, the evaluation form prepared by the American Orthopedic Foot-Ankle Society (AOFAS) will be answered by individuals. The Manchester-Oxford foot questionnaire will be administered to assess standing, walking and quality of life. The orthoses to be used during the study will be randomly distributed to the individuals participating in the study. Plantar pressure analysis will be performed without orthosis, with orthosis and 1 month after the use of orthosis. At the end of the 1-month period during which individuals use the orthoses, patient orthosis satisfaction will be evaluated. Socio-Demographic evaluation will include physical evaluations such as individuals' name, surname, age, weight and body mass index. For social evaluation, individuals' education level, profession and job status will be asked. Questions that are important for the research are included in the socio-demographic evaluation. For this study, individuals will be asked about their shoe choice, average number of steps per day, average standing time per day, presence of hallux valgus, and presence of hallux valgus in the family. Additionally, the foot will be evaluated and the presence of pes planus will be examined.

343,"10 million children are born with orofacial clefts (OFC), which are characterized by incomplete fusion of the lip and/or palate. These children present with congenital malformations that may manifest as feeding difficulties, sleep apnea, middle ear disease, and speech disorders. The latter are a result of impaired function of the velopharyngeal mechanism (VPM). VPM dysfunction is defined as an abnormal pharyngeal constriction during speech production, causing hyper-nasality (HN). HN is more common in children who have had cleft palate repair, and may be due to either incomplete closure of the cleft, or structural and/or neurodynamic deficiencies occurring at the level of the VPM. Despite surgery, 40-70% of children with repaired OFC remain affected by HN long-term. Due to the fact that HN is not corrected by conventional surgical techniques, such as palatoplasty, speech pathologists provide speech therapy. However, there is no consensus on the most suitable treatment. This prospective study aims to evaluate the outcomes of non-surgical treatments, such as speech/language therapy, after cleft palate repair has taken place. The primary aim is to examine HN and voice in children undergoing speech therapy after cleft palate surgery compared to children having pharyngeal flap surgery in an attempt to optimize the outcomes of surgical correction of the VPM. This study will furthermore allow to investigate the role of patient-reported outcomes in the long term assessment of speech function in children with OFC and HN, by creating parent-reported measures. If successful, this study will lead to novel treatment strategies, which may potentially improve speech outcomes and reduce the need for surgical corrections in children with palatopharyngeal dysfunction and/or HN.

It also examined the mechanisms underlying the effects of probiotics on this disorder.METHODS: This is a three-armed, multi-center, randomized, double-blinded controlled trial with 102 subjects: adults male patients (18 to 55 years old) with a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder and normal eyesight would be recruited. Prior to hospitalization, those eligible patients will be randomized (1:1:1) into the lactobacillus intervention group, acceptance and commitment therapy intervention group and placebo intervention group who would then conduct their assigned intervention for 12 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in alcohol use disorder identification test score across four time points (t0 (baseline) = before starting intervention, t1 = 8 weeks after intervention began, t2 = 12 weeks after intervention began, and t3 = 24 weeks after intervention began). The secondary outcome was the change in clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol-Revised score, Penn Alcohol Craving Scale score, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score, electroencephalogram monitoring, tumor necrosis factor-α serum level, interleukin-1β serum level, and interleukin-6 serum level across four time points."

346,"This study aims to test a new neurobiological model of gambling addiction that has the potential to harmonise inconsistent imaging results in gambling addiction with those of other behaviors with reward and emotional components. This model makes the distinction between two different brain phenotypes, depending on whether the response to emotional stimuli is hyper- or hypo-reactive compared to the response to rewards. These two brain phenotypes can be observed in patients with impulsive (striatal hyper-activation) or emotional gambling addiction (striatal hypo-activation). These two types of gambling addiction should be related to different patterns of gambling behavior outside of the laboratory.

The study will first include a control group of non-gambling participants in their 20s. Following that, the clinical samples will be recruited. To do this, they will first complete cognitive tasks in fMRI (150€ for the first group, 100€ for the others) and a psychological questionnaire. They will then be followed over the course of a month (300€ for the first group, 200€ for the others) with in-clinic and EMA investigations.

The inclusion period for the control group will take place from January 1, 2023 to June 30, 2023. The inclusion period for the two clinical samples will take place from August 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024. It is expected that in total, 250 participants will be recruited for this project: 150 non-gamblers, 50 gamblers with impulsive gambling addiction, and 50 gamblers with emotional gambling addiction.

347,"The use of 3D imaging in laparoscopy improves the understanding of complex spatial relationships for the surgeon. The operating surgeon also sees the surgical site from different angles of the image. He is more aware of the surrounding structures and tissues. This knowledge enables him to work more precisely. The operating time as well as the number of intraoperative complications may decrease. For the above-mentioned reasons, this study is a randomized controlled trial in which a different imaging system is used for the same surgical intervention. Patients from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf who are to undergo gastric bypass surgery for obesity are informed about the trial and if they are willing to participate, they are randomized into two groups.

350,"Background: Chronic knee pain (CKP) in patients after total knee arthroplasty has been reported ranging from 22% to 94%. Inadequate pain management after surgery adversely affects patients recovery and may prolong patients’ length of hospital stay and increase cost of care. Moreover, pain is also associated with an increase in psychological distress. Exercise therapy is widely acknowledged to be beneficial among patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA). Exercises after total knee arthroplasty have also been shown to be helpful in enhancing functional recovery. While EIH is a well-known phenomenon after exercises, to the investigators’ knowledge, no studies have been conducted evaluating whether exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is present following exercise in patient after surgery. Furthermore, the effects of exercise intensity on this phenomenon have not been studied. Objectives: To investigate whether exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is present following exercise in patient after total knee arthroplasty and if so, if it changes with exercise intensity Methods: . A repeated measures and single-blinded randomized study were done. Thirty-eight patients 24 hours after TKA were randomly assigned to either low intensity exercises (LIE) group or high intensity exercises (HIE) group. An exercise programs lasted for five days during the hospitalization period. Pain severity was assessed by Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (0-10 mm). Pressure pain thresholds (PPTs) were measured over quadriceps and biceps brachii and muscles immediately before and after exercise."
351,"Breast cancer (BC) is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa, which includes Southwest Nigeria, has the least resources for diagnosis and treatment. However, there are many modifiable risk factors, and a significant proportion of breast cancer cases may be avoided through early detection and appropriate lifestyle modification. 
In Southwest Nigeria, first-degree female relatives of histologically diagnosed BC patients are at increased BC risk due to shared similar environmental and lifestyle factors. 
The investigators aimed to determine the effects of individualized breast cancer risk assessment and counselling on adherence to breast screening recommendations and lifestyle risk reduction practices among first-degree female relatives of breast cancer patients in Abia State and Anambra State, South-West Nigeria using a parallel-group randomized controlled trial.
The investigators hypothesized that an individualized breast cancer risk assessment and counselling would significantly improve the perception of BC risk among female relatives of BC patients, thereby increasing their adherence to breast cancer risk reduction recommendations.
The study was a nested case-control study design with data collection in two phases. During the first phase, enrollment, and identification of first-degree female relatives of histologically diagnosed breast cancer patients were done. In the second phase, baseline risk assessment was done followed by randomization to intervention or standard care control groups. Follow-up questionnaires were administered to the participants and analysis of the data collected was done using SPSS."
352,"1. Rationale and the significance of the study
The present pilot clinical research study is proposed to clarify the differential effect of genotypes of the drug metabolism gene (CYP2B6) on the stereoselective and pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition of multiple doses of the HIV protease inhibitor, efavirenz. Specific objectives of the research study to determine:
1. Effect of CYP2B6 genotype and multiple doses of efavirenz on the stereoselective disposition of methadone; and
2. Effect of CYP2B6 genotype and multiple doses of efavirenz on the stereoselective and pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition of tizanidine.


2. Specific aims
1. To quantify the effect of different CYP2B6 genotypes when efavirenz is administered on the stereoselective disposition of methadone in healthy volunteers
2. To quantify the effect of different CYP2B6 genotypes when efavirenz is administered on the stereoselective and pharmacokinetic (PK) disposition of tizanidine in healthy volunteers


3. Projected outcomes/objectives of study
This study hypothesizes that oral treatment with the HIV protease inhibitor, efavirenz, is associated with CYP2B6-dependent pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions on the metabolism of methadone and tizanidine. The present clinical trial will examine the effect of different CYP2B6 genotypes when efavirenz is administered on the stereoselective and PK disposition of methadone and tizanidine using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. The results of this clinical study will provide further insight into the complex roles of CYP2B6 genotype(s) on the stereoselective and plasma PK disposition of methadone and tizanidine. The outcome from this study will provide information that could serve as a foundation to formulate the dosage and drug administration regimens of methadone and tizanidine, and other drugs metabolized by CYP2B6, in patients suffering from HIV infection who may be affected by concurrent treatment with efavirenz.


4. Scientific background and significance
Pharmacogenetic (pharmacology+genetics) studies of human cytochrome P450 2B6 (CYP2B6) has identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high frequency in the general population. One of the most important and clinically relevant SNPs of the CYP2B6 gene is the substitution of arginine to cysteine at amino acid position 482 (Genbank accession number NM_00684.1) located in the substrate  binding domain of the CYP2B6. Based on population studies of different ethnic groups (i.e., white, black, Asian) subjects homozygous for arginine (NM) (*1/*1 genotype) have been associated with higher CYP2B6 enzymatic activity compared to those with other CYP2B6 genotypes (i.e., intermediately active subjects with one copy of the CYP2B6*482C allele (*1/*6 genotype or *1/*18 genotype) or subjects with reduced CYP2B6 enzymatic activity (*6/*6, *6/*18, or *18/*18 genotype)). It is now well documented that CYP2B6-mediated drug metabolism is responsible for the pharmacokinetic difference between the (+)- and (-)- enantiomers of the opioid medication methadone in humans in which the (+)-enantiomer is the active component with a 40-fold greater potency for analgesia compared to the (-)-enantiomer. In subjects with the NM genotype of CYP2B6, there is no difference in the metabolism of (+)- and (-)-methadone (i.e., equal elimination rates of both methadone enantiomers). However, in individuals with the IA genotype of CYP2B6, the elimination rate of the (+)-enantiomer is lower compared to the (-)-enantiomer that has a disproportionally faster elimination rate.

Previous clinical trial studies have shown that CYP2B6*6 carriers have up"

On the first appointment day, the removal of braces will be done according to the standard protocol with all safety measures taken. Then, 4 sets of impressions will be taken to construct the models and retainers. The participants will be issued with their regular upper and lower retainers, a new toothbrush and a retainer box. The investigator will have to check the group allocation with the consultant orthodontist. After the enrolment session, a set of newly constructed retainers will be measured. The patients will be issued their Hawley and vacuum-formed retainer separately. The patients will be instructed to store their retainers in a dry retainer box or in a glass of clean water. The patients will be advised on the correct cleaning and storage techniques. They will also be asked to draw lots from the sealed envelope from Group A or Group B. Group A will commence store their removable retainers in dry storage condition. After 3 months, the retainers will be returned and measured for comparisons with baseline retainer. A new set of retainers will be issued to the participants with new instruction to change the storage condition of their retainer. Group B will commence store their removable retainers in wet storage condition. After 3 months, the retainers will be returned and measured for comparisons with baseline retainer. A new set of retainers will be issued to the participants with new instruction to change the storage condition of their retainer. After 6 months, the final set of retainers will be measured for comparisons with Baseline retainer and the final set of data will be analysed.

359,"3-OHB is highly metabolized by the heart to acetoacetate, and AMPK-mediated activation of mitochondrial trifunctional protein (which is an end-product of both the FAO and 3-OHB oxidation pathways) and increased ROS production, likely contribute to the heart's preferential metabolic utilization of 3-OHB. AMPK upregulation in the cardiomyocytes during metabolic stress leads to higher rates of fatty acid oxidation and lower rates of glycolysis, ultimately resulting in increased production of L-lactate and H+ in cardiomyocytes. Given the unique properties of 3-OHB, we hypothesize that modulating circulating levels of 3-OHB may be able to modulate cardiac energetics and myocardial hemodynamics, potentially improving cardiac dysfunction. Thus, in this study we will explore the effects of modulating circulating levels of 3-OHB on cardiac function, cardiac energetics and hemodynamics."
360,"This will be a non-blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial. At our institution we perform over 300 breast reductions annually. This is a common procedure, particularly in adolescents. Despite the common use of narcotics following breast reduction surgery, we have noted that many patients are reluctant to take these medications, as they fear this will lead to substance abuse later in life. As such, we have instituted a protocol to minimize narcotic use, and improve pain scores. Our protocol, though effective, has not been rigorously tested- this research will help determine if this protocol should be more widely adopted.
This will be a single site, randomized, controlled clinical trial. We will recruit 35 patients to participate in this study. Patients undergoing bilateral breast reduction at the Connecticut Children's Hospital Center for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery between January 1st 2022 and December 31st 2025 will be invited to participate- they will be screened for eligibility based on our enrollment criteria. Consent will be obtained pre-operatively. Patients will be randomized into two arms. Upon completion of their breast reduction surgery, those in the study arm will receive 20ml of bupivacaine under the pectoralis muscle, and those in the control arm will receive 20ml of saline under the pectoralis muscle. These injections will be performed bilaterally by a plastic surgery staff member. All patients will meet with the plastic surgery physician assistant, or surgical nurse, in the post-anesthesia care unit. The patient will report their pain score and be given the prescribed prescription narcotic. They will then be discharged from the hospital. Patients will follow up in the office 1 week and 4 weeks after surgery. At their follow up visits, they will report on their home narcotic medication refill, and rate their pain on a scale of 1 to 10. Patients will receive the same number of home narcotic refills and the same amount of home narcotic refills regardless of group."
361,"Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer among women in the United States. It is estimated that over 200,000 new cases of breast cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2020. Proton therapy is a form of radiation therapy that is increasingly being used to treat breast cancer. Proton therapy has been shown to be an effective treatment for breast cancer, with a low rate of side effects. However, one common side effect of proton therapy is radiation dermatitis, a skin reaction that can cause redness, dryness, and itching in the area where the radiation is being delivered. Researchers at the Thompson Proton Center at Emory University are working to reduce the incidence of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients who undergo proton therapy. They are conducting a study to evaluate the effectiveness of a new technique called Spot Delete in reducing the severity of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients. In this study, researchers will gather data on skin reactions in patients who undergo proton therapy with Spot Delete and compare that data to data from patients who undergo regular proton therapy without Spot Delete. The goal of this study is to determine whether Spot Delete can be an effective tool in reducing the incidence of radiation dermatitis in breast cancer patients who undergo proton therapy.

362,"Study Rationale： 
In vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) is the most frequently method of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in China and the live birth rate of fresh one-month cycle was 40% by 2015, it seems that the ART method has been highly standardized, however, there is still considerable debate about the dose and efficacy of Cetrorelix Acetate (Cet)  used during ovarian stimulation. Ovarian Stimulation (OS) is an important component of ART. OS is the process of the development of multiple oocytes for subsequent retrieval, fertilization, and embryo transfer, which involves the use of drugs that stimulate the ovaries to produce multiple oocytes. The OS method refers to the drug used and its dosage. The classic OS method used GnRH analogs, which suppress the secretion of endogenous hormones such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). The short-term and long-term effects of FSH are controlled by the body's negative feedback mechanism after receiving GnRH analogs to stimulate ovarian follicles to mature. As early as 12 years ago, the Ovulation Induction (OI) Special Interest Group suggested that the application of GnRH antagonists (e.g. cetrotide) is more effective and safer than traditional GnRH agonists (e.g. Triptorelin) for IVF-ICSI cycle. At present, the most commonly used OS method in the world for IVF is the GnRH antagonist protocol. The clinical effect of GnRH antagonists is better than that of GnRH agonists, but because of the high cost of GnRH antagonists and the long-term clinical observation that the development of resistance may affect the final outcome, alternative methods that are more beneficial to economic costs, patients, and physicians are still actively explored and improved. Therefore, we hope to combine the advantages of different OS methods to control the cost of drugs and maximize the clinical effect and safety of drugs.

365,"Background
-----------------
Atrial fibrilLation is the most common arrhythmia. Stroke and other embolisms are its most serious complications.
The worldwide number of people with AF will increase significantly over the next few decades. Cerebral embolism is the main cause of stroke in this setting.
Catheter ablation of AF is the current treatment of this arrhythmia in symptomatic patients.
Catheter ablation consists of the elimination of specific electrical circuits located inside the heart through the ablation of cardiac tissue.
This cardiac tissue damage can generate embolisms during or soon after the procedure. Other complications that can occur during catheter ablation are bleeding and damage of the blood vessel.
The clinical presentation of these complications is a neurological deficit (a type of paralysis or decreased sensitivity) or a decrease in blood volume or blood pressure. Its cause can be a cerebral embolism, a cerebral hemorrhage or decreased intravascular volume.
In patients with cerebral embolism, brain image techniques such as CT or MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) will show the cerebral infarction (an area of necrosis or tissue death) that causes symptoms. Cerebral embolism is the first cause of strokes and other vascular events in patients who undergo a catheter ablation of AF. 


Objectives and rationale of the study
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to assess in an international registry the clinical presentation, treatment and outcome of acute neurological and non-neurological symptoms associated with cerebral or arterial embolism after catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation.


Objective
-----------------
To study the acute clinical profile of stroke/TIA associated to CABAF (or technically akin procedures such as left atrial macroreentry mapping and ablation). The primary objective is to analyze the acute clinical profile of stroke/TIA associated to CABAF (or technically akin procedures such as left atrial macroreentry mapping and ablation).

For cognitive decline and other late effects of ADT, a simple, non-invasive blood test is more convenient and practical than MR imaging of the brain in men with prostate cancer. 5) ADT will lower testosterone and increase Aβ42 and may lead to increased Aβ42/40 which will be correlated with cognitive decline.

The hypothesis is that the children who will be exposed to rosemary or lemongrass oil will experience less anxiety; the primary outcome measures are: pulse rate; oxygen saturation; blood pressure and the secondary outcome measure is the pain level immediately after the dental extraction."

382,"This study assesses how users of fitness and lifestyle software benefit from understanding their own genetic predispositions alongside non-genetic information about their lifestyles. The investigators are using a commercial platform to deliver personalized recommendations to a cohort of health care staff. Through the use of this platform the investigators will be able to make personalized recommendations to the participants based on their own genetic analysis and self-reported lifestyle data. The study does not constitute a randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participants can choose whether they receive information on their genetic predispositions or not and they will have access to their results at any time and as many times as they wish, before or after completing a digital questionnaire on their well-being. The participant will have control over how much genetic and non-genetic information is gathered and how this information is presented to them and their treatment team (or other relevant party). In addition to the participant having choice over their treatment and the treatment team having choice over whether to view the genetic results, the investigators will allow the participant to opt-out of the study at any time without any penalty. The data is stored in a secure portal that is only accessible to authorised members of both the research team and the participant. Genetic data is not linked to any other health identifiers; only encrypted email addresses, date of birth and saliva sample data are linked to the individual data."

384,"We will perform a prospective case-control study assessing the feasibility and the outcome of a new imaging-guided operative procedure for anterior knee pain in patients who have undergone total hip replacement. The specificity of this procedure is the absence of radiological or ultrasound imaging of the hip being operated because it is only the painful structure, namely the iliopsoas tendon, that is reached. If the feasibility and efficacy of this technique proves to be satisfactory, it could be applied to patients who have undergone hip replacement on the ipsilateral side. 
The purpose of the present study is to assess the feasibility and possible benefit of the surgical intervention for anterior knee pain following THA. 
Differences in the rate of revision for hip pain are expected between the intervention group and the control group. Moreover, we also expect a decrease in anterior knee pain. 
If the feasibility and efficacy of this technique proves to be satisfactory, it could be applied to patients who have undergone hip replacement on the ipsilateral side. This would allow for better patient selection for THA on both sides. 
The primary objective is to evaluate the feasibility and possible benefit of the surgical intervention for anterior knee pain following the THA."

387,"1. Background and purpose
A subset of patients with non-squamous metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harbor EGFR-TKI-sensitizing mutations with an initial response, followed by progression. It is hypothesized that the majority of the population of such patients has tumors with acquired resistance mechanisms to osimertinib, and would therefore benefit from treatments containing other cellular targets in addition to inhibition of EGFR. The objective of MARVEL is to determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of osimertinib, cetuximab, and tucatinib in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC who have acquired resistance to osimertinib and to determine the efficacy of the combination of osimertinib, cetuximab and tucatinib in patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC following resistance to first-line therapy with osimertinib.
2. Detailed Description
Phase I cohorts: Participants with an acquired resistance to osimertinib will be enrolled in dose-escalating studies. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used. Participants receiving cetuximab and tucatinib will be monitored closely for both safety and anti-tumor activity from the first dose.
Each dose cohort will include 3-6 participants. The 3+3 design will only allow the next dose level to be explored if 0 out of 6 or 1 out of 6 participants experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Based on the first 6 participants, in the event that the first DLT is experienced in cycle 1, the next cohort will be recruited at the same dose level. In the event that two (out of six) participants experience a DLT in cycle 1, the MTD will have been identified. Once the MTD is identified in a cohort of participants enrolled using the dose escalation cohort, participants may continue until progression per immune related RECIST (irRECIST/immRECIST) criteria, disease progression on osimertinib as first line therapy in the case of dose expansion, or unacceptable toxicity.
Dose expansion cohorts: Participants with an acquired resistance to osimertinib will also be enrolled in dose expansion studies at the MTD identified in the dose escalation cohorts. A standard 3+3 dose escalation design will be used. The phase I portion of the study will begin by evaluating the safety and tolerability of the combination of osimertinib, cetuximab, and tucatinib in this population. Participants receiving cetuximab and tucatinib will be monitored closely for both safety and anti-tumor activity from the first dose. Participants will continue to receive the study therapies until progression (per RECIST), disease progression on osimertinib as first line therapy (in the case of dose expansion), or unacceptable toxicity.
Phase I outcomes for dose escalation and expansion cohorts:
Primary Efficacy Endpoint:
• Progression free survival (PFS), defined as time from start of study therapy to first documented progression, disease unconfirmed progression, as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death due to any cause. Imaging will be performed every cycle (8 weeks) for dose escalation participants and before starting treatment for dose expansion participants.
Primary Safety Endpoint:
• The occurrence of a dose-limiting toxicity defined as any treatment-related toxicity at the dosing level, lasting at least seven (7) days, with a CTCAE v5.0 grade >=2, meeting the definition of a DLT, which is listed below.

Secondary Efficacy and Safety Endpoints:
• Maximum Plasma Concentration (Cmax) and Area Under Curve - Time (AUC-T) from Time = 0 to Last Measurable or Quantifiable Concentration (AUClast) for tucatinib and osimertinib.
• Objective Response Rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 criteria. Imaging will be performed every cycle (8 weeks) for dose escalation participants and before starting treatment for dose expansion participants.
• Time to Objective Response per RECIST 1.1 criteria.
• Duration of Response per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 criteria.
• Disease Control Rate (DCR) per RECIST v1.1 criteria.

389,"French summary: 

The monochorionic pregnancies and twin pregnancies are characterized by sFGR in monochorionic twins may be complicated by selective (s) fetal growth restriction (sFGR). Although sFGR twin pregnancies are generally more complicated, the associated risks remain significant (higher risk of fetal single or double demise, associated developmental disabilities, maternal morbidity), and adequate therapeutic management is poorly understood. 

The investigators have chosen to focus on sFGR pregnancy due to its unique characteristics and its direct impact on the prognosis of both children and parents: the survival rate for an affected twin is less than 50%, and the rate of postnatal complications exceed 60%. There is a substantial risk of fetal deterioration resulting in (iatrogenic) preterm birth, or even intrauterine demise of one, or both fetuses. sFGR is associated with a decrease in quality of life after birth, and maternal morbidity. 

Within the European Fetal Growth Restriction Trial, the investigators found that a sFGR pregnancy was associated with: longer stay in the hospital before birth, higher rate of preterm birth (<34 weeks of pregnancy), decreased gestational age at birth, more fetal complications, lower birth weights and more need for neonatal support. Moreover, the incidence of major long term neurodevelopmental impairments in the child was higher in a twin with sFGR, which led to higher rate of postnatal complications, disability, and lower intellectual performance compared to a singleton with sFGR and compared to a twin with appropriate fetal growth (AFGR). Surprisingly, the investigators even found that the mother of a twin with sFGR reported a lower quality of life compared to the mothers of a twin with AFGR and compared to a mother of a singleton with sFGR. 

Within the European Fetal Growth Restriction Trial no significant differences between the treatment options studied (delayed vs early delivery) were found. To the exception of some important and already described long-term sequelae (neurological disabilities, abnormal neurobehavioral profiles, lower IQ) in children born with sFGR, little is known about the medium and long term consequences experienced by both children and parents after the birth. In addition, there is still a lack of knowledge about the underlying biological mechanisms, the evolution of sFGR during the entire pregnancy, and the prediction for fetal deterioration or the risk of single/double demise. 

The multidisciplinary team of the investigators believe that this research project will result in important additional insights that will improve obstetric follow-up, diagnostic management and prediction of fetal deterioration for both children and parents. In addition, the investigators believe that this will help to improve the quality of life of and psychological support for the parents. 

The investigators specifically aim to: 

Investigate the possible use of some ultrasound parameters identified in previous studies (e.g. Doppler indices, the size of the umbilical artery's vessel wall, vascular resistance and compliance) in combination with placental ultrasound as a possible predictor of a worse fetal prognosis. 

Investigate the role of the histopathology of the placenta in sFGR pregnancies; these aspects are rarely taken into account within scientific publications. 

Evaluate the feasibility and reliability of a questionnaire to investigate parental mental health and parent-to-infant(s) attachment. These aspects are essential in the future follow-up of children born with sFGR. 

A better understanding of the maternal and fetal prognosis, the evolution of this pathology and the possible outcome (single/double demise, associated sequelae), and an understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of this complex disease will improve the current diagnostic classification systems. This will hopefully reduce the chance of single or double demise.

391,"There continues to be a high prevalence of cannabis and alcohol use disorders (AUD and CUD). Despite available treatments, few individuals seek or are successfully treated for these disorders. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an evidence-based treatment for AUD and CUD but it typically focuses on high-level and general change and requires strong motivation and a great deal of effort on the part of patients. Additionally, AUD and CUD treatment studies have not considered or measured individual differences in the way that CBT, or other psychosocial interventions, work for individuals within the population.

Previous research has shown that the mechanisms of change in response to CBT are diverse and that individuals benefit to varying degrees at rates that cannot be accurately predicted from demographics, psychopathology, severity of substance use or other factors that are included in conventional clinical assessments. This study will use the ANCA toolbox to examine individual differences in CBT and identify biological (e.g. DNA) and clinical (e.g. substance use disorder diagnosis and co-occurring psychiatric disorders) mechanisms that will help tailor CBT treatment to the needs of individual patients, improve health outcomes, and ultimately reduce rates of alcohol- and cannabis-related morbidity and mortality. The ANCA toolbox includes the following innovative and comprehensive approaches: 

1. The AUD and CUD groups will receive a brief, in-person baseline neuroclinical assessment, which will consist of brain imaging, task-based neuroimaging, performance-based neuropsychological assessments, a DNA collection to assess the role of genetic/neurobiological variation in CUD and AUD treatment response, and a comprehensive clinical diagnostic assessment to measure co-occurring psychiatric disorders, trauma, and health-related characteristics (e.g. diet, sleep, physical activity). The baseline assessment will take up to 3 hours to complete. All AUD and CUD participants will undergo a cognitive (memory, information processing, executive functions, and attention) and personality (impulsivity, compulsivity, mood instability) screener followed by an interview about their alcohol and cannabis histories, medical and psychiatric histories, and substance use disorders (e.g. alcohol and cannabis diagnoses) over the past 30 days. Additionally, participants in the AUD group will complete the Minnesota Binge Drinking Scale and the AUD/CUD Motivation to Change Questionnaire to provide self-reports about their current patterns of alcohol use or cannabis use and their personal reasons for change. Next, participants will complete the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Cannabis Use Disorders Identification Test (CUDIT) to determine whether they meet criteria for AUD or CUD, respectively. After completing the clinical assessment, AUD and CUD patients will then undergo the neuroimaging and neurocognitive assessment procedures.

2. AUD and CUD participants meeting the inclusion criteria for either the AUD or CUD groups will be enrolled and eligible to be referred to and treated using the AUD Integrated Care Pathway (AUD-ICP) or the CUD Integrated Care Pathway (CUD-ICP).

All AUD and CUD patients will receive 1) up to 12 weeks of group psychotherapy for AUD or CUD delivered at University Health Network's Toronto General Hospital (AUD groups) or Centre for Addiction and Mental Health's Queen Street site (CUD groups), respectively, and 2) an individual CBT session led by a doctoral-level clinical psychologist on an outpatient basis to improve patient retention, safety, and adherence to medication. The goal of CBP for AUD is to reduce weekly binge drinking frequency and frequency of alcohol intoxication. Both CBT for AUD and motivational enhancement therapy (MET) for CUD will use a similar general therapeutic format and will be conducted over the course of approximately 12 weeks. Both groups will complete weekly symptom monitoring assessments and attend weekly or bi-weekly group therapy sessions. Treatment-related factors such as retention, adherence, and completion (i.e., all elements discussed below) will be monitored and assessed as secondary outcomes of this study. Participants randomized to the AUD group will also have the option to receive evidence-based pharmacotherapy for AUD (e.g. acamprosate, naltrexone, disulfiram or topiramate according to a pharmacotherapy algorithm) given to them by their psychiatrist during psychotherapy sessions and an individual CBT session led by a doctoral-level clinical psychologist on an outpatient basis to improve patient retention"
392,"Aim of this study is understand if the content of the videos actually causes an impact on the expectations of the patients. The study will be double-blind. Two weeks later, they will be randomly assigned into three groups and will watch a short video about SMT (5 minutes) with three different stories: 1- A positive message about the effectiveness of SMT, 2- A neutral message about the effectiveness of SMT, and 3- A negatiev message about the effectiveness of SMT. Then, a physiotherapist will administrate one session of SMT and participants will be re-assessed to investigate the immediate effect of the videos on the pain intensity and global perceived improvement. Then, the participants will be submitted to a semi-structured interview in which their perceptions about the videos will be investigated. Thus, at the end of this study, we believe that is possible to enhance the SMT effect by using positive expectation speech."

Brief Summary
-----------------
Reward is an important motivator that stimulates behavior and guides choices. A dysfunctional reward circuitry is involved in many mental health disorders. Current research suggests that neuromodulatory therapies, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), represent a promising strategy for directly targeting and modulating neural circuitry pathologies implicated in a wide range of psychiatric and neurological disorders. DBS has been successfully used recently for neuropsychiatric treatment, however, a critical challenge is determining the optimal stimulation parameters necessary for a therapeutic effect. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is a new non-invasive method for stimulation of deep brain structures. This novel technology has the potential to provide neuromodulatory effects that may translate into therapeutic benefits. The goal of our research is to evaluate the feasibility and safety of using a novel transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) device combined with an MRI scan to stimulate the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a region that is critical for reward processing, in healthy individuals. The secondary aim of this research study is to investigate whether tFUS can modulate the functional connectivity among the NAc and regions such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and sensory regions, both before and after tFUS stimulation. The research data from this study will provide proof of concept for the future translation of tFUS technology into novel treatment interventions for a variety of psychiatric disorders.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) is an emerging, non-invasive technology for stimulating the brain. tFUS uses ultrasound to target deep brain regions and represents a promising approach to directly modulate neural circuitry activity in both healthy individuals and patients with neurological and psychiatric disorders. Unlike traditional brain stimulation techniques that rely on electrodes on the scalp, tFUS has the advantage of providing access to deep brain structures without requiring surgical intervention. Research shows that the NAc is an important region for the development of reward-related behaviors; dysfunctional NAc functioning has been implicated in a variety of mental health disorders, including Parkinson's Disease, major depressive disorder, addiction, and autism spectrum disorder. Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) shows promise as a novel way to target this region without invasive surgery. By increasing our understanding of the effects of tFUS on the NAc and its functional connectivity network, this study will improve our ability to treat mental health disorders that involve reward-related dysfunction. tFUS stimulation will be administered via ultrasound waves delivered to the deep brain using MRI-guided, transcranial, ultrasound. In this work, we aim to develop a novel transcranial focused ultrasound device that is optimized for the delivery of deep brain stimulation for the clinical treatment of psychiatric and neurological disorders. The proposed tFUS device combines an advanced MRI-guided targeting system with a novel waveform generator that can control and precisely modulate the ultrasound stimulation parameters. The investigators hypothesize that this novel tFUS device will be effective in modulating the functional connectivity between the NAc and key brain regions involved in reward processing, as well as being safe and tolerable for use in healthy individuals. By demonstrating the feasibility and safety of this novel tFUS device, the investigators can pave the way for future clinical trials that can evaluate the efficacy of tFUS for treating psychiatric and neurological disorders with reward-related dysfunction such as depression, addiction, and autism spectrum disorder.

395,"The purpose of this study is to clarify whether upper gastrointestinal (GI) diseases could guide people younger than 50 years who are not recommended for colonoscopy to undergo colonoscopy examination. Analyzed the prevalence of upper gastrointestinal diseases in the same cohort of outpatients with age ≥ 20 years who underwent gastroscopy and colonoscopy examination at the same time.

398,"Pain arises as a consequence of the activation of nociceptive afferents (small fibers) by an external stimulus with sufficient intensity to potentially cause tissue damage. The resulting brain response (EP) provides useful information to objectify and quantify the functional state of nociceptive system. Several studies have established the use of EPs for pain evaluation in humans and other species, using different modality of stimulus. Electroencephalography (EEG) is useful to capture the responses that reach the brain with enough amplitude to capture them. However, these responses differ in their amplitude and/or latency, even in normal conditions, in which the amplitude and/or latency of a response evoked by a sensory stimulus depends on the location within the central nervous system (CNS). 
Importantly, at present, there is no method that allows us to directly know the degree of activation of the CNS, but this has important implications in the field of medicine (diagnosis, prognosis, therapy, etc.). The objective is to evaluate the ability (sensitivity and specificity) of EEG to discriminate EP signals detected in normal conditions, according to the nature of the stimulus applied."
399,"This study will apply advanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) methods to image the skull and brain to investigate a previously undescribed phenomenon: the deformation of the brain within the skull following a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) that causes acute traumatic meningeal enhancement (TME) in a subset of patients. TME is a radiographic abnormality that occurs within 7 days after a TBI and causes a meningeal response where the meninges become inflamed and cause an enhancement of the brain within the skull when seen on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs). TME, as measured by a 5-point scale, has been shown to be clinically correlated with worse long-term outcomes. For example, a study by the Defense and Veterans Brain Injury Center found that those with a TME within 1 year of their TBI were about 9% more likely to develop Post-Concussion Syndrome compared to those without a TME. Because MRE is able to apply controlled and reproducible motions to the brain and measure the resulting deformation of the brain and skull, it may be possible to use MRE to better understand the mechanisms underlying TME and, specifically, the role of the skull-brain interface in the injury and healing of TBI. This is important because understanding this mechanism would enable the development of therapies that could reduce the long-term effects of TBI.

Additionally, this study will enable researchers to image TME and the biomechanical changes in the brain that occur as a result of TBI. Currently, researchers only have a limited understanding of how the skull-brain interface influences the healing process of TBI. As such, this study will provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying TME and the long-term effects of TBI. This study will help address an important public health problem and could lead to the development of new and improved therapies for TBI.

Background
-----------------
There is a gap in understanding the mechanisms underlying traumatic meningeal enhancement (TME). Specifically, it is still unknown how the biomechanical coupling of the brain to the skull contributes to this phenomenon. Imaging Characterization of the Biomechanical Coupling of Brain and Skull: An Observational Study (ICB-BSK) will help to fill this gap by using magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) to image the brain and skull in order to characterize the biomechanical coupling of the brain to the skull in human volunteers with and without a history of acute TME. MRE is a type of MRI that uses the magnetic properties of the brain to measure the relative motion of the brain within the skull, providing important insight into the biomechanical coupling of the brain to the skull. Researchers will use MRE to determine whether local shear strain measures within the cortex during MRE are altered in individuals with a history of acute TME. Study findings will enable researchers to better understand the mechanisms underlying acute TME and will help to guide the development of future studies and therapies related to TME.

401,"The investigators hypothesis is that the moderate alcohol consumption is associated with a beneficial effect on cardiac function, as measured by the primary outcome measure, LVEF at 12 months. If confirmed by the study, the results will have significant clinical implications and increase the number of patients with a recent MI that benefit from moderate alcohol consumption.
Background, Aims of Study
-----------------
Moderate alcohol consumption has been linked with favourable cardiometabolic risk factor profile. Meta-analysis indicates that moderate consumption of alcohol is associated with less adverse cardiovascular outcomes with similar risk of mortality. Epidemiological, observational data also suggests the relationship between alcohol consumption and survival of patients with recent myocardial infarction is dependent on the pattern of alcohol consumption. A moderate-sized (4-28 units/week) alcohol consumption appears to have a beneficial effect on long-term survival, while both abstinence and heavy drinking are associated with adverse outcomes. Patients with a STEMI who report a positive alcohol consumption (1-14 units/week) have been found to have a reduced one-year risk for re-hospitalization. Despite epidemiological and clinical data supporting the use of alcohol in a low-risk cohort, most national societies do not recommend alcohol as a therapeutic option and there seems to be limited awareness that the alcohol-related cardiovascular benefit may outweigh the potential harm in this specific, high-risk population. Consequently, few large-scale randomised trials have been done. In addition, it is not known if moderate alcohol consumption is of any value in the low-risk population of patients with NSTEMI. Furthermore, a potential beneficial effect on cardiac function and reverse cardiac remodeling in patients with recent MI and moderate alcohol consumption has not been addressed. The beneficial effect might be linked to increased cardiac contractility and improved survival in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) or decreased ejection fraction (HFmrEF), despite the fact that moderate alcohol consumption does not appear to be associated with a significant reduction in the primary endpoint of mortality and hospitalisation for cardiovascular events in this cohort population. 

Study setting
-----------------
Patients will be recruited at six Swedish academic hospitals. The participants will undergo a screening visit, followed by a run-in period of 2 weeks (no alcohol consumption). After a successful run-in period, participants will be randomised into two parallel groups on a 1:1 basis, strata-ted by baseline ejection fraction (<50% vs. ≥50%), sex, and study site. A total of 220 patients will be included, 110 assigned to moderate alcohol consumption, and 110 assigned to abstinence. A total of 84 patients with STEMI (n=44/group) and 84 patients with NSTEMI (n=44/group) will be included. Outcome measures will be assessed at baseline (randomisation) and after 12 months. At 12 months' follow-up, patients in the moderate alcohol consumption will have consumed an average number of 209 standard units over the study period, whereas patients in the abstinence group will have consumed no alcohol for the last 400 days. 

Primary outcome of the study
-----------------
All-cause LV ejection fraction measured by cardiac ultrasound at 12 months, i.e. one year after randomisation and with one year of study participation. Assumption is an estimated reduction in the primary endpoint in the moderate alcohol consumption group vs. abstinence group of 0.1 (LVEF ≥50% subgroup) to 0.4 (LVEF <50% subgroup; HFmrEF). The sample size was calculated on the basis of the lower estimate of the primary endpoint in the subgroups, for example 0.1. The expected sample size (110 participants with LVEF ≥50%, and 110 participants with LVEF <50%), based on an assumed 80% power (one-sided), and an estimated level of significance at a 5% level (i.e. p<0.05). 

All-cause LV ejection fraction will be measured in all participants through cardiac ultrasound at randomisation (baseline) and 12-month clinical follow-up. The assessment will be blinded to the treating clinician.

402,"Background and rationale for the study: 
The colonoscopy is the most important way to diagnose bowel mucosal pathology, to evaluate the development of colonic polyps, and to provide treatment for colorectal cancer and colitis. Therefore, it is essential and widely used for patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), who are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. Currently, the polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution has become a routine choice for bowel preparation in hospital, however, a significant proportion of colonoscopy patients suffer from inadequate bowel preparation. Moreover, the PEG products are unpalatable and lead to patients' dissatisfaction, the associated symptoms may lead to low compliance and adverse effects. Recently, lactulose is a widely applied bowel preparation solution for colonoscopy. 
The objective of this study is to perform a randomized controlled trial to compare the lactulose solution with the PEG solution (Laxovid) for bowel preparation in patients with IBD in terms of adverse events, preparation quality, and acceptability in a colonoscopy quality-improvement intervention. 
We hypothesise that the lactulose solution is as effective and well tolerated as the PEG solution for bowel preparation in patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing colonoscopy.

403,"The aim of this study is to explore the effects of aromatherapy based on a randomized controlled trial for people at risk of metabolic syndrome in community bases on people's sleep quality and quality of life. The purpose of this study is to understand the sleep status and quality of life of the older adults at risk of metabolic syndrome in the community and the potential contributing factors, and to explore the effect of aromatherapy on improving the sleep quality and quality of life of the older adults at risk of metabolic syndrome in the community. The experimental group will get the aromatherapy, using lavender essential oil compound ,while the control group will get the placebo aromatherapy, using sweet almond oil. After the intervention, the participants' sleep quality and quality of life indexes will be compared. The quality of life and sleep quality will be measured as the main research index. By using this method, we want to find out whether the aromatherapy can affect the sleep quality and quality of life of community residences in the community."
404,"1. The null hypothesis: soft tissue augmentation with collagen matrix and connective tissue graft in case of severe soft-tissue atrophy around dental implants leads to a decrease in the level of surgical pain during the postoperative period, improves the quality of life and leads to a similar level of soft tissue thickness gain in comparison with each other, however, an important difference is expected in terms of cost of the procedure, as well as aesthetics and efficiency of work at different stages of clinical evaluation. 2. The full hypothesis, as a result of the null hypothesis rejection, will indicate additional advantages of using xenogenic collagen matrices during soft-tissue augmentation when compared with free CTG: decrease in the level of postoperative pain, improvement in the quality of life, higher esthetic value of surgical fields, increase in the efficiency of treatment. Methods: 1. Participants will be recruited by advertising on the I.Pavlov First Moscow State Medical University website, social networks, word of mouth. Candidates who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to the study, where informed consent will be provided and an explanation of the study protocol will be provided. 2. Screening of the initial sample (100 patients) is carried out, eliminating those who are not suitable for randomization into groups. After that, the selection of patients will be carried out, who will be allocated by the randomization method in two parallel groups. 3. The final sample for randomization into groups will consist of 50 patients, of which: the 1st group will receive 0.01-0.02 g of free CTG per 1 mm per linear segment; the 2nd group will receive a collagen matrix of xenogenic origin Fibro-Gide (CM-101) for the manufacture of a 1 mm thick sterile sheet. 4. An exit sample of patients after randomization into groups will consist of 14 patients (2 patients in the 1st group, 2 patients in the 2nd group) who showed signs of complications in the postoperative period and were excluded from the study. 5. Follow-up examination will be carried out on the 90th day (70% of patients) and the 180th day (30% of patients). It is expected that 98 patients will remain in groups for the entire period of clinical observations by the end of the study. 6. To assess the severity of pain, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was used, for which on a 100 mm long line from 0 to 10 mm is marked with a vertical line to indicate the intensity of pain during the postoperative period, while 0 corresponds to the absence of pain or pain at the weakest intensity, and 10 corresponds to unbearable pain. According to the methodology for assessing the severity of pain recommended by the Russian Ministry of Public Health, marking by VAS is indicated in millimeters (mm) and is accompanied by a 0-400 international pain scoring scale with a corresponding definition and abbreviation: 0 - no pain, 1-2 - mild pain, 3-4 - moderate pain, 5-6 - moderately severe pain, 7-8 - severe pain, 9-10 - unbearable pain. 7. To assess the severity of postoperative edema, the method of manual palpation of the area affected by edema is used (linear measurements), a linear ruler is used as a measuring instrument, the measurement is performed at 90 ° of the line of the edematous area, in millimeters (mm). In addition, there are other methods for measuring the severity of edema by the number of days of the observed state, a three-point scale is used, whereby, in the absence of edema, 0 points are recorded, in moderate edema - 1 point, in pronounced edema - 2 points. 8. The patient's quality of life was assessed using the Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) questionnaire. The questionnaire consists of 14 questions that provide patient's self-reported measure of dysfunction, discomfort and disability arising from oral conditions. Each question is scored on a 5-point scale: 0 = never; 1 = hardly ever; 2 = occasionally; 3 = fairly often; 4 = very often/every day. The OHIP-14 total score can range from 0 to 56. Higher OHIP-14 scores indicate worse quality of life and lower scores indicate better quality of life."

406,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a significant burden of disease worldwide. Despite effective treatment options being readily available, not all patients fully remit after treatment. While personalized or ""precision"" medicine aims to tailor health care to the individual, this approach has not, thus far, been explored in the treatment of MDD. For other mental health disorders, we have known for some time that people differ with respect to how they respond to treatment. For patients with depression the current gold standard involves the use of clinical trials, often involving large numbers of patients and multiple treatment modalities. These trials usually involve an empirical approach in which several variables related to treatment response are evaluated and variables that predict treatment response are retained in the model using a stepwise approach. However, this approach can be time consuming, the results may be biased, and the treatment options and instruments may be limited to those used in previous studies. Recently, machine learning techniques have been used to generate data-driven prediction models. However, in the absence of data on the outcome of any intervention in any particular patient, it is difficult to assess what treatment would actually be beneficial for a new patient with a given set of characteristics. The Investigators have developed a new method called the Precision Treatment Rule (PTR), which identifies patients likely to have superior response to a given treatment based on a priori knowledge of treatment response (i.e., historical data) as well as other covariates that are available at baseline. The purpose of the OptimizeD study is two-fold: to evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via the use of a PTR in predicting differential response to either treatment among primary care patients with moderate to severe depression, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of optimization (i.e., treatment allocation by PTR vs. non-allocation) in terms of remission, quality of life, and other treatment outcome measures."
407,"Pulmonary ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) is frequently complicated by secondary bacterial and fungal infections. The microbiome (all viruses, bacteria, archaea, fungi, and eukaryotic microbes in a particular environment) seems to play a role. When a healthy lung is damaged, this leads to the inability of oxygen to enter the bloodstream, and severe cases require mechanical ventilation, which is associated with an increased risk of complications, especially in critically ill patients with COVID-19. However, it remains to be shown how the microbiome affects the development and outcomes of ARDS. This study aims to investigate the possible involvement of specific pathogens in ARDS.

Allocation: Non-Randomized
Intervention Model: Parallel Assignment
Interventional Model Description: In total, 4 different groups of participants will be included in this study. This results in 4 parallel assessment groups: i) patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD); ii) patients with a strong familial component to dementia (FDC); iii) non-demented cognitively healthy volunteers (CHV; non-AD); and iv) patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). The primary aim of this study is to develop a diagnostic biomarker panel of AD in patients with a diagnosis of AD. In this panel we will include proteins that are associated with AD based on data of the literature and AD-associated phenotyping data of the patients of this study (diagnostic biomarkers). Second, this patient group will be used to verify the biomarker panel on an independent cohort (validation). Third, we will develop a diagnostic"
412,"1. The study is to use an AI model established for the diagnosis of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma based on deep learning to assist in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal endoscopists and doctors. It is hoped that the auxiliary value of AI can be verified through the actual application of the diagnosis and treatment team and the actual improvement in the quality of work; 2. Deep learning technology is to use large amounts of endoscopic images as the research sample database for feature extraction, and the feature parameters of the sample data are obtained through algorithm learning. The sample database is divided into three parts: training set (70%), test set (20%), and verification set (10%), which are used for data training, algorithm testing, and evaluation in order; 3. At present, there are no standard diagnostic criteria for esophageal and gastric junction adenocarcinoma based on endoscopic images. In order to provide an annotation basis for AI model training, the researchers will consult the experts of the department to determine the diagnostic criteria of malignant and benign lesions based on morphological and color changes of the lesion. (e.g., color, shape and size, etc.) will give priority to The researchers also use the expert consensus on the diagnosis and treatment of early gastric cancer and endoscopic morphology, chromatin, vascular morphology, pits, etc. as a reference to provide diagnostic references in order to reduce the subjectivity of human judgment as much as possible when designing diagnostic criteria; 4. In this study, the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction requires the endoscopists to diagnose by using the traditional diagnostic criteria of endoscopic pathology and submitting it to the pathologist. If it is difficult to make a clear diagnosis, a standardized pathological evaluation of the lesion will be conducted to formulate a preliminary diagnosis. When an endoscopist is unsure, a senior expert of our department will be called to determine the classification and sub-classification of the lesion; 5. A total of 4062 cases of esophageal and gastric junction lesions were screened from the endoscopy database of the endoscopy department, and 2590 cases of cancer and chronic gastritis were excluded, and finally 1472 cases were included in the study. In the training dataset, 359 cases were used for algorithm training and development of the AI model, including 153 cases of gastric junction adenocarcinoma and 206 cases of benign lesions. The test dataset included 549 cases of gastric junction adenocarcinoma (including 47 cases of esophagogastric junction tumors) and 299 cases of benign lesions (including 41 cases of esophagogastric junction tumors). The verification dataset included 362 cases of gastric junction adenocarcinoma and 214 cases of benign lesions. As the research progresses, it is possible to expand the sample database. Among them, benign lesions such as esophagitis, chronic gastritis, erosion, gastric and duodenal ulcers and benign tumors may be added to the database based on current evidence. At the same time, if there are new confirmed cases of gastric junction adenocarcinoma or new findings discovered in the endoscopic examination, they will be added to the database at the same time . 6. A total of 13 endoscopists (seven experts with operating experience>5000 cases and six experts with operating experience>1000 cases) joined in this study and participated in an AI model training session. Before the training session, the researchers asked each participating endoscopist to complete the endoscopic examination of the lesions diagnosed as adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction and the benign lesions, and to formulate an endoscopic diagnosis and classification, which was recorded in the electronic medical record system. During the training session, each of the 13 endoscopy experts independently completed the classification of the training set of endoscopists of different levels; 7. The researchers analyzed the training set of the endoscopist with rich experience. Among them, The researchers divided the 153 cases of gastric junction adenocarcinoma into two subgroups: the first subgroup containing 104 cases that were clearly diagnosed by experts with rich experience as adenocarcinoma; The second sub"

Input Text: Mixed Methods of Analysis Support Brief Psychoeducational Support to Reduce Alcohol Use for HIV

Detailed Description
-----------------
Introduction: A 15-session, brief psychoeducational (BPE) based program, the Motivational Education Program (MEP), has been developed to reduce drinking in HIV+ adults and in 2 published, randomized trials, it was delivered in person by research study social workers. This MEP intervention was updated to include HIV-specific content in consideration of the importance of tailoring programs to a culturally and racially diverse urban population. The aim of this study is to compare a web-based/phone version of the MEP intervention with the standard, in-person version in reducing alcohol use in HIV+ adults. Methods: An equal allocation randomized trial design was used. Both groups received a baseline survey and either a web-based/phone intervention (intervention group) or in-person intervention (comparison group). In both groups, participants completed 5 follow-up questionnaires over a 36-week period. Analysis examined the differential effect of the updated intervention on self-reports of alcohol use by group. 24-hour timeline followback (TLFB) and alcohol-related problems scores were used to evaluate drinking-related effects. Results: Participants (n=132) were recruited from community HIV service agencies (n=29), social service agencies (n=46), health centers (n=22), and social media recruitment (n=35). Results from both the participant survey and the TLFB will be presented at the conference. Conclusions: Results from this study will inform researchers, HIV providers, and others in the field about the usefulness of tailored web-based/phone interventions or if additional clinical support (e.g., social worker or nurse case manager) is needed to improve treatment outcomes of alcohol use disorder. These research findings also are critical for future scale-up of effective alcohol use interventions to reach larger populations.

This is a UK-based observational study that aims to discover novel predictive biomarkers with the potential to guide treatment decision making and prolong progression-free survival and overall survival in patients with advanced triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). To date, more than 90% of all new anti-cancer treatments have failed to show a survival benefit, due in large to the lack of patient stratification. This study will leverage an innovative AI-driven platform that utilises microfluidic cell culture to test novel drugs and combinations in a 3D physiological environment. TNBC, an aggressive breast cancer subtype, will be used to validate the assay. This project will develop a cost-effective, reproducible and scalable method for conducting predictive drug testing assays."
421,"Background 

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are chronic inflammatory disorders of gut mucosal with onset occurring most frequently in young individuals (18 – 45 years). Two major forms exist which are ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD). For the majority of patients, symptoms are relapsing and remitting with disease flares associated with increased risk of surgery for complications. An essential part of the IBD process is the loss of intestinal barrier integrity which is regulated by the intestinal commensal bacteria and by inflammation-induced signaling molecules. This breakdown in barrier function allows bacteria and their endotoxins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), to penetrate the gut epithelial barrier and migrate into blood and lymph. This causes systemic inflammation that leads to an increased level of antibodies to LPS, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF‐α) and, possibly other inflammatory markers, resulting in increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer in patients with IBD. This intestinal barrier disruption induces chronic inflammation and affects the function of the gut. To what extent this barrier in IBD is restored after surgery is not fully known. Surgery and subsequent ileal dysfunction and malabsorption of fat and other essential nutrients will be expected affect gut barrier and lead to a chronic maladaptive illness and deterioration of intestinal inflammation with loss of remission. Surgery is often delayed to avoid this postoperative morbidity but there is limited evidence describing how surgery and delaying surgery affect health economy (HE), including quality of life (QoL).

Aim

The aim of this project is to analyze how HE including QoL is affected when surgery for IBD is delayed. We aim to answer the following questions:

When is elective surgery performed in IBD?

This will be done by analyzing data in Swedish registers for all patients with IBD and surgery.

What is the effect of delaying surgery for a given individual?

This question will be answered by analyzing prospectively collected health data (HRQoL) of patients from two groups - patients with IBD who are actively waiting for surgery and patients who have undergone elective surgery since 2019. A comparison between these two groups will show the effects of delaying surgery. Both groups will be analyzed regarding socioeconomic differences, postoperative complications and quality of life (HRQoL).


The investigators anticipate the data from this study will provide insight into the effect of delaying surgery in IBD on societal and health care costs and on quality of life.

430,"New mothers experience postpartum depression after childbirth, which commonly include mood swings, crying spells, anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Postpartum depression typically begins within the first two to three days after delivery and may last for up to several weeks or months. Activity and mobility are an integral part of human life that is manifested in a special way in each period. Postpartum life has caused lack of movement, the risk factor of depression and difficulty in maternal life. Resistance training is one of the most popular methods of exercise for improving physical fitness. Along with the better range of motion, it decreases risks of injuries, increases blood supply and nutrients to joints, reduces muscular tension and help to improve quality of life. Flexibility exercises are not just for gymnasts, but rather for everyone. This study will be a randomized clinical trial. Subjects meeting the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria will divide into two groups. Data will be collected from Jinnah Hospital Lahore, Family Health hospital, Johar town. After informed consents were obtained, data will collect. After taking written consent from participants who meet the inclusion criteria, data will be taken.

432,"Background and study purposes: Trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd) is a new antibody-drug conjugate that will be tested in people for whom it is standard treatment to have chemotherapy and trastuzumab (or a similar biological medicine). A further drug (e.g. pertuzumab) will usually also be given. T-DXd is being developed as a new standard treatment for these people. In this trial, it will be compared to current standard therapies. At the University of British Columbia's Michael Smith Laboratories, using tumor and blood samples, the goal is to investigate molecular changes before and after treatment with T-DXd, compared to standard therapy. The researchers also aim to study how these changes affect cellular and tissue changes in order to better understand how to effectively treat breast cancer in the future while minimizing side effects.

Who can participate? People aged between 18 and 70 with newly diagnosed early stage breast cancer for whom it is considered standard treatment to undergo chemotherapy, a drug called trastuzumab (or a similar biological medicine), other targeted therapy and surgery.

What does the study involve? In addition to the usual tests that people undergoing standard breast cancer treatment already receive, and those needed for surgery, people will be asked to have additional tests on up to three occasions during normal treatment: at baseline (before you start treatment), after three and after six treatment cycles. Treatment in each cycle is for 21 days. You can see an overview of these tests in Section 8.4 of the Protocol Summary.
The treatment options being tested in this study are: chemotherapy and trastuzumab (or a similar biological medicine), plus the antibody drug conjugate trastuzumab deruxtecan (T-DXd), OR chemotherapy and trastuzumab (or a similar biological medicine), plus other targeted therapy.

Each treatment alternative will be tested for approximately 37 months.  During this study period, people will: -Have treatment according to the treatment arm assigned. The first patient group will be assigned to three study treatment arms (cycles 1-3), T-DXd (T), Docetaxel, Carboplatin, Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab (TCHP), or Paclitaxel, Carboplatin, Trastuzumab, Pertuzumab (PCHP). After three study treatment cycles, the treatment options received will be decided according to the molecular subtype (Invasive Luminal A/B, Invasive Luminal B HER2-Enriched , Invasive Luminal B HER2-Non Enriched, Invasive HER2-Enriched, Invasive Luminal B ER-negative or Invasive Basal-like/Triple-negative ) of the tumor, as evaluated by the investigator, and using existing guidelines. Patients in this study group are likely to continue their treatment up until six cycles. -Have surgery approximately 37 months after the beginning of treatment and provide 5-year follow-up, 1 year after surgery, and 5 years after surgery. -Be monitored with Molecular and Clinical monitoring, including a final Clinical monitoring appointment 35 months after baseline testing.    Molecular and Cellular monitoring: -On up to three occasions during normal treatment (at baseline (before treatment), after 3 weeks (after 3 treatment cycles), and after 6 weeks (after 6 treatment cycles), participants will provide: 1. Blood for molecular monitoring at baseline and after at least 3 treatment cycles. 
2. Tumor tissue for research at the time of surgery    
3. Provide a hair sample for research at the start of treatment and at approximately one year after surgery. 
4. Provide a urine sample for research at the start of treatment and at approximately one year after surgery. (Molecular and Clinical monitoring) 
 -In addition, participants may be asked to provide blood and tumor tissue for molecular research. Participants will be asked to have blood for molecular research at their surgery appointment. Tumor tissue may be collected at surgery. Molecular and Cellular monitoring will be concluded after approximately five years from the start of treatment. 

 
This clinical study will take place at approximately 25 sites in Europe, North America, South America, and Asia. We are inviting patients to an online discussion board, in which patients can contact researchers in order to find out more about the study, and to share information with other patients. Participants do not need to use email to take part in this study.

437,"Background:  
Over the last decade, there has been a substantial change in the pattern of preoperative biliary drainage. A preoperative biliary drainage is nowadays routinely performed prior to elective pancreatoduodenectomy. In 2015, a large multicenter randomized controlled trial showed increased rates of operative infections (9.4% vs. 2.5% for patients with a preoperative biliary drainage, p < 0.001) without improvement of the oncological outcome. To compensate for a potential increase of postoperative infections, the majority of large cancer centers has implemented a preoperative selective antibiotic prophylaxis. However, it remains unclear if short versus prolonged selective antibiotic prophylaxis is more effective. 
Furthermore, in the Netherlands, a long-term preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis is currently not in line with the current national and international recommendations for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Therefore, the addition of a short or prolonged preoperative selective antibiotic prophylaxis might not be in line with the current antibiotic policy. Rationale: In case of a high proportion of patients with a preoperative biliary drainage, a selective pre-emptive antibiotic prophylaxis might be indicated to reduce the overall rate of postoperative infections. Therefore, we hypothesize that after high-risk pancreatoduodenectomy, the addition of a prolonged selective antibiotic prophylaxis will reduce the incidence of postoperative infectious complications. 
Aims of the study 
This prospective, randomized, open-label, investigator initiated, multicenter, superiority trial will assess the rate of clinically relevant postoperative infections following pancreatoduodenectomy by perioperative versus prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis. Design 
The design will be a randomized controlled trial in which patients are randomized between prolonged and perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. Inclusion 
The study population consists of adult patients undergoing elective pancreatoduodenectomy with a preoperative high risk for postoperative infectious complications. 
Inclusion criteria: Male or female patients of 18 years or older Patients undergoing elective pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile 
- Preoperative biliary drainage for malignant biliary obstruction 
- Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for benign biliary obstruction with suspected malignancy (bile duct brushing, biopsy) 
- Pancreatic cancer with a preoperative bile duct stent 
- Obtained written informed consent prior to enrollment. 
The following patients will be excluded from the study: Patients with a known intolerance or allergy for the study antibiotics Patients scheduled for a therapeutic pancreatic surgery (i.e. Whipple/lob/pancreatic resection for malignancy) Emergency surgery Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography for periampullary tumors without biliary stenting 
(ERCP for suspected cholangitis or cholecystitis) Patients whose planned postoperative care will be in the intensive care unit or another specialized facility 
(e.g. patients undergoing combined procedures) Contraindications to participate in the study (e.g. life expectancy <6 months, pregnancy) Duration of follow-up 
Clinical relevant infectious complications will be identified during the first 90 days after pancreatoduodenectomy. 
Inclusion of patients 
After the patient has been referred to our institution for elective pancreatoduodenectomy, the investigator will obtain written informed consent and enroll the patient into the study. Randomization 
We will perform stratified block randomization (in blocks of 4 or 6 and stratified on the type of pre-emptive biliary drainage (benign vs. malignant). After the patient has been formally enrolled in the study, the randomization will take place before surgery using the web-based randomization program of Amsterdam University Medical Centers (version 2.1). The randomization program will be developed and hosted by the Clinical Epidemiology Unit of the Academic Medical Center Amsterdam. 
This will be a stratified randomization,"

A group/cohort of 60 participants will be recruited. The group/cohort has a broad range distribution of different physiological parameters, such as age, gender, race, BMI, and etc. A questionnaire about demographic information and health condition will be collected before the measurement. During the measurement, the investigators will apply the conventional transcranial Doppler probe (TCD Pro), the wearable ultrasound patch, and the clinical parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure) to 6 non-invasively-monitored regions in the brain. It takes about 1 hour for the full measurement. The clinical parameters (heart rate, mean arterial pressure) and blood flow spectrum of the non-invasively-monitored brain regions (middle cerebral artery, anterior cerebral artery, posterior cerebral artery, vertebral artery, basal artery, internal carotid artery, and ophthalmic artery) will be recorded using TCD Pro and the wearable ultrasound patch. The agreement of these two device on peak systolic flow velocity, mean systolic velocity, and end diastolic velocity of the measurements will be evaluated using the Bland-Altman plot. The Bland-Altman plot will provide the mean difference between two devices and the limits of agreement. If the mean difference is smaller than 20%, 95% CI of the mean difference is within -20% and +20%, and the limits of agreement are within 60% of the maximum peak systolic velocity (PSPV), the agreement of the two device will be concluded. By the same manner, the investigators will compare the peak systolic flow velocity measured by TCD Pro with that measured by the wearable ultrasound patch. The Bland-Altman plot will provide the mean difference, the limits of agreement, and the corresponding 95% confidence interval. A comparison of the pulse waveform from TCD Pro and that from the wearable ultrasound patch will be evaluated using wave intensity analysis."

β2-microglobulin and indoxyl sulfate belong to small middle molecular weight uremic toxins. They have been known for their adverse effects in kidney disease. Small middle molecule uremic toxins clearance by low efficacy dialysis is limited. The low permeability and filtration rate of ultrafiltration lead to a low clearance rate of small middle molecular weight uremic toxins, which easily cause the accumulation in the body. HRF hemodialysis machines use two blood lines and two dialysate lines to set up an additional dialysate line: the blood from the patient enters the blood purification dialyzer, and then enters the ultrafiltration membrane to replace the ultrafiltration dialysate flow. During this filtration process, the blood from the patient enters to the ultrafiltration membrane at one end and the ultrafiltrate at the other end, and then through the blood purification dialyzer and the hemodiafiltration circuit to exchange toxins and filter toxins, which is similar to the dialysysate filtration process. In addition, continuous convective dialysate replacement using a single circulatory system can increase the concentration of the convective component in the dialysate and significantly increase the clearance capacity of toxins. At the same time, it replaces the entire ultrafiltrate in the patient's vascular system, which is more effective than traditional hemodiafiltration mode under the same blood purification time.
HFR hemodialysis machine uses two blood lines and two dialysate lines to set up an additional dialysate line, blood from the patient enters the blood purification dialyzer, and then enters the ultrafiltration membrane to replace the ultrafiltration dialysate flow. During this filtration process, the blood from the patient enters into the ultrafiltration membrane at an angle of 30-40 degrees, and the ultrafiltration dialysate enters from the center of the ultrafiltration membrane and flows through the center of the ultrafiltration membrane to the dialysate bag. As a result, the ultrafiltration dialysate and the blood from the patient mix and form a mixed fluid. When this dilute mixed solution enters into the blood purification dialyzer, the concentration of the convective component in the ultrafiltration component is much higher than the standard hemodiafiltration, and the convective transfer of the toxins is more efficient, which can greatly increase the clearance rate of the toxins. When the dialysis time was the same, the HFR can have the same or higher blood clearance than the HDF or HDF. However, the main disadvantage of HFR is the loss of ultrafiltration fluid during the dialysis process. When ultrafiltration occurs in"

The research protocol requires an individual randomization prior to the group intervention to be delivered by social worker and/or physiatrist to each patient. The randomization schedule will be generated in advance by the investigators or team coordinator and will be based on an independent randomization table, which we will use to generate a random allocation of the patients to the interventions and control groups. The investigators and research coordinator will ensure that randomization is conducted by an independent person who will be blinded to the patient's identity. Randomization will be performed using a computerized interactive randomization schedule with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Following allocation, the research team will contact the physiatrist or social worker, and inform them which group a participant is in (either SEGT or TAU).

447,"There are not clear indications of stage III NSCLC, and more and more patients with stage IIIA were treated with surgery and neoadjuvant therapy, so postoperative survival and recurrence rate were still high. With the wide application of MRD technology, it was found that the MRD rate of stage III NSCLC patients was high, and there was a positive correlation between MRD and recurrence rate. Therefore, it is considered that MRD is an effective factor for judging the postoperative prognosis of NSCLC patients. However, since MRD detection methods need to be improved, its clinical application is not very wide. Therefore, it is predicted that if these deficiencies can be improved, MRD technology can be widely applied in postoperative survival monitoring. Through this project, it is expected that MRD technology can be applied to preoperative treatment selection and postoperative survival monitoring, which can provide more information for NSCLC patients' treatment."
448,"1,540 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit for acute respiratory distress syndrome and septic shock, as well as 600 patients hospitalized for other indications, were prospectively studied. A total of 36 severe ARDS patients were randomly selected from the 1,540 patient group and subjected to sedation with ciprofloxacin. The other 36 severe patients with sepsis were matched according to blood pressure and sedation with propofol. In the general group, 35 moderate or severe ARDS patients and 40 patients with septic shock received propofol. The use of ciprofloxacin as an end-inhalation sedative in ARDS patients can effectively alleviate the patient's condition and reduce the workload of clinicians and nurses.

Introduction
-----------------
Lupus erythematosus (LE) is a chronic, autoimmune disease that affects multiple organs and systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, lungs, and nervous system. It is a complex and highly individualized disease, and there is currently no cure. The diagnosis and management of LE can be challenging due to the variable presentation of symptoms and the potential for significant organ damage and impaired quality of life (QoL) in affected individuals. The skin is one of the most common manifestations of LE, affecting up to 50% of patients. The presence of"
451,"Background:
-----------------
Large- and medium-vessel occlusions constitute the most devastating vascular injuries in the human brain, causing significant neurological deficits and mortality.1 Prompt and early reperfusion within 6 hours after symptom onset using mechanical thrombectomy to remove a clot from a vessel is considered the neuroprotective treatment standard.2 Recently, the application of intravenous thrombolysis within 3-4.5 hours and endovascular treatment up to 24 hours after symptom onset showed modest efficacy.3,4 The use of neuroimaging algorithms to measure the extent of brain injury and guide reperfusion decisions5,6,7 may help improve the efficacy of acute stroke therapies. However, the current imaging-based measures such as final infarct volume (which is assessed after stroke presentation [i.e., 24 hours after stroke onset]) only capture the magnitude of brain tissue loss but cannot indicate whether there will be further progression. While plasma levels of brain-derived NfL were found to correlate with the extent of brain injury within the first 24 hours after stroke onset,13,19,21 they are not specific to brain injury as an elevation of NfL has also been demonstrated in other non-CNS conditions.14,22,23 Brain-derived extracellular vesicle-mediated shuttling of tau proteins from the brain to the peripheral blood circulation has raised interest in the last years as a potential biomarker approach to monitor brain injury and to aid treatment choices in acute stroke.18,24,25 Brain-derived tau (BD-tau) are proteinaceous fragments of tau protein that are released from axonal endings and neuronal somata,25 enter the extracellular space and are secreted by the cells.18,25 Once tau fragments reach the peripheral blood circulation, they are detectable in the plasma by immunoassays.24

Previously, the investigators have shown that the use of plasma BD-tau levels in combination with other clinical variables enables stratification into risk classes for poor outcome at 90 days after stroke onset. The investigators further found that at admission and at 24 hours after symptom onset, plasma BD-tau levels strongly correlated with the extent of brain injury based on neuroimaging metrics and that the use of plasma BD-tau level-based algorithms to guide treatment decisions in acute stroke improved stroke outcomes.18,24 The investigators recently demonstrated in 100 patients with acute large- or medium-vessel occlusion that plasma BD-tau levels increase from admission throughout hospitalization.18 These findings suggest that in acute ischemic stroke, plasma BD-tau may be a sensitive, dynamic, and early biomarker of brain injury and that measuring its time-course trajectories may provide insights on the pathophysiological course of brain injury. Here, PROMISE-BD-100 aims at gaining a deeper understanding on the evolution of plasma BD-tau levels in patients with acute large- or medium-vessel occlusion. 

Hypothesis & Goals: PROMISE-BD-100 builds on the previously demonstrated strong correlation between plasma BD-tau levels upon admission and at 24 hours after onset and the extent of brain injury based on an image-based metric of brain injury (final infarct volume).18,24,27 The investigators hypothesize that plasma BD-tau levels upon admission and 24 hours after onset serve as a good predictor for the extent of brain injury at 24 hours after onset and 90 days after stroke onset. Therefore, PROMISE-BD-100 will assess plasma BD-tau levels at admission and every hour until 48 hours after admission. This will allow for a thorough investigation of the evolution of plasma BD-tau levels (i.e., the time point when plasma BD-tau levels start to rise immediately after and following stroke onset, the type of rise, and the length of the increase). The investigators anticipate that the results of this project will facilitate the development of a real-time monitoring system and clinical algorithms to integrate plasma BD-tau levels and the time of elevation into clinical decision-making algorithms in acute ischemic stroke. This will ultimately enable an accurate and timely estimation of the extent of brain injury and to improve decision-making on reperfusion, cytoprotection, and targeting clinically ineffective reperf"

454,"Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia (PCD) is a genetic and congenital disorder that causes recurrent respiratory tract infections, infertility, chronic non-specific cough, hearing loss, and abdominal pain. These patients will become immunization candidates, presenting the need to evaluate their immune response to different vaccines (inactivated vaccines, vaccines based on viral vectors, and attenuated vaccines). Vaccines to viral infections, even attenuated, have already shown to induce immune response in many PCD cases. Other vaccines for non-viral infections have shown to have limited response and there are no clear data about their behavior. Therefore, through this project, the investigators expect to answer questions such as: Are the different classes of vaccines effective among PCD patients? How is the immune response to different vaccines in this patient population? Are there factors other than genotype that could affect the immune response? Are vaccine administration, route, and response correlated to the patient genotype? The investigators want to answer these questions with a cross-sectional study (clinical study of a determined period of time) that is designed as a single arm, open trial, in which the investigators will carry out the administration of a wide range of available vaccines to a cohort of PCD patients. The study aims to be non-inferior, and in this sense, the investigators will compare the proportion of subjects in which positive response in immunogenicity tests are found, and evaluate to what extent this response is influenced by the genetic mutation. The investigators also expect to find a correlation between the patient’s genotype, the administration route of the vaccine, and the intensity of the immune response to each of the immunogenicity tests and vaccines studied. 


Input Text: 
This study is an exploratory single arm, open trial to investigate the safety and potential antitumour activity of Pemetrexed combined with Bevacizumab in adult patients with previously treated, advanced (local/regional and distant) and/or metastatic solid tumors. It is hoped that the combination will prove tolerable and have substantial antitumour activity.

Overall study aim is to demonstrate proof of principle for efficacy of the combination of Pemetrexed, Bevacizumab and Nivolumab for second-line treatment of malignant mesothelioma. The study will further investigate the toxicities and tolerability of the combination of the study drugs, assessing safety of administration as priority in second-line treatments.

A proof of concept that the PBT/Nivolumab combination is tolerable in second line treatments and shows signs of efficacy will provide the rationale for progressing the combination through Phase 3 trials.

455,"OBJECTIVES: Our primary objective is to explore and describe the salivary biochemical profile of infants diagnosed with GER and to identify the prevalence of GERD among infants presenting with symptoms of GER. Secondly, our aim is to identify any differences in the salivary biochemical profile (pepsin concentration, pepsinogen concentration, electrolyte concentration, such as sodium and HCO3-) between healthy infants and infants diagnosed with GERD. We also aim to identify possible circadian variations in the salivary biochemical profile of healthy subjects and in patients with GER and GERD over a period of 24 hours and assess their feasibility. Our final aim is to correlate the onset of symptoms and nutrition to any changes in the salivary biochemical profile of GER and GERD patients over the course of 24 hours. DESIGN: Diagnostic Test: 2 cohorts of infants will be enrolled in our study: The cohort of patients (28 patients) will include infants hospitalized in the Pediatric Unit of the General Policlinic Hospital (University of Rome) with symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER). The cohort of controls (25 healthy children-matched age, sex, and ethnicity) will include healthy infants undergoing a routine checkup in the Department of Pediatrics of the General Policlinic Hospital. The 2 control groups will be obtained from a pre-existing database that includes clinical and anthropometric data on 207 children aged 1 -12 months referred to the department of pediatrics from April 2015 to September 2016. Saliva samples will be collected at different times (2-sample-every hour). In the case of patients, a 24-hour salivary collection will be made during the execution of a multichannel intraluminal impedance pH (MII-pH) at the same time points as salivary monitoring. Patients will be enrolled in groups of 4 infants a week, based on convenience. In control infants, only 1 sample will be obtained at a given time point. The sample will be immediately processed and sent for biochemical analysis at an external laboratory specialized in salivary biochemical analysis. MII-PH will be performed according to the guidelines of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN). MEDICAL RECORDS: The medical records of enrolled patients will be collected and analyzed after obtaining written parental consent. BIOMARKER IDENTIFICATION: Salivary markers of GERD will be identified and compared between the 2 groups of patients. The study aims to identify salivary markers that can be used in a clinical setting to help diagnose GERD and to correlate the salivary marker values with symptoms that are characteristic of GERD. INFRARED SPECTROSCOPY: In addition to conventional methods, infrared spectroscopy will be used to help identify any differences in the biochemical profile of saliva samples. Infrared spectroscopy is a non-invasive technique that can provide information about biochemical changes in saliva. The primary objective of this study is to explore and describe the salivary biochemical profile of infants diagnosed with GER and to identify the prevalence of GERD among infants presenting with symptoms of GER.

456,"ΝΑFLD is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Dulaglutide is a once weekly, long-acting GLP-1 mimetic, consisting of two copies of the recombinant human GLP-1 (7-36) amide linked by the Gly-Lys (GK) linker 3,4. The efficacy of dulaglutide in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) was studied in several RCTs - AWARD-6, AWARD-8, AWARD-4, AWARD-9, and REWIND, with a median treatment duration of 9-111 wks. With a single dose, dulaglutide induces dose-dependent increases in glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and a single weekly dose of 1.5 mg was the dose selected for further evaluation. Empagliflozin (EMPA) is an oral, once daily, selective inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT)-2, which is responsible for the reabsorption of approximately 90% of the glucose that is filtered at the renal glomerulus. EMPA was studied in several trials: EMPA-REG OUTCOME (1645 participants with T2DM and chronic kidney disease, mean follow-up 3.1 years), CANVAS (7020 participants with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk, mean follow-up 4.1 years) and CANVAS-Renal (7020 participants with T2DM at high cardiovascular risk and chronic kidney disease), EMPA-REG OUTCOME (1645 participants with T2DM and chronic kidney disease, mean follow-up 3.1 years). In all studies EMPA showed its cardiovascular (CV) and renal benefits and also its ability to improve liver steatosis. The potential for liver fat reduction in patients with T2DM treated with these novel medications constitutes an important topic for investigation as, otherwise, we are limited to diet/exercise or surgery, with their respective limitations. Based on these data, the investigators hypothesize that both dulaglutide and EMPA have a potential role in treating diabetic patients with hepatic steatosis.

The 15% of patients from our study who achieved complete remission (i.e. MRD <0.01%) experienced a significant survival benefit compared to patients with suboptimal treatment outcome, with a median overall survival not reached at the time of our analysis as compared to 41.6 months (2.2-43.4) for patients with MRD >0.01%. Our results indicate, in the conditioning arm, overall survival and progression-free survival values that are comparable or better than historical controls receiving VCD as well as comparable overall survival values to those reported by other HCT centres for this patient population. Thus, in patients with aggressive forms of myeloma, the addition of single-agent VCD to VDT-BEAP yields an acceptable safety profile and good treatment outcome in terms of progression-free and overall survival."
459,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a progressive chronic disease that will eventually lead to debilitating chronic complications such as retinopathy, amputations, nephropathy, neuropathy, and cardiovascular diseases. Worldwide, ~93 million people were living with T2D in 2019, and this number is predicted to rise to 152 million by 2045. Women can be exposed to a greater prevalence of T2D in comparison to men, due to a variety of biological and non-biological factors. T2D is associated with an increased risk of preterm and still births, and several short- and long-term complications in the mother and/or the offspring. Pre-Diabetes is another condition associated with an increased risk of conversion to T2D, with 10-15% of pre-diabetic women transitioning to diabetes within 5 years without any intervention to stop their progression. Pre-existing GDM remains a significant risk factor for the onset of T2D in women, increasing the risk of developing this debilitating disease in women post-partum. 
There is growing evidence that lifestyle modifications, including a combination of diet, physical activity, and psychological strategies can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. Digital health interventions that can monitor lifestyle behaviour and provide behavioral modification plans, may further improve the beneficial effect of lifestyle modification via the integration of smartphones in the health and personal care space. However, studies investigating the impact of digital health interventions on the prevention of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes in high-risk populations are still limited.
The research team at National University Health System (NUHS) in Singapore is investigating the use of digital health interventions (including smartphone-based conversational agent-delivered coaching sessions, and gamified lifestyle coaching sessions) to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes and pre-diabetes in post-GDM women. In addition, investigators will examine the potential benefits of these digital health interventions on the health of members of family affected by post-GDM women.
The overall goal of this study is to reduce the risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and pre-diabetes in Asian women and their children by focusing upon a major high-risk group - women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) in Singapore. GDM is diabetes diagnosed for the first-time during pregnancy and has traditionally been considered a benign condition because typically glucose levels return to normal after delivery. Women with pregnancies complicated by GDM often progress to develop T2D later in life. There is evidence that holistic lifestyle modifications that include strategies to improve dietary intake, physical activity, and mental well-being can prevent or delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. The use of digital health interventions can also assist in the prevention of T2D. However, limited studies have been conducted with Asian populations. This study aims (1) to identify post-GDM women from large community settings in Singapore and to assess the efficacy of a holistic lifestyle digital intervention (focusing on diet, physical activity, sleep, and mental well-being) on glucose regulation with those identified women. Secondary objectives are: (a) to examine the potential impacts of the proposed intervention on the health and well-being of subjects' family members (e.g., children); (b) to determine the diabetes risk of the subjects over a 3-year follow-up period; (c) to explore potential economic impacts of the proposed intervention (e.g., healthcare expenditures); (d) to study the importance of gut microbiota and epigenetic factors in relation to changes in glucose metabolism, and (e) to ascertain the safety of the proposed intervention. The study is a 1-year randomized controlled trial with three years of follow-up. The primary outcomes involved the incidence of Type 2 diabetes confirmed by a 2-hr 75g Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) over a 4-year period. Secondary outcomes are (1) incidence of impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance; (b) changes in cardiometabolic variables (e.g., body weight, HbA1c, insulin, blood lipids, blood pressures) in the women; (c) changes in women's body composition; (d) changes in women's mental well-being (e.g., defined by BDI-II, STAI, WHO-5, PSS-4); (e) changes in the health and wellbeing of their children, and (f"

Input Text: The relationship between acute ischemic stroke severity and postoperative outcome in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to determine whether there is a relationship between NIH stroke scale and the degree of improvement of stroke patients after mechanical thrombectomy. Acute ischemic stroke patients who underwent mechanical thrombectomy were divided into groups A and B according to the presence of symptoms that could affect outcome. The group was divided into 2 groups: A) patients who did not have the above symptoms and B) patients who did. The stroke severity was determined using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and the improvement level was determined by neurological examination and the Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) that was given four weeks after operation. For patients who had undergone endovascular treatment, the radiological results, the degree of recanalization and the level of improvement in the mRS according to the degree of recanalization were evaluated.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background and Rationale: Acute ischemic stroke is the most common cause of disability and death in adults over 50 years of age. Neurological deficits in patients with high intracranial pressure and severe midline shift may be observed as an increase in ICP or loss of consciousness. In addition, it may cause respiratory depression leading to aspiration and pneumonia. The presence of these symptoms may lead astrocyte decompensation or secondary brain parenchyma ischemia. Pre-operative neurological symptoms that compromise outcome will be evaluated. The purpose of this study is to determine whether symptoms that may lead to this situation are present in stroke patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy, and to determine the degree of improvement and the relationship between these symptoms and the outcome. Methods: After obtaining approval for ethical and clinical issues from the Ethics Committee of Izmir Katip Celebi University, this study includes the examination of a total of 52 patients who were accepted to the Interventional Neuroradiology Unit and underwent mechanical thrombectomy in our clinic between October 2020 and March 2021. After the patients and their families underwent detailed information about the treatment to be performed by the researcher, their informed consent to their participation in the study was obtained in writing. The patients included in the study were randomized into two groups: Group A: patients who did not have symptoms that could impair outcome (such as agitation, seizures, unconsciousness and excessive intracranial pressure), 26 patients; Group B: Patients who had symptoms that may have affected the outcome, such as agitation, seizures, unconsciousness ( 26 patients).. The age, gender, risk factors, pre-operative neurological level, the degree of recanalization determined by imaging were recorded on the questionnaire. All of the variables that made the evaluation of the study patient difficult or could cause the failure of the study were included in the group evaluation. Pre-operative neurological level was assessed using the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS"
461,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety profile of melphalan intra-arterial chemotherapy, followed by ruthenium brachytherapy for the treatment of medium- to large-sized ciliary body choroidal melanomas that are inappropriate for radioactive isotope brachytherapy with 106Ru. The hypothesis is that the use of ocular ruthenium brachytherapy is safe and effective after melphalan IAC in treating patients with large choroidal melanomas. The intra-arterial injection of melphalan is a safe treatment option for these patients, who otherwise would undergo enucleation. Intra-arterial chemotherapy is not expected to cause damage to surrounding structures or loss of visual acuity."
462,"The purpose of this study is to obtain data that describe the characteristics of trauma in a general hospital from Villavicencio, Colombia, and identify whether patients with different mechanisms, risk factors, or outcomes have different characteristics in order to prioritize actions or policies in trauma prevention."
463,"The goal of this study is to identify the therapeutic efficacy and feasibility of a new treatment approach that will increase mobility in older veterans that suffer from LSS and have failed conservative measures. Specifically by providing non-invasive posture (NIPT) treatment approach which improves posture and reduces stress on the LSS nerves during daily activities and sleep by means of lumbar traction, back extension and leg flexion on the back of a chair for 15 minutes at a time, up to three times per day. The NIPT device and educational materials will train participants to self-correct lumbar extension to avoid lumbar flexion and the concomitant compression of spinal nerves, which can lead to back and sciatica pain during daily activities. 

The hypothesis is that this therapeutic approach will offer a safe, alternative treatment for older veterans with LSS by increasing mobility associated with decreased pain severity, decreased pain interference, and increased physical function, and decreased fatigue and sleep disturbance. If proven effective and feasible, NIPT can be effectively brought to the home environment so that patients can continue their maintenance treatment on a lifelong basis until the patient is fully mobile.

464,"The main objective of the current study is to determine if the use of SANO results in higher bladder capacities and reduced pain and anxiety compared to oxygen during UDS. Secondary objectives include: 1) Assess whether the timing of SANO administration, with either SANO followed by oxygen or oxygen followed by SANO, has an impact on outcome measures; and 2) Assess the effects of SANO on patient experience during UDS, as measured by a semi-structured interview at the end of UDS.

The current proposal for this study includes a single site, the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. This study will use a prospective, single-blind, randomized, crossover design. The study will include male and female patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) at the time of initial catheterization for the study. Patients will be randomized to the order in which they receive SANO or oxygen during the procedure. Participants will be asked to rate their pain and anxiety during UDS after each run. They will also be asked to complete a semi-structured interview at the end of the UDS procedure.

Detailed Description: UDS is a diagnostic test that provides information about the function of the bladder, urethra, ureters, and sphincter. It is sometimes performed by caregivers for patients with LUTS. UDS involves the placement of a catheter into the bladder. The test assesses bladder size (capacity) and maximum flow rate (when voiding). The use of SANO during UDS may reduce anxiety, pain, and discomfort associated with the procedure. We hypothesize that the use of SANO will result in higher bladder capacities and reduced pain and anxiety compared to oxygen during UDS.

465,"Background
=================
Breast cancer is the most common tumor worldwide. The vast majority of cases are hormone dependent and estrogen-receptor-positive (80%) (Czene and Fan, 2010; Sestak et al., 2012). Although the mortality rates have been decreasing in recent years, early age at diagnosis and the subsequent longer life expectancy (Duffy et al., 2008) have meant an increase in the number of young postmenopausal women affected by hormone-dependent breast cancer. In this sense, cancer patients can experience anxiety, depression, and low body esteem after the diagnosis, with a subsequent impact on their quality of life (Kerfoot et al., 2009; Pignata et al., 2013).

As a result of the biological, psychological, and social changes and the uncertainty caused by the disease, many women feel fear regarding further disease evolution and possible relapse. These situations are associated with higher psychological distress both during and after the disease (Allan et al., 2009; O'Flynn et al., 2013; Hanna et al., 2014; Ries et al., 2018). This fear of recurrence can increase anxiety and depression, as well as affect the body image and quality of life (Ries et al., 2018). Fear of recurrence and psychological distress in newly diagnosed patients has been associated with decreased self-confidence (Fitzsimmons et al., 2016), depression (Ries et al., 2018), poor quality of life (Hanna et al., 2014), and higher incidence of anxiety and depression (Löf and Nilsson, 2018). These negative mental states can lead to an increased relapse risk (Ries et al., 2018). Moreover, a fearful attitude towards cancer in remission involves the inhibition of cancer fear (Löf and Nilsson, 2018), leading to negative consequences on memory (Krystal and Neufeld, 2006) and on the quality of life and well-being of the patients (Bultz and O'Brien, 2006; Löf and Nilsson, 2018).

Psychosocially, adversity in childhood, such as childhood abuse or neglect, can be an important factor in the pathophysiology of the disease (Frederick et al., 2019; Sung et al., 2020). Childhood abuse has been found to be associated with an increased incidence of breast cancer (Miller et al., 2002; Maughan et al., 2009; Miller et al., 2009), higher severity of disease (Ellison and Burt, 2008) and lower survival rates (Potocky et al., 2010). In this regard, adverse childhood events are highly prevalent in patients with breast cancer, with a rate of abuse and neglect ranging from 40% (Hall, 2015) to 58% (Hartling et al., 2017). Therefore, it is a frequent phenomenon in the population and can become a predictor of greater risk of disease relapse or poorer quality of life, among other things. The same events can also serve as a predictor of increased anxiety and depression in women with breast cancer (Ellison and Burt, 2008; Fan et al., 2010; Löf and Nilsson, 2018).

Fear for disease progression can be associated with the inability to regulate emotional processes. This inability is related to negative emotionality derived from an increase in the level of a cortisol-binding protein, such as CRF (corticotropin-releasing factor). There is evidence of the existence of a genetic predisposition to CRF production that may influence the level of basal CRF (Nakagome, 2006; Nishio et al., 2009; Nakagome et al., 2012). On the other hand, the increased activation of CRF will alter chromatin remodeling through the action of chromatin regulators, such as histone methyltransferase FKBP5 (Huynh et al., 2016; Crespi et al., 2019; Mao et al., 2019) and the"
466,"Several studies have evaluated the effectiveness and safety of the HDThera® System as a stand-alone procedure and as a component of a protontherapy/phototherapy-based workflow for both extracranial and intracranial neoplasia. To reduce the high costs of protontherapy for the indication of non-malignant diseases (e.g. functional and metabolic diseases), the focus at this point of time will be set on the phototherapy aspects of the HDThera® System for the indication of intracranial neoplasia. A previous clinical study performed by the investigators demonstrated no radiation dose-related difference in the median time of clinical recovery of motor and cognitive functions when comparing LENS ™ - based and 200 MeV protontherapy - based workflows. Therefore, the investigators' ultimate goal for this clinical study is to perform low-energy-photon therapy (≤200 MeV) for patients with intracranial tumors. This should not only reduce the treatment costs, but also the necessary treatment time and the corresponding immobilization stress induced by the treatments. Ultimately, an optimization of the protontherapy - based workflow regarding cost-effectiveness and a higher patient friendliness is achieved.

468,"The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of an EUS-guided injection of mesothelin targeted CAR-T cells (MSLN CART) in patients with early resectable pancreatic cancer (PDAC). PDAC is an aggressive cancer that typically is diagnosed at late stages. For all stages combined, the 5-year survival rate is about 9%. Patients with early stage (resectable) pancreatic cancer may be offered surgical resection together with standard chemotherapy, but despite this, about 70-80% will develop recurrent disease. Novel therapeutic strategies are needed to improve outcome of early resectable pancreatic cancer.  CAR T-cell therapy has had success in patients with relapsed/refractory acute leukemia, lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies, and there is ongoing research on solid tumors. To date, there has been no report of intra-tumoral injections of CAR T-cells for PDAC. This intervention may be an important bridge to surgical resection and, in the future, it may also be an adjunct to definitive standard systemic therapy in patients that might not be suitable for standard surgery.  In this study, we aim to demonstrate that EUS-guided injection of MSLN-targeted CAR-T cells is tolerable, safe and feasible and may translate into improved survival."
469,"Decision Support Systems (DSS) are designed to assist health care providers in making informed decisions, improving the quality of care, and fostering patients' participation and engagement. A comprehensive review of the literature shows that the use of DSS can lead to more effective health outcomes and reduce the costs of delivering care. However, the implementation of DSS in the healthcare setting is still in its initial stages, and further research is needed to evaluate their effectiveness in different health care settings.

Study design
=================
Single center, open-label RCT (randomized controlled trial)

Intervention
=================
In patients who consented to be enrolled in the intervention arm, they will be randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group.
In the control group, patients will not receive any additional intervention other than standard medical advice.
In the experimental group, patients will receive the TREAT (TREatment Adherence SupporT) decision support tool that will be deployed on web-based applications. In particular, they will receive 3 months of support through the web-based tool. Patients are instructed to use it ad libitum. TREAT (TREatment Adherence SupporT) consists of four sections: i) Metastatic Breast Cancer: contains information about MBC and its physical and psychological consequences; ii) Adherence to Cancer Therapies: contains information about adherence in the cancer population; iii) Promoting Adherence: contains information about resources, barriers, and available interventions used to foster adherence; iv) My Adherence Diary.

Study endpoints
=================
The primary effectiveness endpoint will be the difference in adherence between patients receiving the DSS web-based tool and those who receive standard medical advice. 
The secondary endpoint will be to explore the relationship between different psychological, clinical, and QoL variables, as well as risk perception and adherence in the context of cancer treatment administration.

Study hypotheses
=================
Main hypotheses
-	The DSS has a positive impact on patients' adherence to oral anticancer treatment.
-	Psychological and/or clinical factors, quality-of-life parameters, and risk perception may serve as nonmodifiable indicators of patients' adherence to oral anticancer treatment.
-	A machine learning web application can effectively predict patients' risk factors for nonadherence to cancer treatment, specifically considering physical status, comorbid conditions, and short- and long-term side effects.


Study Design
=================
The study is designed as a 3-month randomized controlled study conducted at the European Institute of Oncology (IEO). More specifically, a sample of 100 patients is enrolled consecutively and admitted to the Division of Medical Senology with an MBC diagnosis. Patients who signed the informed consent are given a unique identifier and assigned to either the control or intervention arm in a 1:1 ratio. The protocol foresees three assessment time points: T1 (1-Month), T2 (2-Month), and T3 (3-Month). At the baseline (T0), all patients fill out validated questionnaires to measure adherence, clinical, psychological, and QoL variables. The expected time to complete all the given questionnaires at baseline is approximately 40 minutes. Furthermore, all patients have to fill a weekly adherence medication diary for three months. Each month, all participants receive a brief telephone interview in which they are monitored for compliance with the research protocol.

Study Population
=================
The study population includes patients > 18 years-old; Having a metastatic breast cancer diagnosis; Taking oral treatment intervention for metastatic breast cancer; Patients with internet access and a personal smartphone or tablet; Patients who have read and signed the informed consent.

472,"In cardiac surgery, heparinized blood is diverted from the body, pumped through a membrane-blood oxygenator-pump, into the aorta, and replaced from the systemic arterial circulation in a closed circuit. Consequently, the blood is unnaturally cooled to 25 to 30° C, deoxygenatized to allow oxygenation, and depleted of platelets, which may impair the microcirculation and lead to ischemia, reperfusion injury, and the occurrence of AKI. There is now extensive research on the role of DO2 in optimizing cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) to prevent or limit the development of severe organ injury. DO2 can be defined as the O2 supply to the tissues. In 1976, Prys-Thomas and Taylor reported a strong correlation between the arterial-venous O2 content gradient and the development of organ dysfunction and complications in non-cardiac surgery. This relationship was then further established for cardiac surgery, the so-called Prys-Thomas equation showing that a DO2 of 600 ml/min/m2 was required to prevent hypoperfusion related to organ damage. Conversely, the 2015 European Society of Cardiothoracic Surgery (ESCTS) clinical guidelines recommend a DO2 for CPB of 450 ml/min/m2, which corresponds to an O2 supply of 220 ml/min/m2. Finally, the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and an International Guideline on the Management of Major Cardiovascular Surgery both recommend a goal-directed perfusion (GDP) approach allowing a targeted optimization of the DO2 to 200-250 ml/min/m2 during CPB. Unfortunately, a 2017 Cochrane review failed to report any significant benefit in terms of morbidity or mortality. This failure is largely responsible for the lack of clinical use of GDP. In addition, the optimization of DO2 has remained difficult to implement, as DO2 is only available during CPB and is assessed using invasive techniques (such as the Pulse-CO) requiring an indwelling catheter (such as a pulmonary arterial). The goal of this study is to show the benefit of an automated algorithm to accurately predict and adapt DO2 according to patient needs during cardiac surgery under CPB. To do this, we will develop and validate the Oxygen Delivery Optimization Strategy (DO2-FOS), which is a non-invasive strategy to personalize and optimize the perfusion during routine cardiac surgery. In particular, we wish to investigate whether the DO2-FOS predicts cardiac surgery organ damage (ORAD). We aim to determine whether CPB optimization based on DO2-FOS is superior to traditional GDP. DO2-FOS is a patient-specific perfusion optimization module for CPB. It predicts individualized oxygen delivery (DO2) requirements from patient characteristics using machine learning algorithms and then aims to keep DO2 values constant at 220 ml/min/m2 throughout the CPB period.

The hypothesis is that the DO2-FOS algorithm can predict and optimize DO2 and that individual DO2 values optimized by DO2-FOS will therefore allow personalized management to achieve optimized perfusion of the body during CPB, thereby reducing organ damage.

Background. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) regulation during cardiopulmonary by-pass (CPB) is a subject of intense debate in the field of cardiac surgery. Previous studies showed that a low, medium or high MAP target during CPB (as compared to the “standard” MAP range of 50-60 mmHg) could be associated with different outcomes, in terms of tissue perfusion, cardiac function and postoperative complications. Previous studies also suggested that a high CPB MAP could be associated with poor outcomes during CPB, probably due to a worsening of the arterial baroreceptor reflex on the target organ (i.e. the heart or the brain). Despite these previous findings, in current cardiac surgery practices the MAP is usually modulated on the basis of the patient’s preoperative MAP (i.e. patient-tailored MAP regulation). In the present investigation we will compare different MAP target values during CPB (as compared to the patient-tailored one), in terms of the postoperative blood lactate peak values and other clinical outcomes. Study Aim. The primary aim of the present study will be to evaluate different values of MAP target during CPB, in terms of the peak value of the postoperative blood lactate measured via arterial blood gas. Study Design. This trial is a multicentric, randomized, controlled parallel groups trial. After enrolment, patients will be randomized to receive treatment according to one of the three following MAP target values: 1. 50-60 mmHg. 2. 70-80 mmHg. 3. Patient-tailored MAP values (calculated during the visit of pre-operative assessment), ranging between 50 and 60 mmHg. Study Population. Patients scheduled for elective cardiac surgery and standard CPB will be included and randomly assigned to a study group. Exclusion Criteria. The following conditions prevent patients from participating in the study: age < 18 years, age > 80 years, CPB procedure not feasible due to patient’s conditions, emergency cardiac procedures, isolated or combined mitral values surgery, aortic or mitral valve surgery necessitating hypothermic CPB arrest, inotropic/nitric-oxide support during CPB, preoperative mRS > 2, reoperative patients undergoing valve repair or prosthetic valve surgery (not due to endocarditis or prosthetic thrombosis), patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%, patients with mechanical aortic valve replacement, severe hepatic (Child-Pugh Class B/C) or renal impairment (as defined by the CKD-EPI equation), patients treated with intra-aortic balloon pump, patients with severe preoperative epilepsy, patients with cerebral arteriovenous malformation or intracranial aneurysm. Sample Size. A sample size of 148 patients will be enrolled (49 patients per study group, 93% of power with a Type I error α equal to 5%). This will be the minimum number of patients according to a superiority hypothesis, assuming that the standard group (i.e. the group of patients targeting the blood pressure around the patients’ preoperative MAP) will present a postoperative blood lactate peak value of 2.3 mmol/L (with a SD of 0,85 mmol/L), while the high group (i.e. the group of patients targeting a MAP value around 80 mmHg during CPB) will present a postoperative blood lactate peak values of 2 mmol/L (with a SD of 0,85 mmol/L). In the other case, according to a non-inferiority hypothesis, the standard group will present a postoperative blood lactate peak value of 2.3 mmol/L (with a SD of 0,85 mmol/L), while the low group (i.e. the group of patients targeting a MAP value around 50 mmHg during CPB) will present the same value, with a non-inferiority range of 0.25 mmol/L. The other value (2.55 mmol/L) will represent the higher acceptable cut-off. Study Outcomes. The primary outcome will be the peak value of the postoperative blood lactate measured via arterial blood gas, at CPB termination and up to 3 hours after the weaning from"

476,"What has been previously reported? 
In France, alcohol consumption is widespread despite a strong public health policy, 31% of men and 13% of women drink alcohol weekly, and 19% of men and 3% of women suffer from alcohol dependence. 
It is estimated that the consequences related to the health of individuals and society have a substantial financial price, up to 100 billion euros (World Health Organization, 2021). Despite this, more than half of problematic drinkers do not seek appropriate treatment, and even in patients seeking help, relapses occur in 50% of cases. 
Moreover, the young adult period is a sensitive period for onset of problematic alcohol use. The transition from adolescence to adulthood is characterized by new psychological and social factors, including autonomy, greater availability of drink and independence in the home, thus favoring binge drinking practices, which result in increased risks of developing AUDs. 
The main therapeutic methods for young people with alcohol problems include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) and contingency reinforcement. 
Several intervention strategies are known to improve short- and long-term outcomes. 
However, these strategies are still based on a face-to-face approach, which has limitations. The Covid-19 pandemic has highlighted that the use of digital technology is a promising way to overcome these limitations. 
The benefits of new technologies range from offering greater flexibility of schedules, allowing online use of various services (webinars, remote consultations or remote psychological support) to the possibility of collecting data by telephone or online as part of epidemiological research. 
What knowledge is expected to be gained from the study? 
In the literature, the effects of new technologies on reducing risky and excessive alcohol consumption in young people are not known. The primary objective of this randomized trial is to investigate the effect of a smartphone application aimed at university students with binge drinking habits by decreasing their consumption. The secondary objective is to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the application. 

Input Text: Safety and Immunogenicity of an Influenza Vaccine Administered Using Liquid Beads in Children From 3 to 12 Years of Age With Intramuscular Sensitivity
Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Liquid bead technology consists of attaching a fluorescent dye to a particle made of biodegradable polymers. After insertion in the musculature, this dye diffuses through the tissue in the first few hours, a phenomenon that is observed only in the case of intramuscular injection. This allows for a non-invasive demonstration of the injection. A clinical phase will be carried out with 3 groups of 150 participants from 3 to 12 years of age. The injection of influenza vaccine with conventional syringe in group 1, injection of the same vaccine with liquid bead technology in group 2 and in group 3 an injection of NaCl solution with liquid bead technology. At baseline and 24h following intramuscular injection, investigators will demonstrate the absence of intramuscular sensitivity for the 3 groups and for the same participants followed at 6 months after the second injection. The primary objective is the demonstration of safety and immunogenicity (evaluation of humoral and cellular immune responses) of the influenza vaccine administered with a bead technology and that there is no intramuscular sensitivity reported. The secondary objective is to determine the feasibility of introducing this non-invasive demonstration method into pediatric practice.

Developmental delays and regression during the second year of life are the most common initial symptoms of ASD, and these features differ based on the severity of the disease. This study aimed to investigate ASD risk factors, so the severity of the disease will be determined by investigating the child's history, current ASD symptom severity score, the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist (ATEC), and the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC).

Then this study aim to reveal the changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome. We chose to examine the fecal samples rather than stool samples to collect enough material from the patient. To explore metabolome changes in the feces, we selected the samples that had been preserved since the first day of the experiment. We used three types of stool samples taken in three different time points. The first sample to collect was the fecal sample from ASD children, and it was preserved using the OMNIgene kit. The second stool sample to collect was from non-autistic siblings in the same family where 3 samples will be taken from the non autistic sibling within three months, those stool samples will be used as control samples in this study. And the third stool sample to collect will be from the children's mothers, and it will be taken at the beginning of the experiment to evaluate the presence of any microbial dysbiosis. The study will be carried out on 20 ASD children from a specific autism center in Ain Shams University.

482,"OBJECTIVE: To compare the clinical performance of dual-cure (Fill-Up) and light-cure (QuiXfil and Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill) bulk-fill resin composites in Class II restorations in primary school children.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A split-mouth, randomized clinical trial was conducted at the Orthodontic Department of Alexandria University. The inclusion criteria were: good general health, unrestored Class II restorations in primary molars, no tooth mobility, and no evidence of caries and no visible cervical fractures in the study teeth. The exclusion criteria were: any evidence of a prior restoration or a caries lesion in the study teeth. Three Class II restorations filled with the three tested bulk-fill resin composites were performed in each child. The patients were divided into three groups; each group received one of the three tested bulk-fill resin composites. The teeth restoration was performed by a single clinician in approximately 15 seconds for each restoration, who assessed all of the restorative procedures. A 2-year clinical performance assessment was performed by three examiners using an evaluation form provided by the FDI Working Group. The clinical performance was assessed in five categories of the FDI evaluation criteria: esthetic properties, functional properties, and biological properties. The overall success rates and failure percentages of restorations were measured using the FDI criteria.RESULTS: Sixty-three patients were examined, with a total of 189 restored teeth, 84 in the Fill-Up group, 78 in the QuiXfil group, and 27 in the Tetric N-Ceram Bulk Fill group. All three of the tested materials showed similar success rates for restoring Class II lesions. High success rates were observed at 2 years for all criteria compared to the base line and at the first recall. There was a statistically significant difference favoring bulk-fill resins compared to the base line for the color matching of restorations (P<0.05). A statistically significant improvement in esthetic outcomes (P<0.05) also favored the use of bulk-fill resins.CONCLUSION: The new bulk-fill resin composites showed high clinical success rates for restoring Class II cavities after 2 years."

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The study aimed to examine the effects of a short exposure to a single dose of dexamethasone on organ and tissue-specific inflammatory processes in humans.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Dysregulation of inflammation and cortisol production is highly prevalent in many disease states, including metabolic, cardiovascular, or neurodegenerative diseases. An altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis has been shown to affect inflammation and vice versa. Glucocorticoids (GCs), such as cortisol, are a major player in the HPA axis and are known for their anti-inflammatory, immune-suppressing, anti-proliferative, and anti-apoptotic effects. In order to prevent undesired effects of GCs, drugs are often administered at low systemic concentrations, while achieving a high concentration at the target tissue. Recent investigations suggest that intramuscular (IM) injection of dexamethasone is a suitable method to achieve local anti-inflammatory effects without affecting the systemic levels of GCs in humans. The aim of this study is to understand the effects of this IM injection treatment on pro- and anti-inflammatory processes, as well as the expression of immune-specific markers in human tissues and body fluids. This knowledge could be used to develop novel anti-inflammatory therapies by targeting local inflammation and tissue-specific immune processes.

Among all the strategies to cope with exam stress, the use of techniques which involves controlled breathing and mental imagery seems highly effective. However, there are no studies that determine whether these techniques are more effective if students visualize, just before the exam, the situation of the exam and the sensations that they will probably experience.

The investigators will determine the time course of the regeneration process by performing immunohistochemistry and gene expression studies (at 1, 3, and 6 hours). Furthermore, the investigators will follow the transplanted lungs and compare differences on an organ level. The investigators hypothesize that adding HDF to EVLP is beneficial. With the development of EVLP, the investigator expects that there will be a greater understanding of the pathophysiology and pathology of transplanted lungs. Consequently, many more patients will have the chance to receive healthy organs."

497,"Aim of the Study
This study aimed to propose a novel calculation formula to accurately estimate meibum secretion.

Study Design
An observational cross-sectional study was designed.

Study subjects
In this study, all study subjects were consecutively recruited with informed consent from the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital in Linkou city, Taiwan, from January to December 2014, and enrolled in the study.

Examination
All study subjects underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examinations. In the dry eye assessment, both eyes were examined and clinical examination, non-invasive tear break-up time, Schirmer’s test of anesthesia and meibography were conducted by ophthalmologists with a master’s level of training. Meibography was performed with the meibomian gland imaging system (MGI-1, Lumenis, Israel) by using corneal anaesthesia and retro-illumination technique. An MGI image of the conjunctival part of the eyelids along the upper limbus was used to capture and record the eyelids with the meibography video system. Subjective symptoms were assessed with Ocular Surface Disease Index.

Clinical assessment
The clinical grading of meibomian glands (MGGs) was determined by using meibography. The MGI images were downloaded and evaluated by using the ImageJ software programme Version 1.48 (Bethesda, MD, USA). The horizontal axis of the image was calibrated with the width of the lateral canthal distance of each study subject. This width was measured by using the digital caliper with 0.01 mm precision. The images were then divided vertically into three parts. MGGs in the eyelid margins were graded according to the area of the MGs: Grade 1 (30% to 65% of MGs) with hyperpigmentation was presented with light brown, grade 2 (15% to 30%) with hyperpigmentation was presented with light yellow, and grade 3 (0% to 15%) with hypopigmentation was presented with white.

MGG grading using ImageJ analysis software
The meibography image of the upper eyelid was cropped into the area between the superior temporal canthus and the lateral canthus of each study eye. The image was scaled to a length of 10 mm that corresponded to the width of the lateral canthal distance. The MGG outline within the eye area was manually segmented. The MGG area ratio was then computed for whole eyelid.

WTW distance
The area of the white-to-white (WTW) distance was measured by using the digital caliper. The WTW length was calculated by multiplying the distance with the horizontal axis.

Statistical analysis
The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows, version 18.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). The results of the inter-methods test were presented as means and standard deviations (SD). The correlation analyses of the MGG area ratio for both calculation methods and the WTW distance of both calculation methods were presented by linear regression analysis.

499,"This study aims to determine the predictive ability of a panel of biomarkers in saliva in Healthy and Periodontally Affected Subjets, by analyzing the combination of inflammatory, immune and osteoclastogenic biomarkers in subjects at different periodontal health status (Periodontitis I & II, and III/ IV according to 2018 periodontal classification).

This is a cross sectional clinical study (pilot study) which will start with the inclusion of 140 subjects at different health stages regarding periodontal disease.

Study design: cross sectional clinical study, at the end of the study, each subject will be compared to the rest of the population to determine the sensitivity and positive and negative predictive values.

Methods: Subjects will visit the clinics at the Faculty of Dentistry, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki on a specific date and time. After performing the clinical periodontal status examination (according to the American Academy of Periodontology Standards 2002), saliva samples of 0.8-1.2 mL will be taken.

Saliva samples will be collected using a saliva collection cup and will be transported to the Department of Microbiology laboratories, where they will be stored at −80°C till further processing.

Six milliliters of blood will be sampled as well. The blood samples will be centrifuged in clinical testing kit (Roche Cobas c501/e602) according to the manufacturer’s instructions to prepare the serum fraction. The serum fraction will also be stored at −80°C until further analysis.

For periodontological status assessment, each subject will undergo clinical and standardized probing examination by a calibrated periodontist.

Biochemical and molecular analysis
The following proinflammatory, interleukin and osteoclastogenesis biomarkers in serum fraction or saliva:
1. C-reactive protein (CRP)
2. triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 (TREM-1)
3. interleukin (IL)-1beta
4. metalloproteinase (MMP)-8
5. IL-10
6. IL-6
7. monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1)
8. Macrophage Inflammatory Protein-1 Alpha (MIP-1)
9. interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma)
10. osteoprotegerine (OPG)
11. Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)
12. Tumor Necrosis Factor-Alpha (TNF-alpha)

Outcome
At the end of the study after evaluating the clinical data of the subjects and the data of the biomarkers levels, a panel of biomarkers will be created and will be included in the final model. The final model and the biomarkers levels will be tested to determine their performance in evaluating the periodontal health status of the subjects.

The final model should combine the data of these biomarkers to differentiate the above 4 categories. The results of this model will be used in predicting the periodontal health status of potential subjects.

502,"To compare the effectiveness of parent skills training programs offered by remote versus face-to-face training of staff, both of which are embedded in a larger, randomized clinical trial. Caregiver skills training (CST) is an empirically-based behavioral treatment for young children with ASD or other significant developmental disabilities. The CST program aims to increase positive emotional states, improve adaptive skills, and reduce challenging behaviors of children with ASD using a parent-mediated treatment model. In this study, we will utilize a quasi-experimental design in which one study group of caregivers will be taught by master trainers on-site at their primary program site, and another study group will be taught by master trainers remotely. Caregiver participation in the program requires a three-month time commitment; the duration and format of the CST program varies according to context, but includes core materials such as 12 group sessions, weekly individual parent meetings, and three in-home visits over the course of 3 months. Primary aims: Primary aim #1: To obtain preliminary effect size estimates of parent-child relationship, child behavior, and parent-child interactions from one group of caregivers receiving CST and another group of caregivers receiving child-focused care as usual. Primary aim #2: To replicate these effect size estimates from another group of caregivers receiving a different format of CST training (remote vs. face-to-face).

504,"During the past decade the use of Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy has increased exponentially, but evidence-based research supporting its use as treatment for a variety of neurological disorders is limited. We believe that hyperbaric oxygen therapy may play a role in the treatment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) for which no pharmacologic or behavioral therapy has been clearly established; additionally, there is currently no evidence-based method of improving verbal skills. The primary objective of this study was to assess the feasibility and potential efficacy of hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) to improve verbal scores in individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. A secondary research objective was to determine adherence to study procedures. This is a retrospective chart review to compare verbal scores of children diagnosed with ASD who received treatment with 100% O₂ with 2atm of pressure (ATA) for 60 minutes at 40 sessions for 3 months, with children that received Applied Behavior Therapy only. ASD subjects with available data from both VBMAPP and ABLLS were selected from a population of children ages 2 to 17 who underwent either treatment method from 1 January, 2013 to 4 September, 2017.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Intrinsic to the research plan is our objective to determine verbal performance of individuals with disabilities who are treated with HBOT to improve their verbal communication. In the past decade there has been an exponential increase in use of HBOT, although randomized evidence-based research supporting this treatment modality is still limited. The potential role for HBOT in autism has intrigued the medical community and been the subject of several published studies and reviews. These studies have shown some benefit of the therapy in a variety of autistic symptoms. In addition, the National Resource Center on ADHD and Autism reports hyperbaric oxygen therapy in the treatment of autism as an experimental treatment, although no specific evidence for its efficacy in autism spectrum disorder was mentioned. In ASD, communication is often delayed or lacking altogether; therefore, there is a critical need for treatment options that specifically aim to enhance communication skills. There is currently no published research to support use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy specifically to enhance verbal skills in individuals with ASD. Currently several studies are assessing whether HBOT can improve autism related symptoms. The potential role for HBOT in autism is attractive since it is noninvasive, safe, and relatively inexpensive and has the potential for broad benefits in the form of reduced seizure frequency, improved cognitive function, and improvement of sensory-related symptoms. However, the number of published clinical trials to investigate the effects of HBOT is limited, and its benefit remains to be clearly established as a valid treatment modality for ASD. Moreover, it is difficult to draw conclusions using published reviews of the literature due to limitations related to treatment protocols, study populations and settings, and outcome measures. While these studies suggest that HBOT may help improve some of the clinical signs related to ASD, none of the studies conducted have measured the effect of HBOT on verbal ability in a large cohort of subjects. The primary objective of this research is to assess the feasibility, adherence and potential efficacy of HBOT to improve verbal scores in individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder. A secondary research objective is to determine HBOT safety profile.

505,"Aims A prospective , randomised study was done to compare the analgesic efficacy of ultrasound guided 4-in-1 injection versus adductor canal injection in patients undergoing knee surgery under regional anesthesia. We aimed to compare the analgesic efficacy of 4-in-1 injection versus adductor canal block in patients undergoing knee surgery under regional anesthesia.
Study design, setting, population and method
The study was conducted on patients aged 20-60 years with ASA 1-2. Two groups were compared: adductor canal block group and 4-in-1 injection block group. Group 1 was compared to 60 patients who received adductor canal block in the operating theatre. The ultrasound-guided adductor canal block was performed at a point 1cm anterior to the femoral artery, deep to the sartorius muscle. A 20-G Touhy needle is inserted in-plane approach. If inadvertent arterial puncture occurs, there's no need to remove the needle. Instead, the needle is immediately withdrawn after visualising the needle tip deep to the sartorius and then the needle will be inserted again in the same position until the desired position is achieved. Group 2 was compared to 60 patients who received ultrasound-guided 4-in-1 block in the operating theatre. The 4-in-1 injection block was performed at the adductor hiatus where the descending genicular artery branches from the superficial femoral artery . A 20-G Touhy needle was inserted in the in-plane approach in the medial aspect of the thigh, superficial to sartorius muscle. After removing syringe, 30 ml of .25% of Bupivacaine including 4mg dexamethasone was injected. Intraoperative data, postoperative pain score (measuring in minutes, at rest, 20° hip extension and while knee bending with dorsiflexion of the foot) and postoperative dose requirements of analgesics were assessed in both groups. Sample size calculation was performed with 5% level of significance. Assuming 5% level of significance and power (1-beta error) of 80%, the minimal number of patients to be included in each group is 60. Data was analysed using the T-test for the continuous measurement and Chi-square test for categorical measures. p value <.05 is considered statistically significant for each measured group. Ethical committee approval, informed consent, adherence to Helsinki Declaration Ethical committee approval was obtained by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Medicine of Alexandria University (reference no: 100216). Patients who were indicated to undergo bilateral knee surgeries were approached and written consent was obtained from them. Statistical analysis: SPSS version 23 (IBM, USA) was used for the analysis. Results were expressed as mean (SD). The independent t-test was used to compare the means between two independent groups, The Chi-square test was used to compare between two and more independent groups. The P-value <0.05 is considered statistically significant. 

 Results 
The patients were randomized by the sealed envelope method. There were no significant differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients between the 2 groups ( Table 1). There was no significant difference in the duration of spinal anesthesia between the 2 groups as (P-value = 0.459). The onset of sensory block was faster in group 1 as compared to group 2 with ( P-value = 0.001) and was longer in group 1 (421 ±124.81 min) as compared to group 2 (405±106.67 min) with ( P-value = 0.029). Also, 4-in-1 block achieved higher total sensory score (TSS) as compared to the adductor canal block. There were no significant differences between the two groups with regard to the intraoperative and postoperative visual analog scale- (VAS) mean scores at the different time points ( Table 2):  Table 1: Comparison of Baseline data between the two group

506,"The investigators hypothesis is that axillary lymph node dissection causes obstruction of lymphatic drainage, with the result of chronic swelling. Therefore, immediate lymphatic reconstruction (ILR) can reduce or eliminate the risk of arm lymphedema (AL). The investigators have previously shown that patients who undergo ILR do not develop arm lymphedema, while patients who undergo only AL have a 5% risk of developing AL after 3 years.

This study is a randomized study to identify whether the risk of AL can be further reduced using ILR. To answer the hypotheses of this study, breast cancer patients who received axillary lymph node dissection will be recruited. They will be assigned to either a surgery with AL only, or a combined surgery with both ILR and axillary lymph node dissection. Follow-up will be conducted for two years after the surgery.

510,"Background
-----------------
The postpartum period is a time of heightened vulnerability for many parents, particularly for those with histories of adverse life experiences and/or mental health challenges. Rates of anxiety and depressive disorders in the first 2 weeks following childbirth are as high as 80% (Chiu, Chong, & Chow, 2010). Furthermore, anxiety and depressive symptoms in the postpartum period have been associated with increased parenting stress, poorer parent-child relationships, more negative parenting behaviors, and greater risk for parent-child conflict at a later developmental stage (Barth et al., 2013; Grigoriadis et al., 2017; Porterfield, McHale, Abidin, & Crouter, 2007; Shiver et al., 2013). Despite significant public health implications, effective interventions for postpartum mental health challenges remain limited, particularly as early targeted interventions during the postpartum period are key to improving the health and well-being of parents and children.
Prior studies have shown that psychodynamic therapy groups focusing on parental reflective functioning have been effective in improving mental health outcomes and parent-child relationships (Berger et al., 2016, 2014) and have been well-tolerated among mothers with perinatal mood and anxiety disorders (PMBs) (Berger et al., 2022; Drake & Geller, 2022). However, most studies have examined short-term outcomes, and few have evaluated the long-term effectiveness of parenting groups. The primary goal of the present study is to evaluate the efficacy of a 12-session parenting group on symptoms of postpartum anxiety, depressive symptoms, parenting stress, and relationships with and between caregivers and infants. Our central hypotheses are that: 
1) participation in the CARE parenting group will result in decreased levels of postpartum anxiety, depressive symptoms, and parenting stress.
2) CARE participation will result in greater improvements in parental reflective functioning, as well as in other therapeutic group processes, than would be expected based upon improvements in symptoms of perinatal mood and/or anxiety disorders alone.
3) CARE participation will result in improvements in the perceived quality of the parent-child relationship for both parents and caregivers.

Study Design
-----------------
We will use a prospective, single group design to determine the efficacy of short-term parenting group therapy as a treatment for postpartum mental health symptoms and parenting stress. Baseline assessments will occur in person at the Montefiore Women's Health Center in the Bronx at some point between 0 and two weeks prior to treatment initiation. As part of this visit, participants will be invited to participate in a 12-session CARE Group, after which post-treatment assessments will be conducted. Following enrollment in the group, participants may continue individual mental health care as their needs dictate, but all individual therapy providers are instructed to encourage CARE group participation as the primary treatment intervention. After the completion of treatment (i.e., after Sesson 12), participants will be given a summary report of the findings from their pre-treatment assessments, and will be asked to provide brief qualitative feedback about their experience in the group.

Study Population
-----------------
Participants will be recruited from among patients with perinatal mood and/or anxiety disorders who are actively receiving services at the Montefiore Women's Health Center, as well as patients who are referred for treatment in our outpatient women's mental health clinic at Montefiore Medical Center (MMC) in the Bronx. Eligibility criteria include: 
a) Birthing parent (age 18-70) of an infant born between 3 and 12 months prior to referral date; 
b) Current symptoms of postpartum depression or anxiety as evaluated by a trained provider on the basis of a brief screening (e.g., Beck Anxiety Inventory, Beck Depression Inventory, Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) or as documented in their medical record; 
c) Experience or willingness to disclose experiences of postpartum anxiety, depression, or psychosis; 
d) Willingness to participate in a group setting alongside a small number of other parents and to share their experiences of being a parent with their infant; 
e) English-speaking; and 
f) Ability to self-care and provide self-report data for all study measures.

513,"1 in 5 births results in poor maternal health outcomes for Black/AA women. Community doulas provide labor and postpartum supports that have been associated with fewer cesarian births, improved breast feeding rates and postpartum mental health. The investigators developed the BUNDLE intervention, which includes a two-fold integrated model of doulas and obstetric providers. The investigators hypothesize that BUNDLE intervention will reduce healthcare disparities and improve maternal health outcomes.

Brief Summary
................
Study Overview: This is a study that is trying to get to the bottom of why certain patients are more likely to be sick. The study will see if a new and different approach to care could improve the physical wellness and the pregnancy experience of pregnant people. As part of this study, each participant will be randomly assigned to either the BUNDLE group (which gets the new approach) or to the standard group (which receives usual care). The study also has many parts to it. For example, participants in the BUNDLE group might receive extra support from a doula (which is a birth helper). To make sure that the new approach to care works, the study will monitor health status of each participant during their pregnancy. Participants in each group will be monitored the same way; and follow up after delivery will also be the same in both groups This study will also include an ongoing community engagement component and several interviews to better understand the experiences of people with Black/AA backgrounds.

Detailed Description
................
Rationale: Nationally, Black/AA women experience higher healthcare disparities despite increased perinatal healthcare utilization, including lower rates of prenatal initiation, engagement with, and completion of, recommended healthcare, increased unplanned healthcare utilization with increased risks of adverse maternal outcomes. These disparities become even larger during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the continued need for tailored care to improve Black/AA maternal health outcomes (MHI). While many factors likely contribute to worse MHI for Black/AA persons, the investigators hypothesize that a main mechanism is medical mistrust. Specifically, medical mistrust leads to healthcare avoidance, exacerbating healthcare disparities. To date, the vast majority of studies on strategies to reduce medical mistrust have focused on the development and dissemination of educational curricula. While these interventions are promising and have been widely scaled, a critical factor which influences the effectiveness of educational interventions is cultural competency/awareness of provider and inter-cultural communication. This can be challenging if patients and providers do not belong to the same culture and/or speak the same language. Doulas are a unique group of healthcare workers who are focused on cultural competency, communication, and shared-decision making. Through these efforts, doulas are trained to offer emotional support, clinical coaching, and patient education. Previous studies have shown that the presence of doulas in clinical care can reduce rates of un-planned healthcare utilization, cesarean births, and improve patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes including improved breastfeeding initiation rates. AIM 1: Develop an integrated prenatal care model at F&MCW Health System using a co-creation design approach focused on building trust and improving MHI using: Six focus groups with 30 Black/AA birthing people (currently pregnant or recently postpartum) and 30 prenatal healthcare providers (obstetricians, midwives, doulas, social workers, prenatal care coordinators, nurses, mental health providers, and obstetric unit leaders) to elicit feedback on models of doula/medical provider integration with the overarching aim of building trust and improving MHI through tailored, culturally appropriate interactions A focus group pilot will be conducted to ensure successful recruitment of participants. To maximize engagement of diverse participants and stakeholders within the pilot, the investigators will use a semi-structured focus group guide. Four experienced facilitators will be trained in the use of virtual focus group technology and in focus group best practices (developing rapport, active listening). Given the potential sensitivity of some focus group topics (such as discrimination and/or abuse), the facilitators will ensure a high level of comfort for participants by setting ground rules focused on respect, confidentiality, and inclusion. In preparation for the focus groups, a Community Advisory Panel (CAP) will be convened to discuss potential barriers and facilitators to study implementation. Potential CAP members will be recruited prior to developing project-specific CAP charters, agendas, and materials. The aim of the CAP is to build collaborative and respectful relationships across all racial and ethnic identities. CAP meetings will be held regularly (at least quarterly) throughout the study and will include representation"

BACKGROUND: Low back pain (LBP) is a common problem that causes pain, impaired functional status and reduced quality of life. Various therapies have been used in the treatment of LBP, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), physical therapy and connective tissue massage therapy.OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare the effects of connective tissue massage, physical therapy with an emphasis on the thoracic region, and TENS on pain, functional status and quality of life in patients with chronic non-specific low back pain. METHODS: This was a 3-arm randomized controlled trial, parallel-group study with blind outcomes assessor. Ethical approval was obtained from the Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University Health Sciences Ethics Committee (09.01.2020, decision no: 4). Detailed information about the study was verbally provided to participants, and written informed consent was obtained. The study adhered to the ethical principles of the Helsinki Declaration. The study design adhered to the CONSORT guidelines for rigorous reporting.11 After obtaining consent and confirming the inclusion criteria, a convenience sample of 30 participants was equally and randomly divided into three groups: the CTM group (n=10), CM group (n=10), and control group (n=10). Randomization was carried out by an independent physical therapist, who was not involved in the assessment or treatment of the participants, 1 hour before the baseline measurements. The randomization process involved using opaque and sealed envelopes, each containing a group allocation number generated from a computer-generated random number table. Block randomization was employed to ensure an equal distribution of participants across the groups. All treatment sessions were administered by the same investigator (C.D) in the study group. The intervention duration was uniform across all groups: 4 consecutive weeks, with 3 sessions per week lasting 15-20 minutes per session. Outcome measurements were taken at the beginning and 4 weeks after the completion of the program. An independent physiotherapist, unaware of the research details and participant groupings, conducted the evaluations.RESULTS: A total of 30 participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: the connective tissue massage (CTM) group (n=10), the physical therapy group with an emphasis on thoracic (n=10), and the transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) group (n=10). At the 4-week post-treatment follow-up, significant improvements were observed in all groups in terms of pain, functional status and quality of life. Compared to the control group, both the CTM group and the physical therapy group with an emphasis on thoracic significantly improved in terms of pain reduction, functional status and quality of life (p<0.05). The improvement observed in the CTM group was greater than that observed in the physical therapy group with an emphasis on thoracic. Overall, these findings suggest that connective tissue massage therapy is an effective therapeutic modality for management of non-specific low back pain."
516,"Glaucoma is the second leading cause of blindness with approximately 3 million people affected in the US and a prevalence that increases with age. The primary focus of glaucoma treatment is to lower intraocular pressure (IOP), the pressure of the eye's fluid. In glaucoma, ocular fluid is unable to drain as it should and this can potentially damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. There are numerous therapies available today that lower IOP in the eye, but as a whole they are not satisfying; their main downside is that the majority of medications are either ineffective or have significant systemic side effects.
As a result, many glaucoma patients are prescribed multiple medications simultaneously, creating a more unpleasant and expensive regimen for the patient. Glaucoma is a permanent and irreversible condition that requires lifelong monitoring with an eye care professional. Sometimes additional treatment is required.
The purpose of this study is to: · Determine the differing pressure lowering effects between OMNI canaloplasty alone versus when combined with HYDRUS microstent. Both
surgical study devices are widely used by themselves in conjunction with cataract surgery. While many surgeons have begun combining the two procedures, this will be one of the first studies to randomize (assign by chance) one eye to OMNI canaloplasty alone and the other eye to OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS stent and report the results after one year.

518,"6.3 million Americans aged 50+ are at increased risk for colorectal cancer. Although there are established guidelines for screening and prevention, up to 30 percent of screening and surveillance colonoscopy patients cancel their procedure. Patient cancellation can lead to a loss of insurance coverage and in some cases, this leads patients to delay their next screening or surveillance colonoscopy. Thus, a significant obstacle in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening and prevention is patient noncompliance/cancellation. Patients often forget important details about CRC screening like the colonoscopy appointment date or time. The primary purpose of this RCT is to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of Annie, a novel text message intervention designed to improve colonoscopy preparation and increase CRC screening adherence. The study results may help design larger RCTs with the goal to create a preventive/educational colonoscopy intervention that can be easily integrated into medical practices. This pilot RCT (with IRB approval) hopes to recruit up to 100 cancer-free veterans from the Greater Los Angeles Veterans Affairs Healthcare System (VA). Participants will be randomized to one of two groups and followed for 14 days. The experimental arm will receive text messages, which will be sent starting 7-14 days before and until the day of the colonoscopy procedure and will contain motivational and instructional text messages. The control arm will not receive any text messages. The investigators hypothesis is that Annie helps improve colonoscopy preparation, reduces the rate of procedure cancellation, and increases patient compliance for a subsequent repeat screening colonoscopy."
519,"1. Research question : The research question is : What is the intrauterine vacuvity rate after a hysteroscopy for trophoblastic retention ? We hypothesize to : Hysteroscopy with aspiration of the trophoblastic retention.2. Type of the study : Randomized trial in parallel, open label.3. Population : Female adult patients (18-42), able to give free informed consent and affiliated or beneficiary of a Health Insurance Scheme, affected by a trophoblastic retention after spontaneous miscarriage at 6-14 weeks of amenorrhea (WAMA), undergoing the surgical management of trophoblastic retention in one of the 12 participating centers, with a planned pregnancy. Trophoblastic retention will be diagnosed at the endovaginal ultrasound. Patients not affiliated or beneficiary of a Health Insurance Scheme will not be eligible. Patients not affiliated or beneficiary of a Health Insurance Scheme will not be eligible. Patients who have already received surgical treatment for their current intrauterine retention will not be eligible. Patients will be included in the study on the morning of the surgery, after verification of the selection criteria. Eligible patients will be presented by medical personnel before being informed about the study. In the event of non-acceptance, other patients will be approached until the recruitment target is reached at each participating center. A signed consent to participate will be required for each patient.4. Recruitment criteria : Inclusion criteria : Trophoblastic retention after spontaneous miscarriage (<14 weeks of amenorrhea) Patient with an intrauterine pregnancy in mind Diagnozed by endovaginal pelvic ultrasound Pregnancy desire Shared decision for surgical management Current pregnancy desire Exclusion criteria : Known uterine malformation Patient who has already received surgical treatment for current intrauterine retention Gestational age >14 weeks at the time of the operation Pregnancy obtained by medically assisted procreation Indication for emergency surgical management for haemostatic purposes Failure to obtain free, informed and written consent after a period of reflection Person not affiliated or beneficiary of a national health insurance system Person protected by law, under guardianship or curatorship Person participating in other interventional research involving the human person5. Main outcome : Uterine vacuvity rate (vacuum rate) after hysteroscopy Patients will be recruited in study visit 1 and followed in visit 2 (+/- 7 days). Visit 1 will be performed in the day of surgery. An ultrasound and a pelvic scan will be performed, including a trans-perineal endo-vaginal probing of the uterine cavity, to confirm the diagnosis of trophoblastic retention. An HCG measurement will be performed before hysterosonography to confirm that there is no current pregnancy. An endometrial biopsy could be performed depending on the centre. A speculum examination will then be performed to ensure no significant bleeding requiring emergency surgical management. This is a pre-operative consultation. The patient will be operated in a gynecology department in a university hospital. The type of anesthesia will be decided by an anesthetist in accordance with the standards of the center. Trophoblastic retention, with or without endometritis, will be treated by hysteroscopy using a curette. Aspiration or resection of the retained gestational sac will be performed, and the specimen will be sent for microscopic and / or histological analysis and examination. To this end, the patient will be hospitalized for an average of 24 hours, depending on the standard operating procedure of each center. Before the procedure, the appearance of the uterine cavity will be described. The selected design product will be resected from top to bottom using the surgical resector, without electrical energy, as this method is known to be the most protective of the endometrium in previous studies. Electric current should be used only as a last resort, in cases where the selected design cannot be removed without it. Bleeding may occur, which can be treated using electrical energy. Hysteroscopy should be performed by a gynecological surgeon. A rigid or flexible cannula can be used. Antibiotic prophylaxis, the diameter of the cannula used, the cervical preparation required, and the use of intraoperative ultrasound guidance will be left to the discretion of the operator and the standard practice of the center.

This study is a test of the hypothesis that humans can make adaptive choices, across multiple timescales, and that the ability to use multi-timescale inferences to solve a problem is related to the capacity to make adaptive choices in laboratory experiments. Understanding the capacity of humans to solve complex multi-timescales problems could be useful in other contexts, including economics, psychology, and environmental conservation.

521,"1.5% of the world’s population live with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Dementia and subsequent AD is a major public health burden with high cost and morbidity, and with limited efficacious pharmacological treatment. Sleep disturbance is extremely common in dementia, with significant burden to the person with dementia, their partner and the health care system (Aylward et al., 2009; Pigeau et al., 2008; Ritchie et al., 2000; White et al., 2005). Insomnia is also a common co-morbid condition and there are no current treatment guidelines and few treatment options for people with dementia. This is because the traditional pharmacological treatments for insomnia, like Benzodiazepines, Zolpidem and other sedatives, have significant risks in older adults, and can worsen dementia and are no longer recommended for elderly people (American Academy of Sleep Medicine, 2005, 2015; Chesson, 2004). 
2. Insomnia in adults with early onset dementia (i.e. early 1990s Alzheimer’s Disease Research Centre (ADRC) criteria) is common and causes significant burden to this patient population. However, there is limited clinical research to show what treatments are safest and most efficacious in these patients. To bridge this research gap, this study will serve as a pilot project to inform a larger study of the safety and efficacy of the sleep medication Lemborexant for patients with insomnia and dementia. 
3. This will be an N of 1 trial for adults with early onset dementia and insomnia. While this trial is designed for a particular patient case the investigators anticipate that there may be opportunities in the future for this N of 1 trial to be redeployed additional times to other adults living with early onset dementia. 
4. The proposed study design for this N of 1 trial will build on the recently published guidelines for the clinical conduct of an N of 1 design in practice, in order to ensure that rigour, transparency and replicability are assured. This design will also ensure that the study will meet ethical research standards and will be in a format that is familiar to the potential patients, who are often reluctant study participants. 
5. Study Procedures: Patients identified to have early onset dementia and insomnia by a co-investigator during routine patient care will be considered for the N of 1 trial. The patient and proxy will meet with the other co-investigator who will review the study objectives and risks and benefits with the patient and other relevant caregivers. There will be a discussion of risks and benefits and the consent form will be reviewed. There will be an invitation for the patient to provide informed consent. Given that the study will include people living with dementia and cognitive impairment investigators will ensure that a caregiver or substitute decision maker (if applicable) will participate in these discussions as well. Once informed consent with support from the substitutes decision maker when appropriate is obtained the patient will be considered enrolled in the study and will be provided with (1) study medication and (2) study reporting tool. 
6. (1) Study medication will be provided for an 8 week period. Medications will be dispensed in a sequence where each letter represents 7 days of treatment (A represents placebo, Bi represents lemborexant 5mg, and B represents lemborexant 10 mg). This doubly counterbalanced design to defends against both linear secular trends and nonlinear trends. Medications will be provided in 7 day packs (plastic or cardboard dosette) marked to correspond to the assigned treatment weeks and assigned as follows. Week 1 = placebo Week 2 = lemborexant 5mg Week 3 = lemborexant 10 mg Week 4 = placebo Week 5 = lemborexant 10 mg Week 6 = placebo Week 7 = placebo Week 8 = lemborexant 10 mg Medications will be placed inside an opaque capsule to minimize the difference in appearance for the active and inactive treatments. There will be no washout time between treatment periods (For practical purposes, washout periods may not be necessary when treatment effects (e.g., therapeutic half-lives) are short relative to the length of the treatment periods. Since treatment half-lives are often not well characterized and vary among individuals, the safest course may be to choose treatment lengths long enough to accommodate patients with longer"
522,"This is a prospective, double-blinded, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial that was conducted at seven clinical rheumatology centers in Jiangsu Province, China. 698 outpatients were followed up and assessed from May 2019 to June 2021.

Unable to carry out MRI research or cannot understand the instructions in paper form or spoken Chinese. 
Pregnancy, or unable to accept all the follow-up visits required by the protocol. Participants with a body mass index (BMI) of ≥40 kg/m2. 
Extracorporeal circulation (ESA) blood products (red cell concentrates, platelet concentrates, and cryoprecipitates) or whole blood containing blood products are unavailable at home or at work. 
Participants with a BMI of ≥40 kg/m2. The screening and treatment process had strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and in the end, a total of 698 OA patients were enrolled in the study and randomly assigned to two groups. 
The baseline of the participants in the intervention group and the control group was comparable. The participants included 498 patients with bilateral osteoarthritis of the knee (475 patients were enrolled in the study at the end of the follow-up period) and 118 patients with unilateral knee osteoarthritis (96 patients were enrolled in the study at the end of the follow-up period).
During the treatment phase, one 40 mL injection will be given once every 4 months, a total of four injections; in the follow-up phase, two 40 mL injections will be given once every four months, a total of two injections. The MRI and functional assessments of the patients in the intervention group and the control group were performed within 7 days of the first injection, and the second MRI and functional assessments were conducted 6 months after the first injection. During the follow-up period, there were two 40 mL injections (for comparison with baseline). The investigators collected clinical data at the baseline time point, three months after the first injection, six months after the first injection, 12 months after the first injection, 18 months after the first injection, and 24 months after the first injection.
Primary clinical endpoint: total WOMAC score change in six months
Secondary clinical endpoint: The change of tibial cartilage volume in six months
Safety clinical endpoint: The change of serum ALT, AST, γ‐GTP in six months.
For patients who develop adverse reactions, the relationship between adverse reactions and the use of drugs will be analyzed and reported.
In the end, all data will be double entered by Microsoft excel by two researchers independently. All unanswered data, errors or omissions will be reviewed and corrected by the two researchers. The two datasets are compared and analyzed by SPSS 24.0 software, and if the result is not similar, it needs to be re-determined."
523,"The study purpose is to analyze the effect of virtual reality exercise on the respiratory muscle strength of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis on oxygen flow capacity and respiratory function. During virtual reality exercises, the subjects are expected to perform tasks in the virtual environment (e.g., shooting, hitting targets), while breathing. The study will include 20 patients with IPF. In the first phase, the subjects will be evaluated in terms of respiratory function tests and their strength on a pulmonary rehabilitation day. In the second phase, a 4-week training protocol will be implemented with virtual reality exercises. In the last phase, the subjects will be evaluated in terms of respiratory function tests and strength assessments. The study will be implemented by one researcher. It is expected that the results of the study will contribute to the development of research by providing data that will contribute to the effectiveness of rehabilitation.

529,"Seventy-five patients diagnosed with a form of dementia other than Alzheimer's Disease were recruited based on a clinical diagnostic process following the NINDS-AIREN criteria. Following written informed consent, patients were randomised to either of two pharmacological treatment studies. The group receiving donepezil received a daily oral dose of donepezil 5mg, increased to 10 mg after 6 months. The placebo-randomised group received a daily matching dose of placebo until the end of treatment after 6 months.

Gentle Prompts for Dementia Study (GentPrompt) was conducted as a collaboration by the University of New South Wales Faculty of Medicine and the Kolling Institute, in conjunction with The University of Sydney and UTS. The study was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees at the Royal North Shore Hospital (X12-012), the Western Sydney Local Health District (HREC/13/WMEAD/2), and the NSW Department of Planning and Infrastructure Department of Water Catchment Science Authority (14-11). The study design and protocol have been published (O'Neill and White, 2015; O’Neill et al, 2016), and have been reviewed by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Agency, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), and the American Food and Drug Administration.

=================
Donepezil: The group receiving donepezil received a daily oral dose of 5mg donepezil, increased to 10 mg after 6 months. The placebo-randomised group received a daily matching dose of placebo until the end of treatment after 6 months. The study had two parallel arms: 1) those eligible for pharmacological treatment, and 2) those for whom pharmacological treatment was not deemed appropriate. Those in the latter group were eligible for non-pharmacological treatment of behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), including cognitive stimulation therapy, with the focus on maintaining activity/function, social interaction, and maximising cognitive resources. In the donepezil group, treatment lasted 12 months for those with Alzheimer’s Disease, and a year from baseline for other forms of dementia. Clinical visits were monthly for the first six months, and then every two months for the remainder of the study. Compliance was assessed using pill counts performed at all study visits.

Myofibrillation is the phenomenon that the muscle fibers of patients with rapid injection of succinylcholine twitch and are sometimes accompanied by muscle pain and discomfort. Myofibrillation usually lasts for about 45 seconds to 1 minute, but some cases may also last up to several minutes. At present, the incidence rate of myofibrillation is 1%-5% in patients whose age range is 18-45 years old under rapid injection of succinylcholine. But for patients whose age is older than 45 years old, myofibrillation will definitely occur.

Background Data indicate that carotid atherosclerotic plaques contain a variety of environmental pollutants, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, and ethylbenzene, which may be involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Plastic particles are omnipresent in the environment and have been identified in a wide range of organisms and tissues, including patients with carotid artery stenosis. It is not known whether the presence of microplastics within human atherosclerotic plaques alters their composition, and this study aims to compare the levels of inflammation, and other components, between atherosclerotic plaques containing microplastics vs plaques without. The investigators hypothesize that plaques containing microplastics have more stable features. This study aims to assess whether environmental pollutants are detectable in the lipid core of human carotid atherosclerotic plaques, and whether their presence contributes to the development or progression of cardiovascular disease, through the activation of mechanisms associated with plaque stability such as inflammation and neoangiogenesis. Methods Patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis will be enlisted in the study and undergo carotid endarterectomy. The lipid core of atherosclerotic plaques will be analysed for the presence and the amount of microplastics through transmission electron microscopy. The expression of inflammatory markers and genes involved in plaque stability, i.e. MMP-9 and collagen, will be examined through immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and Western Blot. Study outcomes As primary outcome, the investigators will compare the composite outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality in those with vs those without microplastics within their carotid atherosclerotic plaques. Study status Currently recruiting, expected completion April 2025. Expected results The investigators hypothesize that patients with carotid plaques containing pollutants have an increased risk of ischemic cardiovascular events that occurs after a variable time frame, and that this risk may be mediated by chronic inflammation and plaque vulnerability. Study impact The identification of pollutants, and more in general of novel environmental risk factors, within carotid plaques may lead to the development of novel therapeutic and preventive strategies, with implications also for other cardiovascular diseases for which atherosclerosis is an important underlying cause.

537,"1 in 20 Danes have a diagnosed alcohol use disorder. More than 50% are underestimating their risk of developing liver disease. Even though alcohol-related liver disease is one of the most common types of liver diseases, these patients often remain undiagnosed. A liver stiffness measurement (LSM) is used to diagnose liver fibrosis. This is the first step in detecting alcohol-related liver disease. Studies have shown that a liver stiffness measurement is a safe, easy, non-invasive to carry out. The sensitivity of detecting alcohol-related liver disease by using LSM is nearly 70%. As part of their treatment for alcohol use disorder, the participants are in contact with the research community. Therefore, the aim of this study is to detect liver fibrosis in this population. We hypothesize that this population will benefit from having a liver stiffness measurement as a part of the follow-up after treatment for alcohol use disorder. The trial is conducted at two Danish outpatient clinics. The participants randomized to the intervention arm receive a liver stiffness measurement. The participants randomized to the control arm receive a screening with alcohol-related liver disease by doing blood samples. The trial will evaluate the feasibility, acceptance, and implementation to perform LSM as a part of the follow-up of patients with alcohol use disorder, and the prevalence of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis."

Input Text: Gastric Cancer Resection Trial

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Gastric cancer is the most common cancer in Taiwan, where it is the second leading cause of cancer death. The incidence of gastric cancer in Taiwan has been declining in recent years. However, gastric cancer in Taiwan is still prevalently located in the upper-third of the stomach. The standard surgery for gastric cancer today is a total gastrectomy, in which the whole stomach, including the gastroesophageal junction, is removed. Anastomosis is performed to reconstruct the esophago-intestinal continuity. Despite its low mortality rate, total gastrectomy and its extensive reconstruction are associated with significant morbidity. It could lead to numerous post-surgical complications, such as the formation of a fistula and the development of leaks, in addition to poor quality of life (QOL) and unsatisfactory aesthetic outcomes. Patients may suffer from vomiting, anorexia, and severe dehydration (sometimes requiring re-hospitalization) over the next 2-3 years following surgery. Furthermore, total gastrectomy has also been related to various long-term gastrointestinal sequelae such as bile reflux esophagitis, severe heartburn, esophageal dysmotility, poor sleep quality, food intolerance, and the development of gastrointestinal strictures. Hence, there have been a series of trials to investigate the feasibility and safety of other modalities including subtotal gastrectomy and endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) for the treatment of gastric cancer. With the advancement of surgical technique, subtotal gastrectomy is now considered a viable alternative to total gastrectomy with the help of improved laparoscopic surgical technique and enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols. Laparoscopy allows for superior visibility, better ergonomics of the surgeon, and a more direct approach to the lymph nodes, all of which are important in oncologic surgeries. Although several studies have shown that laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy is as effective as and has the same complication rates as traditional open subtotal gastrectomy, no study has yet compared the two surgical modalities. Concurrently, gastric ESD is currently the most common endoscopic treatment for early-stage gastric cancer. It is usually reserved for gastric tumors that measure less than 2 cm in size or have no high-risk features. ESD is a better option than endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) because it provides superior en bloc resection rates, particularly in the absence of high-grade dysplasia or submucosal invasion, leading in lower recurrence rates. Therefore, the current study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of laparoscopic subtotal gastrectomy and laparoscopic total gastrectomy for early gastric cancer. In addition, the present study will also investigate the difference of complication rates and the quality of life between the two procedures.

Detailed Description
-----------------
The majority of local and worldwide guidelines for the management of gastric cancer use the Japanese gastric cancer treatment guidelines (JGCO) as the gold standard. The Japanese treatment guidelines for gastric cancer (JGCO) and the Western Oncology Guidelines (ESGD) both emphasize the utilization of laparoscopy for distal and proximal gastric resections"

Abstract:
Background: To assess the efficacy of 1.2‐O‐Ethyl‐beta‐1,3‐dioxygenyl‐beta‐1,3‐dioxido‐beta‐1,3‐dioxo‐2,3‐dihydro‐2‐isopropylidene‐5-(methoxymethyl)-5‐methyl‐6-(tertbutyldimethylsilyl)oxy cyclohexa‐2,5‐dien‐1‐one (ODD), for inducing labour.Methods: ODD was given randomly at two doses to 152 women with singleton pregnancies at term and not having any previous contractions. Out of 152 women, 68 patients were in the control group where 1 drop of 1-2 mg of ODD was administered to 76-79 women. Odds ratios were calculated to measure the efficacy of 1.2-O-Ethyl-beta-1,3-dioxygenyl-beta-1,3-dioxido-beta-1,3-dioxo-2,3-dihydro-2-isopropylidene-5-(methoxymethyl)-5-methyl-6-(tertbutyldimethylsilyl)oxy cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one (ODD), for inducing labour. Results: Women in the ODD and control groups had similar characteristics. The cervical dilations in both the ODD and control groups within 6 hours of administration were similar. Cervical dilations were more in ODD group than control group within 24 hours of administration were comparable. Duration of 1st and 2nd stage, time of delivery and mode of delivery were not statistically different between the ODD and control groups. Conclusion: We concluded that 1.2‐O‐Ethyl‐beta‐1,3‐dioxygenyl‐beta‐1,3‐dioxido‐beta‐1,3‐dioxo‐2,3‐dihydro‐2-isopropylidene‐5-(methoxymethyl)‐5‐methyl‐6-(tertbutyldimethylsilyl)oxy cyclohexa-2,5-dien-1-one (ODD) did not improve the induction of labour."

543,"In general practice, primary care physicians (PCP) receive few instructions from the public health system on how to deal with their patients who suffer from a persistent cough (PCC) and are frequently prescribed antibiotics by their PCP. Nevertheless, it is widely agreed that some PCC may be considered antibiotic-appropriate (ie, PCC treated with a well-indicated treatment course) or that PCC does not require any antibiotics at all. We hypothesize that the management of PCC in primary care is influenced both by patient-reported information and by clinical practice recommendations, where the latter are frequently ignored by PCP and replaced by their own personal preferences. Hence, by performing a randomized controlled trial within 48 primary care practices throughout Germany, we aim to evaluate the influence of 4 types of informational interventions on the prescription rates of different antimicrobials or non-antimicrobial drugs for PCC by PCP. We anticipate that the interventions will be more effective in practices where patients provide PCC-related information before the consultation with the PCP. It is also expected that antibiotic prescriptions will be more often indicated for children, women, non-native German speakers or patients older than 50 years, whereas they are less likely to be beneficial for patients with an infection at a non-respiratory area or who have a history of antibiotic prescriptions for PCC.

544,"100 million people in the world have Dry Eye (DE) symptoms , 10% of which were diagnosed with dry eye. It is characterized by multiple complex clinical mechanisms. It is primarily caused by meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) or meibomian gland hypofunction (MGH). The meibomian glands are modified sebaceous glands located in the eyelid and discharge oily secretions onto the ocular surface. With the increase in age and the presence of other systemic diseases, MGD patients will experience a progressive obstruction of the meibomian gland duct. Furthermore, the meibum produced from the meibomian gland is altered. In addition to DE-related clinical signs, meibum dysfunction is also commonly seen in this clinical state. Management of DE with IPL in combination with DQS 1 drop 6 times/per day for 4 weeks have been shown to improve meibomian gland function and enhance gland secretion.

551,"The aim of research is to evaluate the therapeutic effect of adding letrozole to the protocol of combined treatment of cesarean scar pregnancy (CSP). The study was conducted on 141 women with CSP. Informed and written informed consent of patients to participate in the research was obtained. There was a comparison of two groups. Both groups included women treated with a single dose of 100 mg methotrexate (MTX) intravenously and 50 mg MTX in intra-amniotic injection (day 0), along with 30 mg potassium chloride in case of positive fetal heartbeat (FH). The group with letrozole addition was treated additionally with 5 mg letrozole orally (from day 0) for 10 days. Blood parameters (B-hCG, hemoglobin, total blood count, creatinine, urea, alanine/aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, bilirubin) were tested on days 0,4,7, and every 7 days until surgery. After obtaining satisfactory decrease in B-hCG and POC vascularization, women underwent hysteroscopic evacuation of POC. Among all enrolled women, 81 (57.34%) were treated according to the protocol with letrozole. After statistical analysis, no significant differences between letrozole and comparator groups were found. Both groups were comparable according to: age (years) (p=0.157), number of previous CSPs (p=0.200) parity (parous/nulliparous) (p=1.000), positive FH (p=0.184), volume of products of conception (p=0.286) day 0 B-HCG concentration (p=0.131). There were no significant differences in blood parameters. The time interval required to reach the criteria for surgical treatment was significantly shorter in the comparator group than in the letrozole group (11.53 ± 1.46 in the comparator group vs. 20.00 ± 1.80 in the letrozole group) (p=0.000). Patients from the comparator group had less bleeding during the procedure (p=0.00), and the incidence of blood transfusions was significantly lower in this group (p=0.000) compared to the letrozole group. The conversion rate was significantly less in the comparator group (p=0.00). No differences between the groups were observed in the frequency of POC evacuation by hysteroscopic technique (laser vs. forceps). Statistically significant differences were found in the cost of hospitalization. The cost of hospitalization in the comparator group was significantly lower than that in the letrozole group (p=0.000)."
552,"3-step procedure, consisting of 1: recovering blood from the liver donor during organ procurement; 2: processes donor blood to Red Blood Cells (RBC) units; 3: transfuses donor blood to recipients who require blood support. We intend to adopt the use of donor blood to avoid major blood products shortage from donation blood centers during the Covid-19 emergency.

Study design/methodology
=================
Single center, feasibility pilot study in patients undergoing liver transplant. Patients were assigned to the study group (patients managed according to the intervention) and to the control group (patients managed according to the standard of care). The intervention was the use of blood from the liver donor during organ procurement, processed and transfused to liver transplant recipient during the intraoperative. 
1) Recovery of liver donor blood through the continuous autotransfusion system CATSmart (Fresenius Kabi); the maximum quantity permitted for processing up to 4 units (800 mL each) of blood with the CATSmart system. 
2) Processing of donor lymphoid RBCs units by leukoreduction and pathogen inactivation (P-I), with a CATSmart set up of a standard (60°C for 2 hours); 
3) Administration of donor lymphoid RBC units by transfusion to the recipient during liver transplantation, on the basis of the hematocrit level (at the end of the operative procedure and the start of hemodynamic stability) as established by standard practice of the transfusion unit. The primary endpoint of the study was the number and percentage of liver transplant recipients successfully transplanted with internal donors, who received donor RBC concentrates for the intraoperative transfusion support; to evaluate the intraoperative availability of autologous RBC units, according to the usual practice of blood donation centers; to evaluate the rate of graft failure in enrolled patients; finally to perform a cost analysis comparing total costs during the surgical procedure in patients receiving autologous RBC units with respect to a control series."
553,"200 children and 50 adults, patients with asthma, were included in the study. They were divided into the control group (100 in each age group of children and adults) and the test group (150 in each age group of children and adults). The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of supplementation for 12 months on the incidence of symptoms of upper and lower respiratory tract diseases (LRTD). The children had similar symptoms in both age groups (P >0.05), but the symptoms were more pronounced in adult patients than in children. In both age groups, the patients who received the supplement showed a significantly lower incidence of symptoms than in the control group (P<0.05). The incidence of symptoms was significantly lower in the test group than in the control group before and after intervention. The incidence of all symptoms increased with the duration of the treatment, but the difference was statistically significant only for some symptoms (P<0.05); however, in both age groups, the symptoms were less pronounced in the test group than in the control group. The effect of supplementation on the incidence of bronchial asthma (BA) symptoms in children and adults was similar to that on the incidence of all symptoms (P <0.05). A dose-response relationship was found for supplementation; the lower the dose of the supplement, the lower the incidence of symptoms (R2=0.97; p<0.0001). An increase in the frequency of BA exacerbations was found in both age groups of patients (p<0.05); however, the frequency of exacerbations was lower in the test group than in the control group (p<0.05). Supplementation reduced the symptoms of LRTD, but did not have a significant effect on the frequency of BA exacerbations.

If a ROL is identified, they will be invited to undergo contrast-enhanced stereotactic breast biopsy (CESB). The current protocol specifies an upper threshold of 18 biopsies. However, data is currently not available about the amount of tissue actually needed for obtaining a reliable histopathological diagnosis using CESB. An important question that needs to be answered is: how many biopsies do we really need? The main objective is to determine the minimum amount of tissue required by CESB, based upon the cumulative diagnostic yield and biopsies performed. In addition, we would like to establish the various histopathological outcomes, the complication rate, and patient comfort using a VAB/CEM for detection and biopsy."

1. A constant Dbic 35 mmol/L
2. Dbic 35 mmol/L for the first two hours followed by 30 mmol/L for the remainder of the treatment
3. Dbic 30 mmol/L for the first 2 hours followed by 35 mmol/L later.

The three treatment variations are conducted as part of the standard haemodialysis treatment of patients during single week period with a washout period in between. Blood and dialysate acid-base and uremic solute levels are measured in accordance with applicable recommendations during the treatments.

562,"1) We expect to find a potential significant effect of a combined intervention, based on the administration of a noninvasive transcranial direct current stimulation of the left DLPFC in combination with a metacognitive treatment for depression. The tDCS administration will be accompanied by a training on Attention Training involving tasks of recognition of negative affective faces. If the study is positive, it will support the hypothesis that combining tDCS and MCT can increase the efficacy of psychotherapy in unipolar major depressive disorder and other mental disorders for which, within psychotherapy, MCT is currently considered a first-line treatment. The experimental results could represent the scientific ground for a multimodal approach, of high interest and application value, and can contribute to shorten psychotherapy waiting lists and to improve the outcomes of the treatment of mental disorders. 2) We expect to provide an innovative and multifaceted approach to the study of the neural correlates of psychological treatment, with TMS-EEG. The use of combined TMS and electroencephalography procedures is a relevant innovation, that can open new avenues in the study of neuroplasticity, since it is not possible to achieve the high temporal resolution of EEG with other techniques, and is more comfortable and less time-consuming for patients, as EEG recording is performed directly in the chair, without additional movements or discomfort. 3) The EEG examination can document changes in the spontaneous oscillations of cortical activity, but also variations in the cortical response as a function of the application of the tDCS technique, and of its association with psychotherapy. The results of the EEG examination may support the neurophysiological underpinnings of the hypothesized potential of tDCS administration as a strategy to potentiate the effect of psychotherapy.

564,"1. Rationale: Cognitive impairment (CIP) in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) subjects with undetectable plasma-viral load (VDL) has been reported in 30-40% of patients and is associated with negative social and economic outcomes (1). Neurocognitive testing can detect cognitive dysfunction, but it has been limited in the clinical setting as cognitive functions are measured with brief tests that only assess a limited number of domains (2). However, this approach could be more suitable if we could determine which domains were more vulnerable for a given patient. A number of studies have indicated that hot and cold cognition (ie the ability to respond to a present challenge and to future events), may represent an interesting way of predicting vulnerability to CI. In fact, these processes are associated with separate brain circuitries (3). CI related to HIV infection may be related to specific aspects or types of neurocognitive impairment. As such, the identification of specific cognitive dysfunctions affecting the ability to respond to both a present challenge and a future event, would be able to identify the most vulnerable patients with regard to HIV-associated CI and to optimize the available treatment strategies focusing the rehabilitation on the most vulnerable cognitive domain. 2. Goal of the study: Our specific aim is to investigate whether the specific cognitive domains of hot and cold cognition predict vulnerability to CI, including prospective memory. 3. Study design: Since many studies indicate the influence of hot and cold cognition on cognitive impairment it would be of interest to assess these domains in HIV infected patients. Also we hypothize that these aspects influence prospective memory function, which is associated with real-world problems, and may be predictive of future cognitive dysfunction and disability. Therefore, this study will be performed in a sample of HIV-infected patients taking part in the observational cohort study “Prospective studies of the long-term effects of HIV on the Central Nervous System”, an ongoing multicenter epidemiological observational cohort study. All baseline and annual visits take place prospectively during the follow-up visits at each study center and, specifically, it will be performed in HIV+ patients having undetectable plasma-viral load (i.e., a quantifiable value of HIV RNA that has not been verified for 6 months). All enrolled subjects fulfill other baseline characteristics. A total number of 30 subjects would be enrolled, with 15 HIV-infected patients and 15 healthy controls (17 males, 13 females, mean age 45.9) in each group. |"
565,"Background: 
Studies in the past have been done comparing various traction techniques. Few studies compared the effect of the lumbar traction between vertical sitting and supine lying. There is no literature comparing the effect of vertical sitting and supine lying traction on chronic radicular low back pain.   
Although the current literature is based on a multitude of clinical trials with variable outcomes, there is no systematic review to address lumbar traction therapy for low back pain or radicular low back pain. Hence, currently there is no consensus on the optimum position. The aim of the study is to show the superiority of vertical sitting traction by applying 30% of the body weight over supine lying traction with the application of a 20% body weight with 20 minutes sessions to patients with chronic radicular low back pain (CRLBP). This study will contribute to a better treatment option by showing the superior effect of vertical sitting traction over supine lying traction that will make the management of chronic radicular low back pain (CRLBP) by physical therapists easier.   
Study Design: This will be a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of the interventions. This study will follow the CONSORT guidelines.   
Outcome Measures: Oswestry Disability Index and Numeric Pain Rating Scale measures will be recorded at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks.
Intervention: Participants will be randomly (using random number table) allocated to one of the treatment arms mentioned below. The treatment arms are as follows; i) Group: A (Vertical sitting traction): this session will be followed by the application of the continuous mechanical traction in the vertical sitting position with a belt around the chest. A total of 30 minutes session per day with 5 sessions per week for 12 weeks will be provided to the participants in this group.  Group: B (supine lying traction): following the conventional treatment, continuous mechanical traction will be applied in the supine lying position with a traction force equal to 50% of the total body weight. A total of 20 minutes session per day with 5 sessions per week will be provided to the participants in group B | 1 year |"

567,"Study Overview 
The diagnosis of celiac disease (CD) is based primarily on serology and histopathology. Intestinal endoscopy is only indicated for subjects with clinically compatible symptoms at higher risk for the disease (> 2% of the general population). The EMA assay (EMA) is considered the gold standard for serology and is currently being used in clinical practice. The assay was developed at Imperial College London and utilizes tissue transglutaminase (TG2) extracted from mechanically-disrupted intestinal biopsies. This technique requires that the biopsies be properly prepared and sent to laboratories specialized in CD diagnostics as standard pathology labs do not have the ability to extract and concentrate TG2. Our primary objective is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the EMA test detected on the supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens using commercially available kits. We have developed and validated a new rapid, point-of-care blood assay for the detection of IgG and IgA anti-TG2. This assay could be potentially combined with the EMA test using supernatant that contains mechanically lyzed intestinal tissue and could be detected at the point-of-care setting. Our secondary objective is to determine if our rapid anti-TG2 assay on the supernatant of mechanically lysed intestinal biopsy specimens is concordant with the results obtained by the EMA and Culture-EMA. 

Input Text: Prolactin response to gonadal stimulation during infertility treatment

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) are treated with luteinizing hormone (LH) analogues in order to prevent premature midcycle surges in LH, which may impair fertility in women and compromise pregnancy outcomes. Previous work in the laboratory of the principal investigator (PI) has shown that physiological elevations in luteal LH and prolactin (PRL) during assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment promote reprogramming of granulosa cells. In this project, the investigators hypothesize that the combination of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) plus LH antagonist (LHA) may promote granulosa cell reprogramming during ART treatment via transient luteal prolactin signals.
Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of LHA and hCG, as compared to LHA and human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG), will modify in vitro maturation (IVM) parameters, specifically the levels of pro-inflammatory mediators and PR-intermediate (Pri-mt) (a transcription complex) mRNA and PRL in granulosa cells (GCs) of retrieved oocytes. The investigators also hypothesize that the combination of LHA and hCG will improve the quality and fertilizability of metaphase II (MII) oocytes.

Detailed Description
-----------------
At the initial office visit, all participants will complete a questionnaire, describing their medical history, medications, and family history. They will also provide a consent form for the study. Women included in the study will have up to 10-12 follicles and their diameters will be recorded by transvaginal sonography every 2-3 days. Participants will inject LHA beginning on cycle day 20-21 (with or without downregulation of the LH surge at cycle day 20) and oocyte retrieval will be performed 35-36 hours following the administration of hCG. Prior to oocyte retrieval, participants will undergo an ultrasound scan and receive sedation with propofol. In the minor operating room, the participants will be transferred to the operating table. An intravenous (IV) cannula will be placed in a peripheral vein or arm and the participant will receive an IV bolus of 250 micrograms of fentanyl. Oral or localized nerve block will be given as described by Lobo and Faundes, 2007 in the women who have previous difficulty with intramuscular injections. Participants will have a localized IV sedation (midazolam 1 mg; fentanyl 250 mg) at 3-5 minute intervals. The IV lidocaine and analgesia will be repeated as needed. After the participant is"

Evaluate patient-reported health outcomes, cost effectiveness, and sustainability. 5. Identify gaps in clinical care delivery in Uganda and inform health systems-strengthening to improve HF care delivery in Uganda.
Objectives

Reach
The investigators aim for enrollment of approximately 1000 patients for a total of 3000 HF patient experiences. Reach measures will include the proportion of eligible patients approached who: 1) are approached by the research assistant; 2) agree to participate in the study; 3) agree to have their medical records reviewed; 4) agree to complete research questionnaires at each study follow-up visit; 5) download the Medly Uganda mobile application and utilize it over the study follow-up period.

Patient and Facility-Level Implementation Barriers and Facilitators
The patient-level implementation barriers and facilitators will be assessed through interviews and focus group discussions with Medly Uganda patients during study follow-up. The healthcare provider-level factors will be assessed through interviews and focus group discussions with healthcare providers at the study facilities during study follow-up. We will conduct 30 semi-structured qualitative interviews and 5 focus group discussions with patients, and 15 semi-structured qualitative interviews and 5 focus group discussions with healthcare professionals in each facility. The qualitative study will involve in-depth and detailed exploration of the patient and provider experience and preferences to understand the reasons for the reach of Medly Uganda.
Patients and providers will be sampled purposively to obtain diverse perspectives from male and female patients and providers and from patients at different stages of the disease trajectory (e.g., recently diagnosed patients, patients whose disease is stable or progressing, patients who have completed the 3-year study participation period). The final purposive sample sizes will be selected based on saturation. Data collection activities will include in-depth, semi-structured interviews inquiring about participants' experiences with each of the components of the implementation strategy. Participants will be asked about their awareness of the implementation strategy, how they perceive the implementation strategy, how they engage in the implementation strategy, and how the implementation strategy has (or has not) influenced their behavior. Specific questions pertaining to the barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of each component of the implementation strategy also will be included. The qualitative interviews will be audio-recorded for transcription and coding at a later date. A thematic framework analysis procedure will be used to analyze the transcripts. The research team will adopt a ""theory-driven"" approach, and will consider the following implementation concepts: 1) intervention fidelity, 2) reach, 3) adoption, 4) adaption, 5) implementation process, and 6) context. The final thematic framework will be constructed based on the most salient concepts that emerge from the qualitative study data.
The investigators will analyze the data using descriptive and inductive methods. The investigators will use participant interview transcripts and focus group discussion transcripts to derive implementation construct themes and codes. After identifying initial codes, the investigators will review each participant's interview transcript line by line and inductively coding each line into one or more of the implementation construct themes or codes. The investigators will develop a codebook to facilitate coding and thematic identification across all participant interviews. A coding reliability process will be implemented in which two independent coders will code a subset of transcripts. The investigators will address inter-coder reliability discrepancies through discussion. The researchers will identify additional implementation themes and codes based on the emerging patterns in the data. The investigators will analyze the study findings based on the socio-ecological model theory. We will summarize and report socio-demographic characteristics of participants and healthcare providers who participated in this qualitative study. We will also aggregate data and report key quantitative factors influencing implementation success such as: number of patients offered a study participation experience v. number of patients offered a study experience who declined; number of patients with HF who are eligible v. number of patients who are offered study participation experience, who enroll in the study participation experience, and who remain enrolled until the end of the study.

578,"This study evaluates whether a multimodal prehabilitation program targeting exercise training, nutritional therapy and anxiety reducing techniques is effective in improving the functional capacity, metabolic health, nutritional status and quality of life of localized pancreatic cancer patients before surgery."
579,"Purpose: To investigate the efficacy of dual task exercise training on mobility, balance, functional ability and health-related quality of life in children with spastic cerebral palsy.
Background: Walking disorders, muscle weakness, low mobility and decreased balance ability are the most pronounced symptoms encountered in children with spastic cerebral palsy due to muscular and neurologic disruption from non-traumatic brain lesions. Most children with cerebral palsy have muscle contracture, delayed motor development, decreased muscle tone and ataxia that is associated with their motor problems. Children with mild-to-moderate spasticity and poor gait function make up 55-79% of the cerebral palsy population and are the largest group in therapy (Brauer and Schroer 2019). Although intensive rehabilitation improves balance and gait in cerebral palsy individuals, the results on the long term are unconvincing. In addition, studies exploring the effectiveness of balance training in cerebral palsy have reported improvements in balance as well as functional tasks (Brauer and Schroer 2019). Balance exercises have been demonstrated to improve motor performance in individuals with spastic cerebral palsy in the long term (Ko, Choi, Shin, and Kim 2014). When individuals are performing dual task training, they have to integrate visual and auditory input with movement, and these abilities play an important role in both balance rehabilitation and ambulation. As a result, increasing balance ability with dual-task training could result in further improvements in mobility through the ability to integrate visual and auditory input with one's movement.

Study Design: A parallel-group, assessor-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial.
Study Setting: Neurology Department of the Near East University 22 January Hospital in Nicosia, Cyprus.
Sample Population and Sample Size: Sample size was set to be 20 children per group after the power analysis based on the preliminary data of a similar randomized controlled study, with a power of 80%, an alpha level of 0.05 and medium effect size of d = 0.7743.  A sample size of 36 was calculated in total (18 per group). Eligible patients will be selected from the children with cerebral palsy who refer to the neurology department and undergo rehabilitation exercises. Children who are between 5-12 years old, who are diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy (hemiplegic, monoplegic, unilaterally affected or diplegic) and have a modified Gross Motor Function Classification system (GMFCS) level I or II, will be invited to participate in the study.
Randomization and Blinding Process:  After the participants fulfill the inclusion criteria, they will be randomly assigned, using a computer-based method, to either the intervention or control groups. Patients in the experimental group will perform balance exercises with two tasks, while participants in the control group will perform conventional rehabilitation therapy. All participants and examiners will be blinded to group allocation.
Intervention and Comparator: The experimental group will perform single-task and dual-task balance exercises (10-20 repetition/set), while the control group will perform single-task balance exercises. Participants in the experimental group will perform dual-task exercise training with active stretching during single-task balance exercises (simple math while on the balance pad), and will hold a ball while performing the same motor task for 1 minute for 12 weeks, three days a week for 30 minutes. In conventional rehabilitation, exercises include functional strength training, passive stretching and balance training. Exercises will be increased in difficulty as the patient's functional level improves.
Outcome Measures: The Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS), the Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), one-leg stand test (OLST), 3-meter backward walk test (3MBWT), 6-meter walk test (6MWT) and the Generic Children's Health-Related Quality of Life questionnaire (KINDL) will be used to evaluate rehabilitation outcomes. The Pediatric Balance Scale (PBS) is a standardized clinical examination used to measure balance abilities in children with cerebral palsy. The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) is used to measure balance in the transition from sitting to standing and vice versa, as well as walking. One-leg stand test (OLST) is used to measure static standing balance in unil"

Brief summary
=================
Two main subgroups will be targeted in Belgium: poultry-farm workers and veterinarians from the swine industry. Those 2 groups are identified as sentinel populations because they represent a high risk for contracting and transmitting non-human influenza viruses. The purpose is to establish a pilot active surveillance network by enrolling sentinel workers to perform frequent specimen sampling and to develop a monitoring approach to detect and characterize potential avian influenza spillovers. The 2 targeted groups cover both occupationally and non-occupationally acquired influenza virus infections. The former may occur during outbreaks on poultry farms. Outbreak management is coordinated at the national level by the Federal Health Agency so that the sentinel network will be implemented at the earliest step possible as soon as an outbreak is detected. The latter will cover people that frequently come in contact with birds and animal markets during their job/activity (e.g. employees of wildlife sanctuary, birdwatchers, bird breeders) and the detection of an avian influenza virus outbreak in wild birds close to those areas. In addition to these sentinel groups, a group of participants with a recent contact with a bird presenting influenza-like signs, and in outbreaks, the human participants involved in the outbreak response,  (e.g.: public health worker,  veterinary officials,  emergency doctors,  cleaners/cullers and other personnel involved in the response to the avian influenza outbreaks), will be enrolled into the study as well. The total number of enrolled participants is estimated to n=75 (maximum) who will be recruited from various sentinel groups through a list provided by our network of collaborators. Enrolled participants will be contacted by their employer or manager to ask or encourage them to participate in the study based on the following criteria: worker / volunteer in the animal industry, exposure to living or dead birds, participation in control activities (bird culling, disinfection, etc.), work or live in zones at risk for avian influenza virus outbreaks (participants of the wildlife sanctuary).

593,"Learning of new skills is required after neurological disorders, as a consequence of motor deficits. Touchscreen skills are increasingly used in everyday life as a communication aid, due to its simple operation. As such, this technology holds great potential to enhance the communication capabilities of non-fluent individuals with aphasia. Patients with progressive neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD), have been shown to suffer from learning impairments. In this study, we aim to examine learning effects following a two-week home-based training program in patients with PD. To resemble daily life as much as possible, all test and training sessions will be carried out in the on-phase of the medication-cycle, i.e., approximately 1 hour after last medication intake. The effect of a two-week training program will be examined by including 36 PD patients and randomizing in two groups (experimental vs control, equal n), stratified in age and H&Y-classification. The primary outcome will be the time necessary to form 9 patterns by sliding a finger on a touchscreen in both ST and DT condition, averaged over 9 trials.

594,"INTENTION: The present study will assess: 1) the effect of a transcranial magnetic stimulation-activated task-specific training on visuospatial neglect (primary outcome); 2) the effect of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the motor activity of the left hemibody in the chronic stroke survivors; and 3) the effect of the proposed motor training on the motor activity of the left hemibody in the chronic stroke survivors. METHODS: Design: This is a randomized, single-blinded, controlled study. Sample: 40 chronic stroke survivors will be screened. Patients suffering from neglect will be included. Randomization of groups will be performed by using computer-generated permutation blocks of 8. Random allocation sequence will be kept in sealed envelopes and will be opened according to the order of the patients' enrollment. The patients will not be blinded. Measurement: Clinical measures: Clinical Assessment for Stroke Outcomes (CASO) for assessing neglect, Rivermead Mobility Index (RMMI) for measuring physical disability, the Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living (NEADL) questionnaire for evaluating the patients' functional independence, the WHO Disability Assessment Scale 2 (WHODAS 2.0) for evaluating the patients' general disability status, the Modified Barthel Index (MBI) for assessing the patients' dependence in the activities of daily living (ADLs). Neurological measures: Movement Time (MT) for measuring the time it takes to complete a movement. The MT measurements will be done through the use of the Armeometer which is a clinical tool that measures the time of motor performance of the upper limbs in strokes patients and healthy controls. Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) measurements will be done after the neurological measures. fMRI measurements will be done by means of a block-design functional fMRI task, which consists of a 3-min baseline and a 3-min activation period that involves the active movement of the paretic hand to the target as fast and as accurately as possible. In the activation period, a visual target will be presented and disappear after 1500 msec. The participants should try to reach and touch the lighted target with their affected hand using simple movements (i.e. no finger flexion or extension). For each target, the participants should indicate whether they were able to touch them with their affected hand or not. The distance between the patient and the target will randomly vary from 5 to 10 cm. Patients will perform a total of 60 trials including 20 valid and 40 invalid trials. fMRI measurements will be acquired by using a 3 Tesla MRI scanner (Discovery MR750, GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL). TMS measurements will be done by activating the ipsilesional primary motor cortex (M1) during fMRI measurement of the patients' brain activity. The coil of the stimulator will be positioned over the patients' right M1. A single TMS pulse to the upper limb area of the M1 will be applied using standardized intensity of 80% of the measured RMT. The stimulator will be positioned 45° tangential to the scalp to allow magnetic field penetration from right to left. DATA COLLECTION: Screening visit: All the patients will be assessed for their eligibility. Baseline visit: All the patients will complete the mentioned clinical, neurological and neurological measures. Follow-up visit (1): All the patients will complete the mentioned clinical, neurological and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures.

596,"Given the widespread symptoms reported by patients with post-COVID-19, it is important to explore the role of OMT in treating this condition. OMT is particularly relevant because it has been hypothesized that inflammation may be a contributing factor to post-COVID-19 symptoms, and osteopaths are trained to detect and address inflammation in the body. In this study, we plan to collect data on participants' symptom severity, overall health, perceived recovery, and return to work status before and after OMT sessions. We will also collect information about the number and type of OMT sessions received, as well as any adverse events that occur during or after the sessions.

597,"A case series study of patients with severe frostbite will be conducted at Regions Hospital, Minneapolis, Minnesota. In addition to traditional work-up including a physical exam, digital exams of the affected extremities, and a history, there will also be conventional angiography with ICG microangiography. Conventional angiography is the most utilized diagnostic imaging modality for frostbite and demonstrates the microvasculature of the affected tissues. This is performed with intravenous contrast dye that is injected retrograde (up the arterial system), followed by antegrade (down the arterial system) injection. ICG microangiography is diagnostic imaging technique used elsewhere. It is a safe and simple technique in which a single dose of ICG dye is injected through an intravenous line. It does not require radiographic protection and it is non-radiating. It can be used for all types of tissue and has been used to assess the vascular supply in skin grafts, flaps, and other tissue structures. The microvasculature of the affected tissues will be demonstrated as a blue or red color. There are no other differences between the two tests for these patients.

After the study is done, the diagnostic value of each study will be compared. The results from the two imaging modalities will be compared to the amount of tissue that ultimately needs to be amputated, as determined by the final Hennepin Frostbite Score. It is hypothesized that these two imaging modalities will be concordant at demonstrating the ischemic tissue present in severe frostbite. This will allow our research team to determine if either of these imaging modalities provides incremental benefit at determining whether or not tissue is ischemic. Furthermore, since the ICG microangiography can be performed quickly and easily, it will be determined whether there is a role for this imaging technique in future frostbite patients, to potentially spare these patients having to get a conventional angiography.

Cognitive, motor, and psychological symptoms negatively affect the quality of life of patients. One of the most important methods used in the treatment of patients with stroke is rehabilitation. The main emphasis of rehabilitation is to provide patients with functional independence skills in activities that are important to their daily lives. Therefore, it is essential to conduct studies that will help improve patient rehabilitation. In this context, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the training program, which was applied to 22 patients at a post-stroke rehabilitation center, on motor function and functional independence of the patients. Additionally, the effects of the training program on the changes in the mood status of the patients as well as the relationship between these symptoms are also investigated. With this project, we hope to make a contribution to the literature both in terms of increasing the number of studies and reducing the number of patients with stroke in developing countries.

Intervention Description:: This study will be conducted using the mixed methods approach. This approach allows the data gained from both the quantitative and qualitative components to be compared (Fetters et al., 2013; Walsh, 2006). The purpose of this approach is to add strength to both types of data. The quantitative component of the current study is the rehabilitation program for patients, consisting of a total of four stages. In the first stage, the Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) (Fugl-Meyer et al., 1975), Barthel Index (BI) (Mahoney & Barthel, 1965), Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) (Hunt et al., 1986, 1990), and 36-item Short Form Health Survey (Kanber et al., 1998) are administered to the patients, and a baseline assessment is made to gain information about their current health characteristics. Then, the patients will be randomly divided into two groups, with one group receiving motor rehabilitation training 10 times for 50 minutes and the other group receiving psychomotor rehabilitation training 3 hours 10 times for 60 minutes. In order to make the group division, the randomization method will be applied, and a total of 22 patients and 128 healthy participants will participate in the study. Within the scope of the study, participants with uncontrolled hypertension, active cardiovascular disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and recent history of cancer (1 month) will be excluded. The participants will be informed about the importance of the training program. Participants who give informed consent prior to the study will be included in the study (Table A2, Figure A1, Appendix 4).
In the second stage, the patients will be trained for 45 minutes with the application of standardized training programs (American Heart Association, 2008; American Stroke Association, 2008) for their current health characteristics to increase their functional independence skills in daily living.
In the third stage, for 60 minutes, psychomotor rehabilitation training will be applied with cognitive exercises as well as standardized upper extremity rehabilitation exercises. The cognitive exercises are aimed at improving thinking speed and concentration skills in patients. At this stage, 15 exercises that will improve hand function will be applied (Ko et al., 2014).
In the fourth stage, participants who have been trained will be reassessed based on the FMA, Barthel Index, Nottingham Health Profile, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaires. After the 4-week training period, participants in both groups will be assessed based on the Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia Screening Questionnaire (PBSD)(Chui et al., 1981).

604,"Septicemia is one of the leading causes of death in hospitalized patients, mainly because of sepsis-associated organ dysfunction and failure requiring hemodynamic support. Sepsis results from activation of the host immune system. An overshoot of the inflammatory response plays an important role in sepsis’s progression to multiple organ dysfunction

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between precursor biomarkers of inflammation and the development of sepsis.DESIGN: The authors included all of the patients who participated in a trial evaluating the impact of an innovative method for blood transfusion on sepsis-related morbidity and mortality. In this prospective study, investigators enrolled inpatients with an abnormal laboratory inflammatory screen who were undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The authors developed an algorithm for detecting increased inflammatory activity and for predicting the development of sepsis.SETTING: Patients were enrolled from patients undergoing elective coronary artery surgery.PARTICIPANTS: The 100 inpatients, with a median age of 58 years, were in relatively stable preoperative condition with a median length of hospital stay of 0 days.INTERVENTIONS: The algorithm included seven sequential inflammatory markers, which the authors monitored throughout the perioperative period. The time for detection of increased inflammatory activity was 21.4 min after randomization, and the detection rate ranged between 0% and 18.9% in different groups of patients. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, the authors built a sepsis prediction model based on the selected inflammatory markers. The prediction model achieved a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100%.MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Among the 28 (28%) patients who developed sepsis, the median time until the activation of immune markers and subsequent initiation of sepsis prediction model was 184 min, compared with 156 min in the rest of the group (p = 0.02). After applying the sepsis prediction model when the seven inflammatory markers reached the predefined activation threshold, the authors detected 28 patients (28%) with increased inflammatory activity and sepsis.CONCLUSIONS: Seven sequential biomarkers were monitored throughout the perioperative period to assess the precursor biomarkers and to predict the development of sepsis. The authors developed a multivariable prediction model, which achieved a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 100% in predicting sepsis. An early model of inflammatory activity may help clinicians to identify patients at risk of sepsis."
605,"5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is a key neurotransmitter and plays an important role in the initiation and persistence of substance-use disorders. Serotonergic abnormalities including alterations in neurotransmission and neurotrophism have been hypothesized to mediate behavioral and physiological aspects of alcohol and substance dependence. CSX-1004 is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes both fentanyl and its major metabolite, norfentanyl, by binding covalently to S-fentanyl and S-norfentanyl by forming a stable disulfide bond. Binding of CSX 1004 leads to a rapid and irreversible decrease in these ligands' affinity for the μ opioid receptor. CSX-1004 has potent opioid binding affinity (IC50=2.59 nM) and is highly selective for fentanyl and norfentanyl over the entire opioid peptide class. The CSX-1004 antibody is the first and potentially the only recombinantly produced and specific antagonist of S-fentanyl and S-norfentanyl. To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of CSX-1004, one cohort of 12 subjects will receive escalating single doses of CSX-1004 Injection intravenously at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, or 2.4 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg). All subjects enrolled into the study will be required to report any incidental use of opioids prior to Study Drug administration and will agree to take steps to ensure that such opioid exposure does not occur for 72 hours following Investigational Product administration. An additional Safety Follow-up phone call will be made on Day 6. This is an Investigational Drug and its effects are not known at this time.

1. True fast imaging with steady-state precession (True FISP); 
Acquisition parameters: echo time, 1.88 ms; repetition time, 2.5 ms; field of view 320 x 320 mm2; acquisition matrix 320 x 320; slice thickness, 3 mm; and interslice gap, 0 mm. 
2. Hydrogen (H)-resolved 3-D volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE): Acquisition parameters: TE, 1.5 ms; TR, 4.3 ms; flip angle, 15°; slice thickness, 1.5 mm; and reconstruction increment, 1 mm. 
3. Two-dimensional (2D)-steam-prepared breath-hold turbo spin-ech MRI sequence with fat saturation: Acquisition parameters: TE, 3.21 ms; TR, 10.37 ms; TI, 180 ms; flip angle, 180°; field of view, 400 x 400 mm2; matrix, 344 x 344; and slice thickness, 3 mm. 
In addition 130 patients with benign biliary disease, matched by gender and age with the CBD dilation patient group, will be enrolled and followed to validate the MRCP findings. 

MRCP findings will be evaluated by an experienced radiologist to characterize CBD dilation and other possible biliary abnormalities: extrahepatic bile dilation, intraductal stones, CBD strictures, and segmental and diffuse intrahepatic duct dilatations. 

Endoscopic procedure during diagnosis
Both CBD dilation and intrahepatic duct dilation will be scored using the following criteria. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) will be performed by expert gastroenterologists according to the standardized techniques. 

Spatial distribution pattern of CBD dilation in the patient group
In order to assess whether there are any differences in MRCP findings of CBD dilation and intrahepatic duct dilation in the various patient groups, all patients with idiopathic CBD dilation will have an initial MRCP at the time of diagnosis. Moreover, 20 controls from the Swedish Population Study without CBD dilation will be randomly selected and undergo a one-time MRCP, so in total, 140 patients will have an MRCP exam at baseline. 

Follow-up strategy
A total of 14 patients with idiopathic CBD dilation will be diagnosed for primary endpoint (the number was based on the results of previous studies in which half of the patients required early endoscopic intervention to prevent CBD stones). 
All patients who require interventions because of an elevated risk of CBD stones will be followed yearly for a total of 15 years with MRCP examinations yearly as a part of follow-up care. 

The same MRCP protocols will be used in follow-up as in the baseline examination. 
MRCP findings will be evaluated by an experienced radiologist, and the score for CBD dilation will be reevaluated.

609,"1.Study background and objective:
	The DLT is usually inserted in the ipsilateral bronchus when the operation side of the thoracic surgery is determined. It is necessary to change the position of the patient during lung surgery, which will increase the malposition rate of the double-lumen endobronchial tube. 
	Recently, a 3D printing double-lumen endobronchial tube has been developed and used in clinical practice, and its clinical application effect has been confirmed, but the problem of double-lumen endobronchial tube malposition during position change still exists. It can be seen that the malposition rate of the double-lumen endobronchial tube is still high, so it is very necessary to discuss the method of reducing the malposition rate of the double-lumen endobronchial tube. 
	In this study, according to the anatomical characteristics of the trachea and bronchus, by the influence of the position change of the body on the displacement of the double-lumen endobronchial tube, the position change of the body will cause the disengagement of the breathing circuit, which is convenient for the air we expel to escape out and reduce the malposition rate of the double-lumen endobronchial tube. Therefore, our research team intends to study the effect of lung air disengagement on the change of body position after the insertion of a double-lumen endotracheal tube. The clinical study results can provide a reference for the treatment of a double-lumen endotracheal intubation malposition and reduce the adverse reactions of the double-lumen endotracheal tube malposition. 
1.1.Research hypothesis
The change of body position after intubation can cause the lung air to disengage, so the lung air disengagement group has less rate of double-lumen endobronchial tube malposition.
1.2.Study Design:
	The inclusion criteria are patients undergoing thoracotomy requiring left double-lumen endotracheal intubation and patients who sign an informed consent form for this clinical study.
	The exclusion criteria are mouth opening <3cm, history of difficult intubation, with history of operation in larynx and throat, severe obstructive pulmonary obstruction, bronchial asthma or airway sensitivity, obvious cardiac insufficiency, severe liver dysfunction, obvious renal insufficiency, history of central nervous system diseases, severe mental illness, etc.
	There are a total of 160 people in the two groups in this study. The control group is the traditional method of double-lumen endotracheal tube treatment in the operating room. The left double-lumen endotracheal tube is inserted by the anesthesiologist in the supine position; When the patient begins to change the side to the left, the anesthesiologist maintains the normal connection of the breathing tube. The treatment group is to change to a lateral position under the guidance of the anesthesia machine after successful intubation. The anesthesiologist disengaged the breathing circuit when the patient is ready to change position from the supine position to the left lateral decubitus position.
	For this study, a convenience sampling method was used to collect the participants. Participants were recruited through advertising in the hospital environment through posters and announcements to interested patients. Participants also could receive study information by asking our study staff.
1.3. Study process

	2.The duration of the experiment will be 1 year;
	3.It takes about 15 minutes from the time of signing the informed consent form to the time of lung collapse;

610,"This clinical trial will address a fundamental gap in research that is urgently needed to increase understanding of diabetes self care in the type I diabetes patient population, and to expand our knowledge of the factors that influence patients' self-care behaviors and diabetes-related stress over time.

Abstract
=================
Background: Despite advancements in health care, type I diabetes (T1D) continues to be one of the most challenging pediatric diseases to manage. Clinical guidelines currently indicate that a multidisciplinary, patient-centered approach provides care for children with T1D in a manner that is most effective and satisfying for both patients and caregivers. However, there are multiple challenges that arise when applying this approach, especially in the first 2 years following diagnosis. There is great variability in the way patients learn and internalize diabetes self-care and there is a lack of guidance for providers, patients and caregivers concerning the type of care that should be provided and the frequency with which these interactions should occur. This type of personalized care is laborious and time consuming. There are also significant gaps in our understanding of the factors that most influence diabetes self-care and the factors that contribute to the elevated levels of diabetes-related distress that children with T1D and their families experience. Many of the challenges and areas of concern arise in the first 2 years following diagnosis, including patient non-adherence to insulin therapy, mismanagement of high and low blood glucose levels, inappropriate use of supplemental insulin, and elevated levels of diabetes-related distress. Goals/Objectives: Our aim is to establish optimal care following diagnosis of T1D using a personalized, comprehensive approach at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) that will improve diabetes-related self-care and decrease diabetes-related distress for pediatric patients diagnosed

612,"The aim of this research is to assess the potential of a non-invasive, quantitative MRI scan to predict the presence of sarcoma, or detect sarcoma in patients with benign-appearing soft tissue masses. Sarcomas are rare tumours that arise in connective or supportive tissue. While they are most commonly found in bone, they can also appear in fat, muscle, nerve or other tissue in the body. The early diagnosis of soft tissue sarcomas is extremely challenging and standard radiological investigations are often unable to distinguish between benign and malignant masses. Unfortunately, this has a significant impact on patient care - patients with suspected malignancy often undergo unnecessary biopsies, or are placed on long waiting lists. These patients often undergo multiple false negative biopsies before being correctly diagnosed with sarcoma, resulting in delayed treatment and increased patient anxiety. Sarcomas are often diagnosed only after they have become too large to be removed purely surgically or by radiotherapy. This leads to an increased risk of disease spread and ultimately worse survival outcomes. A quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is a non-invasive method of imaging the body which can be a useful diagnostic tool for a large number of conditions such as stroke, heart and brain disease, and some lung conditions. There are a number of characteristics that can be measured within an MRI scan, including tumour diffusivity, which relates to the movement of water within and around a mass. Recent research suggests that a quantitative MRI scan may be useful for distinguishing between benign and malignant masses. This research aims to develop a machine learning algorithm, using these quantitative measures, which can predict sarcoma presence in benign-appearing masses. This research is funded by a Cancer Research UK Project Grant."

614,"Colorectal cancer is one the main causes of cancer related death worldwide. Colorectal cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the US with approximately 50.000 deaths in 2021. The mortality and morbidity of colorectal cancer are affected by numerous factors, such as surgical site infections (SSI), length of stay (LOS) or anastomotic leakage (AL). 
Colorectal surgery is considered as major surgery, and it represents a very severe physical burden for the patients. The major component of physical stress is associated with the tissue damage that accompanies surgery. Tissue damage during abdominal surgery is in fact responsible for the occurrence of Surgical Site Infections (SSI), anastomotic leakage (AL) in the anastomotic areas and the need for further surgical interventions. 
The incidence of anastomoc leakage (AL) in colorectal surgery is reported to be 1-23% and remains a critical postoperative complication. Leakage of the bowel may be manifested by sepsis, fever and/or abdominal pain and can even lead to death. 
Surgical Site Infections (SSI) are frequent complications following colorectal surgery for patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery. The rates of surgical site infections reported in literature are variable depending on hospital procedures and surgery details. A recent study, including 3,952 patients undergoing colorectal surgery, reported a rate of 14% for surgical site infections. 
Increased blood loss in surgery and the use of red blood cells in major surgery significantly contribute to postoperative morbidity. In addition to the high cost associated with perioperative transfusion, it is now well accepted that transfusion carries the risk of infectious disease transmission and acute transfusion reactions. The potential deleterious effects of transfusion may contribute to chronic lung diseases, including asthma. Also, it may interfere with the recovery of cancer patients and affect their quality of life. 
Finally, the length of stay (LOS) in the hospital has been increasingly used as a quality indicator for patient outcomes, and it is associated with clinical care quality, mortality rates and the costs of the health system.
The investigators hypothesized that preoperative administration of oral immunonutrition (Impact oral by Nestle) in patients undergoing colorectal surgery for neoplasm (colon or rectum) could reduce Surgical Site Infections (SSI), Anastomotic Leakage (AL), Length of Stay (LOS) and blood loss. 
The investigators will perform a double-blind randomized controlled trial including 550 patients undergoing colorectal cancer surgery at the Fondazione IRCCS Policlinico San Matteo Pavia and AOU Sant’Orsola-Malpighi, two highly specialized university hospitals, both well known for their Surgical Oncology Units. According to surgical procedures performed by the involved surgeons, the study population will include both major and minor colorectal surgery. Participants will be divided into two groups: the trial group (A) will receive Impact oral + Colorectal Surgery, starting 7 days before colorectal surgery and ending 7 days after surgery (10 days in total); the control group (B) will instead receive placebo + Colorectal Surgery, and oral Impact will be administered only to the patients developing postoperative complications (SSI or AL)."

| Prostate enlargement is one of the most common causes of prostate surgery in men greater than age 60. Following radical prostatectomy and holmium laser enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP) patients commonly experience incontinence that can last multiple months and affect patients' quality of life during their recovery period and beyond. Pre-operative pelvic floor physical therapy (PFPT) can play a significant role in minimizing this incontinence. We plan to investigate the effectiveness of a standardized pre-operative PFPT program on lower urinary tract symptoms and recovery from transient stress urinary incontinence following HoLEP. | Prostate enlargement is a common problem in men older than age 60. Treatment of this enlargement usually requires surgery. Some patients are at risk of urinary leakage after these surgeries. Pelvic floor muscle exercises are often done before the surgery to help prevent urinary leakage. We want to study whether pelvic floor muscle exercises performed before surgery for enlarged prostate improve patients' outcomes. |

619,"BACKGROUND: Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are among the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in older people and the most common cause of unplanned hospital readmissions in developed countries. ADRs are estimated to be responsible for more than 20% of all hospital admissions and nearly 5% of deaths among older people. In inpatients aged over 60, the occurrence of ADRs is especially high and may be even more important, since they tend to present with several morbidities and polypharmacy. Acute kidney injury (AKI) and Hyperkalemia are among the most frequent and harmful ADRs in this population. These conditions may lead to acute renal failure (ARF), a condition particularly common in older people, with an incidence which increases steadily with age. Several studies have observed improvements in kidney outcomes and survival of patients with ARF after initiation of renal replacement therapy (RRT). Although the use of RRT is an essential part of the treatment, current guidelines recommend considering the use of RRT only after an initial correction of potassium and the presence of hyperkalemia. ARF and hyperkalemia are therefore considered preventable conditions, which may be prevented by the rapid recognition and correction of contributing risk factors. To date, there is a paucity of data regarding the effectiveness of ADR prevention techniques in older people. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical decision support software (CDSS) and specific intervention procedures in preventing adverse drug events associated with acute kidney injury and hyperkaliemia in older inpatients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized, non-blinded, controlled trial will be conducted from December 2021 to December 2023. The study will be conducted in the Medicine, Surgery and Obstetrics Departments of six university hospitals located in Switzerland, France and Austria. For each study centre, the study period will be divided into two phases using the stepped-wedge cluster design. The first phase will last 13 weeks and the second phase will last 14 weeks. The study will be performed retrospectively from January 2020 to November 2021 for the control phase and prospectively for the intervention phase. Older patients (> 65 years), admitted for 3 days or more, and treated with more than 5 medications during the first 72 hours of admission will be included. We estimate that a sample of 1020 patients per study centre will be necessary to achieve the study's primary objective with a test power of about 80%.

620,"Crohn's disease is a chronic relapsing inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. In the majority of patients, the disease remits after surgical treatment with an ileocecal resection. However, relapse can occur as frequently as 50% of patient at 3 years. Mesenteric infiltration by lymphocytes and lipids as well as systemic immune activation markers in peripheral blood, are found in Crohn's disease before surgery, as well as in the mesentery of symptomatic patients, and are associated with increased rates of early disease recurrence. It is thought that the activation of the mesenteric tissue, and by extension of mesenteric lymph nodes, can lead to the egress and translocation of bacteria and pro-inflammatory microbial molecular patterns (PAMPs) into the bloodstream. A pro-inflammatory state of the intestinal and systemic immune system would then be primed, thereby increasing the risk of recurrence.
Currently, there is neither evidence of bacterial translocation in the setting of early recurrence of CD that is measurable in the blood, nor evidence of a genetic predisposition to early recurrence. These patients could benefit from a screening and prevention strategy that aims to identify patients at risk of recurrence. Understanding if bacteria that are normally found in the intestine in patients with Crohn's disease can translocate to the blood before and after surgery, as well as genetic predispositions to such bacterial translocation, may open new therapeutic avenues to prevent recurrence in these patients. In this context, we have launched a study in order to evaluate the presence of bacteria in the mesentery, bloodstream and ileal tissue of patients with and without early post-surgical disease recurrence.

621,"1.1 Background and Rationale: Obese individuals have a greater likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes and are at increased risk for coronary heart disease and/or stroke. While the underlying causes of obesity are still poorly understood, it is established that a key aspect involved in the pathogenesis of both obesity and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) is impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and/or type 2 diabetes (T2D). Currently, there are two approved drug therapies for obesity: liraglutide and semaglutide. These two agents are marketed as GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and exert their effect by mimicking the actions of intestinal GLP-1, a hormone that activates GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) to stimulate release of insulin in a glucose-dependent fashion and inhibit release of glucose from the liver while concomitantly promoting satiety. Both GLP-1RAs are approved for treating patients with T2D, but only semaglutide has been approved for T2D in individuals without obesity.
Safety evaluations for both GLP-1RA agents, liraglutide and semaglutide, showed that individuals with IGT or T2D are at an increased risk for acute pancreatitis. In fact, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued a black box warning for liraglutide because of higher risk of acute pancreatitis in patients with T2D (https://www.fda.gov). In addition to the increased risk for pancreatitis, GLP-1RA may also exacerbate gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in some patients. Consequently, these agents are frequently associated with gastrointestinal (GI) distress, including nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. These GI symptoms may contribute to poor patient adherence and lower the likelihood of these agents remaining effective for addressing long-term weight loss as GLP-1RA are associated with weight loss of about 5% when evaluated for this purpose.
Lack of long-term efficacy contributes significantly to high healthcare costs associated with obesity. As such, novel classes of agents that are safe, promote weight loss and reduce the risk of obesity-related co-morbidities are much needed. Recent discoveries have revealed that a novel hormone that circulates in humans as a protein-protein complex is implicated in the regulation of body weight. The hormone in question is an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that is known as the bile acid-controlled GPCR (BA-GPCR) or TGR5. This receptor is abundantly expressed in multiple tissues of the GI tract including the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, colon and rectum. It has been suggested that BA-GPCR activation promotes weight loss by reducing food intake (satiety). In fact, the role of this receptor in the regulation of satiety is thought to be of particular importance to individuals with obesity or metabolic diseases as BA-GPCR is upregulated in obesity and metabolic disease states (for review see). Activation of BA-GPCR has been shown to increase both hepatic and intestinal expression of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19), which suppresses hepatic triglyceride accumulation and stimulates bile acid excretion, indicating that BA-GPCR may suppress hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and stimulate cholesterol excretion in a FGF19 dependent manner. Thus, activation of BA-GPCR can potentially improve both cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes.
A number of investigational agents that can agonize BA-GPCR have been investigated for treating various cardiovascular and metabolic diseases (for review see). Recently, the first fully human BA-GPCR agonist was identified, the peptide LY3437943. In preclinical evaluations, a single dose of LY3437943 rapidly stimulates satiety and suppresses food intake. This suppressive effect on appetite and food intake is associated with the activation of BA-GPCR and results from agonist-driven potentiation of the inhibitory actions of serotonin within the intestinal GI tract. In addition to stimulating satiety, LY34379"

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
Mental Health Disorders (MHD) are the primary cause of morbidity in children worldwide and are one of the greatest threats to the overall burden of physical and mental illnesses. Studies have shown that about 10-20% of school-age children suffer from clinically significant mental health issues. The primary objective of the proposed study is to validate the efficacy of a novel, parent-based intervention intended to prevent anxiety and depressive disorders in school-aged children. We conducted an open trial using elements from multiple treatment modalities. In this study, we randomly assigned parents of children aged 5-10 years in a community sample to receive either a 30- minute face to face parental engagement intervention, a 50-minute online self-help group, or an active comparison group and followed up for two years. Inclusion Criteria: Participation and recruitment were conducted through a network of schools in a south Indian state (about 8400 to 9200 students attending these schools). Both students and schools were randomly selected from the greater Hyderabad area in the Indian state of Telangana. Schools were only considered and included if they enrolled between 500 and 1000 students (grades 3-10). This population is representative of all children in elementary school in the state of Telangana and across India. For this study, two schools within the Hyderabad metropolitan area, with approximately 500 - 1000 students per school were selected that served the majority of students (both girls and boys) in the 5-10 age group. In the selected schools, parents of children (grades 3-10) agreed to participate were enrolled. For inclusion in this study, the children enrolled had to be > 5years of age and < 10years of age as these children would require parental consent given that they were in the early to elementary schooling range. Participants were also required to have an Android or IOS operating system on their phone. Exclusion Criteria: Exclusion criteria include, having any developmental or learning challenges, or any physical, medical, psychiatric diagnosis.

Detailed Description
-----------------
This study investigates the efficacy of a parent-based behavioral intervention aimed at reducing anxiety and depressive symptoms in school-age children. We are proposing a community-based randomized trial to explore the primary hypothesis that a 50-min online, self-help intervention, for parents of children aged 5-10 years, can significantly reduce the risk for developing anxiety and depressive symptoms in those children. Given that we expect that parents receiving the online intervention will also discuss the content of the intervention modules with their (anxious or depressed) child, this approach will also provide a unique opportunity to examine the efficacy of a two-generation mental health intervention program. Specifically, we will randomly assign parents of children aged 5-10 years to an online self-help intervention program, a parental engagement intervention program, or an active control condition, and follow up on the two groups of children (treatment group vs. active control group) and their parents for one year. While the active control intervention group will not receive the active intervention and will constitute an active control group, they will continue to receive the regular schooling curriculum until the end of the study. Outcomes such as symptomology, psychosocial functioning, and well-being will be used to evaluate the treatment effects of the proposed intervention. H0: The level of parental engagement, anxiety and depression in young children from high risk areas and socio-economic status, will not be substantially different in the intervention group relative to the control group.

628,"1. Aim and Background Hypoxia training is a training paradigm where exercise is performed above 2000 m sea level or below sea level. This training method leads to improved maximal oxygen consumption, cardiovascular benefits and an improved time-to-exhaustion. However, altitude training in normobaric conditions is a logistical challenge as it requires air transportation or spending a considerable period of time exposed to hypobaric conditions. Moreover, hypoxia training is typically performed at high-intensity levels, which can lead to the accumulation of fatigue and high perception of effort. In contrast, low-intensity resistance training (LIRT) can be easily programmed as individuals are capable of conducting many high repetitions in a single set, and the perception of effort is reduced. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of six weeks LIRT in hypoxia conditions on cardiovascular, strength-endurance, and muscular characteristics in normobaric hypoxia or normobaric conditions. We hypothesized that LIRT in hypoxia conditions will improve strength and strength-endurance, lower-body muscle thickness and lower-body muscle catecholamine response. 2. Experimental

Driving assessment methods currently used for older drivers are primarily administered during in-person evaluations. It is difficult and burdensome on both drivers and assessors to arrange these assessments and to replicate them over time. As a result, these methods are often only conducted when there is cause for concern (i.e., after a crash or after a diagnosis of dementia or stroke). These methods do not accurately or reliably capture longitudinal driving behaviors of healthy older adults and thus are not designed to identify gradual changes in driving performance. Further, driving assessments using in-vehicle sensing technology are underutilized in older adults due to a shortage of accessible in-vehicle sensors (e.g. headways, brake response, steering wheel angle, etc.) and software that can collect data from the vehicle and create a report for the clinician, caregiver, and the older driver. To address some of these challenges and needs, the investigators propose the development of a novel remote driving assessment application designed to capture driving behavior as a part of the in-vehicle driving experience. The investigators will implement innovative driving data collection and cloud-based data sharing technology designed to quantify driving behaviors over an extended period of time. They will pair neurocognitive and driving assessments with data from in-vehicle sensors to determine driving performance and safety over 3-6 months in older ICU survivors. The investigators will also conduct formative work via stakeholder advisory panels to engage with the end-users of this technology (i.e., ICU survivors, their family caregivers, and providers) to capture their priorities and their preferences on how to present the driving data, such as how to convey relative risk across driving metrics. The investigators will use participant input to refine the technology before launching an efficacy study with a larger sample of older ICU survivors from an expanded network of in-hospital sensors, remote driving assessments, and the investigators' partnering rehabilitation centers

641,"Tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy are performed for many reasons such as recurrent tonsil and adenoid infections, sleep apnea, symptomatic adenotonsillar hypertrophy, halitosis, peritonsillar abscess, and it is one of the most performed surgeries in the world. During these operations, there may be fluid and blood accumulation in the stomach. Investigators wonder whether the amount of blood and fluid accumulated in the stomach after tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in children will increase the risk of aspiration. For this purpose, the aim is to compare the results with values considered risky for aspiration by evaluating the pre- and postoperative gastric volume with ultrasound in children who underwent tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy. This study will include ASA 1,2,3 patients under the age of 18 who will undergo tonsillectomy and/or adenoidectomy in the operating rooms of Istanbul University, Istanbul Medical Faculty, Department of Otorhinolaryngology, after the approval of the ethics committee. All the patients will be given oral midazolam at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg as standard in the preoperative preparation room. After standard monitoring (ECG, NIBP, SpO2) is performed in the operating room, gastric volume will be evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position before the operation. After induction of general anesthesia (sevoflurane + 02 + NO2 inhalation, 1 mcg/kg fentanyl, 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium) patients will be intubated. After intubation, gastric volume will be re-evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position. anesthesia will be maintained with a mixture of sevoflurane + 40%/60% O2/NO2 for a MAC of 1.0. At the end of the surgery, before the patient is extubated, the gastric volume will be evaluated by ultrasound in the right lateral position. Afterwards, the patients will be extubated and taken to the postoperative recovery room. Nausea and vomiting of patients during awakening and for the next 24 hours will be recorded. Patients' age, gender, height, weight, duration of surgery will also be recorded in the follow-up form. This data is going to be recorded manually by the principal investigator of the protocol. In the first stage, the patient is going to be evaluated in the preoperative preparation room, right lateral position on arrival while being monitored. After standard monitoring (ECG, NIBP, SpO2) is performed, the volume of the stomach will be determined by ultrasound. After the patient was placed in the operating room, preincision anesthesia was performed for a maximum of 3 minutes with IV injection of midazolam 0.5 mg/kg and sufentanil 1 µg/kg. After preincision anesthesia, the patient's left arm is placed at the patient's head, right arm is placed at the patient's waist, and his head is turned towards the opposite side. For the first sonogram; the anesthesiologist performs a perpendicular scan from the right iliac crest on the right side of the patient, so that the right hemithorax, abdomen, and pelvis can be seen. The area between the anterior end of the liver and the right hemithorax is examined. The length and width of this area will be recorded with the ruler on the monitor. In other words, the measurement of the right gastric gland will be the product of the length and width measurements. Also, in these areas, a total of 6 images (cross sections) are taken to confirm the results. After recording these values, the data is recorded on the data form. For the second sonogram, during the intubation procedure, the sonogram will be performed in the same areas. After extubation, a third sonogram will be performed; in this sonogram, the data is recorded as before. Measurements will be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm (USG probe in the right upper quadrant will be kept static and at the level of 11th rib, the cross-sectional area of the gastric antrum will be evaluated in each measurement). A ruler is placed on the monitor, and the antral lumen of the stomach is visual"

645,"The objective of the study is to determine if the addition of Mycophenolate mofetil to Intravenous Steroid therapy can reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms associated with Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP) of children. Intravenous Steroid (Methylprednisolone) is the first line treatment of HSP, but 30% of children have GI symptoms after Intravenous steroid treatment, which is refractory in 10% of the cases. Thus, there is an urgent need of a safe, effective and well-tolerated second line of treatment. The primary objective is to determine the efficacy of the addition of Mycophenolate mofetil to Intravenous steroid in improving the GI symptoms of HSP-GI in children after failure of intravenous steroid therapy (including the side effects associated with intravenous steroids), such as diarrhoea and abdominal pain. The primary endpoint of the study is to improve the GI symptoms of HSP-GI (including the side effects associated with intravenous steroids) of children after failure of intravenous steroid therapy of children 3 years of age or older, 10% improvement in symptoms; 25% improvement in symptoms; and 50% improvement in symptoms. The secondary objectives of the study are to determine the adverse events associated with Mycophenolate mofetil and to observe the duration of improvement in symptoms. The secondary endpoints are adverse events (mainly gastroenteritis / diarrhoea) and the improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms."
646,"22 million adults experienced trauma in 2017 and 31% developed PTSD, TBI, or other types of trauma exposure disorders according to national estimates. Currently, the standard of care for veterans with these disorders involves a combination of mental health services, medication, and integrative modalities. However, only ~30-40% of veterans achieve enduring improvement, and few achieve complete recovery from their trauma exposure disorder. Furthermore, veterans with exposure disorders are approximately 8 times more likely to develop addiction issues compared with veterans without trauma exposure. The study investigators aim to address this treatment gap with a novel, non-invasive, adjunctive neurotherapeutic treatment that may lead to significant benefits (i.e., reduced symptoms) for veterans with trauma exposure disorders. The treatment is a non-invasive brain stimulation procedure known as electroencephalogram (EEG)-enhanced transcranial magnetic stimulation (eTMS). In a series of studies, the study investigators have shown that trauma-related symptoms can be significantly reduced or eliminated, and that EEG-modulated neuroplasticity is likely mediating these changes. This is a randomized-control feasibility trial of the safety and efficacy of EEG-enhanced eTMS for chronic and treatment resistant trauma exposure disorders with 300 participants over 18 months. The study investigators will determine if this novel, non-invasive adjunctive treatment can improve health-related outcomes and reduce symptoms of chronic trauma disorder.

649,"Sexual pleasure is one of the factors that determines the decision to have sex and is an important factor that keeps a relationship happy. While several variables are known to affect the quality of sexual life, the relationship between sexual pleasure and the mental state has not been fully investigated. Research on the mental state, such as personality, and sexual pleasure has been carried out to determine the reasons for the satisfaction or dissatisfaction of sexual life, both on an individual and on a group level. The aim of the study was to assess the relationship between the factors that determine sexual pleasure in adult women and personality traits such as depression, anxiety, and stress. A total of 101 women between the ages of 18 and 30 were included in the study. During the study, the Beck Depression Scale, Beck Anxiety Scale, and Self-Perception Scale were examined. Sexual desire, arousal, vaginal lubrication, and orgasm in participants were assessed by using the Female Sexual Function Index tool after two months. In addition, participants were asked to answer some questions about the frequency of sexual activity, sexual desire, and experience of orgasm, and the overall level of sexual satisfaction was evaluated. The results of the study demonstrated that orgasm and overall sexual satisfaction were inversely related to depression, anxiety and stress. The results were in line with the studies in which the relationship between depression, anxiety and stress with sexual life of individuals were investigated and the results were that there is a negative relationship between these variables and sexual satisfaction. In addition, it was found that individuals who received treatment for depression and related anxiety symptoms experienced lower sexual satisfaction. Although the reasons for this relationship are not fully clear, it is thought that the negative effect of depression on sexual pleasure may be due to psychosomatic causes related to sexual function disorders. Another factor that affects sexual pleasure is personality. It is thought that individuals who are depressed, anxious and stressed have a lower sexual desire and experience less excitement due to the suppression of sexual pleasure by personality. In future studies, it is planned to explore this relationship in more detail, as it is a determinant of the healthy sexual lives of individuals."

651,"Post-radiotherapy nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a common complication of radioiodine therapy that is often overlooked due to minimal patient awareness and the lack of systematic monitoring programs. The incidence varies significantly depending on the type of radioiodine used and the administration schedule. Studies that have examined the impact of prophylactic treatment of the lacrimal system in preventing radioactive iodine related nasolacrimal duct obstruction have yielded limited results. To that end, the investigators are proposing a study designed to determine the safety and efficacy of using prophylactic artificial tears in patients receiving radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer in preventing the development of post-radioiodine NLDO.
The study design is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) including 150 consecutive participants receiving radioactive iodine therapy for thyroid cancer. After the baseline visit, participants will be randomized to either prophylactic use of artificial tears immediately following radioactive iodine therapy or no intervention. A follow-up visit to evaluate for the development of NLDO will be performed at 2 weeks from the date of radioactive iodine therapy.
The primary hypothesis is that the use of prophylactic artificial tears to treat the ocular surface reduces the incidence of post-radiotherapy NLDO compared to no intervention. The secondary hypothesis is that the early identification of post-radioiodine NLDO in patients who received prophylactic treatment of the lacrimal system might increase the effectiveness of treatment for post-radioiodine NLDO and reduce the long-term sequelae including patient discomfort and ocular surface disease."

653,"20 outpatient clinics, representing all Perinatal Care Providers (PCP) in Central North Carolina that provide prenatal care (N=26), were enrolled in the clinical trial component of the ACHIEVE initiative after a formative period. The ACHIEVE initiative brings together diverse partners in health care, community, and research to provide sustainable improvements in care for people with severe hypertension during pregnancy. In the pilot phase of the project, three community clinics worked in partnership with the Statewide Alliance for Improvement on Maternal Safety (AIM) to tailor implementation components to the healthcare setting while improving healthcare quality in the outpatient clinic setting. The project was informed by the perspectives of the clinic staff and patients to assess what makes it easier or harder to implement in the outpatient setting, as well as adapt clinic practices in order to implement the bundle in practice. The initial clinical trial enrolled providers and staff from the three clinic sites participating in the pilot phase, as well as additional providers and staff from other community clinics, in a mixed-methods approach to assess what they found most and least useful about their experience with the ACHIEVE process during a twelve-month period of time. In the clinical trial phase, each clinic's care team receives one of three multi-component implementation strategies at varying time points, to ensure a systematic process of implementation across all 20 clinics using a hybrid type III, multiple baseline design. This study is part of an overarching initiative by the AIM Collaborative called ACHIEVE (""Advancing Community and Clinical Care for Childbirth-related Hypertension Through Implementation, Engagement, and Valuing Equity""). The objective of the study is to strengthen existing health care settings' ability to implement an evidence-informed outpatient hypertension bundle and measure the impact of bundled care on maternal hypertension outcomes. This will expand the reach of evidence-based medicine in North Carolina by developing an intervention that is feasible for a variety of healthcare settings and adaptable to settings in rural, culturally diverse, and underserved communities. Findings from this study have potential to transform maternal health outcomes for clinics in Central North Carolina as well as other healthcare settings. Over 5 million people in the United States seek pregnancy care every year, including thousands of people in North Carolina. Severe HTN accounts for 9.6% of all hypertension diagnoses among individuals who gave birth in North Carolina. Nearly 17% of birthing individuals identified as Black, African American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian, or multiple races. Approximately 48.5% of birthing individuals identified as Hispanic or Latino during birth hospitalizations in 2018. Over the past 23 years, rates of severe HTN increased across all races and ethnicities. These alarming statistics underscore the need for improved recognition, response, and referral to tertiary care for people with severe HTN during pregnancy. Adaptation of the AIM outpatient HTN bundle for outpatient settings provides an opportunity to improve recognition and response to severe HTN in an accessible, patient-centered, and culturally safe manner."
654,"Abstract: Gain and Loss Framed Text Messaging to Reduce Drinking Among Older Adults. Alcohol consumption of older adults leads to greater health consequences and increased strain on health care resources than for any other age group. A significant body of literature highlights the need to address negative health consequences and reduce hazardous drinking among older adults. The goal of this study is to test the feasibility, acceptability, and impact on hazardous drinking of three different brief text-messaging interventions among older adults. We will collect data on hazardous drinking patterns, demographic patterns, and participant willingness to continue receiving text-messaging program, and data will provide a preliminary test of how effectively our text-messaging interventions change normative feedback and alter drinking behavior among older adults. This project aims to improve the evidence base around how older adult populations respond to behavioral sciences informed interventions such as text messaging. Findings can be used to (1) tailor digital health interventions more effectively among older adults to address hazardous alcohol consumption, and (2) develop, in partnership with older adults, a mobile health solution to encourage them to reduce alcohol consumption, increase participation in treatment, and improve quality of life. In addition, findings will further support the development of digital health interventions for hazardous alcohol reduction.


Brief Summary
-----------------
Alcohol consumption is the third leading cause of preventable death, after smoking and poor diet. Alcohol use of older adults leads to greater health consequences and increased strain on health care resources than for any other age group, yet alcohol interventions for this age group are limited. An increase in geriatric alcohol consumption is expected as the population ages. This project aims to reduce harmful drinking behaviors among older adults utilizing a scalable, brief, and tailored text-message digital intervention. We will collect data on drinking behaviors, drinking triggers, demographic patterns, and participant willingness to continue receiving text-messages. Three randomized text-messages arms will be compared regarding feasibility, acceptability, and impact on drinking, and will provide a preliminary test of how different types of brief text-messaging alter drinking behavior, drinking triggers, and drinking attitudes among older adults. Findings can be used to (1) tailor digital interventions more effectively among older adults, and (2) develop a scalable, cost-efficient, and long-term adherent digital health intervention for behavioral health treatment among older adults. Furthermore, findings will further support the development of digital health interventions for hazardous alcohol reduction.

655,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. There is no treatment currently approved for AD. Biochemical imaging with PET radiotracers provides an opportunity to characterise the neurobiological processes underlying AD, but there is currently no PET tracer approved for routine clinical use. PET can allow us to determine in humans when these processes arise and how they interact with each other. This is particularly important because it is thought these changes begin more than a decade before patients exhibit signs of cognitive decline. Research in this area is likely to help us understand how the disease develops and identify drug targets for effective drug treatment. 

In this protocol, the investigators propose the use of two PET tracers for imaging two different pathological biomarkers of AD. Both tracers would be injected into the same participant allowing for direct comparison between PET images derived from the different tracers. This comparative approach may ultimately help us identify the relative importance of the various AD biomarkers in understanding the pathophysiology of AD. 

[18F]-Fluselenamyl will be used for measuring amyloid beta plaques which are present as an early signature of pathology in AD. In the brain, amyloid plaques are formed by amyloid beta (Aβ). When Aβ forms these plaques, it results in dysfunction of brain cells and neuronal cell death. Plaques eventually cause memory problems and other symptoms characteristic of AD. Research studies of Aβ suggest that these plaques begin forming in the brain up to 20 years before patients become symptomatic. Once deposited, Aβ plaques are thought to initiate a cascade of events that slowly spreads through the brain and eventually leads to extensive neuronal cell death and cognitive impairment. 

[11C]-Pittsburgh Compound B (PIB) is the most widely used PET tracer for imaging Aβ in humans. In this study we will use [11C]-PIB to confirm whether [18F]-Fluselenamyl is capable of detecting similar levels of Aβ as [11C]-PIB in participants imaged within the same time frame. 

Another biomarker of AD is neurodegeneration of the hippocampus. A key challenge in the current study is that no current PET radiotracer that can reliably identify neurodegeneration in humans is readily available. To address this problem in the current study, Aim 2 proposes to validate the use of quantitative MRI to image neurodegeneration of the hippocampus in human participants diagnosed with AD. This will allow the investigators to assess the extent of neurodegeneration among participants with different Aβ burden levels determined by [11C]-PIB and [18F]-Fluselenamyl. 

Aim 3 involves the investigation of a potential relationship between amyloid beta deposition and neurodegeneration. Aim 3 of this study is to characterize the relationship between Aβ plaque burden and neurodegeneration by examining the co-localization of [18F]-FLUSENAME and hippocampal volumes in AD patients.

PATIENT SAMPLE & PROTOCOL OVERVIEW 
-----------------
The safety of [18F]-Fluselenamyl in humans will be established in 8 healthy volunteer subjects for up to 4.5 hours post injection during PET imaging. This is a critical assessment that will help to provide regulatory authorities with the required information about [18F]-Fluselenamyl to support potential future human therapeutic applications and future clinical trials with [18F]-Fluselenamyl. Dosimetry calculations performed on the preclinical data extrapolated to humans will provide supporting data for the dosage range to be used during the PET imaging studies. The safety of [18F]-Fluselenamyl will be determined by quantification of physiological and metabolic parameters following its injection. Vital signs and concomitant adverse events will also be recorded. 

The investigators will image 12 non-demented older adults with mild cognitive complaint(s) and 12 people with previously confirmed diagnosis of AD. They will be imaged with both [18F]-Fluselenamyl and [11C]-PIB PET during the same imaging session. The data will be used to assess whether [18F]-Fluselenamyl is capable of detecting a"
656,"Background: Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is a group of neurodegenerative diseases defined by progressive language deficits and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Frontal-dominant PPA (nfvPPA) and semantic-variant PPA (svPPA), in particular, present an increasing burden for caregivers and society. In nfvPPA, an atrophic pattern of cortical thinning of the inferior frontal gyrus has been described, which reflects a decreased ability of the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex to coordinate semantic and executive processes implicated in language production. Furthermore, impairments of this cortical area are associated with behavioral changes, cognitive alterations, and the emergence of neuropsychiatric symptoms such as disinhibition, apathy, and depression.
Limitations: Neuronal degeneration affects both cortical and subcortical structures. Therefore, brain stimulation techniques must involve multiple cortical regions to improve clinical symptoms. The impact of brain stimulation interventions is usually investigated during a short period. The mechanisms associated with long-term effects need to be examined.
Objective: Evaluate the longitudinal effect of non-invasive brain stimulation (TMS) combined with language exercises over one year in primary progressive aphasia.
Study design: This is a single-center, single-blinded, randomized, controlled study.
Description: Sixty patients will be randomized either to: (1) 800 pulses of sham TMS applied over the left inferior frontal gyrus associated with language therapy on a daily basis. Or; (2) 400 pulses of real TMS applied over the same region associated with language therapy on a daily basis. Each participant will undergo a baseline 3 Tesla FDG-PET scan and monthly 1.5-Tesla FDG-PET scans during the study. All imaging data will be analyzed and visualized in MRIcron software in accordance to the guidelines of the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative. All participants will be assessed monthly with the Mini-Linguistic State Examination, the Swedish Version of the Boston Interview Score, and the neuropsychiatric symptoms rating. The cognitive and behavioral effects associated with TMS stimulation will be evaluated before and after treatment at baseline, after 3 months and 12 months. Inclusion will take place between December 2020 and November 2021. The project is planned to end January 2024. Expected duration of participation is between 6 and 10 months per participant.
Ethics, patient involvement, and dissemination: The study will be conducted at the University Hospital of Linköping. The protocol and amendments will be approved by the Regional Ethics Board of Linköping and the Radiation Safety Committee. Patients, their relatives, and caregivers will have the opportunity of accessing the study results.

657,"1) Is there a difference in cognitive outcomes in patients with long COVID when treated with a standard tapering course of methylprednisolone compared to placebo? The primary endpoint is the change in cognitive function (as measured by the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire (MMQ)) from baseline to week 8 (treatment phase), week 20 (treatment phase) and week 52 (open-label treatment phase). 2) Is there a difference in other outcome measures including neurocognitive function as measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), quality of life (as measured by the PROMIS questionnaire), mental and physical fatigue as measured by the Chalder Fatigue Scale and the Fatigue Severity Score (FSS) among patients with long COVID when treated with a standard tapering course of methylprednisolone compared to placebo? 3) Is methylprednisolone safe in patients with long COVID? 4) Will 7 mg/kg Methylprednisolone be more effective than 1 mg/kg in the treatment of cognitive dysfunction and persistent neurocognitive deficits? Secondary endpoints will be the change in cognitive function (as measured by the Multifactorial Memory Questionnaire), neurocognitive function (as measured by the MoCA, SDMT), quality of life (as measured by the PROMIS questionnaire), physical and mental fatigue (as measured by the Chalder Fatigue Scale and the FSS, as well as the safety profile of methylprednisolone."
658,"185 patients will be recruited with the diagnosis of disease related malnutrition (DRM) of moderate or severe etiology (criteria GRALL classification) from the departments of Internal Medicine, Geriatrics and Cardiology and undergo an intervention of oral nutritional supplement (ONS) rich in omega-3 and olive oil polyphenols for 3 months and a follow-up period of 3 consecutive months. The objective is to study the impact of such product on malnutrition and the effect of its active constituents (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids and olive oil polyphenols) on inflammation and muscle proteolysis. The hypothesis is that the combination of active components will have a favourable modulatory effect on the inflammatory status and muscle protein synthesis thereby increasing the efficacy of medical ONS supplementation in these patients.

660,"Dental wear has multiple causes. Tooth erosion and abfraction are the most prevalent forms of tooth wear in Brazil. Dental wear leads to tooth hypersensitivity, changes in tooth color, and impaired occlusion. These conditions contribute to the aesthetic and functional demands of dental treatment. Composite resins are the most widely used direct restorative material because they are inexpensive, easy to use, and show good color and shape adaptation. There is no consensus on the evaporation time that leads to better retention and marginal adaptation of composite resin restorations at cervical lesions. Considering this scenario, dental practitioners may benefit from the information that this study will produce.
Methods: A randomized clinical trial will be performed. The objective is to perform a study using two universal adhesives with a prolonged or shortened evaporation time of the solvent and their effect on the marginal retention and marginal adaptation of a composite resin applied on non-carious cervical lesion (NCCL) restorations."

Interferon-α for Chronic Hepatitis C Virus Infection in a Real-world, Non-research Clinical Setting: The Italian Cohort

Description
-----------------
Chronic HCV infection represents a major threat to human health worldwide. The introduction of interferon and pegylated interferon with or without ribavirin (RBV) as anti–hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy transformed a chronic infection into a chronic disease, as a large number of persons with chronic HCV successfully cleared the virus. However, more recently, an unprecedented success in treating chronic HCV infection has been achieved with the introduction of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). All-oral, DAA-based regimens are well tolerated, noninferior to interferon-based therapy and often superior to treatment with interferon alone or in combination with RBV. The sustained virologic response now achieved in approximately 95% patients is associated with a decreased risk of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and thus may result in the normalization of aminotransferase levels and cessation of antifibrotic therapy. Given the safety, duration of treatment, and higher rates of sustained virologic response in naïve HCV-infected patients receiving the new oral DAA therapies, it appears appropriate to reexamine the role of first-line peginterferon treatment in this population, and, in addition, to evaluate and implement optimal treatment approaches for patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis when second-line DAA-based therapy is contraindicated or not available. The Italian Cohort for Chronic Hepatitis C (ICCHC) is a multicenter longitudinal observational study on the clinical course and outcome of DAA-naïve HCV-infected patients treated with standard-of-care interferon and/or ribavirin therapy in a real-world, non-research clinical setting in Italy. The aims of the ICCHC are to monitor in the long term patients treated with peginterferon alfa ± ribavirin therapy for chronic HCV infection, to analyze the risk factors associated with drug-related adverse events and premature treatment discontinuation, to evaluate the predictors associated with sustained virologic response, to compare the clinical outcome of all the peginterferon alfa ± ribavirin treatment regimens used in routine clinical practice, and to collect data on patients who are intolerant to these drugs or in whom the use of these drugs is otherwise inappropriate.

664,"Ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas (PDAC) is the 5th leading cause of cancer death in both developed and developing countries. Most of the patients with PDAC underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple) to achieve local control of the disease. However, total pancreatectomy (TP) for PDAC has been performed in some patients in whom the tumor abuts or involves both gastroduodenal and splenic arteries. However, after splenic arterial ligation, some patients may experience pancreatic insulin-dependent diabetes. Recently, more and more TP has been performed for pancreatic ductal cell adenocarcinoma (PDCA) which abuts or involves both gastroduodenal and splenic arteries. Warshaw's procedure (spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with excision of splenic vessels) has been safely performed for years. Likewise, both pancreatic tail and spleen can be preserved after excision of splenic vessels for leftward extension of pancreatic parenchymal transaction line during Whipple (WOTSA). In that case, TP can be replaced by WOTSA. The purpose of the current study is to assess the safety and efficacy of a new technique Whipple over the splenic artery (WOTSA) as a treatment for PDAC which traditionally requires total pancreatectomy (TP)."

These messages are created to provide the necessary information to the fathers, increase their emotional and social support, and increase breastfeeding by using WhatsApp as a tool. 6) Fathers apply scales on the first, 42nd and 12th day of their stay here and on the day that they take their babies, and the mothers also apply some scales on the first, 42nd and 12th day of their stay here and on the day that they take their babies. 

Brief Summary
-----------------
Maternal and child health plays an important role in the development of a healthy society and a healthy life expectancy. In countries where breastfeeding has spread and supported, breastfeeding rates are higher and mortality rates in infants are lower. According to the data of the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2014, 23 countries in the world did not reach the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months of the baby in the first 24 hours after birth. Similarly, in other studies, it is reported that while only 28% of the women breastfeeds exclusively in the first 6 months in the world, this rate is 22% in South Africa, 21% in the Philippines and 4% in China (Hunter et al., 2018). Breast milk provides infants with the necessary nutrients, which are known to have both short- and long-term effects on the baby's health. Breastfeeding has been shown to have positive effects on child development, and the results obtained from various international studies show that there is a reduction in the mortality rate of infants, obesity in infancy, sudden infant death syndrome, and allergic diseases (Lawrence et al., 2006; Chauhan et al., 2013; Taveras et al., 2010). Breast milk has been reported to have a protective role against inflammatory processes by providing immune protection (Dunkel et al., 2003). In addition, immunological activity is found in breast milk, which shows antimicrobial activity (Achiron, 2005). The role of breast milk in preventing the development of diseases is very important. Studies have shown that when children are fed artificially, they need to take extra vitamins and antiseptics to prevent illnesses such as diarrhea. Studies conducted in developing countries show that there is a significant increase in both mortality and morbidity due to diarrhea when breastfeeding is not ensured (Aduayom et al., 2016; Ebih et al., 2011; Njenga et al., 2012). On the other hand, breast milk supports the bond between the mother and the baby and it is claimed that breast milk also affects the cognitive functions of the child (Cakici Tekcan et al., 2017). However, despite the proven benefits of breast milk, the lack of breastfeeding knowledge in families and the lack of breast milk support in both the private and public health sectors may negatively affect breastfeeding.

Breastfeeding practices in our country are not satisfactory in terms of World Health Organization (WHO) and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommendations. However, when the practices between 2012 and 2017 in our country are examined, an increase in the rates of breastfeeding both immediately and in the first 6 months is also observed. According to the latest data of our Ministry of Health, the breastfeeding practices among postpartum mothers in Turkey are at a good level. A total of 93,2% of mothers start to breastfeed, and a total of 59,9% are breastfeeding their babies at the 1st month after birth and a total of 25,0% are breastfeeding exclusively up to 6 months. It also states that women who have a university degree and are older than 30 years old are both more likely to give early and exclusive breastfeeding (MOH, 2017). While the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6"
666,"This is a multi-centre retrospective study of patients who have PIK3CA mutations. The primary objectives are to describe patient characteristics and treatments received, as well as number of tests for PIK3CA mutations performed. The secondary objective is to understand barriers and facilitiators to PIK3CA testing, and patient and provider perspectives on PIK3CA testing and PIK3CA test results.

Background
-----------------
PIK3CA mutations are common in ER+ breast cancer but, while the data are still evolving, there is some suggestion that PIK3CA mutations are associated with a poorer prognosis and a worse overall survival outcome. Since patients with PIK3CA mutations appear to have a different tumor biology and prognosis, determining a patient's PIK3CA mutation status will have management implications for patients whose disease has progressed on hormonal therapy.

Objectives
-----------------
The primary objective is to describe patient characteristics, treatments received and number of tests for PIK3CA mutations performed. The secondary objective is to understand barriers and facilitators to PIK3CA testing, and patient and provider perspectives on PIK3CA testing and PIK3CA test results.

Study Design
-----------------
This is a multi-centre retrospective cohort study that will include health records from patients who have received PIK3CA mutation testing in the context of routine treatment for primary or metastatic breast cancer at participating breast oncology clinics. This includes all patients who meet the eligibility criteria during the study entry period and have a PIK3CA mutation test result.

Target Sample Size
-----------------
A total of approximately 50 eligible patients are expected to have been tested for PIK3CA mutations across all sites during the study entry period. 

Inclusion Criteria
-----------------
Patient must: Have been diagnosed with advanced breast cancer between 01 January 2015 and 30 June 2020; Have had a PIK3CA gene status test; Have had a PIK3CA gene status test and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status assessment in the 12 months following the primary diagnosis of advanced breast cancer; Be ≥18 years at the time of initial diagnosis of primary or metastatic breast cancer.

Primary Outcome
-----------------
The number of tests for PIK3CA mutations will be abstracted from each patient's treatment records. In the event a patient has a biopsy and PIK3CA status is known, their record may be included in the number of tests conducted.

Secondary Outcome
-----------------
The study timeframe will be from study entry (i.e. date of enrolment in the study) until the date of data collection for the study or the date of death, whichever occurs first. Clinician documentation of the reason for PIK3CA testing will be categorized into 1 of 4 categories: 'as standard of care,' 'pre-operative evaluation of tumor for surgery,' 'pre-operative evaluation of metastatic tumor,' or 'suspicion of hereditary mutations from family history.'"

Eligible patients must have an advanced malignancy with HER2 amplification or activating mutations that is considered by the investigators to be incurable or refractory with standard therapy. Patients are allowed to have received no more than 3 prior treatments for advanced malignancy except in the rare instances outlined below. Treatments for early tumours are permitted if they have no impact on the results of laboratory tests that will be used to select treatment for the clinical trial. Treatment decisions for paediatric patients will also be made with the consideration of their clinical status with respect to the need to obtain disease or tumour control prior to commencing with the clinical trial treatment. Eligibility will be determined after screening procedures including medical history evaluation, a complete physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests including tumour and blood samples as well as radiological exams including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) or X-ray scans, bone-scans, or positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans. Patients will receive an individualised approach to therapy. Each patient must undergo a fresh biopsy so that the genetic profile of their tumour, including HER2 amplification or mutations in the HER2 gene can be identified for that patient. The trial's principal objectives are to investigate the efficacy of trastuzumab and pertuzumab combination therapy in treating rare tumours. Hypothesis 1 is - that for any given sub-group the DCB rate at 24 weeks will be >=15%. Hypothesis 2 is - that there will be at least one disease group in which the DCB rate at 24 weeks will be >=20%.

The measurement of the metabolites of the renin-angiotensin system and its variation after treatment with oXiris will be performed on blood samples collected in the framework of research prior to starting dialysis and under dialysis on blood, analyzed by LC/MS . Several inflammatory markers and sepsis markers will also be measured in the same samples by RT-PCR.

672,"Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) is technically challenging in cases with prior Cesarean section (CS) due to surgical adhesions. However, according to previous studies, total laparoscopic hysterectomy is considered a safe and effective procedure for women with prior CS. To the best of our knowledge, the impact of urinary bladder dissection technique on postoperative morbidity and outcomes has not been previously investigated in cases with prior CS. The aim of this trial is to evaluate whether a lateral approach may reduce urinary bladder injury and thus minimize the risk of urinary tract damage during total laparoscopic hysterectomy in cases with prior CS.

675,"1. Purpose and rationality
(1) Since Turkey is a low breastfeeding rate country compared to the rest of the world, providing practical support to fathers is important for breastfeeding in our country.
(2) Breastfeeding rates in Turkey  are around 72%-78%.  However, the rate of breastfeeding initiation after birth and the continued breastfeeding rate are declining day by day.  In 2019, the breastfeeding rate in the first six months was 50.7%, the breastfeeding rate after 180 days was 43.8%, and the breastfeeding rate after 3 months was 15.7% .
(3) Therefore, studies using training as an intervention tool for breastfeeding support are important for determining the effects of training on maternal and infant outcomes, increasing breastfeeding duration and increasing breastfeeding self-efficacy.
(4) Although Turkey has higher breastfeeding rates compared to low and middle income countries, it is still below the desired level .  It is known that breastfeeding self-efficacy is high in mothers whose babies are breastfed for at least 180 days.  The role of fathers in increasing breastfeeding initiation, continuation and duration is also crucial.
(5) However, there is still no intervention or training protocol to support fathers.

In other countries, studies have been conducted to address this gap, and fathers have been provided with theoretical and practical information on breastfeeding during labor and the early neonatal period.  In line with this information, many studies have shown that fathers who attended the training became more involved in breastfeeding, felt more effective to breastfeed, and increased their self-efficacy towards breastfeeding .
(6) Although breastfeeding support training studies were conducted in some countries, there is nothing about the training protocol in our country.
(7) Our study aims to close this gap by developing a breastfeeding support training protocol for fathers of our country in line with the literature.
2. Research questions
(1) Breastfeeding initiation
(2) Continuing breastfeeding
(3) Breastfeeding maintenance
(4) Breastfeeding self-efficacy
(5) Father-child bonding

3. Study type and hypotheses:
3.1 Study type
This study is a randomized controlled trial.  The study includes three groups: Experimental Group 1: which received face-to-face breastfeeding support training for both mothers and fathers, Experimental Group 2: which received face-to-face breastfeeding support training for mothers only, and control group: which did not receive any intervention.
3.2 The hypotheses of the study are as follows:
(1) Breastfeeding initiation will be high among the mothers who received face-to-face breastfeeding support training for both mothers and fathers.
(2) The fathers who received face-to-face breastfeeding support training for both mothers and fathers will be more effective in performing breastfeeding tasks.
(3) Dads who receive face-to-face breastfeeding support training for both mothers and fathers will feel happier to help breastfeed than dads who receive no training.
(4) Dads who receive face-to-face breastfeeding support training for both mothers and fathers will have higher breastfeeding self-efficacy levels than their peers.
(5) Fathers who received face-to-face breastfeeding support training for both mothers and fathers will have a more positive bond with their baby than fathers who received no training.
(6) Breastfeeding initiation, rate, duration will be higher among mothers who receive face-to-face breastfeeding support training for both mothers and fathers.

4. Study Design.
The study design is in line with the study's methodology.  A randomized controlled study design was used in the study.  The subjects will be randomly assigned to the three groups.  Since the sample size of this study was 81, it was decided to use a block randomization method.  It was made in blocks of 9 individuals.  Cards were prepared and the cards on which the study groups were written (EG1; EG2; control group) were placed on the back and on three different sheets.  By taking 9 cards at a time from the bag, the first 9 cards were randomly placed in group 1, and the following 9 cards were randomly placed in group 2, and so on.  In the end, block randomization method was used in the study.

Young adult women, particularly those who access family planning services, are at high risk of alcohol or drug misuse. There are few evidence-based treatment interventions for young adult women that have the potential to reduce harm from alcohol and drugs and to improve overall health functioning at low cost to the healthcare system. This is a multi-pronged study of an innovative strategy (SBIRT) to increase substance use screening, brief intervention, and referral to care at family planning clinics across the Northeast U.S. We will study its effectiveness for reducing alcohol and/or drug misuse and improving overall health functioning, and we will assess its sustainability. The study has 4 components: A single-arm, pre-post design pilot intervention effectiveness study comparing changes between pre-intervention and post-intervention baseline periods (approximately 1 year total) before the implementation phase commences at 4 family planning clinics. A cluster randomized effectiveness study comparing interventions (pre-intervention vs post-implementation vs post-sustainment) across 3 sub-phases (12 months total) at 4 family planning clinics. A quasi-experimental effectiveness study comparing interventions between pre-intervention and post-intervention periods within each of 4 clinics, conducted during the 12-month implementation phase. To examine potential effects of the implementation strategy, all 4 clinics will receive usual-care SBIRT training and implementation efforts. A prospective cohort qualitative implementation study conducted between baseline and endline to elucidate implementation barriers and facilitators. In this study we will assess how a well-established family planning organization, operating across 8 cities, has successfully scaled this intervention across family planning clinics in 3 cities, adopting local processes and policies which are appropriate to the regional landscape.

Intervention Description:: This study includes 4 components: Baseline Pilot Intervention Effectiveness Study: During a 12 month pre-intervention (baseline) period, we will conduct a single-arm, pre-post design pilot intervention effectiveness study comparing changes between pre-intervention and post-intervention baseline periods at 4 family planning clinics: 3 sites will be compared to a 4th site which has already completed SBIRT training. Cluster Randomized Effectiveness Study with Usual-care Comparison: We will then conduct a cluster randomized effectiveness study comparing interventions (pre-intervention vs post-implementation vs post-sustainment) across 3 sub-phases (12 months total) at 4 clinics. Providers and clinicians receive SBIRT training at each site during the preparation phase. Then, the 4 training sites will be randomized to either pre-intervention, immediate implementation, or post-sustainment conditions beginning in Month 12. Participants: All patients of clinical staff who provide family planning services will be screened at each site. During the pre-implementation period (Months 1-11), patients will be referred for a full SBIRT assessment with a dedicated SBIRT clinician if they screen at an elevated risk for substance abuse and/or addiction. During the implementation phase (Months 12-23), all patients seen at the clinic during the visit window will be screened and will either receive a full SBIRT assessment from a dedicated SBIRT clinician or will not, based on assignment to intervention condition. During the post-sustainment phase (Months 24-35), all patients seen at the clinic during the visit window will be fully screened by an SBIRT clinician (SBIRT-Clinician). In addition, all patients will be asked to complete a follow-up survey (SBIRT-Patient). Throughout, all clinical staff will be trained on how to screen, assess, or refer patients to the SBIRT program as part of their standard procedures. In the post-implementation and post-sustainment phases, we will analyze whether receiving SBIRT services is associated with positive health outcomes among the family planning clinic patients, using generalized mixed effects regression models that adjust for baseline characteristics and that account for clustering by practice site. In both of these phases, clinicians, coordinated by a master trainer, will receive in-person training in implementation strategies during the preparation period. In the post-sustainment phase (Months 24-35), we will explore whether the implementation strategy promotes"

We have designed the study to ensure that all participants are well-informed of what they might expect from trial participation, and that any concerns they may have are fully addressed, and any uncertainties about the potential effects of rhubarb, green tea and senna are fully and carefully explained. During the study, rhubarb root, green tea or green tea with rhubarb root will be consumed for 3 weeks with a follow-up collection of samples and data at the end of the intervention period. The study is expected to show that senna and rhubarb root teas have an effect on total cholesterol, triglyceride and lipid concentrations in plasma. We hypothesise that these health outcomes will be improved and that this may be related to dietary habits, change in health related quality of life. Furthermore, we hypothesise that rhubarb root alone has a more beneficial effect on lipid levels and BMI compared to green tea alone."

681,"Patients with cancer are increasingly being treated in academic medical centers (AMC) and regional cancer centers that deliver state-of-the-art care but are often far from where their patients live. Unfortunately, traveling from home can be unavoidably difficult, time-consuming, and occasionally too stressful for patients and families to tolerate. Many of these patients also experience financial toxicity because their insurance often requires high deductibles and co-pays, as well as lodging costs incurred by them or their family members while traveling. Additionally, patients are frequently dissatisfied with their physician-patient interactions, and they are particularly dissatisfied with their health care experience outside of their home centers. However, AMCs and cancer centers may want to consider care transition as an alternative to avoid the disruption in continuity of cancer care and patient-physician relationship that might result if these facilities choose to limit their services to patients in the catchment area. Therefore, we propose a natural experiment study to examine factors that influence AMC and cancer center patient preference for receiving their care closer to home versus continuing to receive care at their usual site."

683,"The colonoscopy and subsequent surgical treatment are the fundamental method of prevention of cancer of the colorectum in patients, with risk factors for the disease (e.g. history of adenoma of colon). There is a consensus on the need of regular colonoscopies, especially in patients, who had already a history of adenoma. However, there are serious problems regarding frequency of surveillance colonoscopies and the decision on the duration of surveillance colonoscopes. It is well known that the majority of colorectal neoplasms, that recur during the surveillance period, are the microsatellite instability with high mutation burden. As MSI-H colon carcinoma and its microsatellite-instability (MSI-H) neoplasms seem to be similar, it would be reasonable to offer more frequent colonoscopy (4 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, or longer period, depending on the patient) or extended period of surveillance (5-6 years) only to patients with MSI-H lesions found on the index colonoscopy. Therefore, it would decrease the cancer risk by avoiding the unnecessary colonoscopy procedures. Unfortunately, MSI-H status of the lesion could be determined only after resection of the lesion and genetic test. In previous studies, we have confirmed that the mutation burden in MSI-H lesions could be 100-times higher compared to adenomas, with microsatellite-stable status. As MSI-H lesions are detected in 3-5 % of adenoma of the colon, this mutation burden could be 1000 times higher in these lesions. Our main hypothesis is that mutational status of the lesion could reflect the neoplastic risk of the patient, and we will analyze it on the lesions resected during index colonoscopy.

684,"Malnutrition is a prevalent entity worldwide. In Europe, the prevalence ranges from 3% in the general 
population to 60% of frail elderly individuals. However, malnutrition is a multifactorial disorder and 
the precise mechanisms are largely unknown.
Currently, the definition of malnutrition still relies on the presence of anthropometric parameters 
and on the level of nutrients in the body. To address this issue, new indicators are needed to better understand 
the relationship between molecular, metabolic and bioenergetic markers with clinical outcomes. Thus, the 
development of new markers of malnutrition can allow earlier diagnosis and new therapeutic approach.
Therefore, this project focuses on studying malnutrition as a complex multifactorial disease, not only as a 
phenotype, but as a disease entity.
In the last decade, interest in extracellular vesicles (EVs) has increased due to their potential use as 
drug delivery systems (DDS). EVs are small (20-100 μm in diameter) vesicles (liposomes) originated from many 
cell types, including endothelial and adipose cells, macrophages, neutrophils, as well as erythrocytes and 
platelets. The study of EVs presents several advantages since they can originate from a diverse source 
and they facilitate protein sorting and membrane trafficking. For that reason, EVs play an essential 
role in many pathophysiological processes through the transfer of bioactive molecules and their 
interaction with target cells.

685,"Nearly 1 million Americans are living with Parkinson's disease (PD), and this number is expected to grow as life expectancies increase. People living with PD often face challenges related to disease and medications that result in an inability to move or experience a lack of sensation. These challenges negatively affect an individual's cognitive, emotional and physical function, reducing their physical activity participation and ability to live independently. Physical inactivity has negative consequences on the health and quality of life (QoL) of people with PD. The most significant negative consequence of physical inactivity in people with PD is the loss of quality of life. An individual's physical activity and exercise levels often decline after the diagnosis and over time. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to gain a better understanding of how people with Parkinson's disease (PD) manage their physical activity and exercise participation with different levels of support from their communities and clinicians. The investigators expect to find evidence based solutions to this problem.

Brief Summary
-----------------
The goal of the proposed research is to compare the effect of two different delivery of palliative care interventions for frail cognitively normal older adults on functional decline. As an exploratory component of the study, the hypothesis to be tested is that a combination of palliative advance care planning (ACP) decision-making with a brief interdisciplinary palliative care/geriatric intervention will demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in a) functional status, b) quality of life and c) less hospitalizations and emergency room visits

Detailed Description
-----------------
The goal of the proposed research is to compare the effect of two different delivery of palliative care interventions for frail cognitive non-deficient (FCND) older adults on functional decline. As an exploratory component of the study, we will compare the two intervention in relationship to hospitalizations and emergency visits. To perform our study, we will identify eligible participants in the community and inpatient setting and randomize them to one of the four study groups (ACP, ACP and brief palliative care intervention, standard care, and standard care plus brief palliative care intervention). The intervention will consist of an initial assessment (to include review of medical records, charting review, review of the code status and surrogate designations, advanced care planning discussions) and follow up visits, in which we will conduct a geriatric assessment including: frailty risk assessment, depression and anxiety screenings, physical and cognitive function assessment, pain management evaluation and medication reconciliation, medication rationalization, and comprehensive goal-based care planning. Additionally, a palliative care team (including a geriatrician, nurse and social worker) will meet monthly to review the patients' progress and recommend clinical interventions including appropriate referrals. The intervention will occur within 3-5 days and last between 2-4 weeks. Primary outcome measures will be measured at baseline, 6-months, and 12-months. Secondary outcome measures will be measured during the same study period. The number of participants required will be 40 per arm for a total of 160 subjects. This sample size permits a 4% (effect size) improvement in the composite primary outcome measure, with 80% power and 5% two-sided α-error.

687,"The intervention (MIE  = mechanical insufflation-exsufflation)  is to be used at 8 to 12 h intervals in ICU patients 2 times or 14 x per day. MI-E is currently not part of the standard care in all ICUs in Denmark. The intervention is not intended as an alternative to routine therapy, but should be performed in addition to and if possible not simultaneously  with suctioning (=routine therapy) of the endotracheal tube or manual hyperinflation. A patient should only  receive the intervention if the ICU care team  is convinced that the patient has the potential of receiving MIE therapy and not necessarily in all days of the ICU stay.

The outcome of efficacy is to establish whether the intervention will reduce the incidence of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP)  and  duration on mechanical ventilation.  Furthermore, the outcome of safety is to evaluate whether MI-E  is safe. 

Part 1 is a small sample trial of 60 patients investigating the feasibility  of implementing MI-E in ICUs in Denmark. 

Part 2 is a subsequent randomized clinical trial of MI-E in 1000 patients  within the same cohort of ICUs. If MI-E is not safe or feasible in Part 1 or Part 2, or if the effect on VAP is not significantly different, then the trial will stop recruiting. We will however assess the effect of MI-E on the duration on mechanical ventilation and ICU mortality. 

Economic analysis of MI-E therapy: The cost of MI-E will be compared with the cost of ICU care in general  in patients with an expected duration of mechanical ventilation of more than 48 hours. It will also include the  cost in the non-intervention group.

Besides Part 1 and 2 the following outcomes will be assessed: 
 
Adherence of implementation
 
Acceptability
 
Appropriateness
 
Measuring the amount of time needed to perform MI-E (feasibility)
 
Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), (efficacy).
 
Assuming the prevalence of VAP around 20% and a clinically relevant reduction  of 20% reduction in VAP between  treatment and control group MI-E is associated with a number need to treat (NNT)  of  5 if VAP occur in 20% of the patients. This means that in total  5 patients must be ventilated and then treated with MIE for 4 weeks (14 sessions).

Duration of mechanical ventilation (efficacy). 
 
In the preliminary study  we observed that  the median  duration of  invasive mechanical ventilation was 7.2 days  (IQR 4.7-15.7) for patients intubated with endotracheal tubes for more than 48 hours. 

Mortality (efficacy)
 
Assuming  the prevalence of VAP around 20% and a clinically relevant reduction  of 20% reduction in VAP between  treatment and control group MI-E is associated with a NNT of  5 if VAP occur in 20% of the patients. This means that in total  5 patients must be ventilated and then treated with MIE for 4 weeks (14 sessions). 
 
Mortality is not an outcome related to mechanical interventions, but is necessary to obtain statistical power to detect a meaningful difference in the effect of MI-E and to provide information on the safety of the intervention. 
 
Ventilator free days (efficacy). 
 
The following patient characteristics will be assessed: demographic characteristics, SAPS 2 score at admission, Acute Physiology Score (APS)  at inclusion and severity of illness at each day while on mechanical ventilation (based on vital signs, laboratory results and organ dysfunctions)

691,"15 patients undergoing surgery are assigned randomly to one of the two treatment groups: a treatment group receiving conventional premedication consisting of diazepam 10 mg 45 minutes before surgery and a placebo group receiving normal saline 45 minutes before surgery. The aim of the study is to determine whether the addition of a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist to premedication attenuates the severity of postoperative pain. The following parameters will be recorded for each patient: maximum pain score within 48 hours postoperatively, additional analgesic requirements within 48 hours, degree of nausea, degree of anxiety, adverse events and patient satisfaction. To ensure random allocation, a computer-generated randomization list is used. This process is performed by an investigator who is not involved in the analysis or presentation of the results and is not aware of the patient's allocation. The allocation will be concealed by placing the participants in identical white envelopes that are numbered in case they are accidentally opened. The only exception to this rule is in case of emergency treatment or when a serious adverse event occurs. After randomization, the patients are given their study medication in accordance with the treatment assignment. Pain is measured on a numerical rating scale ranging from 0 to 10 (with 0 being no pain and 10 being severe pain), and additional analgesic requirements are assessed by the clinical staff. Nausea and anxiety are measured on four-point Likert scales, and adverse events are recorded in the patient's medical record. After the surgery, the patients are asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire. The questionnaire asked patients to rate the quality of their surgical experience on a scale of 1 to 5 and to specify whether they would recommend the same procedure to a friend or family member. A score of 1 indicated that they were highly satisfied with their surgery, while a score of 5 indicated that they were not satisfied or recommended the same procedure to someone else. Study results: The main finding of our study is that the addition of a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist to conventional premedication attenuates the severity of postoperative pain. Specifically, patients who received the selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist had less pain 48 hours postoperatively compared to the control group. In addition, patients who received the selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist had lower postoperative analgesic requirements and fewer adverse events compared to the control group. However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in terms of nausea, anxiety or patient satisfaction. Our results support the use of selective histamine H1-receptor antagonists as an adjunct to conventional premedication for reducing postoperative pain with minimal adverse events in patients undergoing surgery. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that the addition of a selective histamine H1-receptor antagonist to conventional premedication reduces the severity of postoperative pain in patients undergoing surgery. This finding has important implications for clinical practice and could lead to the development of new treatments for postoperative pain."

693,"PROSPER is a pilot randomized controlled Trial (RCT) and a qualitative study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of Problem Management Plus (PM+) as an intervention for Dutch prisons and for developing the interventions (i.e. supervision, training and fidelity) for future implementations. Problem Management Plus (PM+) is a brief, psychological intervention program that will be adapted to the Dutch prison context. It is an evidence-based program that targets anxiety, depression, stress, and self-identified problems among the target population. PM+ is a transdiagnostic program, meaning that it is effective in addressing multiple different mental health conditions in a single intervention. To date PM+ has been tested to be an effective intervention across a wide number of different settings (e.g. primary health care, public mental health services, university/school campuses). While PM+ is a brief program, a large body of research demonstrates that it can substantially reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. However, the present study will be the first RCT outside the United Kingdom and Australia (where PM+ was developed). PROSPER is a mixed methods study. This means that we will be conducting both an RCT (study phase 2) and qualitative studies to assess whether PM+ (1) is feasible to implement and whether staff and participants (2) find the intervention beneficial and acceptable."
694,"α-Naphthyl acetate (α-NAA) is a naturally occurring chemical that has been shown to reverse or block drug resistance in a variety of cancer types in preclinical model systems. Xevinapant is a prodrug analog of α-NAA which can be converted to α-NAP to target the drug transporter called p-gp. Xevinapant has several attributes that make it an attractive therapy: 1) it is taken orally in capsule form and does not require intravenous (IV) delivery; 2) it may overcome p-gp resistance, allowing for more effective uptake of other cancer therapies; 3) it is safe and well tolerated; and 3) it will be developed in combination with an existing p-gp inhibitor, the targeted therapy enzastaur (TAK-779/Ensartin®), which is FDA-approved for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Based on preclinical studies, we hypothesized that xevinapant (in capsule form) in combination with radiation and platinum- or taxane-based chemotherapy will be safe and effective for treating selected patients with unresectable HNSCC.


Background
We will evaluate xevinapant in combination with radiation and platinum- or taxane-based chemotherapy in patients who have non-metastatic stage III or IV locoregionally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN). We will examine the effect of increasing doses of xevinapant on the occurrence of side effects and effectiveness of treatment.

Study Design
This is a Phase I/IIa, open-label, sequential dose escalation and cohort expansion study of xevinapant in combination with carboplatin, paclitaxel, and radiation therapy in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The study design is illustrated in Figure 1. In the initial dose escalation phase of study, the investigator will determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) or highest dose evaluated in this study. This will be accomplished via the administration of increasing doses of xevinapant in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle, and radiation therapy 3 times per week for approximately 7 weeks, in patients with nonmetastatic head and neck cancer. A dose finding phase will determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), which will then be evaluated in a dose expansion phase of study. Participants will begin xevinapant treatment at a lower dose than MTD, which will then be increased up to the MTD/RP2D dose in 28-day cycles. The dose will be increased until the occurrence of an unacceptable toxic effect or when 3 or more participants in a dose cohort have a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) which is defined as 2 or more toxicities that are thought to be related to xevinapant and are CTCAE grade 4 or worse within 28 days of dosing. The MTD/RP2D for xevinapant will be defined as the maximum dose studied that does not meet the above criteria for DLT.

Determination of xevinapant dose to be administered
Following treatment with radiation and chemotherapy, participants will continue with standard of care xevinapant therapy (N =60) for 3 cycles in the expansion phase of study.

Eligible patients must have histologically confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (SCCHN of the oral cavity, oropharynx, larynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, or sinuses).

697,"BACKGROUND: Major depression is one of the leading causes of disability in the Danish population. It is estimated that 170,000 Danes have current major depression. In addition, about 15-20% of patients with depression show treatment resistant patterns following the initial period of treatment. Patients that show treatment resistance can show a number of problematic clinical patterns, including high co-morbidity, frequent and severe suicide attempts, frequent episodes of depression, and low responsiveness to pharmacological and psychological treatment. Patients with chronic treatment resistant depression often seek treatment in the secondary health care sector and the majority are in need of long-term pharmacological treatment. Clinical experience from treating chronically depressed patients has found that many of them have problems with poorer-than-expected response to pharmacotherapy, poorer-than-expected long-term prognosis and lack of focus on quality of life improvements, and show psychological and personality patterns that are often difficult to change with standard depression treatment. One such pattern is the development of avoidant, passive and hopeless personality traits in response to adversity, which may interfere with psychotherapeutic engagement and compliance. Treatment of this patient group can be a challenging prospect for therapists. There is currently no established treatment of choice for patients with treatment resistant depression. There are a number of promising approaches that claim to be more effective than standard treatments for depression, including schema therapy, but studies are mostly open label. A recent systematic review found that treatment for patients in the secondary level health sector who are treatment resistant can improve the patients' quality of life but has unclear effects on symptomatology. However, the review did not take into account the severity of depression as a moderator of treatment response. There are promising alternatives, such as schema therapy, that can benefit from randomized controlled treatment effect studies. The study is designed as a randomized controlled multicenter trial. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study will include 400 adult participants with chronic mild to moderate treatment resistant depression (defined as a 12-months history of treatment resistant current major depression), who will be randomly assigned to receive either a prolonged period of schema therapy or extended standard treatment as usual in the secondary level mental health sector. The primary objective is to determine whether schema therapy affects depression symptomatology better than standard treatment as usual at 12 months after baseline. The primary outcome for depression symptomatology will be the reduction of symptomatology after 12 months on the clinician-rated Hamilton-6 Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D6). Secondary objectives and measures will include the effect of schema therapy compared to standard Depression treatment as usual on patient-defined improvements, quality of life, avoidance of medication, avoidance of inpatient setting and improvement related to health services use. Additional secondary measures will include the effect of schema therapy on negative expectancies, patient-centered outcomes of quality of life and personal recovery, psychological functioning, health-related quality of life, symptom avoidance, health-care resource use, subjective therapeutic response and outcome expectancies. 
 A number of novel outcome measures will be tested in relation to the patient's motivation towards psychotherapy and psychological wellbeing. Finally, a number of proposed modifications of the standard Minimal Stressor and the Major life Stressor questionnaires will be tested regarding ease of use, usefulness as a diagnostic tool and reduction of the number of missing values when participants are asked to provide data about events happening in the previous 12 months rather than in the previous 12 years. The findings are expected to give more insight into the mechanisms of change in psychotherapy for treatment resistant depression and will provide preliminary information about possible subgroups responding differently to schema therapy. If schema therapy is found to be superior to standard Depression treatment as usual, the study will provide a basis for the design of future studies that further establish schema therapy as the treatment of choice for treatment resistant depression.
