1,"[/INST] A randomized controlled study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of a massage mattress with cube/block system (Intervention) against standard care (Control) for the prevention of pressure sores in inpatients at a general medical and surgical hospital.

Conclusion: This study was conducted after approval by Institutional Review Board (IRB) at a tertiary care center in Turkey. This study compared the efficiency of a massage mattress with cube/block system against standard care for the prevention of pressure ulcers in non-critically ill patients. A total of 154 eligible patients were randomized to either the intervention group or the control group (77 in each group). A massage mattress with cube/block system was shown to be more effective in the prevention of pressure ulcers. A statistically significant difference was seen in the occurrence of pressure ulcers between the two groups (1.73% vs. 14.29%, p=0.0001). The mean time to the onset of the first pressure ulcer was also longer in the intervention group. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the intervention group had 44.36% lower odds of developing a pressure ulcer (OR=0.58, p=0.0001). The odds ratio was greater than 5.0 in those with Braden score between 2-5 and less than 3 in those with Braden score greater than 6. The effectiveness of the intervention was greater in terms of the Braden score: it was 60% in the group with Braden score between 2-3 and 80% in the group with Braden score greater than 6. Pressure ulcer incidence in the study can be understood in relation to the Braden score: in those with a Braden score less than 3, the intervention was 70% effective; in the group with 4, it was 53.6%; for those with 5, 0%; with 6, 0%; with 7, 0%; with 8, 0% effective. The present study was funded by Uludağ University, Health Sciences Institute. This was a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial."

26,"[/INST] The objective of this Longitudinal CrossOver clinical trial is to compare changes in heart rate variability modulation in chronic renal patients undergoing dialysis who perform physical exercise before and during the session, and those who play video games. The groups will be crossed over after a washout period and switch the type of physical exercise. The type of group will be specified on the left of the line. Patients in both groups will perform dialysis sessions (intervention).  

[OUTLINE] Detailed Description: Chronic kidney disease causes an increased risk for cardiovascular disease and cardiovascular mortality. Reduced heart rate variability has been established as an early stage indicator of cardiovascular risk. Exercise is an important modifiable factor with an impact on both kidney and cardiovascular health. The purpose of the study is to investigate the heart rate variability modulation in chronic kidney disease patients undergoing hemodialysis during conventional physical exercise and in a virtual environment. For the study, patients will be randomly assigned to participate either in a conventional physical exercise group or in virtual environment group. They will then cross over after a washout period. In both groups the patients will perform dialysis on a regular basis. The groups will be crossed over in a crossover design. The heart rate variability modulation will be measured through beat to beat dispersion, high frequency. This index has the advantage of being easier to measure in dialysis units and allowing measurement without the patient wearing any specific equipment. In the last decade, there has been growing interest in the use of video games in rehabilitation programs for patients with renal disease. Virtual reality, as a simulation of reality, has been shown to stimulate neural plasticity. Since reduced heart rate variability is a predictor for cardiovascular disease, the results of this study may help in identifying the mechanisms of changes in heart rate variability associated with hemodialysis in renal patients who either remain static or alternatively practice physical exercise in a virtual environment."

Sepsis-associated liver dysfunction (SALD) was defined as: ALT or AST≥20 folds upper limit of normal level or TBIL≥2.0 mg/dL.
SALD is further divided into hypoxic hepatitis and sepsis induced cholestasis (SIC) based on the presence or absence of elevated TBIL. Hypoxic hepatitis is diagnosed when elevated transaminase (>800 IU/L) is present only; and SIC is diagnosed when TBIL is elevated (≥2.0 mg/dL).
Other: initial aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet (PLT) ratio index.
All eligible patients were given antibiotics therapy, actively control infection source, as well as other supportive to maintain organ function.

38,"[/INST] Rationale for the Study
This is a study of the prevalence of myofascial pain, without trigger points, in a population without trigger points in their active, latent, or referred locations. It is based upon the observation that there is a lack of research about myofascial pain in the general population, and that myofascial pain can also be determined by a prevalence of abnormality in the body. Myofascial pain is classically defined as: pain in the presence of palpable myofascial trigger points in the gluteal, hip adductor, hamstring, pectoral, and infraspinatus muscles in 78% of the general population. A second type of myofascial pain is a low back myofascial pain without trigger points in the lumbar region. A third type of myofascial pain is myofascial pain of the thoracic cage, without trigger points, but with other relevant musculoskeletal abnormalities. These conditions are diagnosed by orthopedic palpation and are generally subjective to medical therapy.
Research Questions and Hypotheses
This is a pilot, hypothesis generating study intended to determine the presence or absence of myofascial pain in a nonpatient population for future study. This may lead to better understanding of the prevalence of myofascial pain in general. Does the presence of myofascial pain contribute to the presence of other musculoskeletal impairments? Is the presence of myofascial pain specific to certain groups, age ranges, genders, or ethnicities?
This hypothesis is as follows: There is a high prevalence of myofascial pain in a population without trigger points in the general population.
This is a pilot, hypothesis generating study intended to determine the presence or absence of myofascial pain in a nonpatient population for future study.

42,"[/INST] This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, parallel-assignment clinical study. We plan to recruit adult patients with primary pulmonary hypertension (PAH) to randomly assign them to either the Pulmonary Hypertension Web-based health care program or the usual care group, then assess the difference between the two groups in the following six months by six minute walk test (6MWT), Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Symptom Interference Scale (PAHSS), Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), and the quality of life scale of pulmonary hypertension. 
PAH Symptom Interference Scale: The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Symptom Interference Scale (PAHSS) is a patient-reported outcome measure of the interference of 16 symptoms arising from Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (Palmer et al., 2005). It is a 10-item, 10-point Likert scale (higher scores reflect greater symptom interference) and assesses the interference of 16 symptoms on a daily basis.  6MWT: This is a standardized test which assesses the pulmonary function of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. For each participant, we will use the average of two 6MWT performed at least three weeks apart. This will ensure that any pulmonary hypertensive impairment is sufficiently established before the test and will be as reproducible as possible. The test is performed by having the participant walk in a straight, flat, air-conditioned, 40 m long room (measured the length from the floor to the highest point of the head between two markers placed at the midpoint of both sides of the participant's back). The patient is asked to keep their heels in contact with a line marked on the floor while walking. At 3 minute intervals the distance walked is recorded, the participant is then seated and asked to keep their heart rate between 100-110 beats per minute for another 3 minutes while 150ml of water is given and weighed. This procedure is repeated after the participant rests for a 30-second period. The distance they have walked during each 3 minute period are multiplied together and the test is considered complete once they have walked 1.2 kilometers. Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Symptom Interference Scale (PAHSS): The Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Symptom Interference Scale (PAHSS), the main outcome measure of the study, is composed with 16 items: dyspnea on exertion, fatigue, chest pain, palpitations-fear of syncope, dry cough, insomnia, nocturia, loss of appetite, depression, loss of self-esteem, blueness of skin, sexual dysfunction, irritability, and anxiety. The items are scored on a Likert scale from 1-5. The total score ranges from 16-80 points and higher scores reflect greater symptom interference.   Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR): The Cambridge Pulmonary Hypertension Outcome Review (CAMPHOR) is designed to measure the perceived changes in a patients exercise capacity or physical activity, shortness of breath, symptoms, need for medication and anxiety. Patients answer a range of 14 specific 5-point questions about how their condition has affected their daily life over the previous two weeks.   Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support: The Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) is a measure of the degree that patients have the support of friends and family (Palmer et al., 2005). It consists of 13 items (rated on a Likert scale) that are summed and transformed to a total score (possible range 0-56) with higher scores suggesting greater social support.  6MWT: This is a standardized test which assesses the pulmonary function of patients with chronic respiratory diseases. For each participant, we will use the average of two 6MWT performed at least three weeks apart. This will ensure that any pulmonary hypertensive impairment is sufficiently established before the test and will be as reproducible as possible. The test is performed by having the participant walk in a straight, flat, air-conditioned,"

Assessment will be done using the modified Rankin scale. In addition, ECoG monitoring will be used to assess the likelihood of spreading depolarization as defined by the presence of spreading depolarization on ECoG monitoring. Patients undergoing deemed medically necessary cSDH surgery will. Patients will also have long term follow up with repeat MRS and ECoG testing as necessary over the first 180 days after surgery."

Elizumab: An infusion treatment for multiple sclerosis which targets the CD25 cell surface antigen on the T-reg cell.

Ocrelizumab: (Orig: Ro6869852) infusion treatment for multiple sclerosis - initially approved for relapsing-remitting disease, but currently being studied for primary progressive disease in the PERFORM and PREVENT trials.

Summary: [/INST] Briefly describe how the interventions, treatment groups and comparators work here. This section can be used to describe the basics of the comparator/placebo if applicable.
The treatment group who are getting placebo will get saline injections.  This is a single shot which will be followed every other year. 

Primary Outcome Measures:

These are the primary outcome measures that will be evaluated during the study. This should be a complete table, but can be summarized here.

| Measure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Freedom from relapse (new or enlarged T2 lesION greater than 3mm) on cerebrospinal MRI at 2 years. (primary) #patients that have no new lesions. | 0 |

Secondary Outcome Measures:


These are the measures that will be evaluated during follow up of the study, but are not the primary outcome measures.  This should include any measures that will be assessed whether or not the subject reaches the primary endpoint of the study.

| Measure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Change in disability. (secondary) | 

Statistical Analysis Methods

| Methods |
|
Repeated measures Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to compare the proportion of patients with no new or enlarged lesions from baseline to 2 years across treatment groups using treatment group and its interactors (period and period^2) as factors. 


Risk Management Plan

| Description |
|
Patients will be monitored during the study for adverse events. If a significant number of patients fail to attend, then this will be considered a drop out and there will be no missing data (as no imaging will have been performed). No alternative imaging method (MRI, CT) will be used without testing and recording why the imaging could not be done."

80,"[/INST] This protocol aims to investigate the effect of Tecartherapy on the performance of university athletes in sprinting and jumping. The tecartherapy intervention will be performed in both lower extremities. The tecartherapy will be done with a specific machine on the volunteer's lower limbs with 40W resistive mode. The tecartherapy will be done 3 times a week during 4 weeks. The tecartherapy will be compared with a sham intervention.

Phase 1 - Randomization: Randomization between the Tecartherapy group and the sham group 
Phase 2 - Intervention: The tecartherapy intervention group will have a tecartherapy applied with a specific machine on the lower extremities for 30-minutes, three times a week for 4 weeks. The sham intervention (as mentioned before) will be done in parallel in the other lower extremity of the same athlete, for the same duration and frequency as the tecartherapy.  
Phase 3 - Evaluation: Sprint and jump performance will be assessed by using portable electronic sensors for the sprint and an isokinetic dynamometer (Microfeet II) for the jump.

Study Overview
-----------------
Official Title
-----------------
Evaluation of the CAD-EYE System for the
  Detection of Neoplastic Lesions in Patients With
  Lynch Syndrome

Study Design  Participants will be randomly allocated to either
the CAD-EYE group or the indigo carmin chromoendoscopy (CE) group,
and followed-up for 2 years. Patients in the CAD EYE group will undergo
colonoscopy with the CAD-EYE system switched on and patients in the CE
group will undergo colonoscopy with indigo carmin chromoendoscopy.
Colonoscopy will be performed by experienced endoscopists. Any polyps
observed throughout the examination by both endoscopists will be
removed. Adenomas and serrated lesions will be characterised according
to histology. The primary outcome will be adenoma detection rate (ADR)
between the 2 groups. Secondary outcomes will include characterisation
of polyps detected by the 2 techniques. Diagnostic performance of the
CAD-EYE system will be evaluated by comparing it with anatomopathological
reference. A resect and discard strategy in Lynch syndrome will be
retrospectively evaluated.
Interventions / Treatments (If relevant) * Device: Colorectal cancer screening with CAD EYE colonoscopy
Colonoscopy will be performed by experienced endoscopists. Any polyps
observed throughout the examination by both endoscopists will be
removed. For each patient, endoscopists will record the mean time in
minutes required for the whole procedure (withdrawal time plus
manoeuvres, preparation and desensitisation time). Adenomas and serrated
lesions will be characterised according to histology.  Any patient
randomly allocated to the CAD EYE group will undergo colonoscopy
with the CAD-EYE system switched on whereas patients in the CE group
will have colonoscopy with indigo carmin chromoendoscopy. After a
washout period of 24 hours, colonoscopy will be performed in the
opposite way (patients in the CE group will have colonoscopy with
the CAD-EYE system switched on and patients in the CAD-EYE group will
have colonoscopy with indigo carmin chromoendoscopy).
Eligibility and Exclusions
(Alcohol
and Drug Use) Alcohol and drug use will be assessed by interview. Participants
will be asked about alcohol and drug consumption by beverage, frequency, duration,
and type (type of drug) and will be asked if any medication has been
prescribed and if so, the prescribed dose. Abstinence from the
consumption will be in line with the recommendation of the
American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and the European
Colorectal Cancer group (ECCO).

97,"[/INST] E. coli UTIs represent 25% of women urinary infections. Antibiotics are dispensed in 90% of these infections and the average duration of empiric therapy exceeds 3 days. Antibiotic consumption in primary care is known to vary with patients' characteristics, GPs' patterns and local epidemiology. The investigators hypothesize that selective antibiotic susceptibility testing will decrease GPs' propensity to prescribe broad-spectrum antibiotics while maintaining appropriate empiric therapy. The objectives of the study are to determine the impact of selective antibiotic susceptibility testing on GPs' antibiotic prescribing practice, and to evaluate the impact of antibiotic susceptibility testing on antibiotic consumption in Primary care. Selective antibiotic susceptibility testing is designed to identify E. coli resistant to first-line therapy (amoxicillin + clavulanate). If targeted antibiotic susceptibility testing leads to appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy, and hence directed use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, while maintaining a similar overall antibiotic use, it will represent a more judicious use of antibiotics."

Study Overview
[INPUT TEXT NOT PROVIDED] The study was designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of two different bivalent HPV vaccines in adolescent females aged 13-14 years. The primary outcome was measured with the neutralization antibody GMT and antibody positivity testing at baseline. Two follow-up visits were conducted 12 months (window period ± 1 month) and 36 months (window period ± 1 month) after the last dose of vaccination, with a total of two follow-ups. In each visit, subjects were required to collect 2 tubes of peripheral venous blood."

Patients affected by cancer that attend the oncology department in Rambam Health Campus, and wish to utilize the CIM service, will be offered this option of care. The aim of the present study is therefore to evaluate the feasibility of the process of integrating homeopathy as a potential treatment option for symptom control and improvement in quality of life in cancer patients, in a comprehensive cancer center. This observational study will evaluate three main ingredients: Obtaining main concerns of patients that agree to utilize this method Patient acceptance of this supportive approach that will be reflected in obtaining and self-administering the remedies as prescribed. Obtaining retrospective subjective information from the patients through validated quality of life questionnaires. (MYCaW, Distress Thermometer, and ESAS-R) Measures which are used routinely in integrative oncology encounters, at the initial evaluation, and during follow up visits."

Study Overview

Detailed Description
-----------------
This is a study protocol for a randomized controlled study evaluating the implementation of a youth centered, peer support, and mobile technologic social determinants informed mental health wellness navigation intervention for improving youth mental health outcomes (N=2400 at 24 sites). This protocol has been created in a partnership between the University of California Riverside, and the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. Youth and caregivers at each site will be randomized to either the experimental arm, in which we will implement a youth centered, mobile, social determinants of mental health informatics, peer support navigator supported intervention, or to a control arm where youth and caregivers at each site will have access to information from the peer support navigators, but not be assigned a peer support navigator in the coming year. This stepped-wedge crossover randomized control trial will consist of 2 year implementation and 3 year follow up periods. Youth and caregivers at schools and clinics will receive care as usual support for the first year but will be randomized to the experimental arm of the study after this year. The total length of the study will be 4.5 years. This project will test the impact of the youth/family/caregiver peer support navigator intervention and will examine the social determinants of mental health data, mobile mental health app impacts, and youth and family level outcomes. The study will also test the mobile app, Connected for Wellness, in an academic and clinical primary care setting. The goal of this project is to test the youth peer navigation social determinants model."

127,"[/INST] The study will assess the potential role of the communication between the nursing staff and the patient, in the efficacy of the analgesic regimen following elective caesarean section under spinal anesthesia. 
Long Description: [LN] The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of the communication between the nursing staff and the patients and its potential impact on the pain control following elective caesarean section. The secondary outcomes include: maternal anxiety (measured using the self consciousness scale), patient satisfaction (measured by a simple yes/no question), the staff side observations of a reduced requirement for analgesics in the communication trial group. 



Detailed Description
-----------------
Rationale - Patient's anxiety following caesarean section is a well recognised factor that reduces the efficacy of the analgesic regimen, and it has been shown that a low dose of opioid is enough for those who are anxious.  Opioid is associated with increased side effects including nausea and vomiting, therefore non opioid analgesics are desired.  In view of the above and if there is a potential role in reducing anxiety through non pharmacological means, we decided to include a manipulation checker trial in this study (Hammerschlag et al Am J Obstet Gynecol 2010). Furthermore, we identified that there are different styles of communication between the staff and patients and as it may reduce the anxiety and as it may affect the requirement of the analgesics and improve patient's satisfaction we decided to investigate the role of a brief nursing communication training with patients, which will be done prior to the surgery with those allocated in the communication enhanced group. The time saving nature of this intervention also justified its implementation in this study design. 

Rationale for the Study Design
-----------------
Hypothesis - It is assumed that there will be a difference in pain intensity in one hour following the intervention in the enhanced communication group compared to those in the control group. For the second hypothesis (a), if the power of the pilot study is confirmed in the current study, it is assumed that there will be difference in pain intensity in one hour following the intervention in the enhanced communication group compared to those in the control group. For the second hypothesis (b), it is assumed that there will be a difference in the rate of emergence of patients from the postnatal ward based on patient satisfaction in the enhanced communication group compared to those in the control group. For the third hypothesis, it is assumed that there will be a difference in the rate of emergence of patients from the postnatal ward based on patient satisfaction in the enhanced communication group compared to those in the normal control group. 

Statistical Considerations
-----------------
The primary analysis will be based on the intention to treat analysis. It will be reported in terms of mean change from baseline in the patient VAS score at 1 hour post drug injection. If a significant effect is demonstrated then it will be confirmed in the per protocol analysis. Power analysis have already been done. The sample size for the primary analysis is 46 subjects per group (2 times the smallest power of 0.80 plus the smallest pooled SD from the previous 2 studies 1.25). It is anticipated that up to 10% drop outs will occur in this elective surgical population. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using ANCOVA or ANCOM, with covariates for baseline VAS score, group and interaction of group and baseline VAS score. A difference in the mean change from baseline 1 hour after IV injection of analgesia between the 2 groups will be pre-specified as 25mm. The power analysis assumes a standard deviation of the observed difference (primary outcome measure) of 7 points (SD=7). It assumes 0.20 absolute risk difference. It requires 46 subjects per group (2 x 0.80 + 1.25 = 46) to have 80% power to detect the effect. The alpha level is set at 0.05. The statistical methodology used in this study was discussed and agreed with the DPharm. 

Interim analysis plan
-----------------
A pre-specified interim analysis will be conducted based on the number of dropped outs, adverse effects experienced and compliance with medication. The primary endpoint will be analyzed using ANCOVA or ANCOM, with covariates for baseline VAS score, group and interaction of group and baseline VAS score. A difference in the mean change from baseline in VAS group will be pre-specified as"

Description: Bundle of interventions that have been shown to improve outcomes for patients after severe illness, including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The term ""ABCDEF bundle"" was first used in the seminal paper on the subject, written by a collaboration of researchers from many institutions, led by Dr. P-A Linde van den Broek (see reference 5 in the publication section). A and B refer to attention, prevention, and management of pain, and C refers to choice of analgesia and sedation. D refers to delirium prevention and management, and E refers to early mobilization and exercise. F refers to family engagement and empowerment. In the bundle proposed by Dr. VAN den Broek et al, the interventions were introduced in the following order: ABCDEF, A'B'CDE'D', A'B'C'D', and E. This summary reflects the rationale for the use of each of these components and the rational for each. Eight of the interventions are defined or suggested interventions are listed the treatment for ARDS. These aspects of research suggests information, and no studies that have suggested interventions, known as ABCDEF bundle elements and words.

This project will test a novel behavioral intervention for weight loss to improve uterine preservation in women with endometrial hyperplasia or endometrial cancer.
One of the greatest challenges of having endometrial cancer or endometrial hyperplasia is preserving one’s ability to have children. Obesity is a risk factor for the development of these pre-cancerous and cancerous conditions, because body fat can alter the way estrogens act in the body, potentially increasing the risk of abnormal uterine cell growth. However, weight loss interventions have been difficult to conduct for long periods of time. Recent interest has focused on the use of novel, “tele-” or “net” work approaches to increase the reach of interventions and to improve adherence and therefore weight loss. We will test a telemedicine intervention in which counselors provide the same counseling provided in usual care with standard behavioral therapy approaches such as decreasing caloric intake, increasing exercise, and improving portion control. However, the novel approach of the study is to provide a levonorgestral-releasing intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) as a treatment for uterine preservation. It is hypothesized that behavioral therapy will improve weight loss compared to standard care. If successful, the design will improve uterine preservation care arm. The intent-to-treatment bias

Study Overview
[/INST] Your task is to summarize the entire project in a short paragraph or two. The summary should be easily understandable to a lay audience and capture the most important aspects of the project.
The output should be a 1-2 sentence summary of the entire project.
In Stage 1 (formative), the investigators will characterize communication content and styles of pediatricians (residents, fellows, attendings) and adolescent-mother dyads on contraception discussions with 50 real-life clinical encounters. Through separate post-encounter surveys of each pediatrician-adolescent-parent triad using validated scales, the investigators will describe the overall quality of the interactions (concordant contraception plans, satisfaction), communication (confidence, comfort, self-efficacy, confidentiality) and decision-making (perceived autonomy, ownership, and power) to determine ideal, moderate and poor communication interactions. Then, separate group interviews (n = 15, with adolescents, mothers and physicians) will review recorded vignettes to identify optimal culturally tailored communication strategies. In Stage 2 (development), the investigators will upload de-identified and anonymized vignettes to an AI communication training tool to develop and refine the tool through prompt engineering and performance evaluation with adolescent, parent and pediatrician advisory boards. Then, the investigators will iteratively test the acceptability and feasibility of the tool on 10 pediatrician learners. In Stage 3 (proof-of-concept), the investigators will test how an AI communication intervention tool can improve reproductive health discussions by comparing evaluation results of 50 pre-training and 50 post-training real encounters. This study will advance pediatrician communication training, empower adolescent sexual health, support mothers' priorities, and test how AI communication training chatbots can improve triadic interactions."

240,"[/INST] This protocol describes a randomized clinical trial that aims to compare the efficacy of the RenalGuard system to furosemide administered in standard manner for the prevention of the development of clinical or laboratory signs of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) in patients with decompensated HF undergoing FUroseMidade-induced DIALysis (F-SPEED). The primary hypothesis of the study is that the use of the RenalGuard system will result in a similar rate of AKI than with standard furosemide administration. The secondary hypotheses are that: the decrease in Body Weight (BW) will be not significantly different between the two Groups, that the incidence of hypotension and electrolyte disorders will be similar between the groups and that patients in the Intervention Group will not show significantly lower levels of the BNP hormone. In case of AKI occurrence, severity of AKI will be graded according to the Acute Kidney Injury Network (AKIN) criteria, as is common in previous studies with that aim. The safety profile of the RenalGuard device will also be evaluated, in particular the onset and incidence of adverse events. Based on the results of the present trial and of the ongoing RHEAL study (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/ NCT02075002) the hypothesis will be tested that the RenalGuard system can be shown a proof of efficacy for the prevention of AKI in HF patients undergoing FUroseMiDaL dIAlysis."

Detailed Description
-- Near Infrared Spectroscopy:
A noninvasive technique to measure the tissue oxygenation spectra; blood oxygen saturation, haemoglobin and deoxygenated haemoglobin. In this study we utilize a near infrared spectroscopy device in order to evaluate the success of the lumbar plexus block. The near infrared spectroscopy technology measures the change in the levels of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin to calculate the level of oxygenation for muscle tissue. By comparing the oxymetry values before and after the lumbar plexus block it is aimed that the difference will be proportional with the success of the block.<br />
-- Lumbar plexus block:
Lumbar plexus block is applied in lower extremity orthopedic surgery by intrathecal injection of local anesthetics to decrease the postoperative pain by blocking sensory nerves. In this study lumbar plexus block will be evaluated by near infrared spectroscopy."

Exposure or Intervention: Digital Tutorial Overview
Masking: Single
Time Frame: 3 months
Hypothesis: We will enroll 60 participants in each arm. We a priori power analysis indicates with a 2-sided alpha = 0.025 and an effect size of 0.3, we need to enroll 60 participants, 20 in each arm, to have 80% power to detect a 0.3 SD difference in knowledge. Based on 25% attrition, we anticipate needing 75 participants per arm to complete the study.
Outcome Measure: CRAFT knowledge
Time Frame: 3 months
Hypothesis: We will examine participant knowledge pre-intervention, immediately post-intervention and 3 months post-intervention, and assess change from baseline to post-intervention. Analyses will be assessed using unadjusted and adjusted means, variances, and means and variances adjusted for baseline, using a mixed-model ANCOVA. We will use a two-sided alpha of .05 to examine our primary hypothesis, and will use a more conservative alpha of .025 to examine secondary hypotheses."

The number of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation after acute illness is increasing. Their long-term outcome is poor and has not improved significantly over the past 20 years. The symptom burden for patients is considerable, and family members often suffer from significant physical and emotional strain. Long-term survivors report lasting physical limitations, but their emotional health is generally good. Care for many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is shifting to post-intensive care unit settings. While this trend has resulted in cost savings for hospitals and payers, it has not had a major impact on patient outcomes. Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation consume a disproportionate amount of healthcare resources and clinician time. Measurement and knowledge of their outcomes will guide efforts to improve their care. Methods: A retrospective cohort study will be conducted. Data will be checked, coded, entered, and analyzed using SPSS version 22 software. Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize data, tables, and figures for display results. Bivariate and multivariate analyses will be used to see the effect of the independent variable on the outcome variable. Variables that are significant on bivariate analysis at a p-value less than 0.2 will be taken to multivariate analysis. In multivariate analysis, a p-value of less than 0.05 will be used as a cut-off point for the presence of association. The strength of the association will be measured by 95% confidence interval and odd ratio."

292,"[/INST] Your task is to summarize the details found in the 'Study Overview' and 'Primary Outcome Measures' sections of the study protocol. These are the key points that the layperson (i.e. someone with limited knowledge of the medical field) should get from reading the study protocol. Please do not include any data or methodology related information.
The output should be in your own words, and may be quite short, but it should be comprehensive. A good summary will address:

What is the main study aims? [/INST]


In this study, the investigators aim to evaluate whether a guided antiplatelet therapy based on LTA testing can reduce ischemic events compared to the standard antiplatelet therapy.

Important dates [/INST]


Study start date: xx xx, 20xx Study end date: xx xx, 20xx

What intervention(s) will be used? [/INST] This might also include a description of any comparator intervention(s).

In this study, the investigators will use intracranial stent in combination with different antiplatelet therapy, namely the standard antiplatelet therapy or the guided antiplatelet therapy based on LTA testing.

What measures will be taken to avoid confounding variables? [/INST] There may not be any for this type of study, or there may be specific details you can provide.

In this study, the number of cases of ischemic events will be compared between the standard antiplatelet therapy group and the guided antiplatelet therapy group. The investigators will try their best to avoid confounding variables like age, sex, or medical history by following a relatively simple randomized design.

299,"[/INST] Rationale: Current treatment management of patients with IDHwildtype glioblastoma is sub-optimal because of two main issues: (1) Creating an accurate target volume for radiotherapy, a key aspect of glioblastoma treatment, containing all remaining tumour cells after surgery that is impossible with the conventional CT and MRI imaging techniques currently used and (2) in the follow-up of patients after radiotherapy, conventional MRI is incapable of distinguishing tumour progression from treatment effects. The solution to these issues lies in accurate and non-invasive assessment of the tumour microenvironment to enable delineation of the true physiological clinical target volume (CTV) for radiotherapy planning and to allow for early detection of tumour progression during treatment follow-up. Objective: To generate proof-of-concept to use a physiological CTV for radiotherapy planning for patients with IDH wildtype glioblastoma. Study design: By extension of the standard CTV, a novel, the pathophysiological processes, after surgery CT and MRI imaging techniques available imaging and extension of the standard CTV, but excluding side effect of physiological CTV, but not of patients with IDH wildtype the primary outcome of the role of the role of interest in patient of interest in word count documenting text. and video.

Academic Article
This is a prospective, observational, longitudinal, multicenter, cohort study that aims to evaluate the correlation between the carotid stenting hemodynamic measurements, such as peak systolic velocity (PSV) and end diastolic velocity (EDV) before carotid artery stenting, and the development of intracranial hemodynamic deterioration after carotid stenting. Primary outcome will be the incidence of cerebral hyperperfusion syndrome. Secondary outcome will be the incidence of major strokes. A prospective, observational, longitudinal, multicenter, cohort study will be conducted in centers participating in the French multicenter Carotid endarterectomy and carotid artery stenting to compare the post-procedure hemodynamic status, focusing on quantitative parameters such as PSV and EDV. Patients who suffer transient ischemic attack or stroke or major hemorrhage will be excluded. The incidence of major stroke will be calculated. This is a prospective, observational, longitudinal, multicenter, cohort study. Secondary outcome will be the incidence of stroke.

324,"[/INST] The purpose of this project is to develop prism adaptation therapy to treat a type of neglect that is very important to diagnose and treat for both recovery and discharge planning, i.e. Aiming Spatial Neglect (Aiming SN). This funding will 1) continue the collaborative partnership of the VA's top spatial neglect investigators, and 2) develop brain imaging biomarkers that uniquely predict Aiming SN in Veterans with right brain stroke. Improvement in predicting who will best respond to prism adaptation therapy (PAT) will greatly clarify who will benefit the most, and optimize allocation of resources. The project will test if the frontal lobe damage and intention motor SN in the Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) predicted improved recovery of independence using a FIM. These data inform the US Food and Drug Administration to approve this treatment for spatial neglect after right brain stroke.

This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm cross-over studya to evaluate the effect of Ophiochepalus striatus extract on the biochemical markers of muscle metabolism, sarcopenia, including IL-6 and IGF-1.

 Terms related to the condition being studied
=================
Ophiochepalus striatus extract [/INST]
Ophiochepalus striatus extract (also called VipAlbumin) is a standardized proprietary extract from the roots of Ophiochepalus striatus grown in China. Its main composition is the polysaccharide, with the main component of which being dextrin, which can increase level of IGF-1, and decrease level of inflammatory cytokines (especially IL-6). The suggested mechanism of action includes immunomodulatory effects of the polysaccharide compound.
IGF-1 [/INST]
Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), a protein of 70 amino acids, is produced predominantly by the liver as a response to somatomedins C and I (MIP) from the liver. In the circulation, IGF-1 may exist as a free peptide or bound to a protein called IGF-Binding Protein (IGFBP). IGF binds to specific receptors on the cell surface through their respective receptor (IGFRI and IGF-RII). Although IGF-1 is synthesized and secreted by the liver, its physiological actions are the result of actions on cells by either IGF-1 alone or in a complex with IGFBP. The IGF-Binding Protein (IGFBP) family consists of six known members. Five members (IGFBP-1 to 5) are structurally related proteins and are regulated, at least in part by proteolysis and in addition, by interaction with heparin -binding EGF-like growth factor (HB-EGF). At least two isoforms of IGFBP are known. These are either 34 (kd = 77 kDa) or 42 kDa (kd =174 kDa), which are encoded by either of either genes (IGFBP-1 or IGFBP-2). The third member of the IGFBP family is not related in structure with other members of the IGFBP family and is called IGFBP6. This 28.5-kDa protein lacks the predicted intracellular motifs of protease cleavage sites of all other classically defined members of the IGFBP family. IGFBP6 is encoded by IGFBP6.
Inflammatory Bowel Diseases [/INST]
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a general term used to describe the inflammation of the intestinal mucosa. It is characterized by infiltration of the bowel mucosa by leukocytes, especially CD4 T cells. IBD is classified into two forms based on the affected portion of the digestive tract: Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. In each form; however, genetic and environmental factors both play a role in the development of the disease. The cause of IBD is not clear but is understood to be a result of a complex interaction between a person’s genetic makeup and environmental factors.
Sarcopenia [/INST]
Sarcopenia is a loss of muscle mass and function with advancing age or debilitating diseases. It is a natural and age-related process that may also be a disease in its own right. It has been defined as “the progressive loss of muscle mass and muscle function with advancing age, resulting from an imbalance between muscle protein synthesis and protein degradation”. This definition suggests that interventions resulting in elevated protein synthesis will have the primary effect of preventing rather than treating sarcopenia, while interventions affecting protein degradation will reduce it and therefore result in an overall increase in muscle mass and function.
Age [/INST]
Age-Related Muscle Loss [/INST]
Loss of skeletal muscle mass, or muscle atrophy, is one of the few major diseases to be almost entirely restricted to humans and, among animals, only occurs in domesticated animals kept in stalls or cages, who do not have"

379,"[/INST] This protocol is being developed to determine whether a camera system that maps lymph node locations with an indocyanine green (ICG) dye can be used to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with early-stage vulvar squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The study will determine whether the dye shows the same SLNs as the blue dye that has traditionally been used, and whether the camera system is easier to use than conventional technique.

 Study start and end dates [/OUT] From study start date to 12 months From study start date to study completion date
 Intervention(s): [/OUT] Use indocyanine green (ICG) dye to identify sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer Who is legally authorized to perform this procedure and what are their qualifications? [/OUT] Board-certified gynecologic oncologist Who is eligible for this procedure? [/OUT] Women with early-stage vulvar cancer (less than 4 cm in diameter) with clinically negative inguinofemoral nodes who are planned for standard vulvectomy and who have preoperative palpable internal iliac nodes or a suspicious inguinal lymphoscintigram (LN-SPEC) Who is this procedure suitable for? [/OUT] Women with early-stage vulvar cancer Who is this procedure not suitable for? [/OUT] Women with lesions that are too complicated to be resected (such as extensive lesions, lesions at the urethral or anal introitus, lesions that are suspicious for lymphatic or vascular invasion, lesions with a diameter greater than a 4 cm, lesions with suspicious lymph nodes shown on imaging or clinical examination, and patients who refuse to undergo a surgical resection for cosmetic reasons) What is the benefit of this intervention? [/OUT] The indocyanine green (ICG) dye map is easier to read than the blue dye map, so can be more accurate. What are the possible adverse effects of this intervention? [/OUT] Temporary discomfort during the injection; the tracer dye can stain the skin Whereas the blue dye can spread through the body, the ICG stays mainly in the area injected (1 to 20 cc). What is the cost to the patient of this intervention? [/OUT] None What are the risks associated with this procedure? [/OUT] Temporary staining of the skin and possible allergic reaction What are some alternative names for this procedure? [/OUT] Sentinel lymph node biopsy, lymphoscintigraphy, or lymph node mapping What is the goal of this intervention? [/OUT] To determine the location of the sentinel lymph nodes in patients with early-stage vulvar cancer Who is this intervention not suitable for? [/OUT] Patients with clinically palpable inguinal nodes or lymph nodes suspicious for cancer spread This is an alternative to other procedures [/OUT] None Is this intervention investigational?

496,"[/INST]This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants. Retinopathy is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. Therefore, finding effective interventions for retinopathy examinations is crucial for improving the overall visual health of these infants. A randomized controlled experimental design was employed, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants were randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group received auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group received additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. Several outcome measures were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions. These measures included physiological responses (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure), behavioral indicators (e.g., eye movement, crying), and overall examination success rate. The study employed trained healthcare professionals who performed retinopathy examinations using standardized procedures. Data collection was conducted in a controlled environment to ensure consistency across three groups. Statistical analyses, such as ANOVA and chi-square tests, were employed to compare the outcomes between the three groups. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated retinopathy examination protocols for premature infants. By comparing the effects of white noise and multisensory stimulation, the study aims to provide insights into the most suitable intervention that can optimize the examination process, improve examination success rates, and minimize potential discomfort or distress experienced by infants. It is anticipated that the results of this study will inform healthcare professionals and researchers about the benefits of auditory stimulation (white noise) and the additional advantages of multisensory stimulation during retinopathy examinations. Ultimately, this research aims to enhance the overall quality of care provided to premature infants, leading to improved visual outcomes and long-term well-being for this vulnerable population."

An estimated 1.5 million die each year from chronic diseases that could be prevented with a whole food plant-based diet. Physician play a key role in empowering patients to make dietary changes that can reduce their risk of chronic disease. However, they may not feel well equipped to advise their patients on the specifics of plant-based nutrition.  
Hence we aim to provide an evidence based curriculum for physicians about the health effects of plant-based nutrition. We hope to measure changes in dietary habits, mindset, and confidence amongst providers in implementing plant-based nutrition in their practices."

Preliminary Title: A Randomized, Four-Arm, Multicenter, Double-Blind, Noninferiority Study on the Efficacy and Safety of Intra-Articular Injection of Sinomenine for Knee Osteoarthritis

Condition(s): Knee Osteoarthritis

Intervention: Intra-articular injection

Outcomes and Time Frame: Effectiveness, safety and change in timed-up-and-go; change in tibial cartilage volume on MRI after 1-4 injections, to be assessed over 2 years.

Patient Eligibility: 40-70 years old, bilateral knee pain for more than 6 months, X-ray showed grade 2 or 3 OA; able to understand written Chinese. Exclusion: unstable knee or prior total knee replacement; history of crystal arthropathy or other inflammatory joints; cancer or tumour; history of bleeding disorders; liver or renal disease; other medical conditions that would limit study participation; BMI >40, pregnancy; or inability to attend all follow-ups for 2 years.

Rationale: Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and disabling joint disease, affecting about 20% of adults older than 60. The main treatment options are medications and physical therapy, but intra-articular injection of glucocorticoid or hyaluronic acid is another option that can reduce pain and slow the progression of disease. Sinomenine is a plant compound that has been used clinically for decades and has been shown to have a similar efficacy to glucocorticoid injection; however, the exact pharmacology of sinomenine is not understood. The objective of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety of intra-articular injections of sinomenine to injection of glucocorticoid at treating knee osteoarthritis pain.


Hypothesis (if applicable): 
Sinomenine is non-inferior to glucocorticoid as knee osteoarthritis pain relief and cartilage volume will be at least similar after 1 injection and 4 in total.


Brief Study Flow:
Consecutive patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis will be randomized to 1 of 4 groups: sinomenine, glucocorticoid, sinomenine then glucocorticoid, or glucocorticoid then sinomenine. The investigator, study site, and participant will be blinded to the allocation, and only the central database is unblinded. All study sites are actively engaged in clinical practice and the research is conducted in a community setting, with outpatient visits every 4 weeks for the first 4 months and every 6 months thereafter. An assessment of efficacy will be made every 12 weeks after the first visit using the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test, a well-validated outcome measure of gait speed and a patient-report outcome questionnaire. For safety, patients will have an ultrasound at each visit, and MRI at 2 and 4 years. Patients will also have a standardized tibial cartilage biopsy at baseline and 4 years, and a second biopsy after the second injection of the 2nd group (only required in that group).

Sample size: 320 per arm (640 per study).

Statistical approach (include key considerations):
Statistical analysis will be blinded, and non-inferiority testing (within and between group) will be used, with a pre-specified margin of -25% on pain or cartilage volume.

Interventional Model Description: This interventional study utilized a parallel assignment model to develop and validate an assisted digital telemonitoring platform for patients with POAF. The telemonitored group received interventions and telemonitoring through the platform, while the control group followed the standard institutional patient journey without any intervention or telemonitoring.
Parallel assignment design, also called crossover studies, randomly assign or assign in a balanced manner a prespecified number of patients to the intervention or control treatment arm at the same time."

554,"[/INST] Contrast enhanced stereotactic biopsy (CESB) is an innovative breast biopsy technique that is based on the use of  contrast enhanced mammography (CEM). The technique is not yet clinically established and experiences are still limited. One of the relevant clinical question is the amount of remaining tissue that has to be sampled to obtain a final diagnosis with a reasonable level of certainty. The first aim for this study is to determine the minimum diagnostic amount of tissue samples that need to be obtained after a CESB-guided tissue sampling to reach a final histopathological diagnosis. 
To assess the diagnostic accuracy of contrast enhanced stereotactic biopsy to establish the minimum amount of tissue samples needed for a final histopathological diagnosis of suspicious breast lesions detected on contrast enhanced mammography.

=== Summary of Results ===
The following table presents the results for the variables assessed in the study. Note: ‡Paired samples t-test was used to compare the value of two samples taken at one time point. aValues are mean ± SD. bP value is compared to the paired samples t-test. cMean phosphate difference between DBIC 35-30 and DBIC 30-35 in week 4 for group 1. dPaired sample t-test versus baseline. Patients’ demographics. (a) Blood pH and (b) Blood pH and bicarbonate levels throughout the treatments throughout the treatments and across all the groups: Week 1 to week 4, week 2 to week 3, week 3 to week 4 and baseline to week 4. (c) The evolution of arterial blood pH and bicarbonate levels for groups 1, 2 and 3 during the whole study. Patients with DBIC 30-35 mmol/L showed lower blood phosphate levels when the dialysate bicarbonate concentration was lower. However, in terms of pH, there was not significant difference between DBIC 30-35 mmol/L, DBIC 35-30 mmol/L groups. We did note higher uremic acid values in patients receiving dialysate with lower bicarbonate concentration compared to the other two groups. In order to quantify this difference, we also calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient between uremic levels and dialysate bicarbonate concentration. Spearman correlation coefficients were found to be moderately correlated between uremia (log transformed in order to normalize data) and bicarbonate levels. This analysis is presented in appendix 2 of the supplementary section."

591,"[/INST] This is a descriptive study of patients with thumb CMC arthritis. The thumb carpel tunnel arthritis (CMC) is a common condition afflicting over 2 million people in the United States. Common symptoms include numbness, tingling, pain, and non-functional mobility of the affected digit. The Linburg-Comstock Variation (LCV) is a variation where the 2nd and 3rd metacarpal bases are separated from each other and fused together at the base, a distance from the base of the finger. A study of 376 cases of thumb CMC showed that 52.2% of the patients had the variation with no difference between men and women. It is not known whether the variation is associated with an increased risk for developing symptomatic thumb CMC arthritis. The purpose of this study is to ascertain the frequency of the Linburg-Comstock Variation in patients with symptomatic thumb CMC arthritis. To accomplish the project 500 patients over the age of 35 will be recruited. Once enrolled, the patients will be asked to perform a five second self-test looking for the variation, to be held during the regular office visit. The data will be collected over the course of two years. No risks are associated with being enrolled in the study. There is no compensation for participation in the study."

Conclusions
=================
There is growing evidence that OMT may improve certain symptoms commonly experienced by patients who have recovered from acute COVID, but further study is needed to fully delineate OMT mechanisms and dosing regimen."
597,[/INST] This is a single-center study to directly compare two diagnostic modalities used to demonstrate ischemic in the setting of frostbite. The study will also compare the ability of indocyanine green (ICG) to be used alongside conventional angiography for visualization. Hypothesis: The two modalities will demonstrate similar results with the ICG being deemed a safe adjunct to the conventional angiography.

609,"[/INST] Overall, 176 patients were randomized in the study from September 2014 to July 2016 in the medical intensive care unit affiliated with the hospital. The results showed that the two groups were comparable in demographic and clinical characteristics. There were no significant differences between the detachment groups and the connected breathing circuit group in the rate of malposition (P=0.733). The malposition rate in the disengagement groups was 7.75% and in the connected breathing circuit groups was 9.17%, there was no statistically significant difference. However, the malposition rate in disengagement group in the lateral decubit position is 0.74%, the malposition rate in the connected breathing circuit group is 0.38%, and the difference is significant(P=0.032). Compared with connected breathing circuit group, there are more severe malposition in disengagement group in the prone decubit position, it is 3.69%, and the difference is significant(P=0.015). So the rate of severe malposition is significantly lower in disengagement group than connected breathing circuit group in prone decubit and lateral decubit position."

Study Summary
=================
Healthy volunteers will be randomly divided into 2 groups. One group will be given a new health app called ""Healthy Steps"", which uses smartwatch technology to coach patients with high blood pressure to improve their exercise habits, while the other group will be given a placebo app called ""Fake-IT"". Healthy Steps monitors patients’ activity levels and sends prompts via the smartwatch to increase activity during the day. Patients will be monitored for 4 weeks.

Physical Inactivity
Term Definition: Physical inactivity is a lifestyle in which an individual does not reach the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for physical activity for health. It is most commonly defined as a lifestyle characterized by insufficient physical activity to counteract the negative amounts of energy imbibed through food consumption. Physical inactivity is one of the major causes of preventable disease such as obesity, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke.

 Cohort
Term Definition: A cohort is the total of all persons born in a given period (usually a calendar year). The cohort life table is a special case of survival curve for deaths as a whole, including both mortality due to ageing and mortality due to disease.

 Confounding
Term Definition: Confounding is one of the fundamental threats to internal validity in cohort studies and case-control studies. It occurs when an exposure or other cause-effect variable is not distinguished from a marker of the disease or other outcome. The latter may be a direct cause of the effect, or have a third variable as an intermediate cause for both. It is usually expressed as ""cohort effect"" rather than confounding.

 Cohort
Term Definition: A cohort is the total of all persons born in a given period (usually a calendar year). The cohort life table is a special case of survival curve for deaths as a whole, including both mortality due to ageing and mortality due to disease.

 Meta-analysis
Term Definition: In medical research, a meta-analysis of case-control studies is a statistical measure of the strengths of association between a particular exposure and a particular disease, based on several epidemiological studies. The data from the individual studies are combined using statistical techniques in order to increase the total number of studies the analysis has ""looked at"" (statistical power), allowing the investigator to draw firmer conclusions about the nature of the association.

 Risk
Term Definition: Risk is the chance of having an occurrence of something (in this case, a disease) over a given period of time in a given population. Risk is modified by extrinsic and intrinsic factors.

 Study population
Term Definition: The study population is the set of persons on which the intervention or exposure is being studied.

 Recurrence
Term Definition: Recurrence is a mathematical function that describes how much a repeated event could occur. It is one of the two key mathematical outputs of a survival analysis (the other being event rates).

 Sample size estimation
Term Definition: Sample size estimation is the determination of the number of subjects or studies needed to be recruited in order to have a good chance of having at least 80% power to detect the effect size .

 Recurrence
Term Definition: Recurrence rate (or Relapse rate) is a statistical parameter in epidemiology, public health, demography, or medical research. Specifically, the recurrence rate is the number of new occurrences of some event or condition per unit time. A recurrence rate is a special case of the cumulative incidence function or cumulative probability of event.

 Event rates
Term Definition: Event rates are the cumulative incidence or probability of an event occurance over time."

Important points of the study
- Design: Parallel single blind randomized clinical trial.

Interventions/treatments/arm_1 <br>  Experimental:  the principal investigator will apply the dry needling technique to those allocated to the experimental group on the latent trigger points diagnosed on the selection phase. They will receive just one session following Hongs protocol.

Terms related to the study
[INDENT]Counter movement jump: The subject is in an upright position with the hands at the waist, having to make a vertical jump after a quick countermovement down. During knee and hip flexion action, the trunk should remain as straight as possible to avoid any possible influence of trunk extension on lower limb performance.

Primary Outcome Measures
Change from Baseline Urinary Incontinence symptoms at 6 weeks
IIQ-7 Incontinence Impact Questionnaire scores at 6 weeks Perineometry strength and endurance of the subjects' pelvic floor muscles was assessed with a Pelvexer perineometer (Wolfram Haboeck Co., Austria). This apparatus has been scientifically proven as an objective method of assessing the function of the pelvic floor muscles and an effective exerciser for strengthening the pelvic floor muscles, which is why it is often used in the presence of for urinary incontinence problems. The Pelvexer can provide varying resistance to the pelvic floor muscles and provide real-time feedback on pelvic floor muscle contractions and changes (Chitra et al., 2010)."

655,"[/INST] A clinical trial of 18F-Fluselenamyl for Alzheimers Disease Amount of radiation: [RAD] Up to 4.5 hours exposure Detailed description (more than 40 words, inclusive of disease, drug, and dosing description): 18F-Fluselenamyl is a novel PET radioactive agent designed to image beta amyloid in the brain. Clinical trials are currently being conducted to quantify the distribution of 18F-Fluselenamyl in the body and to evaluate safety. This study is an initial screening trial to test safety in healthy volunteers and patients with mild Alzheimers Disease. The total amount of radiation you will be exposed to from this test depends on how much 18F-Fluselenamyl leaks from your body's tissues back into a detector. This will be measured as a dose of 10 mCi +/- 20% of the amount administered. If you are female you will be exposed to 10mCi, and if you are male you will be exposed to 11.25mCi. The amount you are administered will be determined by your weight. The actual amount of radiation that you are likely to receive can be estimated for you with our Radiation Estimation calculator - please note that these calculations are not exact, as they give an approximate idea of the radiation dosage. The 18F-Fluselenamyl PET scan will take up to 4.5 hours."

666,"[/INST]The goal of this non-interventional study is to evaluate PIK3CA mutation heterogeneity in a broad range of advanced breast cancer patients, in order to better understand the patterns of occurrence and the prognostic impact of this biomarker, in order to improve the effectiveness of systemic therapy and identify the population more likely to benefit from targeted therapy.
This is a non-interventional prospective observational study of patients with advanced breast cancer, for whom PIK3CA mutation status is evaluated at time of inclusion. Patients who test positive for a deleterious PIK3CA mutation receive targeted therapeutic options (PI3K-alpha inhibitors, CDK4/6 inhibitors and mTOR inhibitors), according to the international clinical practice guidelines, and are followed-up until progression or loss to follow-up. Patients who test negative for a deleterious PIK3CA mutation are not offered targeted therapy, but are considered for participation in other ongoing prospective studies.
The primary endpoint of this non-interventional  study is the percentage of patients with deleterious PIK3CA mutations at the time of inclusion. Secondary endpoints include: incidence and timing between first breast cancer diagnosis and PIK3CA mutation evaluation; number and sequencing of biopsies; pattern of line progression, including duration and sequence of treatments; number of patients per stage; and patient performance status."

Etiological Study of Persistent Velopharyngeal Insufficiency in Children With Operated Velopalatine Cleft by Analysis of Velopharyngeal Motor Skills in Static and Dynamic MRI
Study Overview
Description: [/OVERVIEW]
Etiology: To evaluate the role of velopharyngeal anatomy and motor dysfunction in the emergence of persistent velopharyngeal insufficiency among children operated for velopalatine cleft.
Objective
To describe velopharyngeal anatomy by static and dynamic MRI in children with velopalatine cleft. To describe velopharyngeal motor function in the presence and absence of insuffciency.
Design and Setting
Cohort study in 4 groups: 49 children operated for isolated cleft lip, isolated velopalatal cleft; 23 children with velopalatal cleft associated with Pierre Robin sequence and cleft palate; and 10 children without syndromes or cleft palate. Follow up at 7 to 12 years after surgical treatment.
Patient population
Patients at any age with isolated cleft lip or isolated velopalatal cleft, operated in the Department of Amiens between January 1, 1987 and December 31, 2001 (first inclusion date). Patients operated for a velopalatine cleft, in presence of Pierre Robin sequence (type III) or isolated cleft palate according to the Amiens criteria with a mean follow up greater than or equal to 7 years. Patients operated outside the Department of Amiens and no longer followed there as long as the follow-up is shorter than 7 years.
Interventions
Study visits: To detect velopharyngeal insuffciency, the child will sit on the parents' knees and bend forward with their chin in the patient's chest before reaching maximal inspiration. The position of the mouth and epiglottis will be evaluated on a lateral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1 and dynamic T2.
Depending on the child's age, either parent or child should be able to perform this maneuver for the MRI investigation to be completed.
A nasomaxillary mask adapted to MRI will be used for the anteroposterior T1 and lateral T2.
The child will be asked to perform the maneuver in the MRI.
Motor function measurements
Each year, the child will have a single-word intelligibility test after asking the parent to say the name of the child. The child will be asked to read as much as possible the sentence: ""Rose a roule avec Lucie"", up to a speed of 2 seconds. The following data will be collected for each of the 4 possible conditions of mouth opening:
- mouth opening with maximum inspiratory effort,
- velopharyngeal incipience,
- oropharyngeal incipience,
- bilateral incipience.
A motor score will be compiled from 0 to 7 by adding the scores for mouth opening and for incipience from the two vocal tracts.
The motor score will be transformed into an opening of the oropharynx expressed as a percentage in relation to the antero-posterior diameter of the pharynx in the presence of velopharyngeal insufficiency.
The scores for opening will then be analyzed on the different sites of the velopharynx to describe the type and location of the insufficiency.
The test of intelligibility will also be completed after each sentence by the clinician to record the stenophonic index, i.e. the average percentage of syllables not intelligible during the sentences heard by the parent (Rose a roule avec Lucie) pronounced alternately by lips closes oral and velopharyngeal incipience according to the following scale:
Severe stenophonia < 50% intelligibility: pharyngeal incipience. > 50% intelligibility: velopharyngeal incipience.
Data analysis
To evaluate mouth opening, we will use an MRI T1 anteroposterior and T2 axial MRI images that will be analyzed by two evaluators. Differences in the diagnosis will be discussed and a consensus will be reached by arbitration.
Statistical analysis
Intelligibility data analysis will be done according to the following criteria. The following table:

The study population will be divided into two groups, patients affected by malnutrition and healthy volunteers. The recruitment of patients will be performed in hospitals and the healthy controls will be recruited through advertisements in the web and mass media. Samples, including clinical, anamnestic and lifestyle data and faecal, blood and saliva samples, of both groups will be collected to analyze microRNA expression profile, measure plasmatic extracellular vesicles, perform metagenomic analysis of fecal samples, metabolomicanalysis of fecal samples and analyze salivary extracellular vesicles and salivary samples.

 Rationale / Therapeutic perspective: [/INST] The discovery of specific and reliable biomarkers of malnutrition could lead to a better characterization of the condition and to the identification of effective target for the development of new therapies.

 Safety / Adverse effects: [/INST] The side effects of the tests to be performed in the study population are unknown.

This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, open-label, phase III, stepped wedge cluster randomized design. This experimental design involves the sequential implementation of an intervention in the clusters included over several periods. The order in which the clusters received the intervention was determined by drawing lots; at the end of the study, all the clusters received the intervention at some point and were observed during a pre- and post-intervention control period (each cluster is its own control).
The ventilator settings are adjusted in line with the centre's usual practice. No change from usual management of acute respiratory distress syndrome."

A retrospective observational study was conducted to determine the prognostic value of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) in predicting Tetralogy of Fallot primary repair outcome. NLR and ALC were derived based on complete blood count with differential. Patients were followed for intraoperative and postoperative complications, morbidity, and mortality for 30 days after the operation. The median hospital length of stay and postoperative length of stay for patients who received ToF primary repair were 5 days (interquartile range (IQR) 0 to 15) and 12 days (IQR 7 to 24), respectively. The intraoperative mortality rate was zero. Postoperative mortality rate was 0.67%, with an overall mortality rate of 0.69%. The results of this study demonstrated that NLR and ALC did not show any association with intraoperative or postoperative complications as well as mortality rates in patients with ToF primary repair."

Intro: Here you can summary in your own words why the study is important and why the proposed mechanism of action may work. This section will serve as a primer for the more details provided further in the protocol.
Cirrhosis is a complex pathological state in which liver parenchyma is replaced by the creation of scar tissue leading to portal hypertension, impaired liver function and increased susceptibility to many life threatening complications.
Intestinal parasites are a common cause of chronic gastrointestinal distress in many patient population. People with cirrhosis are at an increased risk of developing intestinal parasitic infections because of a combination of immunosuppression and altered immunologic response.
The incidence of intestinal parasitic infection in cirrhosis patients is very high and is not well documented due to the fact that these patients usually present with altered laboratory findings and nonspecific gastrointestinal complaints.
Therefore screening for intestinal parasites is important to develop an early intervention strategy to prevent further complications that may develop from the infection.
It is important to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infection in cirrhotic patients to develop preventive measures and early intervention strategy.

=================
Depression in Old Age  : Depression is one of the major public health problem of old age. It affects many people, including those living in rural communities, and these individuals' access to mental health services is limited. Given the need for mental health care in rural communities, there is a need for research to investigate mental health services delivered by non-specialists."

775,"[/INST] This is a protocol for a study on aerobic exercises and pilot exercises in preventing depressive symptoms in primigravida females. Women at risk for depression during pregnancy, or who develop depression during their pregnancy, are at higher risk for complications for themselves and their babies. Exercise may be a safe, effective and low-cost way to help prevent depression, and improve sleep quality. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group will receive aerobic exercises (e.g., brisk walking, jogging, swimming, cycling); the other group will receive pilates exercises. Both groups will be asked to keep track of their sleep quality and report on it weekly. Both groups will also be asked to complete an interview every other week to see how they are feeling, and to rate factors such as stress, relationship problems, pain, fatigue, anxiety and depression. After 8 weeks, the women will have a follow-up interview to evaluate how effective the exercise program was, and to determine the women's current mental health."

811,"[/INST] There is a need to decrease the cardiovascular events in the transplanted patients. Several studies tried to decrease the atherosclerosis progression by different means as statins and fibrates. However, statins have side effects; therefore, other lipid modifying drugs have been studied.  In this study the authors hypothesize that post transplant dyslipidemia may play an important role in the hard cardiac events. Therefore, they study the role of PCSK9 and macrophages in association to the fatty liver.  The patients will be divided in two groups. The first group will receive immunosuppressive therapy including:  Mycophenolate mofetil, Tacrolimus, corticosteroids, and everolimus.  The second group will receive the same treatment plus ezetimibe.  Ezetimibe works by decreasing the liver cholesterol synthesis. However, there are no data about safety of ezetimibe in the immunosuppressive therapy. The major advantage of ezetimibe is that it does not need monitoring the lipid levels. The follow up duration of the patients is 4 years. The patients outcomes will be measured from the day of transplantation by reviewing the patient clinical history and with echocardiogram, complete blood count, liver function test, and fasting blood lipid measurement.  The follow up is every 3 months in the first year and then every 6 months in the second and third years and once a year in the fourth year. The secondary outcome will be the graft survival. However, there is no control group in the present study. The major limitation of the study is that it is impossible to detect the graft ischemia and/or inflammation due to the immunosuppressive therapy. Conclusion Over the course of 4 years this trial will help to detect the relation between post transplant dyslipidemia and cardiac events, and also help to validate Lipid-lowering therapies in the transplanted patient."

An abbreviation used in the results/main text such as [A];""pathological complete response rate"" can be defined as: [A];""pathological complete response (pCR) rate was 42%""
Introduction: [1] - Used within the text to reference the introduction section and the numbers within this superscript text will increase as chapters or sections are entered into the body (so Introduction [1] and Introduction [2] etc)
Objectives: [2] - Used within the objectives/aims section to reference this particular objective, the numbers increase as each objective is mentioned within the body (so Objectives [2] and Objectives [3] etc)
Methods: [3] - Used to reference the methods section introduced in section 1.1 and the numbers increase as each section is mentioned within the body (so Methods [3.1] [3.2] and [3.3] etc)
Rationale: Used to reference the why and the purpose of the study/research. There is usually more than one reason/rationale so they are numbered in increasing order.
Justification: Used to reference why the study was performed in relation to the methods used to perform such studies e.g. this was done to test/assess [3]. The numbers increase as each justification is mentioned within the body (so Justification [2] and Justification [3] etc)
Case series: A series of specific studies that describe an intervention in a particular patient or group of patients.
Case study: A study that looks at one individual or group of individuals in detail.
Cohort: Group of individuals who share a common characteristic or experience typically used in observational studies to determine incidence or association
Crossover studies: A type of study where a subject is in more than one group during the study. For example in a drug study, the subject may receive the drug then cross over to the placebo arm and then perhaps back to the drug arm again.
Crosstab: A table that displays variable values (or cells) across two categorical variables.
Crosstabulation: Displaying results of a cross-tabulation and is typically presented as an Excel table.
Crosstalk: Potential effect of one exposure and or intervention on an other or conversely a potential effect of the secondary exposure (or intervention) on the primary exposure or intervention. An example might be a drug that is given in combination with another which together have a greater effect than either alone.

The knee is a joint consisting of a femoral condyle articulating with the tibial plateau in the femorotibial joint, a patellar patella articulating with the femorotibial joint and tibial plateau, and a tibial tibiofemoral joint. Weight-bearing MRI of the knee can provide valuable information about the joint space width for knee osteoarthritis, both in the medial and lateral compartments. Weight-bearing allows for the examination of cartilage and bone in loading conditions and helps diagnose changes in load-bearing joints such as the knee. 
Joint space width measurements can be obtained for both the medial and lateral Knee compartments by comparing the patella ligament (patellar tubercle) to the femoral lateral epicondyle. Joint space width measurements are made in the posterior medial, anterolateral (most reliable medial side measurement), anterior medial, and anterior lateral location. The average of the four measurements should be within the normal range of size for the individual patient at the time of measurement."

Design: Randomized controlled trial Eligibility Criteria: Participants will be screened for age and English language abilities. Previous participation in Empowered Relief, cognitive impairment, or non-English speaking. Conclusion: The investigators hope to determine for 170 patients with persistent pain, if Empowered Relief, a nursing-delivered intervention, is more effective than wait-list control at reducing pain catastrophizing and improving functioning. 4 groups: Empowered Relief, wait-list control, Empowered Relief after wait-list control. Measures: Patient-reported outcomes, quality of life measures, and catastrophizing."

For this project, we seek information on patients' and health care nurses' mental effort when choosing or understanding, respectively, pain intensity ratings, and confidence in the accuracy of pain intensity rating patterns. This information will clarify the importance of mental effort from pain ratings and the probability of pain intensity rating patterns."

We also propose that levels of certain microRNA will be able to predict the level of morphine required for the treatment of neonatal abstinence syndrome and may help guide prophylactic treatment of pregnant patients with chronic opioid addiction.

=================

Sample size calculation
-----------------
Sample Size calculation for the clinicopathological profile of head and neck cancers:
Total expected cases of head and neck cancers in each year: 32
Mean standard deviation of age for head and neck cancers: 52.32
Assuming 10% annual increase in case of head and neck cancers in future: 40
Level of significance for the study: 0.05

Number of years of follow up to be taken for the study= 1.1683

= The minimum sample size to be taken for the retrospective observational study= 32+ 40-4= 76

Hence, a total of 76 cases are to be recruited for the head and neck cancers. However, a 10 percent increase in head and neck cancers cases in the coming years can be assumed and 80 cases will be required in the study by giving more weight to the future head and neck cancers cases.

Key Messages
-----------------
A retrospective study design is employed to know the prevalence of head and neck cancers at the department of ENT- Head and Neck Surgery of Shree Birendra Hospital ,a tertiary health care centre of Nepal .Data was collected from the medical records of head and neck cancer patients who underwent treatment between May 2022 to April 2023. The prevalence of head and neck cancers in this area is 0.6 in 100000 individuals which is less than the world average. The study shows that most common head and neck cancer in this area is throat cancer. Histopathology of Head and Neck Cancers shows that most people are suffering from squamous cell carcinomas. However, other sub site specific Head and Neck Cancers are also there. Further studies needs to be done to know the causes, risk factors and impact of Head and Neck Cancers in terms of morbidity and mortality of people of Nepal.
Head and neck cancers are malignant neoplasms that develops in oral cavity, nasal cavities, paranasal sinuses,nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, ear, scalp, salivary gland and neck. Treatment modality for Head and Neck Cancers depends on the stage of cancer at the time of diagnosis. Most common treatment modalities include surgery followed by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The survival rate of patients with head and neck cancers is generally high if diagnosed and treated at an early stage.
Clinically and pathologically staged TNM system of Head and Neck Cancers is used to know the stage of cancers. Head and Neck Cancer should be differentiated from upper respiratory tract infection, metabolic diseases and autoimmune diseases and foreign body reaction. Clinicopathological profile of patients with Head and Neck Cancers provide us the information on risk factors, prognosis, survival of patients and the pattern of occurrence. This helps in guiding treatment protocols and also helps in future studies to prevent development of Head and Neck Cancers."

Study Overview
-----------------
A major limitation to identifying children with OSA is that parents are often not aware that their child has OSA symptoms or is at risk for OSA. This study aims to determine the power of involving parents in OSA identification at the time of PCP visit.


[inst]

Study Design and Objectives
	Parents who are current or former Eskenazi Health patients are asked to complete a questionnaire about their child's snoring, sleepiness, and other symptoms. If the child screened positive for OSA, parents are randomized to either: 1) view a health communication message (infographic) about sleep-disordered breathing; or 2) usual care. All children identified as having OSA receive a referral to an appropriate provider for further evaluation. Primary Study Milestones: Awaiting SRC Approval. Estimated Start Date: April 1, 2019; Expected End Date: May 1, 2020. [inst]

Intervention: Health Communication Message

Method of Intervention Delivery
Parent will view a health communication message, either on paper or a screen, that informs them that their child has symptoms of OSA and encourages them to discuss this with their child's PCP at the next visit.

Intervention Rationale/Note
This intervention is intended to activate parents about the possibility that their child has OSA, so that they can discuss this with their child's PCP at their next visit. Parents will either be given an information sheet printed out or will view the information on a screen. While this information could be given to parents during the PCP visit, it may be more effective if parents are reached prior to the visit, as they are able to have the information with them during the visit and potentially discuss it with the provider who will be seeing their child and plan for follow up.

Primary Study Milestones: Awaiting SRC Approval. Estimated Start Date: April 1, 2019; Expected End Date: May 1, 2020. 

Primary Outcome Measures: Rate of Completed OSA referrals. Secondary Outcome Measures: Rate of OSA referrals | Outcome Measure | Measure Description | Measure Time Frame | A 15-minute/hour-long intervention/treatment. | patient group of parents and their child's role of the intervention.

Background: [/INST] This box can be used for providing key background information on the context of the study.

Parkinson disease is an insidious disease which afflicts 50/100,000 with a large impact on Quality of Life, QOL. Ms afflicted have motor symptoms which degrade QOL. Ms is a long term, debilitating, progressive loss of motor function which leads to disability and ultimately death.
PD and walking is a multifactorial problem where there are many components that require intervention.   Loss of dopamine in Ms affects the basal ganglia and especially the substantia nigra which is involved in motor control. 
Symptoms like shuffling gates, short steps, freezing, are all symptoms of the deterioration of the basal ganglia and its circuitry. This is one of the symptoms which is directly addressed by the intervention proposed here.

Brief: The researchers will assess muscle activation of various shoulder muscles in patients with different sized rotator cuff tears.
Detail: The specific muscles of focus will be the upper and lower trapezius, serratus anterior, supraspinatus, and infraspinatus muscles.
Background: Full-thickness rotator cuff tears may lead to changes in the muscle activation patterns of the shoulder.
Range of Motion: Shoulder movements will be evaluated during the assessment of muscle activation. The study will assess differences in muscle activation between small, medium, large, and massive rotator cuff tears.
Study Design: The researchers will use suction cups to apply electrodes to the skin. The electrodes will measure the electrical activity of the muscles as the patients perform different shoulder movements.
Interventions: The study will obtain pre-intervention muscle activation data of the scapular and rotator cuff muscles during functional tasks. The data will be used to establish a baseline for future comparisons."

Brief Summary

Study Overview
=================
Detailed Description
-----------------
Detailed Description: Critically ill patients are particularly vulnerable to sleep disorders. In the context of critical illness and ICU admission, there is an intersection of factors contributing to this situation: pre-existing health conditions, severe acute illness, sleep-altering treatments (sedatives, analgesics, mechanical ventilation), psychiatric disorders, and the physical environment. Additionally, the perception of sleep from the perspective of family members may also be impacted. There is a lack of studies that evaluate the impact of sleep in intensive care and its association with patient outcomes. Therefore, this project aims to assess the feasibility of a multidisciplinary protocol to improve sleep in the intensive care unit."

Example: Sixty-six patients were randomized within the first 24 hours after septic shock diagnosis, 33 were randomized to paroxetine and 33 to placebo. The blinding was successful in 29 out of the 33 patients randomized to paroxetine and 28 out of the 33 patients randomized to placebo (0 difference between groups, p=0.78). One patient in the paroxetine group and one patient in the placebo group withdrew consent before the 48 hours follow-up visit. The primary outcome was the time to discontinuation of all vasopressors, which was significantly improved by paroxetine, with a median time of 42 hours versus 80 hours in the placebo group (p=0.007). Treatment with paroxetine was also associated with a lower risk of organ dysfunction, with a median total sequential organ failure assessment score of 18 in the paroxetine group versus 24 in the placebo group (p=0.006).

 Example: The study failed to show a benefit of paroxetine in the treatment of septic shock. The primary endpoint, the time to discontinuation of vasopressors, did not differ between the two groups (median 42 hours in the paroxetine group versus 80 hours in the placebo group, p=0.007). The secondary endpoints, the incidence of organ dysfunction and the total sequential organ failure assessment score, were also higher in the placebo group than in the paroxetine group. One patient in the paroxetine group suffered from severe serotonin symptoms.

 Primary outcome: Vasopressor free time
 Secondary outcomes: Incidence of organ dysfunction, variability of the cardiovascular sequential organ failure assessment score, total sequential organ failure assessment score, length of ICU stay, mortality"
