The study consists of three phases: collecting data on glycemic trends and insulin administration in free-living conditions, inducing hyperglycemia by temporarily suspending insulin infusion, and retrospectively analyzing the data to evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithms. The study will involve 12 participants who meet specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. The primary outcome measure will be the sensitivity of the algorithms in detecting insulin suspension, and the secondary outcome measure will be the number of false alarms per day.

The study is designed as a single-group, open-label trial, and the intervention will consist of simulating an insulin pump failure by suspending insulin infusion and monitoring the resulting hyperglycemia. The study will be conducted at a clinical site, and the participants will be required to undergo specific procedures, including downloading data from their artificial pancreas, visiting the clinic for the induction of hyperglycemia, and restoring euglycemia before returning home. The study will provide valuable data for the scientific community, enabling the retrospective testing of fault detection algorithms."
