406,"The OptimizeD study aims to determine whether different patients respond differentially to brief psychological treatment or a widely used generic SSRI and, if so, whether one can optimize outcomes in a cost-effective fashion for primary care patients with moderate to severe depression. The study has two specific aims and two exploratory aims. The first specific aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a precision treatment rule (PTR) on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either psychotherapy based on behavioral activation called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) or antidepressant medication (fluoxetine). The second specific aim is to assess the costs of optimal vs. non-optimal treatments and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing relative costs and effectiveness between those who were randomly allocated to their optimal treatment with those who were randomly allocated to a non-optimal treatment, based on the PTR developed in Aim 1. The exploratory aims are to explore whether one can use the PTR to make our tests of mediation more precise and to explore whether polygenic risk scores and other biomarkers can enhance the prediction of both general and differential response to either treatment.

The study will use machine learning to develop the PTR, using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not. The study will also consider whether treatment-related factors (e.g., adherence, quality) act as mediators of the effects of each treatment on remission and recovery.

The study will measure depression severity, as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), cost-effectiveness of optimization, depression remission, generalized anxiety disorder assessment (GAD-7), WHO Disability Assessment Schedule II (WHODAS-II), minimal clinically important difference (MCID), and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5).

2. Digital health intervention (Medly Uganda): This intervention utilizes a patient-facing mobile health application designed to improve self-care among patients with HF. Its principal components are: 1) a patient-facing mobile application that processes patient-reported symptoms and generates algorithm-driven messages to guide self-care and symptom management and 2) a clinician-facing internet dashboard that monitors symptom reports and facilitates nurse-guided management recommendations and physician backup support.

Outcome Measures:
The study will measure the following outcomes:
1. Change in Self-Care of Heart Failure Index (SCHFI)
2. Clinical Effectiveness (a composite of mortality and HF hospitalization)
3. Participant fidelity to self-care (assessed by medication adherence, optimal HF medication dosing, and self-report)
4. Facility fidelity to implementation strategy (assessed by vital sign checks, percentage of planned echo training sessions conducted with post-training participant feedback, adherence to medications, and change in resting pulse)

It will include 60 patients with asthma, 50 of whom will be biologic naïve and 10 who will be on biologic therapy. The study will involve collecting various samples (blood, oral rinse, nasopharyngeal swab, EBC, stool, and induced sputum) at multiple visits over a 6-month period. The samples will be processed for microbiome and host transcriptome profiling, and the data will be analyzed using various methods, including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, bulk RNAseq, and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. The study's primary outcome measures include describing the microbiome signature across the spectrum of asthma severity, establishing any association between asthma phenotype and microbiome signature, and determining whether microbiome signature can predict treatment response or resistance.

999,"The SmartMom study aims to assess the effectiveness of a mobile health program delivered via text messaging in promoting healthy behaviors during pregnancy. The program, called SmartMom, provides evidence-based information to participants through three text messages per week, with links to content focused on improving knowledge, providing information about prenatal assessments and screening, and encouraging the adoption of behaviors to support healthy pregnancy and physiologic birth. The study will compare the outcomes of participants who receive the SmartMom program with those who receive a control text messaging intervention. The primary outcome measures include change in weight during pregnancy, attendance at prenatal care visits, and changes in health knowledge, health literacy, fear of childbirth, depression, and anxiety. The study will also measure changes in use of tobacco, vaping, alcohol, or cannabis, rates of planned vaginal birth after cesarean, exclusive breastfeeding at hospital discharge, and adverse pregnancy outcomes.
