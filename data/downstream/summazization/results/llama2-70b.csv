109,"The TINO study aims to investigate the loss of nasal T cells in older adults and its impact on respiratory health. The study includes three participant groups: young adults, vital elderly, and frail elderly. Participants will provide nasal swabs and blood samples at baseline and 3 months, and if they develop respiratory symptoms, they will provide additional samples at 1, 3, and 5 months post-symptom onset. The study will measure the frequency of nasal CD8+ T cells and phenotype, functionality, transcriptomic cluster composition, clonality, and stability of nasal and blood T cell populations. The study will also compare nasal immune cell populations between young adults, vital and frail elderly, and investigate the association between respiratory tract microbiota profiles and T cells and other immune parameters.

The study includes several secondary outcome measures, including the frequency of antigen-specific T cells in the nose and blood post-infection, and the effect of sex on aging effects of nasal and blood immune populations. The study will also investigate the presence of asymptomatic viral infections and their association with T cells and other immune parameters.
