34,"The study aimed to investigate the association between elevated initial APRI value and the development of sepsis-associated liver dysfunction in adult patients with sepsis. The study included 100 patients and was conducted in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of SALD, which was defined as ALT or AST≥20 folds upper limit of normal level or TBIL≥2.0 mg/dL. The study found that elevated initial APRI value was associated with an increased risk of SALD.

The study used a retrospective design and included patients from the MIMIC IV database. The study excluded patients with chronic liver disease, viral hepatitis, primary acute cholangiopathies, cholecystitis, hepatic infarction, liver necrosis, liver trauma, and length of ICU stay < 24 hours. The study also excluded patients without simultaneous AST and PLT data in the first 24 hours after ICU admission.

The study found that the incidence of SALD was 20% in the non-SALD group and 40% in the SALD group. The study also found that the mean APRI value was significantly higher in the SALD group than in the non-SALD group. The study concluded that elevated initial APRI value was associated with an increased risk of SALD in adult patients with sepsis.

The study's findings have implications for the early detection and management of sepsis-associated liver dysfunction in adult patients with sepsis. The study suggests that monitoring APRI values in these patients may help identify those at risk of developing SALD and guide early interventions to prevent or manage the condition."
