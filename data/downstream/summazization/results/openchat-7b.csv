In Phase 1, the committee members classified each informed variable as unimportant, important, or essential for the physical therapy assessment to provide quality care to the patient during hospitalization. The validity of this construct was performed using the Delphi technique, and the consensus was defined with a minimum percentage of at least 75% agreement as important or essential. In Phase 2, the PHYSIOSCORE was assessed by two physical therapists with a minimum interval of 15 minutes between them in 110 patients hospitalized for clinical or surgical cardiac conditions. The study also included a third phase, clinical validation of the instrument, in which the PHYSIOSCORE was applied to assess the level of attention and complexity of physical therapy care by one professional, followed by a second physical therapist with at least five years of experience performing respiratory and neuromuscular physical therapy. The time spent evaluating respiratory and neuromuscular physical therapist care and registering electronic medical records were all timed.

Summary:

The study aimed to develop and validate the PHYSIOSCORE, a tool to assess the complexity level and physical therapy care in hospitalized patients. The PHYSIOSCORE was developed by a committee of ten physical therapists with more than ten years of experience in hospital care. The questionnaire was based on variables used in clinical practice and had to meet four objectives: (i) be composed of variables used by physical therapists working in the hospital; (ii) have valid"
21,"The SAVAL trial is a single-arm, phase II trial evaluating selective adjuvant therapy for HPV-mediated oropharynx squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) based on residual circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels. The primary objective is to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years post-last treatment, inclusive of patients undergoing salvage treatment for locoregional recurrence (LRR). The study will enroll 100 patients with p16+OPSCC who are candidates for surgery and have positive ctDNA. Patients will be stratified into one of three risk groups: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. The low risk group will be observed per standard of care (SOC), the intermediate risk group will be observed per the experimental arm, and the high risk group will receive adjuvant treatment per SOC. The primary outcome measure is PFS at 2 years post-last treatment. Secondary outcome measures include rate of recurrence at one year post TORS with negative ctDNA, rate of salvage for LRR after TORS, LRR at 2 years post-last treatment, overall survival (OS) at 2 years post-last treatment, number of participants free from distant metastases at 2 years post-last treatment, number of participants with grade 2/3 xerostomia at 1-year following completion of treatment, patient scores from the MDADI questionnaire at 1-year following completion of treatment, and PEG-tube rate at 2-year following completion of treatment.

The trial aims to determine if patients with p16+OPSCC who are currently recommended for adjuvant RT based on intermediate risk factors can be observed post-TORS when ctDNA is cleared. The investigators hypothesize that patients in the intermediate risk group will have similar rates of distant metastases and favorable rates of salvage as those in the low risk group. The results of this trial may inform future treatment strategies for patients with p16+OPSCC.

The trial is currently recruiting participants."
22,"This is a single-institution prospective phase 2 trial comparing ultra-hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) to partial breast irradiation (PBI) in patients with breast cancer.

23,"This study aims to explore the use of symptom monitoring and digital life coaching (DLC) to inform a more complete understanding of the impact of multiple myeloma on symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among a diverse U.S.-based, contemporary sample. The benefits of routine symptom monitoring have been demonstrated in recent studies, where overall survival increased among cancer patients who routinely monitored their symptoms. As the science related to symptom monitoring continues to evolve, exploring interventions to support both the assessment of and interventions related to disease and treatment-related sequelae it is important to identify how symptoms can best be monitored and managed. Studies to date have explored how symptom monitoring can be conducted for patients in the ambulatory setting, where patients do not receive around the clock assessment and management as they would in the hospital setting. In this context, digital or eHealth technologies are increasingly emerging as ways to promote health behaviors, and to monitor individuals with chronic health states, including cancer. An integrative review of 28 articles specifically evaluating eHealth interventions for patients with cancer identified 16 unique eHealth interventions, largely centered around educational support and decision aids. Telehealth counseling and navigation was found to be effective in supporting psychosocial needs in a small study (n=20) of underserved (defined by the authors as those who were primarily unemployed and uninsured) breast cancer patients. In a study of 1371 cancer patients, 71% reported using a mobile phone daily and 93% reported having internet access from home, of which 68% reported daily internet use, suggesting that internet-based technologies may be purposeful in the sharing of information with and coordination of care for cancer patients. Despite literature indicating its potential efficacy, few interventional studies have been published that evaluate digital health coaching and its relationship with self-efficacy and symptom management, specifically in R/R MM patients. As such, there is a gap in the literature on how digital health coaching might be used to support patients during cancer treatment and into survivorship.
