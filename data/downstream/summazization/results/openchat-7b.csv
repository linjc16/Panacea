In Phase 1, the committee members classified each informed variable as unimportant, important, or essential for the physical therapy assessment to provide quality care to the patient during hospitalization. The validity of this construct was performed using the Delphi technique, and the consensus was defined with a minimum percentage of at least 75% agreement as important or essential. In Phase 2, the PHYSIOSCORE was assessed by two physical therapists with a minimum interval of 15 minutes between them in 110 patients hospitalized for clinical or surgical cardiac conditions. The study also included a third phase, clinical validation of the instrument, in which the PHYSIOSCORE was applied to assess the level of attention and complexity of physical therapy care by one professional, followed by a second physical therapist with at least five years of experience performing respiratory and neuromuscular physical therapy. The time spent evaluating respiratory and neuromuscular physical therapist care and registering electronic medical records were all timed.

Summary:

The study aimed to develop and validate the PHYSIOSCORE, a tool to assess the complexity level and physical therapy care in hospitalized patients. The PHYSIOSCORE was developed by a committee of ten physical therapists with more than ten years of experience in hospital care. The questionnaire was based on variables used in clinical practice and had to meet four objectives: (i) be composed of variables used by physical therapists working in the hospital; (ii) have valid"
21,"The SAVAL trial is a single-arm, phase II trial evaluating selective adjuvant therapy for HPV-mediated oropharynx squamous cell carcinomas (OPSCCs) based on residual circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels. The primary objective is to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) at 2 years post-last treatment, inclusive of patients undergoing salvage treatment for locoregional recurrence (LRR). The study will enroll 100 patients with p16+OPSCC who are candidates for surgery and have positive ctDNA. Patients will be stratified into one of three risk groups: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. The low risk group will be observed per standard of care (SOC), the intermediate risk group will be observed per the experimental arm, and the high risk group will receive adjuvant treatment per SOC. The primary outcome measure is PFS at 2 years post-last treatment. Secondary outcome measures include rate of recurrence at one year post TORS with negative ctDNA, rate of salvage for LRR after TORS, LRR at 2 years post-last treatment, overall survival (OS) at 2 years post-last treatment, number of participants free from distant metastases at 2 years post-last treatment, number of participants with grade 2/3 xerostomia at 1-year following completion of treatment, patient scores from the MDADI questionnaire at 1-year following completion of treatment, and PEG-tube rate at 2-year following completion of treatment.

The trial aims to determine if patients with p16+OPSCC who are currently recommended for adjuvant RT based on intermediate risk factors can be observed post-TORS when ctDNA is cleared. The investigators hypothesize that patients in the intermediate risk group will have similar rates of distant metastases and favorable rates of salvage as those in the low risk group. The results of this trial may inform future treatment strategies for patients with p16+OPSCC.

The trial is currently recruiting participants."
22,"This is a single-institution prospective phase 2 trial comparing ultra-hypofractionated whole breast irradiation (WBI) to partial breast irradiation (PBI) in patients with breast cancer.

23,"This study aims to explore the use of symptom monitoring and digital life coaching (DLC) to inform a more complete understanding of the impact of multiple myeloma on symptom burden, health self-efficacy, and financial, physiologic, and psychosocial well-being among a diverse U.S.-based, contemporary sample. The benefits of routine symptom monitoring have been demonstrated in recent studies, where overall survival increased among cancer patients who routinely monitored their symptoms. As the science related to symptom monitoring continues to evolve, exploring interventions to support both the assessment of and interventions related to disease and treatment-related sequelae it is important to identify how symptoms can best be monitored and managed. Studies to date have explored how symptom monitoring can be conducted for patients in the ambulatory setting, where patients do not receive around the clock assessment and management as they would in the hospital setting. In this context, digital or eHealth technologies are increasingly emerging as ways to promote health behaviors, and to monitor individuals with chronic health states, including cancer. An integrative review of 28 articles specifically evaluating eHealth interventions for patients with cancer identified 16 unique eHealth interventions, largely centered around educational support and decision aids. Telehealth counseling and navigation was found to be effective in supporting psychosocial needs in a small study (n=20) of underserved (defined by the authors as those who were primarily unemployed and uninsured) breast cancer patients. In a study of 1371 cancer patients, 71% reported using a mobile phone daily and 93% reported having internet access from home, of which 68% reported daily internet use, suggesting that internet-based technologies may be purposeful in the sharing of information with and coordination of care for cancer patients. Despite literature indicating its potential efficacy, few interventional studies have been published that evaluate digital health coaching and its relationship with self-efficacy and symptom management, specifically in R/R MM patients. As such, there is a gap in the literature on how digital health coaching might be used to support patients during cancer treatment and into survivorship.

The investigators will also identify HBV integrations by Capture NGS and quantify the specific vh-DNA by ddPCR as personalized biomarkers from the same-patient serum samples. The study will further correlate clinical response and recurrence/metastasis with serial changes of vh-DNA copy numbers. The results will support the consolidative use of personalized vh-DNA for earlier evaluating treatment response after RT, for post-RT disease monitoring, and for differentiating clonality at recurrence to design future clinical trials on combinational treatment."

296,"The EPigenetic Consequences in Children of Intravenous vs Volatile Anaesthesia for Surgery (EPIVA) is a randomised, clinical, feasibility trial that aims to explore whether changes in signals in DNA (epigenetic changes) can be seen in children undergoing anaesthesia and whether this is impacted by the type of anaesthetic given. The trial has been designed as a feasibility trial to evaluate whether a larger scale trial looking at anaesthesia and surgery in relation to changes in markers on DNA (epigenetics) is both possible, and of value. Currently there have been no published studies looking at whether general anaesthesia can cause epigenetic changes in children, and whether the type of anaesthetic given has an impact on any changes present. The study will include children aged 6 months to 3 years undergoing hypospadias surgery and will randomise participants to one of the two anaesthetic maintenance approaches that are used routinely in clinical practice: intravenous or inhalational. Blood samples will be taken from the participants before and after surgery and will undergo laboratory analysis including epigenetic, biochemical, haematological, and redox.

297,"The study aims to investigate whether a variety of additional markers can improve laboratory diagnostics in patients with hypothyroidism receiving levothyroxine in whom TSH cannot be used as a reflection of thyroid hormone status (e.g. central hypothyroidism). Alternatives could be fT3 and the derived fT3/fT4 ratio but TT4, TT3, rT3, SHBG, acylcarnitines and several amino acids might be interesting parameters as well. We hypothesize that treated hypothyroid participants who are assumed euthyroid based on TSH (e.g. patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism) but have fT4 concentrations above the upper reference limit will more often have a fT3 level or a fT3/fT4 ratio within the reference interval. TSH is considered to reflect thyroid hormone status reliably. Concentrations of alternative markers in healthy controls and patients with Hashimoto's hypothyroidism with 'normal' TSH concentrations can, thus, be used to predict thyroid hormone status in patients using levothyroxine in whom TSH cannot be used to assess thyroid hormone status. Therefore, outcomes of this study will particularly benefit the follow-up of patients with central hypothyroidism in whom TSH cannot be used to monitor thyroid hormone status."

406,"The OptimizeD study aims to determine whether different patients respond differentially to brief psychological treatment or a widely used generic SSRI and, if so, whether one can optimize outcomes in a cost-effective fashion for primary care patients with moderate to severe depression. The study will use machine learning to develop a precision treatment rule (PTR), using a wide range of clinical, socio-economic, and neuro-cognitive characteristics measured at baseline as predictors. The investigators hypothesize that patients randomized by chance to their optimal intervention will be more likely to remit and recover than patients who are not.

The study has two specific aims and two exploratory aims:

Specific Aim 1 (Clinical and Functional Outcomes): To evaluate the effectiveness of optimization via generating a precision treatment rule (PTR) on patients with moderate to severe depression randomized to either psychotherapy based on behavioral activation called the Healthy Activity Program (HAP) or antidepressant medication (fluoxetine).

Specific Aim 2 (Cost-effectiveness Outcomes): To assess the costs of optimal vs. non-optimal treatments and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis by comparing relative costs and effectiveness between those who were randomly allocated to their optimal treatment with those who were randomly allocated to a non-optimal treatment, based on the PTR developed in Aim 1.

Exploratory Aim 1 (Mediators): To explore whether one can use the PTR to make our tests of mediation more precise.

Exploratory Aim 2 (Genetic Predictors): To explore whether polygenic risk scores and other biomarkers can enhance the prediction of both general and differential response to either treatment.

453,"The study aims to investigate the effect of different stimulus encoding methods on simple perceptual and behavioral tasks in visual prosthesis patients. The investigators will produce visual percepts in CORTIVIS and Argus II patients either by directly stimulating electrodes (using FDA-approved pulse trains), or by asking them to view a computer or projector screen and using standard stimulation protocols (as is standardly used for their devices) to convert the computer or projector screen image into pulse trains on their electrodes. Informed by psychophysical data and computational models, the investigators will test the ability of different stimulus encoding methods to support simple perceptual and behavioral tasks (e.g., object recognition, navigation). These encoding methods may include computer vision and machine learning methods to highlight important objects in the scene or to highlight nearby obstacles and may be tailored to each individual patient. Performance of prosthesis patients will be compared both across stimulus encoding methods and to performance in normally sighted control subjects viewing stimuli manipulated to match the expected perceptual experience of prosthesis patients. The normal method of stimulation is a chain from a camera mounted on eye glasses through a video processing unit (VPU) which converts the video image into FDA-approved electronic pulse trains. Sometimes the investigators will test subjects using the camera. More often, the investigators will carry out 'direct stimulation' when using an external computer to directly specify pulse trains (e.g., for Argus II, a 1s 10 Hz cathodic pulse train, with a current amplitude of 100 microAmps and a pulse width of 45 microseconds to Electrode 12). These direct pulse trains are then sent to the VPU. This VPU contains software that makes sure that these pulse trains are within FDA-approved safety limits. For example, these pulses must be charge-balanced (an anodic pulse must be followed quickly by a cathodic pulse and vice versa or the electrode will dissolve), must have a charge density below 35 microCoulombs/cm2. The frequency of the pulse train and the current amplitude of the pulse train is not actually a critical safety issue, since the electronic/neural interface is robust to extremely high rates of stimulation and high current levels. However, high frequency pulse trains or high amplitude pulse trains can"

Summary of the Results:

This study is still recruiting participants. No results are available yet.


Summary of the Key Points:

* This study is a Phase 2 trial that aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new treatment approach for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in children, adolescents, and young adults.
* The treatment approach combines chemotherapy drugs (gemcitabine and cisplatin) with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab).
* The primary objective of the study is to determine the incidence of grade 3 or higher immune-related adverse events (irAEs) during induction chemoimmunotherapy (CIT).
* Secondary objectives include evaluating event-free survival (EFS) at 2 years, objective response rate, and feasibility of the induction regimen.
* The study is still recruiting participants, and no results are available yet.


Summary of the Background:

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a type of head and neck cancer that occurs in the nasopharynx, the area at the back of the nose where the roof of the mouth meets the throat. NPC is more common in certain populations, such as people of Asian descent.

Traditional treatments for NPC include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. However, these treatments can have significant side effects and may not be effective for all patients.

In recent years, immunotherapy has emerged as a promising treatment option for various types of cancer, including NPC. Immunotherapy works by stimulating the body's immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells.

This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a new treatment approach that combines chemotherapy drugs (gemcitabine and cisplatin) with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (nivolumab) in children, adolescents, and young adults with newly diagnosed NPC.

493,"This is an observational cohort study using MRI to measure gastrointestinal (GI) function, lung structure and function and liver endpoints in children with CF aged 6 to 11 years. The study will use a modified version of the protocol used in the GIFT-CF3 study to measure GI physiology in addition to MRI measures of lung and liver structure and function. The aim is to identify whether these measures are changed before and after starting ETI. For the CF participants, to be enrolled in the study they must be homozygous or have at least 1 copy of the Phe508del mutation, which would mean they are eligible for ETI treatment. The modified MRI protocol, taken from NCT04618185, has been shortened to include scans that are taken over three timepoints. These timepoints are determined around the ingestion of a test meal which has been previously described. Participants will arrive fasted before having a baseline scan. After their first scan they will eat their first standardised high fat meal followed by a second standardised high fat meal around 240 minutes after. MRI scans to assess GI function will be taken at baseline (fasted), 240 minutes post ingestion of a breakfast meal (T240) and 300 minutes post breakfast (T300). Liver scans will also be taken at baseline and lung scans taken opportunistically at the T240 timepoint. In total, participants will be asked to remain in the MRI scanner for approximately 30 minutes at a time. For comfort, participants will be able to watch multimedia programmes through the use of a specially adapted television while in the scanner. Participants will also be asked to complete validated gastrointestinal questionnaires throughout the study day and recall their GI symptoms over the previous 2 weeks and complete a 3 day food diary. The study will be split into two phases. The first will be a pilot phase where 3 children with CF aged 6 to 11 years and 3 healthy age and gender matched controls undergo MRI scanning. These scans will be assessed to determine whether the scan protocol can be completed by the participants and assess the quality of the images obtained.

496,"This study aims to compare the effectiveness of white noise and multisensory stimulation in retinopathy examination on premature infants. Retinopathy is a common eye disorder among premature infants that can lead to long-term visual impairments if left untreated. The study employs a randomized controlled experimental design, with premature infants as the study participants. The infants are randomly assigned to three groups: the control group, the white noise group, and the multisensory stimulation group. The white noise group receives auditory stimulation through the presentation of white noise, while the multisensory stimulation group receives additional visual and tactile stimuli during the retinopathy examination. Several outcome measures are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the interventions, including physiological responses, behavioral indicators, and overall examination success rate. The findings of this study have the potential to contribute to the development of effective and well-tolerated retinopathy examination protocols for premature infants.

516,"This study aims to determine the differing pressure lowering effects between OMNI canaloplasty alone versus when combined with HYDRUS microstent. Both surgical study devices are widely used in conjunction with cataract surgery. While many surgeons have begun combining the two procedures, this will be one of the first studies to randomize (assign by chance) one eye to OMNI canaloplasty alone and the other eye to OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS stent and report the results after one year. About 80 subjects aged 18 years and older will participate in this study.

The study will use competitive enrollment, meaning that when a target number of subjects begins the study, all further enrollment will be closed. Therefore, it is possible that you could be in the screening phase, ready to begin the study, and be discontinued without your consent if the target number of subjects has already begun the study. If you qualify to take part in this study and go on to receive the study treatment, then the following will happen:

Washout Period: You will be asked to stop taking your eye drops to treat your glaucoma. This is called a washout period, during which the effects of these medications leave your body.

Study Treatment: You will be randomly assigned by chance (like the flip of a coin) to receive either OMNI canaloplasty or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. You will have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of receiving OMNI canaloplasty alone or OMNI canaloplasty with HYDRUS microstent. This is a not a blinded study, which means that you, the study doctor, study staff and the sponsor will know the study treatment you are given.

After Study Treatment: Glaucoma is a permanent and irreversible condition that requires lifelong monitoring with an eye care professional. Sometimes additional treatment is required. Your eye specialist will recommend follow-up care based on your personal findings.

The primary outcome measure is the change in unmedicated intraocular pressure from baseline at 12 months. Secondary outcome measures include the reduction in the number of medications needed to control intraocular pressure from baseline and the percentage of patients with greater than 20% reduction in intra"

612,"This study aims to develop an AI algorithm that can differentiate between benign and malignant soft tissue masses using artificial intelligence (AI). Soft tissue sarcomas are a type of cancer that can appear anywhere in the body where there is soft tissue such as muscle or fat. While sarcomas are rare, benign lumps in soft tissue are common and it is currently very difficult to tell the difference between the two using imaging. This means many patients with benign masses are referred for painful biopsies and waiting lists for biopsies are long due to the large diagnostic workload. This research aims to develop an AI algorithm that can differentiate between benign and malignant soft tissue masses. While an algorithm can be developed using existing routine data the researchers would like to investigate if adding quantitative MR images could make it more accurate. Patients who are already having a scan for sarcoma will be asked if they consent to extra MR images being acquired. These images will be used to provide extra information to the AI. The extra images will add a maximum of 10 minutes to the patients' standard MRI scan, meaning patients will not need to make an extra trip or undergo any extra procedures. Study participants will not need to receive MR contrast as part of this research. A small subset of patients will be asked if they would be willing to come for a second scan so that the researchers can see how reliable the measurements are, but this will be entirely optional.

The study will have two arms:

1. Original cohort: This cohort will have a maximum of 10 minutes of quantitative MRI sequences added on to the end of the clinical standard MRI scan.
2. Reproducibility cohort: This group will be invited back for a second MRI scan to test reproducibility of quantitative scans and the machine learning algorithms developed to interpret them.

The primary outcome measure is diagnostic accuracy - ROC analysis of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of AI algorithms for distinguishing between benign and malignant soft tissue lesions. The secondary outcome measure is classification accuracy - ROC analysis of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of AI algorithms for classifying malignant lesions into their pathological grade.

The study will run for 3 years.

639,"The Supporting Physical Literacy at School and Home (SPLASH) study aims to increase children's physical activity (PA) through a multilevel, comprehensive physical literacy (PL)-focused program that will reach children both at school and at home. The study will use a 2-arm, group randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 400 3rd-5th grade students from low-income schools. The intervention is the Rising New York Road Runners (RNYRR) program, which provides lesson plans covering fundamental movement skills and family engagement materials. The primary outcome measures are baseline and end-point physical activity levels, and secondary outcome measures are baseline and end-point fundamental movement skills. The study hypothesizes that children who attend schools with the RNYRR programming will increase PA and PL relative to children in control schools.

The study will also examine whether RNYRR program effects on children's PL and PA differ by sex or weight status, and whether changes in PL and PL subdomains (e.g. ability, confidence, motivation) mediate changes in daily total PA volume or MVPA.

The study is designed as a prevention study with a parallel assignment intervention model, and the intervention and control groups will be randomly assigned. The study will be conducted in schools, and the intervention will be provided to the experimental group, while the control group will receive standard school operating procedures.

The study will evaluate exercise and physical activity every 3 months in a cohort of people with PD from two clinics in the Chicagoland area: Northwestern Medicine Lake Forest and University of Chicago Medical Center. The study will evaluate differences in 12-month physical activity trajectories between groups enrolled during each of three conditions: (1A) standard care (condition 1, year 1), (1B) written exercise guidance (condition 2, year 2), and (1C) Consultative PT (condition 3, year 3). People with PD will be enrolled each year into an activity and exercise tracking study. Participants will be tracked using a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos) and commercial grade activity trackers. Research-grade actigraphy and patient reported outcome measures will be monitored every 3 months for the first year. All participants will be enrolled in an exercise and physical activity tracking study where they can use a remote therapeutic monitoring platform (Datos Health) to share their exercise and physical activity data with their medical and rehabilitation teams at NMLF and UCMC. The platform allows for synchronization of patients' activity data from their fitness tracker or smartwatch to the secure cloud-based platform. The platform can summarize steps per day, activity intensity, minutes of moderate-vigorous physical activity per day based on target heart rate zones (including an ability for physical therapists to customize the target heart rate zone). At the 2 sites of care (Northwestern Lake Forest Hospital and University of Chicago), participants will be recruited based on contacting consecutive patients who meet the inclusion criteria based on scheduling and EMR screening prior to their visit with their neurologists. The study will also determine if they should use targeted recruitment strategies to increase reach to specific groups or recruitment rates by doing one or more of the following: (1) sending measures through MyChart to potentially eligible patients targeting or oversampling for higher socioeconomic, race, or ethnicity diversity or (2) reaching out to local community exercise classes or support groups using emails to community advocates and flyers to increase sample size more rapidly.

686,"The study aims to employ multi-channel tr-fNIRS to address the limitations of current commercial cerebral oximeters, with the goal of timely detection and prevention of ischemic brain injury. The investigators will use a state-of-the-art full head coverage tr-fNIRS device to monitor the entire brain, as opposed to only select regions (such as the limited capabilities of the current cerebral oximeters) in the perioperative setting. Together with in-house analysis algorithms, the full head coverage tr-fNIRS can detect specific brain regions at-risk of ischemic injury with a high degree of certainty because of greater spatial resolution (in cm) and less signal contamination from extracerebral tissue. The study will include adult patients scheduled to have elective shoulder surgery in the beach-chair position under general anesthesia. The primary outcome measure is the impact of intraoperative hemodynamic parameter on regional differences in cerebral oxygenation (ScO2) between brain regions during surgery. Secondary outcome measures include regional differences in cerebral autoregulation in beach-chair position under general anesthesia as measured by the tr-fNIRS monitor (Hz) data outputs, and the association between cerebral desaturation (or hypoxic injury) events in multiple brain regions to clinical outcomes such as stroke and delirium.

738,"The study aims to develop a pharmacodynamic model for propofol in older adults. The model will use pharmacokinetic parameters from the Eleveld model and new pharmacodynamic parameters derived from frontal EEG in a population older than 65 years. The hypothesis is that the modified Eleveld PKPD model will predict better the hypnotic effect of propofol than the original Eleveld PKPD model in adult patients older than 65 years.

756,"The study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of STERIFY GEL in the treatment of periodontitis following scaling and root planing (SRP). The study is a split-mouth, randomized, controlled study involving patients with grade III and IV chronic periodontal disease. The primary outcome measure is pocket depth, measured by periodontal probe. Secondary outcome measures include gingival recession, clinical attachment level, plaque index, bleeding index, furcations, grade of mobility, and quantification of bacterial contamination.

The study will assess the safety and efficacy of STERIFY GEL in promoting healing of periodontal pockets following SRP, compared with treatment with SRP alone. With specific visco-elastic and mucoadhesive properties, STERIFY GEL easily penetrates into the deepest and hard-to-reach areas of periodontal and peri-implant pockets, adhering to the gingival tissue and alveolar bone, providing complete coverage of the pockets. The effect of STERIFY GEL is promoted by a physical mechanism of action. After SRP, the gel is applied into the gingival pocket, where it acts primarily as a filler to restore volume, physically preventing bacteria from entering and reinfecting the pocket. STERIFY GEL can thus mechanically protect treated pockets and bone defects, promoting tissue healing. The occluding action at the level of periodontal and peri-implant gingival pockets, in synergy with the accessory action of hydroxytyrosol, nisin, and magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, prevents bacterial recolonization and promotes subsequent tissue regeneration. Although SRP surgery is considered a gold standard treatment for periodontitis, it may in some cases be insufficient to decontaminate the pocket allowing bacteria to recolonize the tissues promoting new inflammation that can worsen the clinical picture. STERIFY GEL may find useful application in cases of moderate to severe chronic periodontal disease as an adjunctive treatment following SRP to improve and accelerate healing parameters and prevent recurrent inflammation and infection. In addition, antimicrobial control action prevents antibiotic use and the risk associated with antibiotic resistance. Such control of periodontal disease also allows for the maintenance of patients who cannot undergo surgical treatment (e"

The study aims to assess if HABIT-ILE at home is not inferior to HABIT-ILE in camp regarding physical abilities, functional activities and participation of the participants. Moreover, if the maintenance of skills during HABIT-ILE camp at 3- and 6-months post-therapy has been proven, the question of improving them has not been investigated yet. Indeed, we know that in order to maintain the skills learned during the HABIT-ILE therapy, it is necessary to practice them on a daily basis. If a skill is not used it will lead to a cortical reorganization of the motor cortex at the expense of this skill. Thus, there is a persistent cycle of decreased utilization that leads to unfavorable cortical reorganization that leads to decreased utilization, etc. It is called learned non-use. In order to reduce this phenomenon and thus improve the transfer of the HABIT-ILE skills into the daily life of the children, we wonder about the benefit of a post-therapy follow-up. Once again, the use of tele-rehabilitation can provide us a solution of daily delocalized therapy directly implemented at the patient's home and supervised remotely. Could the transfer of learned skills be improved with a follow-up than without a follow-up after two weeks of HABIT-ILE therapy? In order to answer this question, after the two weeks of both HABIT-IL modality, we will set up a HABIT-ILE telerehabilitation follow-up for 9 weeks. This study therefore also aims to assess if the patient's abilities could be potentialize with a follow-up than without a follow-up after two weeks of HABIT-ILE therapy."

873,"The study aims to measure non-invasively, easily and reliably the variations of cerebral perfusion in patients with or without cardiovascular risk factors during controlled variations performed during routine care to adjust the blood pressure level within the recommended safety standards during general anesthesia. The setting of the optimal mean arterial pressure (MAP) level will be achieved within the ranges of values commonly used, taking into account the patient's cardiovascular comorbidities. In particular, the lower limit of MAP of 60 mmHg for patients without cardiovascular risk factors and 80 mmHg for patients with risk factors should never be exceeded, in accordance with current French and international recommendations. The main objective is to identify a significant linear relationship between the percentage change in mean velocity (Vm) and the percentage change in the 95% spectral frequency front (SEF95) during the MAP change. Cerebral perfusion and cerebral O2 adequacy will be compared and assessed by continuous and simultaneous measurements of cerebral blood flow by transcranial Doppler (TCD) and cerebral O2 adequacy by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and a brain function parameter by intraoperative electroencephalogram (EEG) - frontal EEG. The classification of patients in the cardiovascular risk group will be determined in addition to their history and treatment by an arterial stiffness parameter (pulse wave velocity) measured non-invasively before and during the protocol by MESI mTablet automatic digital sphygmomanometer (MESI ltd, Slovenia). The objective for a given patient is to look for a possible threshold value of pressure that could impact the blood flow velocity (Doppler) and possibly the EEG and cerebral oximetry.

891,"The study aims to examine the beneficial effects of a short playful interaction on the cognitive, social, and mood of older people. The investigators will examine changes in indices of mood, mental health, social functioning, cognition compared to an active control intervention. The study also aims to compare between online playful interactions to face to face. In addition, in the past two decades there has been a shift toward the development of tailor-made interventions that fit individual needs and abilities. This trend is especially important in aging, given increased variability in personality and cognitive and sensory characteristics. The investigators aim to investigate the mediating role of personality traits and cognitive functions in connection to the beneficial effect of playful interactions in aging. The investigators hypnotized that playful interactions will induce greater effects on emotional and social indices, as well as on executive functioning, compared to more familiar social interactions. The investigators hypothesize that these effects will be found in older populations. The effects of short-term playful interaction tasks as compared to the matched social control condition will be preserved in the online format. Individuals' characteristics and personality traits will influence the effects of the interaction on the dependent variables."

910,"The study aims to investigate the treatment of couples undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF). Eligible couples will be recruited for the study after providing informed written consent following counseling. The IVF protocol involves various steps, including preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) as clinically indicated. Women will undergo ovarian stimulation using gonadotropin injections, and regular ultrasound monitoring will be conducted to track the growth of follicles. To prevent a premature LH surge, progestin primed ovarian stimulation or a GnRH antagonist will be administered. Once at least three follicles reach a size of over 17 mm, a trigger injection of either human chorionic gonadotrophin or a GnRH agonist will be given to induce final maturation. Oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours after the trigger under transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The recruited women will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: the microfluidic chip group or the density gradient centrifugation group. Randomization and blinding will be ensured to maintain the integrity of the study.

949,"The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of video biofeedback and laryngeal control therapy in the treatment of paradoxical vocal fold motion (PVFM). PVFM is characterized by episodic shortness of breath that can range in severity and acuity. Symptoms may greatly impact daily life. Some patients experience severe respiratory distress, which can lead to emergency department visits and occasionally intubation. The standard treatment is typically behavioral therapy performed by speech and language pathologists. However, new evidence suggests that video biofeedback may be an effective alternative treatment. Video biofeedback allows patients to directly visualize their breathing while performing specific breathing exercises. This is a desirable treatment because it can be performed at the time of diagnosis and requires minimal additional time or resources. The investigators' goal is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to compare the relative effectiveness of video biofeedback and behavioral therapy in the treatment of PVFM. The primary endpoint will be the change in Dyspnea Index score before treatment and one month after treatment. Patients will complete surveys to collate data about patient expectations of behavioral therapy, their reasons for pursuing additional treatment if applicable, and the perceived benefits of the specific intervention. The investigators hypothesize that no clinically meaningful difference will be detected between behavioral therapy and video biofeedback for the treatment of PVFM. This pilot RCT will provide critical data for designing a fully powered trial comparing these two interventions, and will advance the investigators' goal of providing clinicians with important evidence for guiding treatment.

The study is designed as a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with active treatment control group.

973,"The study aims to develop and implement a successful and effective digital care plan to improve post-secondary student mental health care substantially. The proposed mental health hub will offer a comprehensive care model using a stepped-care approach. The study will be divided into three phases: pre-adoption, delivery, and post-adoption phases. The pre-adoption phase will assess post-secondary students' current mental health landscape through surveys and focus groups. The delivery phase will determine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of the online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs by comparing them to treatment as usual, using validated clinical assessment tools. The post-adoption phase will use the collected data to monitor the success and fidelity of the programs using surveys and focus groups and to build capacity and scale the project to other Canadian municipalities.

The study will target a broad population of students ranging from those interested in learning more about mental health (online psychoeducation program) to those seeking additional help for their psychiatric symptoms (e-CBT program). The research team is strongly experienced in designing effective AI-assisted online psychoeducation and diagnosis-specific e-CBT programs for various mental health conditions in diverse populations. Therefore, being as effective as in-person methods of healthcare delivery, it is hypothesized that the online interventions disseminated via a robust implementation science and community collaboration strategy will be a feasible, cost-effective, and pragmatic solution to address accessibility issues with post-secondary student mental healthcare.

The study will use a digital platform called the Online Psychotherapy Tool (OPTT) to deliver the interventions. The platform is a secure cloud-based platform co-developed by the principal investigator.
