436,"The study aims to develop a new system for non-visible lung cancer nodules detection during minimally invasive surgery. The system uses a fluorescent compound called IRDye800, which is administered intravenously before surgery. The compound accumulates in cancer cells and emits near-infrared light that can be detected by a special camera during surgery. The study will assess the effectiveness and safety of this new system in patients with early-stage lung cancer.

The study will enroll 20 patients and will be conducted in a single center. Patients will be randomly assigned to receive either the study drug (IRDye800) or a placebo. The primary outcome measure will be the detection of lung nodules during surgery using the NIR camera. Secondary outcome measures will include the detection of lymph node metastatic disease, unexpected cancer localization, negative surgical margins, and the time it takes to detect the nodules.

The study will be open-label, meaning that both the patients and the investigators will know which patients are receiving the study drug and which are receiving the placebo. The study will be conducted over approximately one year, and the results will be analyzed and published in a scientific journal."
437,"The SPARROW trial is a randomized controlled trial that aims to evaluate the additional value of pre-emptive antibiotic treatment on clinically relevant organ/space surgical site infections (OSIs) in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy with a high risk for contaminated bile. The study will compare perioperative versus prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with preoperative biliary drainage or ampullary malignancy. The primary outcome measure is the rate of clinically relevant OSI between patients with perioperative versus prolonged antibiotic prophylaxis. Secondary outcome measures include the rate of isolated OSI, superficial incisional SSI, clinically relevant postoperative pancreatic fistula, bile leakage, post pancreatectomy hemorrhage, delayed gastric emptying, bacteremia, Clostridium difficile infection, major morbidity, reinterventions, ICU admission, length of hospital stay, and in-hospital and 90-day mortality."
438,"This is a Phase 2 basket trial in which patients with advanced solid tumors carrying the KRAS G12C mutation receive treatment with a combination of sotorasib and panitumumab. The primary purpose of the study is to assess the objective response rate based on RECIST v1.1 after Cycle 1 Day 1. The study is open-label and has a single group assignment. Participants will receive oral sotorasib at a dose of 960 mg once daily with panitumumab administered intravenously at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 14 days. The study will enroll approximately 120 participants at multiple sites in the United States, Europe, and Asia."
439,"The study is a randomized clinical trial that aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a novel volume-stable collagen matrix (VCMX) in the treatment of single gingival recession associated with non-carious cervical lesion partially restored. The study will be conducted on adult patients with a systemically healthy, no signs of active periodontal disease, and full-mouth plaque and bleeding score ≤20%. The study will be randomized, double-blind, and parallel-group design. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the experimental treatment (PR + CAF + VCMX) or the active comparator (PR + CAF). The primary outcome measure will be the recession reduction (RecRed) at 180 days. Secondary outcome measures will include dentine hypersensitivity, patient-centered esthetic evaluation, oral health impact profile, patient discomfort, number of analgesics, percentage of complete combined defect coverage (%CDC), modification of the root coverage esthetic score (MRES), and clinical parameters. The study will be conducted at the Centre Hospitalier Valida."
440,"The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different nutritional support modes based on nutritional risk screening in improving the nutritional status of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. The study will randomly assign patients to an intervention group or a control group based on their nutritional risk screening results. The intervention group will receive a five-step treatment model for malnutrition plus conventional nutritional intervention, while the control group will receive conventional nutritional intervention only. The study will measure the changes in various nutritional indexes, such as NRS-2002 and PG-SGA scores, dietary energy and protein intake, and nutrient energy and protein intake, before and after the intervention, and compare the results between the two groups. The study will also explore the effects of disease type and age on the results.

Please provide a concise summary of the study in 50 words or less.

Summary:

The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of different nutritional support modes based on nutritional risk screening in improving the nutritional status of patients with gastrointestinal cancer."
441,"This clinical trial aims to compare the effect of the abutment-prosthesis connection on marginal bone loss and gingival sealing around dental implants. The study will be conducted as a randomized parallel-group trial, with participants receiving either a Connect® abutment or a conventional multi-unit abutment. The primary outcome measures will be marginal bone level and peri-implant microbiome, with secondary outcome measures including peri-implant inflammation. The study will enroll 30 participants per group and will be conducted over a period of one year."
442,"The study aims to evaluate the clinical feasibility of non-invasive blood flow monitoring in the brain using a wearable ultrasound patch. The study will compare the measurements from the wearable ultrasound patch with the conventional transcranial Doppler probe in 60 participants. The primary outcome measures will include the agreement of the measurements from the two devices on peak systolic velocity, mean flow velocity, and end diastolic velocity of the blood flow spectrum in different arterial segments. The study will be conducted over a period of 1.5 years."
443,"This study aims to evaluate the clearance rate of uremic toxins by hemodiafiltration (HFR) in maintenance hemodialysis patients. The study will be conducted as an open-label, single-arm study, with all participants receiving HFR treatment. The primary outcome measures will be the concentrations of β2-microglobulin (β2-MG), indoxyl sulfate, and λ-free light chain (λFLC) before and after HFR. Secondary outcome measures will include single-compartment urea clearance index (spKt/V), urea reduction ratio, and the concentrations of other middle molecules and macromolecular uremic, serum albumin, branched chain amino acids, and vitamins A, C, E. The study will also evaluate the comfort of HFR treatment."
