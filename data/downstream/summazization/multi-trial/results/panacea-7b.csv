The use of a vein collar at the distal anastomosis has been suggested to improve patency and limb salvage, a problem that is analysed in this randomised clinical study. Patients with critical limb ischaemia undergoing polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) bypass to below-knee arteries were randomly either assigned a vein collar or not in two groups - bypass to the popliteal artery below-knee (femoro-popliteal below-knee (FemPopBK)) and more distal bypass (femoro-distal bypass (FemDist)). Follow-up was scheduled until amputation, death or at most 5 years, whichever event occurred first. In the FemPopBK and in the FemDist groups, 115/202 and 72/150 were randomised to have a vein collar, respectively. Information was available for 345 of 352 randomised patients (98%). At 3 years, primary patency was 26% (95% confidence interval (CI) 18-38) with a vein collar and 43 (33-58) without a vein collar for femoro-popliteal bypass and 20 (11-38), and 17 (9-33) for femoro-distal bypass, respectively. The corresponding figures for limb salvage were 64 (54-75) and 61 (50-74) for femoro-popliteal bypass, and 59 (46-76) and 44 (32-61) for femoro-distal bypass with and without a vein collar, respectively. Log-rank-test for the whole Kaplan-Meier life table curve showed no statistically significant differences with or without vein collar primary patency: p = 0.0853, p = 0.228; secondary patency: p = 0.317, p = 0.280; limb salvage: p = 0.757, p = 0.187 for FemPopBK"

The results of the studies suggest that there is no significant difference in the therapeutic effect of haloperidol at different dosages. However, there is a curvilinear relationship between haloperidol levels in plasma and clinical response, with a therapeutic window of 5.5 to 14.4 ng/ml. Patients with high levels may improve to a lesser extent or even worsen in negative symptoms, showing a nonstatistically significant trend to present more extrapyramidal symptoms.

The use of antiviral medications for the treatment of influenza in children has been shown to be effective in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms. However, the optimal timing of treatment initiation is not well established. This study evaluated the efficacy of oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours of symptom onset in children 1-3 years of age with laboratory-confirmed influenza.
                A total of 408 children with influenza were randomized to receive either orally administered oseltamivir suspension or a matching placebo twice daily for 5 days. The children received clinical examinations, and the parents filled out detailed symptom diaries for 21 days.
                Among children with influenza A, oseltamivir treatment started within 24 hours of symptom onset shortened the median time to resolution of illness by 3.5 days (3.0 vs 6.5 days; P = .006) in all children and by 4.0 days (3.4 vs 7.3; P = .006) in unvaccinated children and reduced parental work absenteeism by 3.0 days.

The use of twin-bag disconnect systems for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has been associated with a lower rate of catheter-related infection than single-bag systems. However, their greater monetary purchase cost has prevented universal adoption. Therefore, a single-center randomized study was performed in 63 adult patients to compare the efficiency and total cost of Freeline Solo (FS, twin-bag) and Basic Y (BY, single-bag) systems. Patients were new to CAPD (N = 39), or had a new CAPD catheter, or had had no episodes of peritonitis or exit-site infection in the previous 12 months (N = 24). Total follow-up was 631 patient months (pt.mon), and 53 patients were still on the trial at its termination. Patients rated FS as easier to use than BY (P < 0.001). Peritonitis occurred on 23 occasions in 12 out of 30 patients using BY, and on seven occasions in five of 33 patients using FS. Time to first infection was less with BY than FS (hazard ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.0 to 5.3; P < 0.04). Cumulative incidence of peritonitis was 1 per 14.0 pt.mon with BY and 1 per 46.5 pt.mon with FS (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% CI 1.5 to 8.5; P = 0.004). Length of hospitalization for peritonitis or exit-site infection was 98 days in six patients with BY, versus 17 days in two patients with FS. With BY, four catheters were removed because of infection, but none with FS (P < 0.05). With BY, the total cost of infection was $AUD127,079 ($5033 per pt.yr) versus $19,250 ($704 per pt.yr) with FS, which offset the higher purchase cost of FS. The total cost of CAPD was"

The use of a pancreatic stent during pancreaticoduodenectomy has been shown to reduce the incidence of pancreatic fistula. However, the optimal type of stent (internal or external) is still unclear. This study compared the outcomes of pancreaticoduodenectomy with an internal stent versus an external stent.
                A total of 120 patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenctomy with end-to-side pancreaticojejunal anastomosis were randomized to have either an external stent inserted across the anastomosis to drain the pancreatic duct (n = 60) or no stent (n = 60). Duct-to-mucosa anastomosis was performed in all cases.
                The 2 groups were comparable in demographic data, underlying pathologies, pancreatic consistency, and duct diameter. Stented group had a significantly lower pancreatic fistula rate compared with nonstented group (6.7% vs. 20%, P = 0.032). Radiologic or surgical intervention for pancreatic fistula was required in 1 patient in the stented group and 4 patients in the nonstented group. There were no significant differences in overall morbidity (31.7% vs. 38.3%, P = 0.444) and hospital mortality (1.7% vs. 5%, P = 0.309). Two patients in the nonstented group and none in the stented group died of pancreatic fistula. Hospital stay was significantly shorter in the stented group (mean 17 vs. 23 days, P = 0.039). On multivariate analysis, no stenting and pancreatic duct diameter <3 mm were significant risk factors of pancreatic fistula.
                Pancreaticojejunostomy with an internal stent is therefore considered to be an effective treatment alternative after PD, with an acceptable morbidity and no mortality.."

After a 4-wk run-in period of treatment with budesonide (800 microg, twice daily), 60 patients with moderate asthma were randomly assigned to a 1-yr treatment with 400 microg of budesonide plus placebo, twice daily (BUD800), or 100 microg of budesonide plus 12 microg of formoterol, twice daily (BUD200+F). All drugs were administered via Turbuhaler. Budesonide (800 microg, twice daily) during run-in significantly reduced median sputum eosinophils from 4.5 to 0.68%. No significant changes in the proportion of eosinophils, EG2(+) cells, other inflammatory cells, or ECP levels in sputum were observed over the ensuing 1-yr treatment with BUD200+F or BUD800.

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health problem that can occur after a person has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event. Symptoms of PTSD can include flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of situations that remind the person of the traumatic event. PTSD can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life and can lead to other mental health problems such as depression and anxiety.

There are several evidence-based treatments for PTSD, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), exposure therapy, and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). CBT involves teaching the person coping skills and changing negative thoughts and beliefs about the traumatic event. Exposure therapy involves gradually exposing the person to the traumatic event in a safe and controlled environment. EMDR involves focusing on the traumatic event while moving the eyes back and forth.

Research has shown that these treatments can be effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD. However, there is still a need for more research to determine which treatment is most effective for different types of trauma and for different populations. Additionally, there is a need for more research to determine the long-term effectiveness of these treatments and to identify factors that may predict which treatment will be most effective for a particular person.

Overall, evidence-based treatments for PTSD can be effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life for people who have experienced or witnessed a traumatic event."

The studies suggest that there is no significant difference in the efficacy of manual and mechanical chest percussion in hospitalized patients with cystic fibrosis. The use of the PEP mask with forced expiratory coughing was compared with conventional physiotherapy over a one month period and no difference was shown in symptom scores, sputum production, or simple lung function tests. The mask was well accepted and allowed independent treatment by older patients. The use of a positive expiratory pressure (PEP) mask was compared with postural drainage in the treatment of 10 patients with cystic fibrosis. The patients were allocated randomly in a crossover fashion to the two regimens and evaluated initially by a physiotherapist and over a 4 week treatment period by use of a diary card. There was no significant difference in sputum production or change in lung function between each technique as assessed by the physiotherapist. Diary card evaluation also failed to demonstrate a difference in sputum production, symptom score or peak expiratory flow rate between the 4 week treatment periods. It was concluded that PEP mask therapy is an acceptable and effective alternative to postural drainage in interval therapy of patients with cystic fibrosis, although the patients have tended to revert to postural drainage during acute exacerbations. Bronchial hygiene therapy is a standard part of the treatment of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Coughing alone promotes sputum expectoration and is probably the primary effective component of standard bronchial hygiene therapy. The purpose of this study was to determine whether substituting regular exercise, which also promotes coughing, for two of three daily bronchial hygiene treatments would affect the expected improvements in pulmonary function and exercise response in hospitalized patients with CF. Seventeen patients with CF hospitalized (means length of stay = 13.0 +/- 2.6 days) for an acute exacerbation of their pulmonary disease participated in the study.

The review of the literature on the efficacy of interventions to prevent sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies in young women found that interventions that were theory-based, culturally appropriate, and tailored to the individual were more effective than those that were not. Interventions that included skills training, such as condom use skills, were also more effective. The most effective interventions were those that were delivered in a group format and included multiple sessions. The review also found that interventions that were delivered in a clinical setting were more effective than those that were delivered in a non-clinical setting. Overall, the evidence suggests that interventions can be effective in reducing sexual risk behaviors and preventing sexually transmitted infections and unintended pregnancies in young women."

Study Abstracts: Study #1: A randomized study of cancer screening in a family practice setting using a recall model.. A randomized controlled study that evaluated a recall system and patient education material by mail in 178 asymptomatic female family practice patients aged 50 to 69 years showed no effect on the proportion of patients who had cancer screening tests (P = .20) and a significant adverse effect on the mean number of tests performed (P = .05) after 4 months. In a subgroup of previous compliers (those who had one or more tests 12 months before the study), however, there was a lower proportion of patients receiving one or more tests (P = .019) with a lower mean number of tests (P = .007) than previous compliers in the control group. Recall strategies for cancer screening tests need to be more extensively studied in the United States before they are routinely adopted in family practice..

Study #2: Breast and cervical cancer screening in a low-income managed care sample: the efficacy of physician letters and phone calls.. A randomized trial was conducted to evaluate the impact of mailed psychoeducational materials on adherence to Pap tests and mammograms in a low-income managed care program. Women 40 to 79 years of age who were past due for cancer screening were randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Medical claims were reviewed after 6 months to determine intervention effectiveness. The odds of receiving all needed cancer screening tests during follow-up were four times higher in the intervention group. Women who reported having to take time off from work to see a doctor had lower odds of getting screened..

The role of early endoscopic intervention in the treatment of acute gallstone pancreatitis remains controversial. Previous randomized trials have not focused on the subgroup of patients with clinical evidence of biliopancreatic obstruction. This study failed to provide evidence that early endoscopic intervention reduces systemic and local inflammation in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis and biliopancreatic obstruction. If acute cholangitis can be safely excluded, early endoscopic intervention is not mandatory and should not be considered a standard indication."

The use of oxytocin alone in the active management of the third stage of labour is as effective as the use of oxytocin and ergometrine in preventing postpartum haemorrhage without an increase in the incidence of retained placenta. The incidences of nausea, vomiting and headache were significantly lower in the oxytocin group, as was the occurrence of a mean rise in diastolic and systolic blood pressures of 20 and 30 mmHg or more, respectively. The use of oxytocin-ergometrine was associated with nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure."

The available evidence suggests that there is no significant difference in the healing rate and level of discomfort experienced by patients with corneal abrasions treated with antibiotic ointment and mydriatic alone compared to those treated with antibiotic ointment, mydriatic and a double eye pad with bandage. Eye patching does not appear to be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions compared with topical antibiotic ointment. There is no significant difference in the rate of healing between the patched and nonpatched groups, even when adjusted for age and initial abrasion size. There was no difference in discomfort and interference with activities of daily living, other than greater difficulty walking in the patch group, and there were no complications in either group. Patching a corneal erosion does not significantly accelerate reepithelialization and does not alter the epithelial wound healing pattern. It does not reduce the incidence and severity of inflammation nor relieve pain when compared with treatment without patching."

The Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe form of epilepsy that usually begins in early childhood. It is characterized by multiple types of seizures, mental retardation, characteristic electroencephalographic abnormalities, and resistance to standard antiepileptic drugs. The current study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lamotrigine as adjunctive therapy for seizures associated with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
                Eligible patients had more than one type of predominantly generalized seizure, including tonic-clonic, atonic, tonic, and major myoclonic, and had seizures on average at least every other day. After a 4-week base-line period in which all participants received placebo, we randomly assigned 169 patients (age range, 3 to 25 years) to 16 weeks of lamotrigine (n= 79) or placebo (n=90) in addition to their other antiepileptic drugs.
                The median frequency of all major seizures changed from base-line levels of 16.4 and 13.5 per week in the lamotrigine and placebo groups, respectively, to 9.9 and 14.2 per week after 16 weeks of treatment (P=0.002). Thirty-three percent of the patients in the lamotrigine group and 16 percent of those in the placebo group had a reduction of at least 50 percent in the frequency of seizures (P= 0.01). There were no significant differences between groups in the incidence of adverse events, except for colds or viral illnesses, which was more common in the lamotrigine group (P=0.05).

The ketogenic diet is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has been used to treat epilepsy for over 100 years. It is effective in reducing seizures in children and adults with epilepsy, particularly those with drug-resistant epilepsy. The diet is safe and well-tolerated, with few side effects. The mechanism of action of the ketogenic diet is not fully understood, but it is thought to work by altering brain metabolism and reducing excitability. The diet is typically initiated in the hospital, with a gradual increase in fat intake and a decrease in carbohydrate intake. It is important to closely monitor patients on the ketogenic diet, particularly in the first few weeks, to ensure adequate nutrition and to prevent complications such as dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.

The studies suggest that screening elderly people in primary care can improve morale and mental health, but there is no evidence of better resolution of physical problems or finding activities of daily living easier. Screening for visual impairment in people aged 75 or over as part of a multidimensional screening programme did not lead to improved visual outcomes. A randomised controlled trial was conducted to test a multicomponent intervention program for preventing disability and falls in older adults, but the results suggest that benefits diminished by the second year of follow-up. A health visitor visiting a group of people aged 70 and over and using simple preventive measures had no effect on the incidence of fractures. Preventive home visits were not beneficial for the general population of elderly people living at home but might be effective when restricted to subjects with poor health."

The studies suggest that manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) is an effective and safe alternative to electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) for first trimester abortion. There were no significant differences in pain levels or satisfaction reported by patients, but significantly more women in the electric group were bothered by noise. Physicians found MVA as acceptable as EVA for elective abortions performed at less than 10 weeks gestation. The two groups did not differ in their reports of pain, anxiety or bleeding or in the acceptability of their method. Estimated blood loss was significantly lower for patients treated by VA than D & C at 6 to 10 week's gestation, but the difference in blood loss was not statistically significant at 11 to 12 weeks' gestation. Time from insertion to removal of the speculum was significantly less with VA than D & C at 6 to 10 weeks' gestation but not at 11 to 12 weeks' gestation. Since vacuum aspiration is at least as safe as D & C, and appears to be more convenient and costeffective, it should on the basis of this experience be accepted over D & C as the standard method for treatment of first trimester abortion."

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Evaluation of sponging and antipyretic medication to reduce body temperature in febrile children.. Two hundred and twenty-four children aged 6 months to 5 years, with rectal temperatures greater than or equal to 30 degrees (104 degrees F), were randomly treated with sponging alone or with medication including a single oral dose of aspirin 15 mg/kg, or paracetamol 15 mg/kg, or ibuprofen 8 mg/kg. Twenty-three children were excluded from the final analysis because they did not complete the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients were found to be comparable in all groups. Rectal temperatures were recorded every 30 min for a 3 h period. During the first 30 min of intervention, sponging was found to be more effective than all of the three medications. After 60 min, the effects of each medication became superior to sponging with tepid water in reducing body temperature. Twenty-three children were excluded from the final analysis because they did not complete the study. Comparing the effect of the three different medications, it was seen that the antipyretic efficacy of aspirin and ibuprofen were significantly more than paracetamol 3 h after intervention (P < 0.05). For the management of fever over 39 degrees C, it is therefore recommended to give children an antipyretic drug, preferably ibuprofen, and at the same time to begin sponging to provide a rapid and sustained antipyresis.

The timing of tracheotomy in patients requiring mechanical ventilation is unknown. The effects of early percutaneous dilational tracheotomy compared with delayed tracheotomy in critically ill medical patients needing prolonged mechanical ventilation were assessed. Patients were prospectively randomized to either early percutaneous tracheotomy within 48 hrs or delayed tracheotomy at days 14-16. Time in the intensive care unit and on mechanical ventilation and the cumulative frequency of pneumonia, mortality, and accidental extubation were documented. Early group showed significantly less mortality (31.7% vs. 61.7%), pneumonia (5% vs. 25%), and accidental extubations compared with the prolonged translaryngeal group (0 vs. 6). The early tracheotomy group spent less time in the intensive care unit (4.8 +/- 1.4 vs. 16.2 +/- 3.8 days) and on mechanical ventilation (7.6 +/- 2.0 vs. 17.4 +/- 5.3 days). There was also significantly more damage to mouth and larynx in the prolonged translaryngeal intubation group.

The purpose of this trial was to compare three different iodine interventions. School children aged 8-10 years were randomized into one of three groups: group A was provided with iodized salt by researchers with an iodine concentration of 25 ppm; group B purchased iodized salt from the market; and group C was similar to group B with the exception that they were given iodized oil capsules containing 400 mg iodine at the beginning of the study. Salt iodine content was measured bimonthly for 18 months and indicators of iodine deficiency were measured at baseline and 6, 9, 12 and 18 months after randomization. The prevalence of abnormal thyroid volumes, based on the World Health Organization (WHO) body surface area reference >97th percentile, was 18% at baseline and declined to less than 5% by 12 months in groups A and C, and to 9% after 18 months in group B. Results for goitre by palpation were similar. The median urinary iodine was 94 microg l(-1) at baseline and increased in all groups to > 200 microg l(-1) at the 6-month follow-up. In this population of school children with initially a low to moderate level of iodine deficiency, the group receiving salt with 25 ppm (group A) was not iodine deficient on all indicators after 18 months of study.

The treatment of acute cystitis in pregnant women using a single-dose of fosfomycin trometamol was equally effective as the 3-day course of oral ceftibuten. Both regimens were well tolerated with only minor adverse effects. Long-term chemoprophylaxis should be suggested in patients with recurrent UTI or following acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy.

Cefuroxime can be considered as a first choice option in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy due to its tolerance, microbiological activity and efficacy.

Completion of 10 days of antibiotic therapy with oral medication does not significantly reduce the risk of recurrent pyelonephritis immediately post-parenteral treatment. Women in the no oral treatment group had a non-significant increase in positive UC at the 2-week follow-up visit. The high rates of recurrent urinary tract infection during pregnancy in both groups underscore the need for regular UC and for the possible role of oral antibiotic suppression.

There are no significant differences in clinical responses or birth outcomes of inpatients or outpatients treated for acute pyelonephritis after 24 weeks' gestation if they completed their assigned protocols. Thirty percent of outpatients were unable to, and most women with acute pyelonephritis in the third trimester were not candidates for outpatient therapy."

The results of the studies suggest that there is no significant difference in reading rates between coloured light filter overlays and a clear filter. However, some coloured light filter overlays were found to have a significantly poorer overall ranking in terms of reading rates compared to other coloured and clear light filters.

The use of electronic vision enhancement systems (EVES) can improve reading speed and acuity, as well as some specific near tasks. However, some EVES can be performed just as fast using optical magnification.

Clinicians should continue to show patients conventional optical aids and demonstrate electronic HMDs only when appropriate for the individual patient. Younger patients and those with better distance acuity are more likely to benefit from HMDs, particularly when reading small print.

Head-mounted video magnifiers, such as LVES, can support good low-vision reading performance, but the restricted range of magnification may limit the usefulness of the device as a reading magnifier for people with very low acuity.

Clinicians can expect significantly better initial reading performance for patients with central visual-field losses when reading with CCTVs versus optical devices. Handheld CCTVs, when compared with stand-mounted systems, are less expensive, provide equal performance, and have slightly lower subject preference ratings.

The four new ergonomically designed magnifiers were preferred by low vision patients compared to a commercial stand magnifier.

The use of the Virtual Retinal Display (VRD) as a low-vision computer interface showed no significant difference in reading speed between displays, but individual subjects with predominantly optical causes of low vision exhibited clinically important increases in reading speed versus the CRT. However, most subjects with predominantly retinal damage showed a slight disadvantage using the VRD."

The results of the randomized controlled trials of fecal occult blood screening for colorectal cancer are consistent in demonstrating a substantial, statistically significant reduction in colorectal cancer mortality from biennial screening. The reduction in mortality was independent of sex and site of tumor. The reduction in mortality was sustained, but further follow-up of this population is required to determine whether a significant reduction in the incidence of colorectal cancer will be achieved. The lesser reduction in mortality from CRC of 11% compared to 18% after 5 screening rounds may be explained by the decrease in the number screened. Efficacy in those screened supports the introduction of countrywide screening in Denmark, but it must be ascertained that acceptability, proportion of early CRC and logistics all reach the same standard as in the randomized trial."

Combined spinal-epidural (CSE) analgesia is a technique that combines the rapid onset of spinal analgesia with the longer duration of epidural analgesia. It has been shown to be effective in providing pain relief during labor, with fewer side effects than epidural analgesia alone. However, there is still controversy regarding the optimal technique for CSE analgesia, including the type and dose of local anesthetic and opioid used.

Intrathecal opioids, such as fentanyl or sufentanil, have been shown to provide excellent pain relief during labor, with minimal motor blockade. However, there is concern about the potential for respiratory depression in the mother and neonate. Epidural opioids, such as sufentanil, have also been shown to provide effective pain relief during labor, with less respiratory depression than intrathecal opioids.

The studies reviewed in this summary suggest that CSE analgesia with intrathecal opioids provides rapid and effective pain relief during labor, with minimal motor blockade and side effects. However, there is still controversy regarding the optimal technique for CSE analgesia, including the type and dose of local anesthetic and opioid used. Further research is needed to determine the optimal technique for CSE analgesia during labor."

The use of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) in the management of preeclampsia is well established. However, the optimal duration of MgSO4 therapy is not well defined. The purpose of this study was to determine whether women receiving 12-hour and 24-hour postpartum MgSO4 therapy for mild preeclampsia have differing clinical courses.
                Consenting women with suspected mild preeclampsia were randomly assigned to 12 hours or 24 hours of MgSO4 postpartum therapy. Treatment was continued after the assigned time period if there was evidence of severe disease. The frequency of progression to severe disease and other outcomes were compared between study groups using the Fisher exact, chi2, and Student t tests where appropriate.
                Between January 2001 and August 2004, 200 women were enrolled. The 12-hour and 24-hour groups were similar in age, parity, delivered gestational age, anesthesia, and mode of delivery, as well as for proteinuria and blood pressure. In the 12-hour group, MgSO4 treatment was extended in seven women (6.9%) for progression to severe disease versus one (1.1%) in the 24-hour group (P = .07). Women who developed severe disease had higher blood pressures at the first prenatal visit (140/78 versus 122/69, P < or = .02 for systolic and diastolic pressures), at the time of randomization (152/88 versus 135/78, P < or = .03 for systolic and diastolic pressures), and were more likely to have insulin-requiring diabetes (27.3% versus 4.4%, P = .03). No 12-hour patients required treatment beyond 24 hours postpartum. There were no seizures, MgSO4 toxicity, or intolerance in either group.

This treatment was followed by oral chloroquine (10 mg/kg/d for 3 d). The primary end points of the study were fatal outcome and coma recovery time. In the intrarectal group, 35 children were cured (90%) and 4 died. In the infused group, 28 were cured (76%) and 9 died; mean coma recovery times were 34.6 h (SD = 12.8) and 33.0 h (SD = 14.1) for the intrarectal and infused groups, respectively. None of the differences was significant. Both treatments were well tolerated and no anal irritation was observed with intrarectal Quinimax.

The most expensive and ineffective way of treating STD was by not providing drugs. Integrated peer education, condom distribution, and syndromic STI management did not reduce population-level HIV-1 incidence in a declining epidemic, despite reducing HIV-1 incidence in the immediate male target group.

The results of the present study suggest that immediate replacement without functional loading may be considered a valuable therapeutic option for selected cases of single-tooth replacement in the esthetic area when TE implants are used. Implant stability at the moment of implant placement is slightly inferior in the immediate replacement group, but it does not affect the treatment result.

The results of the present study suggest that VDH and HDD reduction at defects adjacent to immediate implants may be achieved without the use of membranes and/or bone grafts.

BioOss significantly reduced horizontal resorption of buccal bone. There is a risk of mucosal recession and adverse soft tissue esthetics with immediate implant placement. However, this risk may be reduced by avoiding a buccal position of the implant in the extraction socket.

The evidence suggests that dietary interventions can be effective in reducing blood cholesterol levels in individuals with hypercholesterolemia. However, the magnitude of the reduction may be influenced by the intensity of the intervention, the duration of the intervention, and the type of intervention provided. The most effective interventions appear to be those that involve individualized advice provided by a dietitian or a structured group program. The use of dietary fact sheets or brief advice provided by a physician or practice nurse may be less effective in achieving significant reductions in blood cholesterol levels.

The use of heparin in the prevention of pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia has been investigated in several studies. The results of these studies are conflicting. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) on the pregnancy outcome, on maternal blood pressure values, and on uteroplacental flow in ACE DD nonthrombophilic women with history of preeclampsia. Eighty nonthrombophilic ACE DD women were randomized in 2 groups: 41 treated with dalteparin 5000 IU/day and 39 untreated (control group). Women underwent 24-hour automated blood pressure monitoring in the preconceptional period and every 2 weeks from weeks 8 to 36 and transabdominal color flow/pulsed Doppler examination at weeks 16, 20, and 24. LMWH reduced the risk of clinical negative outcomes (74.1% reduction of preeclampsia and 77.5% reduction of fetal growth restriction) and the severity (88.3% reduction of early onset of preeclampsia and 86.4% reduction of early onset of fetal growth restriction). In treated women, the relative risk for preeclampsia was 0.26 (P=0.02), and the relative risk for fetal growth restriction was 0.14 (P<0.001). Systolic (P=0.002) and diastolic (P=0.002) blood pressures, as well as awake (P=0.04) and asleep (P=0.01) period values, and the resistance indexes of both uterine arteries (P=0.002) were lower in the treated group. LMWH reduces the recurrence of preeclampsia, of negative outcomes, and the resistance of uteroplacental flow, and also prevents maternal blood pressure increase in ACE DD homozygote women with a previous history of preeclampsia.."

The use of thrombolytic agents in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with acute submassive pulmonary embolism remains controversial.

Study #1: Heparin plus alteplase compared with heparin alone in patients with submassive pulmonary embolism. The use of thrombolytic agents in the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients with acute submassive pulmonary embolism remains controversial.
                We conducted a study of patients with acute pulmonary embolism and pulmonary hypertension or right ventricular dysfunction but without arterial hypotension or shock. The patients were randomly assigned in double-blind fashion to receive heparin plus alteplase or heparin plus placebo over a period of two hours. The primary end point was in-hospital death or clinical deterioration requiring an escalation of treatment, which was defined as catecholamine infusion, secondary thrombolysis, endotracheal intubation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or emergency surgical embolectomy or thrombus fragmentation by catheter.
                Of 256 patients enrolled, 118 were randomly assigned to receive heparin plus alteplase and 138 to receive heparin plus placebo. The incidence of the primary end point was significantly higher in the heparin-plus-placebo group than in the heparin-plus-alteplase group (P=0.006), and the probability of 30-day event-free survival (according to Kaplan-Meier analysis) was higher in the heparin-plus-alteplase group (P=0.005). This difference was due to the higher incidence of treatment escalation in the heparin-plus-placebo group (24.6 percent vs. 10.2 percent, P=0.004), since mortality was low in both groups (3.4 percent in the heparin-plus-alteplase group and 2.2 percent in the heparin-plus-placebo group, P=0.71).

Uremic pruritus is a common and distressing symptom in patients with end-stage renal disease. The pathophysiology of uremic pruritus is not well understood, but it is thought to be multifactorial. Several treatments have been proposed for uremic pruritus, but none has been shown to be consistently effective.

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of various treatments for uremic pruritus. We searched clinical trials in a database and selected randomized controlled trials. We assessed the quality of the trials and the strength of the evidence for each treatment.

The evidence for the efficacy of antihistamines, gabapentin, and ondansetron is weak. The evidence for the efficacy of naltrexone, montelukast, and tacrolimus is moderate. The evidence for the efficacy of topical capsaicin, topical tacrolimus, and topical naltrexone is limited.

In conclusion, there is no clear evidence for the efficacy of any treatment for uremic pruritus. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the efficacy and safety of various treatments for uremic pruritus."

The 'Stent or Surgery' trial (SoS) is a randomized controlled trial to compare coronary artery bypass grafting with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and primary stent implantation in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease. This is a multicentre, multinational venture involving over 40 centres in 12 countries throughout Europe and Canada. Eligible and consenting patients will be randomly allocated, in equal proportions, to open revascularization by CABG or by PTCA with the primary implantation of intracoronary stents. The trial design is pragmatic and imposes few protocol restrictions in patient selection, surgical and intervention techniques or adjunctive medication schedules. The rationale and design of the trial are discussed, including important sub-studies, examining quality of life, neuropsychological outcome, cost and cost benefit.

Starting in 1996, MIDCAB was performed in 618 patients. Angiography was performed before discharge and repeated after 6 months at follow-up examination.

The results of the review showed that acetaminophen and NSAIDs were effective in the treatment of postoperative pain. The efficacy of acetaminophen was comparable to that of NSAIDs. The combination of acetaminophen and NSAIDs was more effective than acetaminophen alone. The combination of acetaminophen and codeine was more effective than acetaminophen alone.
                The results of this review suggest that acetaminophen and NSAIDs are effective in the treatment of postoperative pain. The combination of acetaminophen and NSAIDs may be more effective than acetaminophen alone. Further studies are needed to determine the optimal dosing regimen and the most effective combination of acetaminophen and NSAIDs."

The results of the studies suggest that antidepressant medication is effective in the treatment of depression in primary care. However, the evidence is limited by the small number of studies and the lack of high quality evidence. There is some evidence that psychological treatments may be as effective as antidepressant medication, but the evidence is also limited. Further research is needed to determine the most effective treatments for depression in primary care."

The use of local anaesthesia is effective in reducing pain during cervical biopsy and treatment with the Semm coagulator. The intracervical injection of prilocaine with felypressin (Citanest and Octapressin) is the preferred local anaesthetic combination for large loop excision of the transformation zone of the cervix. The use of cocaine spray to provide pain relief during laser vaporization of the cervix is effective."

The provided abstracts suggest that child sexual abuse prevention programs can be effective in increasing children's knowledge of abuse prevention concepts and skills. However, the effectiveness of these programs may vary depending on the age and cognitive abilities of the children, the duration and intensity of the program, and the method of delivery. Some programs may also have unintended side effects, such as increased anxiety or negative emotional consequences. Further research is needed to determine the most effective ways to prevent child sexual abuse and to address potential side effects of prevention programs."

The efficacy of primaquine in combination with artesunate for the treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria was assessed in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 100 patients in the Gambia. The patients were randomly assigned to receive either artesunate alone or in combination with primaquine. The patients were followed up for 42 days. The parasite clearance time was significantly shorter in the patients who received artesunate plus primaquine than in those who received artesunate alone. The gametocyte clearance time was also significantly shorter in the patients who received artesunate plus primaquine than in those who received artesunate alone. The addition of primaquine to artesunate did not increase the incidence of adverse events. The results of this study suggest that the combination of artesunate and primaquine is a safe and effective treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria..

Study #12: [Therapeutic efficacy of a regimen of artesunate-mefloquine-primaquine treatment for Plasmodium falciparum malaria and treatment effects on gametocytic development].. The efficacy and gametocytic activity was evaluated for two treatment regimens, AS-MQ (with or without PQ) in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.
                Between April 2007 and February 2008, 50 patients were recruited for the trial in Turbo, Antioquia. A randomized clinical trial was conducted. Treatment compliance was supervised, with a clinical and parasitological assessment on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 to evaluate response rate according to the WHO 2003 protocol.
                Clinical response and parasite elimination efficacy of AS-MQ (with or without PQ) was 100% (95% CI 86.3%-100%), and parasitemia and fever were absent on day 3 of treatment in all patients. Gametocytic elimination"

The results of the studies suggest that weight loss and sodium reduction interventions are effective in lowering blood pressure and reducing the incidence of hypertension in overweight adults with high-normal blood pressure. The effects of potassium-enriched salt on cardiovascular disease mortality and medical expenditures in elderly veterans were also observed. Reduced sodium intake and weight loss constitute a feasible, effective, and safe nonpharmacologic therapy of hypertension in older persons. The beneficial effects on blood pressure achieved in this trial have implications for the prevention of cardiovascular disease through dietary reduction of calories and sodium."

The available evidence suggests that aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but the magnitude of the effect is modest. The evidence is strongest for the prevention of colorectal adenomas, which are precursors to most colorectal cancers. The effect of aspirin on the risk of colorectal cancer is uncertain, and the evidence is insufficient to recommend aspirin for the prevention of colorectal cancer."

Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting up to 14% of pregnancies. It is associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and the baby. The risk of GDM is increased in women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy.

The management of GDM involves dietary modification and exercise. However, there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of these interventions.

The aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of dietary modification and exercise in preventing GDM in women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy.

The review included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,500 women. The trials were of moderate to high quality.

The results of the review showed that dietary modification and exercise were effective in preventing GDM in women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy.

The review also showed that dietary modification and exercise were effective in preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy.

The review found no evidence of adverse effects of dietary modification and exercise on the mother or the baby.

The review suggests that dietary modification and exercise should be recommended to women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy to prevent GDM and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.

The review also suggests that further research is needed to determine the optimal type and intensity of dietary modification and exercise for preventing GDM and excessive weight gain during pregnancy."
