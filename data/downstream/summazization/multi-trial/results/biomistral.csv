142,"[/INST] The studies included in this summary evaluated the efficacy and safety of different nitric oxide donors for cervical ripening before surgical termination of pregnancy in the first trimester. The studies compared the nitric oxide donors with each other or with a prostaglandin analogue. The nitric oxide donors evaluated were isosorbide mononitrate, misoprostol, sodium nitroprusside, and glyceryl trinitrate. The prostaglandin analogue evaluated was gemeprost. The studies found that isosorbide mononitrate was less effective than misoprostol in cervical ripening before suction termination of pregnancy. Intracervical administration of 80 mg isosorbide dinitrate in women with missed abortions appears to be effective for cervical ripening prior to surgical evacuation of the uterus. Sodium nitroprusside is not as effective as misoprostol in cervical ripening before surgical termination of pregnancy in the first trimester. Like the prostaglandin analogue gemeprost, the nitric oxide donors isosorbide mononitrate and glyceryl trinitrate can effect cervical ripening.

218,"[/INST] The summary of the study abstracts is as follows: The nature of feeding in infants with cleft lip and/or palate is different from that of noncleft infants. Infants with cleft lip and/or palate have shorter sucks, a faster sucking rate, higher suck-swallow ratios, and a greater proportion of intraoral positive pressure generation. Infants with cleft lip and/or palate who were fed with a squeezable bottle had increased growth in weight and head circumference compared to those fed with a rigid bottle. Both feeding methods were effective in supporting normal growth. Infants with cleft lip and/or palate who were not treated with infant orthopedics had similar feeding velocities and growth outcomes as those who were treated with infant orthopedics. Early postoperative breast feeding after cleft lip repair is safe and results in more weight gain at 6 weeks after surgery."

243,"[/INST] The studies included in this summary investigated the effects of fish oil supplementation on appetite, weight, and nutritional status in patients with advanced cancer and anorexia/cachexia. The first study, a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, found that fish oil did not significantly influence appetite, tiredness, nausea, well-being, caloric intake, nutritional status, or function after 2 weeks compared with placebo in patients with advanced cancer and loss of both weight and appetite . The second study, a randomized double blind trial, compared a protein and energy dense supplement enriched with n-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (experimental: E) with an isocaloric isonitrogenous control supplement (C) for their effects on weight, lean tissue, dietary intake, and quality of life in cachectic patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. At the mean dose taken, enrichment with n-3 fatty acids did not provide a therapeutic advantage and both supplements were equally effective in arresting weight loss. Post hoc dose-response analysis suggests that if taken in sufficient quantity, only the n-3 fatty acid enriched energy and protein dense supplement resulted in net gain of weight, lean tissue, and improved quality of life. Further trials are required to examine the potential role of n-3 enriched supplements in the treatment of cancer cachexia . The third study, a North Central Cancer Treatment Group and National Cancer Institute of Canada collaborative effort, determined whether an EPA supplement-administered alone or with megestrol acetate (MA)-was more effective than MA. The percentage of patients with appetite improvement (North Central Cancer Treatment Group Questionnaire) was not statistically different: 63%, 69%, and 66%, in EPA-, MA-, and combination-treated arms, respectively (P =.69). In contrast, 4-week Functional Assessment of Anorexia/Cachexia Therapy scores suggested MA-containing arms experienced superior appetite stimulation compared with the EPA arm, with scores of 40, 55, and 55 in EPA-, MA-, and combination-treated arms, respectively (P =.004).

The use of Naproxen sodium (550 mg) 30 minutes before surgery was not found to be effective in reducing pain during laser vaporization of the cervix."
245,"[/INST] The summary of the study abstracts is as follows: The studies evaluated various child abuse prevention programs and their impact on knowledge, skills, and attitudes of children regarding abuse prevention. The programs included in the studies were: Who Do You Tell?, ESPACE, CAP, Teaching personal safety skills for potential prevention of sexual abuse, Preventing sexual coercion in dating situations, a brief intervention for educating school children in awareness of physical and sexual abuse, Teaching self-protection to children using television techniques, Behavioral Skills Training program, Project TRUST, and Feeling Yes, Feeling No. The programs were evaluated using pre- and post-test questionnaires, knowledge and skills tests, and follow-up assessments. The programs were found to be effective in improving children's knowledge and skills regarding abuse prevention, as well as in reducing the incidence of abuse. The programs also helped in improving children's attitudes and beliefs regarding abuse prevention. The studies also highlighted the importance of early intervention and the need for continued research and development of effective child abuse prevention programs."
246,"[/INST] The studies included in this review evaluated the efficacy of different antimalarial drug combinations in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria. The studies were conducted in different regions of the world, including Africa, Asia, and South America. The antimalarial drug combinations evaluated in the studies included artemisinin-based combinations, such as artesunate-mefloquine, artesunate-sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, and artesunate-primaquine. The studies also evaluated the efficacy of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine monotherapy, as well as the efficacy of primaquine in combination with other antimalarial drugs. The studies found that artemisinin-based combinations were highly effective in treating uncomplicated malaria, with cure rates of over 90% in most studies. The studies also found that primaquine in combination with other antimalarial drugs was effective in clearing gametocytes and reducing the risk of malaria transmission. However, the studies also identified some limitations of the antimalarial drug combinations evaluated in the studies, including the potential for drug interactions and the need for close monitoring of patients for adverse events. Overall, the studies provide important information on the efficacy of different antimalarial drug combinations in treating Plasmodium falciparum malaria and can help inform the development of new antimalarial drug policies and guidelines."
247,"[/INST] The studies included in this summary all focused on the effects of weight loss and sodium reduction interventions on blood pressure and hypertension incidence in overweight people with high-normal blood pressure. The studies were conducted in the United States and included a total of 2382 men and women aged 30-54 years. The interventions included counseling aimed at promoting weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and their combination. The interventions were found to be effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the short-term (6 months), with weight loss and sodium reduction interventions resulting in a decrease in blood pressure of 3.7/2.7 mm Hg and 2.9/1.6 mm Hg, respectively. The effects on average blood pressure declined over time, but the interventions were found to be effective in reducing the incidence of hypertension. The incidence of hypertension was significantly lower in each active intervention group than the usual care group, with relative risks ranging from 0.78 to 0.82. The studies also found that a switch from regular salt to potassium-enriched salt was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and medical expenditures in elderly veterans. A randomized controlled trial of nonpharmacologic interventions in the elderly found that weight loss and reduced sodium intake were effective in the treatment of older persons with hypertension. The combined outcome measure was less frequent among those assigned vs not assigned to reduced sodium intake (relative hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.81; P<.001) and, in obese participants, among those assigned vs not assigned to weight loss (relative hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85; P=.002). The effects of nonpharmacologic interventions on blood pressure of persons with high normal levels were also studied. The results showed that weight reduction intervention produced weight loss of 3.9 kg, diastolic blood pressure change of -2.3 mm Hg, and systolic blood pressure change of -2.9 mm Hg. Sodium reduction interventions lowered urinary sodium excretion by 44 mmol"
248,"[/INST] Varenicline is a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is used for smoking cessation. It is more selective for the alpha4beta2 subtype of nAChRs, which are thought to be involved in the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Varenicline has been shown to be effective in helping smokers quit in several clinical trials. It has been approved for use in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the European Union. Varenicline is typically taken once or twice a day, and it is available in both immediate-release and extended-release forms. It is generally well tolerated, with common side effects including nausea, insomnia, and abnormal dreams."
249,"[/INST] The studies included in this summary were all randomized controlled trials of aspirin or sulindac in the prevention of colorectal adenomas or cancer. The studies were conducted in patients with a history of colorectal adenomas or in patients with familial adenomatous polyposis. The studies were generally well-designed and well-conducted, but the results were inconsistent."
250,[/INST] The studies included in this review are randomized controlled trials that compare the efficacy of different antibiotic prophylaxis regimens in preventing infectious complications after transrectal prostate biopsy. The studies were conducted in different countries and the number of patients included in each study varied from 75 to 140. The studies were published between 1996 and 2002.
251,"[/INST] The studies in this review were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary interventions in preventing or treating obesity-related complications in pregnancy. The studies included in this review were randomized controlled trials that compared different dietary interventions with usual care or placebo. The interventions included dietary counseling, meal replacements, and dietary supplements. The outcomes of the studies included maternal and neonatal outcomes such as gestational weight gain, maternal glucose metabolism, and neonatal birth weight. The results of the studies showed that dietary interventions were effective in reducing gestational weight gain and improving maternal glucose metabolism. However, the evidence was limited on the effectiveness of dietary interventions in reducing neonatal birth weight. The studies also showed that dietary interventions were safe for both the mother and the fetus."
