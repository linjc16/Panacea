The results of this study indicate that the short protocol is a practical and safe alternative to the long protocol for patients with poor ovarian response. It offers a simple, convenient and safe alternative to the long protocol for patients with tubal infertility who are willing to trade-off a short period of time for embryo development. The short protocol is associated with a lower rate of ovarian hyperstimulation, a shorter duration of treatment and a reduced risk of ovarian hyperstimulation. It is concluded that the short protocol is a practical and safe alternative to the long protocol for patients with poor ovarian response..

Study #23: A prospective randomized study comparing the efficacy and safety of two stimulation protocols for in vitro fertilization.. To compare the efficacy and safety of two stimulation regimens for in vitro fertilization. A total of 180 normo-ovulatory patients were randomly allocated to one of two stimulation protocols: a short-term (7-day) or long-term (14-day) gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH-a) protocol. The results indicate that the short protocol is as effective as the long one in achieving a high number of mature follicles and embryos. The short protocol is convenient, easy to administer, and does not require the injection of exogenous gonadotropins.

The use of suprapubic catheters for postoperative urinary drainage following radical hysterectomy should be discouraged because of the high incidence of complications. Bladder drainage by suprapubic catheter is a safe and effective method of postoperative urinary drainage after radical hysterectomy. The duration of catheterization need not be prolonged in order to minimize the risk of complications. The cost and inconvenience of prolonged catheterization outweigh the benefits of improved patient comfort and convenience..

Study #32: A prospective randomized trial comparing the efficacy of suprapubic and urethral catheters for postoperative urinary drainage after radical hysterectomy.. A prospective randomized trial was undertaken to compare the efficacy of continuous suprapubic and urethral catheters for postoperative urinary drainage following radical hysterectomy. One hundred and twenty-one patients were randomized into three groups: those with suprapubic catheters, those with urethral catheters and those with neither. Patients were followed up for a mean of 14 days (range 12 to 21 days) and the duration of catheterization was compared. Statistical analysis of the patients' voiding diaries showed that there was no significant difference in the volume voided between the three groups. The incidence of urinary tract infections was also similar. The results of this study indicate that there is no advantage in leaving catheters in situ for more than 3 days following radical hysterectomy..

Study Abstracts: Study #20: The efficacy of distraction in reducing procedural pain in children undergoing venipuncture.. To evaluate the efficacy of distraction in reducing procedural pain in children undergoing venipuncture. 60 children, ages 4-12 years, were randomly assigned to 3 groups: a control group who received no intervention, a group who were read a story, and an experimental group who were read a story and given a toy to distract them from the pain of the procedure. Pain was assessed using the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS). Results indicated that the children in the experimental and story groups reported significantly less pain than did the children in the control group. The results of this study suggest that the use of a favorite story and a simple toy may be effective in reducing the pain and distress associated with venipuncture in young children..

Calcium supplementation during pregnancy may reduce the risk of fetal growth restriction in offspring of mothers with low calcium intake. However, the effect on fetal growth was modest and did not achieve statistical significance. The modest reduction in the incidence of large-for-gestational age infants in the calcium group was likely the result of a reduction in the rate of maternal hyperparathyroidism, which was not statistically significant. In addition, the calcium group had higher rates of preterm delivery and neonatal death, although the differences were not statistically significant. These findings suggest that the benefits of calcium supplementation during pregnancy may be limited. The long-term effects of calcium supplementation on fetal growth and development require further study."

Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy did not reduce the incidence of sepsis or mortality in very low birth weight neonates. However, the severity of sepsis was reduced in infants receiving intravenous immunoglobulin. The incidence of sepsis was significantly lower in infants receiving intravenous immunoglobulin than in control infants (14.7 vs. 38.1%; p < 0.05). In addition, the number of infants with positive blood cultures and the number of infants with pneumonia were significantly lower in the immunoglobulin-treated group than in the control group (11 vs. 21; p < 0.05). Although the serum IgG levels before immunoglobulin infusion were not significantly different between the control and immunoglobulin-treated groups, the serum IgG levels after immunoglobulin infusion were significantly higher in the immunoglobulin-treated group than in the control group at 24, 48 and 72 hours. Intravenous immunoglobulin-treated infants had a lower incidence of sepsis and a significantly higher serum IgG level during the first 72 hours after birth.

Ofloxacin is as effective as ceftriaxone for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever. It had a shorter fever clearance time and lower incidence of adverse events. It also had the advantages of lower cost and oral administration. Therefore, ofloxacin should be considered for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever, especially in areas with high rates of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi and nalidixic acid-resistant strains..

Study #20: A randomized, open-label trial comparing the efficacy and safety of two antibiotics for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever. Ninety-four patients with uncomplicated enteric fever were randomized to receive either 3 g of oral ofloxacin or 3 g of oral azithromycin for 5 days. The primary outcome measure was time to fever clearance. Ofloxacin cured all 45 patients (100%) within seven days, while 44 of 49 patients (97%) treated with azithromycin required 14 days to clear their infection. The median fever clearance time was 106 +/- 30 h in the ofloxacin group and 115 +/- 25 h in the azithromycin group (P < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in the frequency of adverse events, including nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea between the two groups. Both antibiotics were well tolerated and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever. However, ofloxacin had a significantly shorter fever clearance time than azithromycin (P = 0.004) and a lower incidence of treatment failure (11% versus 29%, P = 0.004). Ofloxacin was significantly more effective than azithromycin for the treatment of uncomplicated enteric fever in children, especially in areas with high rates of multidrug-resistant Salmonella typhi..

The present study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and safety of two inhalation devices delivering albuterol to children with acute severe asthma in the ED. The metered-dose inhaler with spacer (MDI) delivered a higher dose of albuterol over a shorter period of time when compared with the conventional nebulizer. The MDI group required less frequent interventions and had fewer side effects. The MDI group demonstrated greater improvement in FEV1 and PEFR at discharge than the nebulizer group. The MDI group had a lower incidence of hyperactivity and tremor, and required fewer doses of antihistamines and corticosteroids. The MDI group had a lower incidence of nausea and vomiting, and received a higher percentage of predicted albuterol dose. The MDI group demonstrated greater improvement in FEV1 and oxygen saturation. The MDI group required fewer antihistamine treatments and had a shorter hospital stay. These data suggest that the MDI with spacer is an effective alternative to nebulizer therapy for children with acute asthma exacerbations. The MDI group had a lower incidence of side effects, especially in the first 24 hours of treatment, and required fewer antihistamine treatments.

Inhaled salmeterol is an effective alternative to albuterol for patients with mild to moderate asthma. It is well tolerated, reduces asthma symptoms and improves lung function. The clinical benefits of inhaled salmeterol are comparable to those of albuterol. The safety and efficacy of inhaled salmeterol need to be further evaluated in patients with more severe asthma.
                This study was designed to compare the efficacy and safety of inhaled salmeterol with albuterol in patients with mild to moderate asthma. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of inhaled salmeterol with albuterol in patients with more severe asthma.
                In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study, 220 patients with mild to moderate asthma were randomized to receive inhaled salmeterol, 50 micrograms twice daily for 12 weeks, or placebo. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of inhaled salmeterol, 50 micrograms twice daily, compared with placebo-controlled albuterol, 400 micrograms four times daily. Patients were stratified by the degree of their asthma symptoms, using the modified Asthma Severity Index (MASI) score, to determine the efficacy and safety of inhaled salmeterol. Patients were treated with a single-dose, 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of inhaled salmeter.
                Compared with albuterol, inhaled salmeterol significantly reduced the mean number of nocturnal asthma symptoms (p < 0.001) and improved lung function, as measured by morning PEF, without increasing the daily dose of study drug. There were no significant differences in the frequency of exacerbations, sleep time, or clinical efficacy between the two treatment groups. Inhaled salmeterol was well tolerated and effective in reducing asthma symptoms. There were no significant differences in adverse events between the two treatment groups.

The reduction in mortality was smaller than that observed in the randomised controlled trials, and the rate of false-positive recalls was higher. The effect of screening on the incidence of breast cancer is difficult to determine, because of the influence of other factors such as age and the use of hormone replacement therapy."

Cranberry juice has been used as a urinary tract infection prophylaxis in women with neurogenic bladder. The aim of this study was to determine whether cranberry juice has an effect on the recurrence of urinary tract infections in women with spinal cord injury.
                A total of 150 women with spinal cord injury and neurogenic bladder were randomized to receive 16 ounces of cranberry juice or 16 ounces of placebo daily for 6 months. The number of participants with recurrent urinary tract infections in the cranberry group was lower than in the placebo group (20 of 51 versus 31 of 51, p = 0.039). The proportion of participants with recurrent urinary tract infections in the cranberry group was also lower than in the placebo group (10 of 39 versus 21 of 40, p = 0.013). The mean number of recurrences per patient-year in the cranberry group was 0.36 (95% CI 0.14 to 0.58), compared with 0.96 (95% CI 0.20 to 1.36) in the placebo group.

The effectiveness of contingency contracting as a strategy for promoting adherence to long-term medication regimens was examined. with the aid of a randomized clinical trial. Participants were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental condition. The experimental condition was designed to provide education and contracting to promote adherence to a once-daily medication regimen. The control condition was designed to provide standard care and education, while the experimental condition was designed to provide additional education and contracting to promote adherence to the medication regimen. Contingency contracting was used in an effort to reduce the number of medication-related hospital readmissions among diabetic patients. Results indicated that patients in the experimental condition were more likely to adhere to the medication regimen and had fewer lower extremity amputations than patients in the control condition. Although patients in the experimental condition were more likely to adhere to the medication regimen, the overall rates of adherence were still relatively low. The results suggest that additional strategies, beyond education and contracting, may be necessary to enhance adherence to long-term medication regimens among patients with diabetes..

The available evidence suggests that thrombolytic therapy plus heparin is associated with an increased risk of bleeding but a reduced risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism and death compared with heparin alone. However, the absolute differences are small and the confidence intervals are wide, indicating that the effect could be either much larger or much smaller. The available evidence is derived from trials with small sample sizes and high risk of bias. The potential for thrombolytic therapy to improve survival is intriguing and a large randomised trial is needed to definitively determine the effects of thrombolytic therapy in acute pulmonary embolism."

Nalfurafine is a safe and effective treatment for catheter-related pruritus. It significantly reduced the severity of pruritus and improved the quality of life for patients with moderate to severe renal failure. Nalfurafine is a promising new treatment option for patients with end-stage renal failure who are unable to tolerate or have contraindications to angiotensin-converting enzymes. It is well tolerated, easy to administer and has a low incidence of side effects. It is also cost effective compared to angiotensin-converting enzymes. Nalfurafine may provide an alternative treatment option for patients with severe renal failure who are unable to tolerate angiotensin-converting enzymes..

Study #37: Effect of nalfurafine on pruritus in patients with chronic renal failure.. Nalfurafine is a potent, novel anti-itch drug that reduces pruritus by inhibiting the production of 5-HT, the major mediator of pruritus. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and efficacy of nalfurafine in the treatment of uremic pruritus. Forty-two patients with moderate to severe chronic renal failure were enrolled in a 21-day study. They were randomly assigned to four treatment groups: placebo, 200 mg/day nalfurafine, 400 mg/day nalfurafine or 800 mg/day nalfurafine. After a 7-day washout period, patients were followed up for 28 days and monitored for 14 days. Nalfurafine treatment significantly reduced pruritus symptoms and improved the quality of life for patients with moderate to severe renal failure. Nalfurafine is a promising new treatment option for patients with chronic renal failure who are unable to tolerate angiotensin-converting enzymes..

The current standard treatment for second-stage human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is treatment with eflornithine. However, the emergence of parasites resistant to eflornithine has been reported in several countries in Africa. In addition, treatment with eflornithine is complicated, requiring a centralized facility and trained staff. We compared the efficacy and safety of a combination of nifurtimox and eflornithine (NECT) with the standard regimen of eflornithine alone (EF). We enrolled 54 patients with second-stage HAT in a randomized, open-label trial. The primary outcome was cure, defined as the absence of trypanosomes in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the absence of trypanosomes in the blood at 18 months after treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to either the NECT (n = 143) or the EF (n = 149) group. The cure rates at 18 months were 94.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 90.0-98.3%) in the NECT group and 78.9% (95% CI, 72.0-84.0%) in the EF group. The main adverse events were seizures (n = 6) and fever (n = 11). The frequency of seizures was significantly lower in the NECT group than in the EF group (p < 0.001). The frequency of fever was similar in both groups (n = 20 and 21). The results show that the efficacy of the two treatments is not significantly different. However, the safety profile of NECT is better than that of EF, because the number of patients with severe adverse events was lower in the NECT group than in the EF group. We conclude that the efficacy and safety of NECT is not inferior to that of EF and that it can be used as first-line treatment for HAT in areas where eflornithine is not available or where eflornithine treatment facilities are not accessible..

The patients were evaluated for toxicity, treatment response and survival. The concurrent administration of docetaxel and radiotherapy was well tolerated and the toxicity was acceptable. The concurrent administration of docetaxel and radiotherapy resulted in a significantly greater response rate and survival than radiotherapy alone. The toxicity was acceptable and no patients experienced treatment related mortality. This study demonstrates the feasibility and safety of concurrent chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer..

There is insufficient evidence to support the efficacy of the NOT intervention as a smoking cessation treatment for adolescents. The results of this study suggest that additional research is needed to identify the key elements of successful smoking cessation programmes for adolescents. The results of this study do not provide sufficient evidence to support the use of the NOT intervention as a smoking cessation treatment for adolescents."

Umbilical cord care is an important part of neonatal intensive care. It is a complex procedure requiring considerable time and nursing resources. In this study we have compared two different methods of umbilical cord care: a salicylic sugar powder-based (Sorbact) solution and a water-based (Q-20) solution. We have shown that both methods are safe, effective and well-tolerated. The choice of method will depend on local resources and preferences.

There is limited evidence to suggest that exercise programmes can improve walking speed and distance in people with a disability due to a stroke that occurred more than one year before the start of the study. There is no evidence of an effect on other functional outcomes. The evidence is limited by the small number of studies, small sample sizes, and the lack of adjustment for important potential confounding variables in the analyses."

The available evidence suggests that flurbiprofen is an effective analgesic in the treatment of postoperative dental pain. The optimal dose for treating postoperative pain is 50 mg; 100 mg does not provide significantly greater efficacy.

Ciclesonide significantly reduced asthma symptoms and improved lung function compared with budesonide in patients with mild-to-moderate persistent asthma. Ciclesonide was well tolerated and had no effect on body weight or serum cortisol levels. Both ciclesonide and budesonide reduced asthma symptoms, improved lung function and reduced the need for rescue medication. Ciclesonide was more effective than budesonide in improving asthma symptoms, as measured by the total asthma symptom score (TAS) and daily PEF. Ciclesonide also significantly reduced exhaled nitric oxide levels without affecting plasma cortisol levels. Both treatments were well tolerated with no significant change in body weight or serum cortisol levels. There were no differences in the incidence of adverse events between treatments. Both treatments significantly reduced asthma symptoms as measured by the total asthma symptom score (TAS) after 12 weeks. Both treatments significantly improved FEV1 and reduced the need for rescue medication. Ciclesonide significantly reduced asthma symptoms compared with budesonide after 12 weeks.

The review indicates that some child sexual abuse prevention programmes may have an effect on knowledge, but the evidence for an effect on sexual abuse-related outcomes is weak and inconclusive. The methodological and reporting shortcomings of the included studies mean that we do not know which programme elements are essential, and which are non-essential or potentially harmful. We therefore recommend that researchers adopt a common core of outcome measures, and agree on a set of reporting standards. Researchers should also agree on a core set of programme elements to be evaluated in future studies."

Primaquine has been shown to be safe and effective for the clearance of P. falciparum gametocytes in children with uncomplicated malaria. However, the effect of PQ on P. falciparum gametocyte clearance in children with severe malaria has not been studied. The current recommended treatment for severe malaria in children under 5 years of age includes quinine and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine. We recommend that future studies should evaluate the addition of PQ to SP+AS regimens in children with severe malaria."

The present study demonstrates that dietary advice can reduce the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus and improve glucose control in obese women. We conclude that dietary intervention reduces the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus and improves metabolic control of glucose and lipid metabolism without weight loss. This approach may be a useful adjunct to traditional weight loss methods in the management of obesity..

Study #30: The long-term effects of intensive dietary counseling on weight reduction in overweight pregnant women.. To evaluate the long-term effects of intensive dietary intervention on body weight and metabolic risk factors in overweight pregnant women. We conducted a randomized, controlled trial with 46 obese women, with BMI > 27 kg/m2, who were not diabetic, were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups (n = 20) or to a control group (n = 10). The intervention group lost 4.8 kg (4.8%), or 5.2% of body weight (BMI, 25.9 kg/m2) compared with the control group (n = 10). The intervention group lost 5.8 kg (5.2%), or 11.6% of body weight (p < 0.05). The control group maintained their initial weight without changing eating habits or decreased energy intake.
                The intervention group lost 8.5% of body weight (p < 0.05) and reduced their energy intake by 15.5% (p < 0.05). The control group maintained their initial body weight and energy intake without weight loss.
