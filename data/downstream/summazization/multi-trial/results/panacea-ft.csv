The results of this meta- analysis suggest that probiotics supplementation significantly reduces the incidence of NEC and mortality in preterm infants .
The risks of probiotics are minimal .
Probiotics are used in many European units but only rarely in North-America .
In spite of the evidence , this safe and effective treatment for one of the most serious complications of prematurity has never been studied in the United States and perhaps never will .
Probiotics are quite inexpensive to manufacture .
People can even make them at home .
Some mothers have started adding probiotics to their breast milk .
In these cases, the medical team can either be unaware a preterm infant is in fact receiving probiotics or tacitly not interfere with these parental initiatives .
Given the low cost of probiotics and Articles in the series A Different View are edited by William Meadow ( wlm1@uchicago.edu ) .

Study #2: Probiotics in the prevention of necrotizing enterocolitis in preterm infants: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.. BACKGROUND & AIMS Necrotizing enterocolitis ( NEC ) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants . The use of probiotics as a preventive strategy for NEC has been studied in several r and omized trials with conflicting results . We aim ed to evaluate the efficacy of Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG ( LGG ) in the prevention of NEC in preterm infants . METHODS A r and omized , double-blind , placebo-controlled trial was conducted in a tertiary neonatal intensive care unit in Athens , Greece . Preterm infants ( gestational age : 25 to 36 weeks ; n = 180 ) who were mechanically ventilated and received enteral feeding were r and omly assigned to receive LGG ( 5 × 10(8"

The improvement in the inflammatory state is associated with a significant reduction in the levels of leptin , while it is not correlated with the degree of weight loss .
