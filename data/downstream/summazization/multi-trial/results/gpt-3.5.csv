0,"Based on the collection of study abstracts, it has been found that both alfimeprase and recombinant urokinase (r-UK) show promise in restoring function to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs). In a phase II trial, alfimeprase was shown to be more successful than alteplase, with the 3.0 mg dose of alfimeprase producing the highest patency rates. Similarly, a dose-ranging trial with r-UK demonstrated that all three concentrations of r-UK were significantly superior to placebo in restoring total CVAD function. The study also supports further evaluation of a 5,000 IU/mL concentration of r-UK for the treatment of occluded CVADs. In comparison, a trial with alteplase showed that it was effective in restoring flow to occluded catheters, without the need for pretreatment radiographic evaluation. Additionally, a study comparing urokinase and recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) found that 2 mg of t-PA restored catheter function more reliably and dissolved thrombi faster than twice the standard dose of urokinase. Another trial with r-UK demonstrated that it was superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency in occluded CVADs. Finally, a study on low-dose urokinase infusions found that they can restore function to the majority of catheters occluded by fibrin sleeves. Overall, these findings suggest that both alfimeprase and r-UK are effective in restoring function to occluded CVADs, with potential advantages over alteplase and urokinase in terms of efficacy and safety."
1,"Antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in reducing the incidence of peristomal wound infection after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) procedures. Various antibiotics, including cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and co-amoxiclav, have been shown to be effective in preventing infection. The use of local antiseptic spray in combination with antibiotics further reduces the incidence of stomal infection. Prophylactic antibiotics are particularly beneficial in patients without malignant disease and those at high risk of peristomal infectious complications, such as those with advanced oropharyngeal malignancy. The pull method of PEG placement is associated with a higher complication rate, but the use of antibiotic prophylaxis can significantly reduce complications. The overall consensus is that antibiotic prophylaxis should be recommended as a standard practice in PEG procedures."
