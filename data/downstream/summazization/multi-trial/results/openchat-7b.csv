1,"Glucomannan is a soluble fiber derived from the konjac root. Studies have shown that glucomannan supplementation can lead to significant reductions in body weight, body mass index, and body fat percentage in overweight and obese individuals. It has also been shown to improve lipid profiles, including reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. Additionally, glucomannan has been found to have positive effects on blood glucose levels and insulin resistance in individuals with type 2 diabetes. The fiber supplement is generally well-tolerated and has few side effects. Overall, glucomannan appears to be an effective and safe dietary supplement for weight management and improving lipid and glucose profiles in individuals with overweight and obesity, as well as those with type 2 diabetes."

5,"A systematic review of 18 studies on workplace interventions for low back pain prevention reveals that exercise programs, education, and ergonomic improvements can be effective in reducing the prevalence and intensity of musculoskeletal and psychosomatic complaints, improving physiotherapy status, and increasing shoulder strength and coordination. However, these interventions may also be associated with increased work-related stress and decreased job satisfaction. The Delphi list, a criteria list for quality assessment of randomized clinical trials, is a useful starting point for evaluating the methodological quality of studies on workplace interventions for low back pain prevention. The cost-benefit analysis of a back injury prevention program in a northern California county showed a modest overall decline in back pain prevalence rates and significant improvement in satisfaction and reduction in risky behaviors, with a net benefit of $161,108 and a return on investment of 179%. The effectiveness of educational programs in preventing low back injuries has been mixed, with some studies showing no long-term benefits associated with training. Prophylactic orthoses and multimodal intervention have been found to be effective in preventing back injury and reducing time loss. Exercise programs, particularly those that include a combination of strength/endurance and fitness training, have been shown to reduce sick leave attributable to back pain and improve work performance. Overall, a combination of exercise, education, and ergonomic improvements may be the most effective approach to preventing low back pain in the workplace."

They note that there is growing appreciation for the advantages of experimentation in the social sciences , and that policy-relevant claims that in the past were backed by theoretical arguments and inconclusive correlations are now being investigated using more credible methods . Changes have been particularly pronounced in development economics , where hundreds of r and omized trials have been carried out over the last decade . When experimentation is difficult or impossible , research ers are using quasi-experimental design s. Governments and advocacy groups display a growing appetite for evidence -based policy-making .

Study #26: The effect of a school-based intervention on the prevalence of HIV infection and sexual behavior among young people in rural Uganda: a cluster-randomised trial. Summary Background : The prevalence of HIV infection among young people in sub-Saharan Africa is high, and sexual behaviour is a major risk factor for HIV infection. We aimed to assess the effect of a school-based intervention on HIV infection and sexual behaviour among young people in rural Uganda. Methods : We did a cluster-randomised trial in 100 primary schools in rural Uganda. Schools were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or usual care. The intervention comprised 12 sessions of HIV education, peer education, and school-based counselling and testing for HIV infection. The primary outcome was HIV infection, measured by HIV antibody testing. This trial is registered, number ISRCTN31961122 . Findings : 100 schools were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention or usual care. 10 000 pupils were enrolled in the study. The prevalence of HIV infection was 1·3% (95% CI 0·9–1·9) in the intervention group and 1·4% (1·1–1·8) in the control group (p=0·64). The prevalence of sexual intercourse was 10·1% (95% C"

10,"Oral cobalamin therapy has been shown to be effective in treating cobalamin deficiency in elderly patients. Studies have demonstrated that oral cobalamin can be as effective as intramuscular injections in correcting hematologic parameters and increasing serum cobalamin levels. The use of oral cobalamin is also associated with better tolerability and lower costs compared to intramuscular injections. Doses of 250-1000 micrograms of oral crystalline cyanocobalamin per day for at least one month have been found to be effective in treating cobalamin deficiencies related to food-cobalamin malabsorption. Intranasal hydroxocobalamin has also been shown to be effective in increasing cobalamin concentrations in cobalamin-deficient patients. Overall, oral cobalamin therapy is a viable and effective alternative to intramuscular injections for the treatment of cobalamin deficiency in elderly patients."
11,"The studies suggest that oral immunoglobulins, particularly monomeric IgG, may be effective in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis in low-birth-weight infants. Probiotics, specifically a combination of Bifidobacterium infantis, Streptococcus thermophilus, and Bifidobacterium lactis, have also been shown to reduce the incidence and severity of NEC in very preterm infants. Oral gentamicin therapy has been found to be effective in preventing NEC in high-risk neonates. Acidifying the feedings of small premature infants to a pH low enough to inhibit bacterial proliferation in the stomach significantly lowers the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. Breast milk feeding has been associated with a significantly lower risk of NEC compared to formula feeding. The incidence and severity of NEC can be reduced by feeding enterally with Infloran (Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis) with breast milk. However, enteral human IgG supplementation does not appear to be effective in preventing necrotizing enterocolitis."

14,"Resistant starch (RS) has been shown to improve glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in both animal and human studies. In a systematic review of clinical trials, RS has been found to reduce fasting and postprandial insulin levels, improve insulin sensitivity, and reduce inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes. Additionally, RS has been shown to improve gut hormone release, which may contribute to its beneficial effects on appetite control and glucose homoeostasis. Some studies have also found that RS can reduce markers of endotoxemia and oxidative stress in patients with type 2 diabetes. Overall, the evidence suggests that RS may be a useful adjunct therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes, but more research is needed to confirm its efficacy and to determine the optimal dose and form of RS for use in clinical practice.

The studies reviewed here provide evidence that resistant starch can improve insulin sensitivity and reduce inflammation in patients with type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which RS exerts these effects are not fully understood, but may involve the stimulation of gut hormone release, the modulation of the gut microbiota, and the reduction of endotoxemia and oxidative stress. While the evidence is promising, more research is needed to determine the optimal dose and form of RS for use in clinical practice, and to confirm its efficacy in improving metabolic outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes."
15,"Iron deficiency is common in women, particularly in those who are physically active or have heavy menstrual bleeding. Iron deficiency can impair physical performance, particularly in endurance activities. However, the effects of iron supplementation on physical performance are not entirely clear. Some studies have shown improvements in physical performance with iron supplementation, while others have not. The effects of iron supplementation on physical performance may depend on the severity of iron deficiency, the type of exercise, and the duration of supplementation.

In general, iron supplementation can improve iron status and hemoglobin levels in iron-deficient individuals. However, the effects of iron supplementation on physical performance are less clear. Some studies have shown improvements in physical performance with iron supplementation, while others have not. The effects of iron supplementation on physical performance may depend on the severity of iron deficiency, the type of exercise, and the duration of supplementation.

In conclusion, iron deficiency can impair physical performance, particularly in endurance activities. Iron supplementation can improve iron status and hemoglobin levels in iron-deficient individuals. However, the effects of iron supplementation on physical performance are less clear and may depend on the severity of iron deficiency, the type of exercise, and the duration of supplementation.

16,"The studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions, such as mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and mindfulness meditation, can have positive effects on fibromyalgia patients, including improvements in pain, disability, depression, and overall well-being. Some studies also found that these interventions can lead to sustained benefits over time. However, the studies also highlight the need for further research to better understand the mechanisms behind these effects and to develop more effective interventions for fibromyalgia patients. Additionally, some studies found that dietary glutamate may contribute to fibromyalgia symptoms in some patients, and that mindfulness meditation plus Qigong movement therapy may not be superior to education and support as a treatment option for fibromyalgia. Overall, the studies suggest that mindfulness-based interventions can be a helpful addition to the treatment of fibromyalgia, but further research is needed to optimize these interventions and to better understand their underlying mechanisms."
