0,"The studies show that prebiotics can improve growth, stool consistency, and gastric motility in preterm infants. They can also reduce the incidence of diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis. Prebiotics may also have a positive impact on the gut microbiota, promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. Overall, prebiotics appear to be safe and well-tolerated in infants, and may have potential benefits for their growth and gut health."
1,"A summary of the findings from the studies is as follows:

1. Glucomannan, a soluble fiber derived from konjac root, has been shown to have a positive impact on plasma lipid levels, including total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides. Studies have reported reductions in these lipid levels ranging from 7.2% to 34%.

2. Glucomannan has been found to be effective in reducing body weight in overweight and obese individuals. Weight loss has ranged from 3.5% to 5.5% over an 8-week period.

3. Glucomannan has been shown to have a positive impact on glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Studies have reported reductions in fasting glucose levels ranging from 23.2% to 25%.

4. Glucomannan has been found to have a positive impact on blood pressure, with reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure ranging from 2.2% to 11%.

5. Glucomannan has been shown to be well-tolerated and safe for use in clinical trials, with no significant side effects reported.

6. Glucomannan has been found to be effective in reducing lipid levels and improving glycemic control in individuals with type 2 diabetes, making it a potential adjunct therapy for this population.

7. Glucomannan has been found to be effective in reducing body weight and improving lipid profiles in children with hypercholesterolemia, making it a potential adjunct therapy for this population as well.

8. Glucomannan has been found to be effective in reducing body weight and improving lipid profiles in individuals with severe obesity, making it a potential adjunct therapy for this population as well.

In conclusion, glucomannan has been shown to have a positive impact on plasma lipid levels, body weight, glycemic control, and blood pressure in various clinical trials. It is well-tolerated and safe for use, making it a potential adjunct therapy for individuals with hyperlipidemia, obesity, and type 2 diabetes."
