1. Alfimeprase, a novel-acting fibrin degradation agent, was found to be more successful than alteplase in restoring patency to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs) in a phase II trial. Alfimeprase 3.0 mg produced the highest patency rate at 120 minutes after the first (60%) and second (80%) doses.

2. Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was found to be superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs in a phase III trial. The primary efficacy variable was the restoration of catheter function to all treated lumens (i.e., total catheter patency) after one or two instillations.

3. Urokinase was found to be superior to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in thrombosed central venous catheters in a double-blinded, randomized trial. Urokinase restored catheter function more reliably and dissolved thrombi faster than t-PA.

4. Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was found to be superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs in a phase III trial. The primary efficacy variable was the restoration of catheter function to all treated lumens (i.e., total catheter patency) after one or two instillations.

1,"Study #12: Antibiotic prophylaxis in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG): a prospective randomized clinical trial.. The most frequent complication reported for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is peristomal wound infection which occurs in as many as 30 % of patients. In the studies published so far, the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of peristomal wound infection has remained controversial. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of peristomal wound infection associated with PEG.
                During a 2-year-period a total of 347 patients (251 men, 96 women; mean age 60.2+/-5) were included in our study. In all cases, a 9-French gauge Freka gastrostomy tube was inserted using the ""pull"" technique. The patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups (group 1, antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g cefotaxime; group 2, antibiotic prophylaxis with 4g piperacillin plus 0.5g tazobactam; group 3, no antibiotic prophylaxis). For a period of one week after gastrostomy, the peristomal area was evaluated using a wound score. According to the score, peristomal infections were classified as being of degree I-IV. Infections of up to degree III were regarded as minor, while an infection of degree IV was defined as a severe complication.
                PEG tubes were successfully placed in 336/347 patients (97 %). Of the 336 patients, 29 were excluded because of incomplete follow up (dropout rate 9%). Cases included were: in group 1, n = 101; in group 2, n = 100, and in group 3, n = 106. There was no mortality related to PEG insertion. There were five instances of severe complications (1.6%). Patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis had mean daily combined wound scores that"
2,"Study #1: Evaluation of the effectiveness of a low sodium diet in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.. 28 patients who had a sustained diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 104 mm Hg and who had no treatment for it for at least 13 months before the trial, but who were otherwise unselected, took part in a randomised controlled trial in which the effect of a restricted sodium diet was compared with that of a general health package. The general health package did not include any specific hypotensive procedures. Changes in blood pressure were measured at predetermined intervals over the course of a year. Within each group both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell to a highly significant extent after a year, but there was no significant difference between the groups. It would thus seem that the antihypertensive effect of a restricted sodium diet may be related to the increased consultation and monitoring activity of such intervention rather than to the dietary manipulation itself..

Study #2: Effects of a low-salt diet and of acute salt loading on blood pressure and intralymphocytic sodium concentration in young subjects with borderline hypertension.. 1. Three groups of young patients with borderline hypertension were studied for a 12 months period. The first was on a free sodium diet while the second was on a low-salt diet. The third group of patients underwent acute salt loading. 2. After 12 months the group on free diet showed a significant increase of intralymphocytic sodium but no change in blood pressure was noted. Five patients who were re-checked after 24 months also had a significant increase in blood pressure. 3. Patients treated with a low-salt diet showed a significant decrease of both intralymphocytic sodium concentration and blood pressure. 4. After acute salt loading, borderline subjects with high intralymphocytic sodium showed a significant greater natriuresis whereas intralymphocytic sodium increased only in those subjects in whom it was initially normal..

Study #3: A pilot study to test the feasibility of salt restriction in a community.. Index subjects were selected from the population of Milton studied in the May 1981 survey. Index subjects aged 64 or less with"
