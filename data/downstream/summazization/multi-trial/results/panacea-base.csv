0,"The key findings from the provided abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question are summarized as follows:

1. Alfimeprase, a novel-acting fibrin degradation agent, was found to be more successful than alteplase in restoring patency to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs) in a phase II trial. Alfimeprase 3.0 mg produced the highest patency rate at 120 minutes after the first (60%) and second (80%) doses.

2. Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was found to be superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs in a phase III trial. The primary efficacy variable was the restoration of catheter function to all treated lumens (i.e., total catheter patency) after one or two instillations.

3. Urokinase was found to be superior to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in thrombosed central venous catheters in a double-blinded, randomized trial. Urokinase restored catheter function more reliably and dissolved thrombi faster than t-PA.

4. Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was found to be superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs in a phase III trial. The primary efficacy variable was the restoration of catheter function to all treated lumens (i.e., total catheter patency) after one or two instillations.

1,"Study #12: Antibiotic prophylaxis in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG): a prospective randomized clinical trial.. The most frequent complication reported for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is peristomal wound infection which occurs in as many as 30 % of patients. In the studies published so far, the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of peristomal wound infection has remained controversial. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of peristomal wound infection associated with PEG.
                During a 2-year-period a total of 347 patients (251 men, 96 women; mean age 60.2+/-5) were included in our study. In all cases, a 9-French gauge Freka gastrostomy tube was inserted using the ""pull"" technique. The patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups (group 1, antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g cefotaxime; group 2, antibiotic prophylaxis with 4g piperacillin plus 0.5g tazobactam; group 3, no antibiotic prophylaxis). For a period of one week after gastrostomy, the peristomal area was evaluated using a wound score. According to the score, peristomal infections were classified as being of degree I-IV. Infections of up to degree III were regarded as minor, while an infection of degree IV was defined as a severe complication.
                PEG tubes were successfully placed in 336/347 patients (97 %). Of the 336 patients, 29 were excluded because of incomplete follow up (dropout rate 9%). Cases included were: in group 1, n = 101; in group 2, n = 100, and in group 3, n = 106. There was no mortality related to PEG insertion. There were five instances of severe complications (1.6%). Patients who received antibiotic prophylaxis had mean daily combined wound scores that"
2,"Study #1: Evaluation of the effectiveness of a low sodium diet in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension.. 28 patients who had a sustained diastolic blood pressure of 95 to 104 mm Hg and who had no treatment for it for at least 13 months before the trial, but who were otherwise unselected, took part in a randomised controlled trial in which the effect of a restricted sodium diet was compared with that of a general health package. The general health package did not include any specific hypotensive procedures. Changes in blood pressure were measured at predetermined intervals over the course of a year. Within each group both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell to a highly significant extent after a year, but there was no significant difference between the groups. It would thus seem that the antihypertensive effect of a restricted sodium diet may be related to the increased consultation and monitoring activity of such intervention rather than to the dietary manipulation itself..

Study #2: Effects of a low-salt diet and of acute salt loading on blood pressure and intralymphocytic sodium concentration in young subjects with borderline hypertension.. 1. Three groups of young patients with borderline hypertension were studied for a 12 months period. The first was on a free sodium diet while the second was on a low-salt diet. The third group of patients underwent acute salt loading. 2. After 12 months the group on free diet showed a significant increase of intralymphocytic sodium but no change in blood pressure was noted. Five patients who were re-checked after 24 months also had a significant increase in blood pressure. 3. Patients treated with a low-salt diet showed a significant decrease of both intralymphocytic sodium concentration and blood pressure. 4. After acute salt loading, borderline subjects with high intralymphocytic sodium showed a significant greater natriuresis whereas intralymphocytic sodium increased only in those subjects in whom it was initially normal..

                Randomized, prospective study.
                University hospital IVF unit.
                Sixty low responders who were recruited on the basis of results in previous cycles.
                Modified flare protocol in which a high dose of GnRH agonist was administered for the first 4 days, followed by a standard agonist dose, or a modified long protocol in which a standard agonist dose was used until pituitary down-regulation, after which the agonist dose was halved during stimulation.
                Number of oocytes retrieved.
                Twenty-nine cycles were performed with the modified flare protocol and 31 were performed with the modified long protocol. Significantly more oocytes were obtained with the modified long protocol than the modified flare protocol (4.42 +/- 2.6 vs. 3.07 +/- 2.15). The number and quality of embryos available for transfer was similar in both groups. One clinical pregnancy (3.4%) was achieved with the modified flare protocol, and 7 pregnancies (22.5%) were achieved using the modified long protocol.
                These preliminary results substantiate the poor prognosis and outcome for low responders undergoing IVF. A modified long ""mini-dose"" protocol appears to be superior to a modified mega-dose flare protocol in terms of oocyte yield and cycle outcome..

4,"Study #24: A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of topiramate in the treatment of aggression in female borderline personality disorder patients.. The goal of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of topiramate versus placebo in the treatment of aggression in women who meet the criteria for borderline personality disorder.
                We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of topiramate in 29 female subjects (response rate 93.5%) meeting SCID (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) criteria for borderline personality disorder. The subjects were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to topiramate (N = 21, analysis based on N = 19) or placebo (N = 10). Treatment lasted 8 weeks (November 2003-January 2004). Primary outcome measures were self-reported changes on the anger subscales of the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI).
                Significant improvements on 4 subscales of the STAXI (state-anger, trait-anger, anger-out, anger-control) were observed in the topiramate-treated subjects after 8 weeks, in comparison with the placebo group. The difference in improvement in score between the 2 groups for state-anger, trait-anger, and anger-out ranged from 21% to 24%, and the difference for anger-control was -13%. As an exception, a difference of only 8.5% (p < .2) was found on the anger-in subscale. Significantly greater weight loss was observed in the topiramate-treated group than in those treated with placebo (difference in weight loss between the 2 groups: 2.3 kg [5.1 lb] [3.2%]; 95% CI = 1.3% to 4.4%, p < .01). All patients tolerated topiramate well.
                Topiramate appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of anger in women with borderline personality disorder as defined by SCID criteria. Additionally, significant weight loss can be expected..

These antibiotics can be administered orally, which may reduce the period of hospitalization and economic costs. However, the efficacy of these antibiotics may vary depending on the specific organism causing the infection and the duration of treatment.

The study by Thakar et al.

11,"The provided abstracts suggest that dexamethasone and methylprednisolone (MP) administration prior to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in children can reduce the inflammatory response to CPB. Dexamethasone has been shown to decrease the postbypass inflammatory response as assessed by cytokine levels and clinical course. MP administration before the onset of CPB in children undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease has been found to reduce the postoperative IL and CRP levels, but the clinical picture was apparently affected in only 1 patient.

The studies also suggest that the effects of glucocorticoid on outcome are controversial. While some studies have found that glucocorticoid administration during CPB can reduce inflammatory mediator release, others have found no significant difference in clinical outcome between the placebo and dexamethasone-treated groups.

Overall, the studies suggest that dexamethasone and MP administration prior to CPB in children can reduce the inflammatory response to CPB, but the effects on clinical outcome are not clear. Further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and timing of glucocorticoid administration during CPB in children."

14,"The findings from the provided abstracts suggest that the use of twin-bag disconnect systems for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is associated with a lower rate of catheter-related infection than single-bag systems. This is likely due to the reduced risk of contamination during the exchange process. The twin-bag system also has a lower purchase cost than the single-bag system, which may contribute to its greater monetary purchase cost. However, the total cost of infection is lower with the twin-bag system than the single-bag system, which offsets the higher purchase cost.
The findings from the provided abstracts also suggest that the use of Y-set disconnect systems for CAPD is associated with a lower rate of peritonitis than conventional spike systems. This is likely due to the reduced risk of contamination during the exchange process. The Y-set system also has a lower cost per bag than the conventional spike system, which may contribute to its greater monetary purchase cost. However, the total cost of treatment (pesos/patient/year) is lower with the Y-set system than the conventional spike system, due to the lower peritonitis incidence and associated hospitalizations.
Overall, the findings from the provided abstracts suggest that the use of twin-bag and Y-set disconnect systems for CAPD is associated with a lower rate of peritonitis and a lower cost of treatment. These findings may be useful for healthcare providers and policymakers in making decisions about the use of these systems in CAPD patients.

Study #2: Quality of life and survival with continuous hepatic-artery floxuridine infusion for colorectal liver metastases.. Very few patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer can be cured. We have investigated whether a treatment to slow the growth of liver metastases, hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine, improves palliation in this setting. In a randomised study of 100 patients, we compared quality of life and survival in patients who received hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine and in those who received conventional symptom palliation. 95% of control patient survival time was spent with normal quality-of-life scores, which suggests that the aim of treatment should be to prolong normal quality survival rather than merely to sustain quality of life. There was a significant prolongation (p = 0.03) in overall survival in floxuridine-treated patients compared with controls (median 405 vs 226 days). There were similar significant prolongations in normal-quality (ie, normal symptom scores) survival for physical symptoms (p = 0.04), anxiety (p = 0.04), and depression (p = 0.04). This survival benefit was associated with significant reductions in metastasis size on computed tomography (p = 0.001) and in serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration (p = 0.006) in floxuridine-treated patients. There was no evidence of treatment-related hepatotoxicity as assessed by serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin measurements. This is the first demonstration that survival can be prolonged with normal quality of life in patients with colorectal liver metastases. We conclude that hepatic-artery floxuridine infusion can be recommended for suitable patients..

The mechanism of action is not fully understood, but it is thought to involve the activation of A-delta fibers, which are responsible for the transmission of pain signals. The studies also suggest that the effect of sterile water injections is comparable to that of other pain relief methods, such as epidural anesthesia, and that it is safe and well-tolerated by patients. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and frequency of injections."

Until recently, Dutch general practitioners contributed little to tobacco control. This is due to several factors, among which is the lack of a feasible intervention program for adult smokers. Such a minimal contact behavioral intervention, using the Stage-of-Change concept, is now available. Effectiveness was tested in a randomized trial.
                Twenty-two general practitioners and their practice assistants were trained in applying the program. In all, 530 smoking patients were enrolled, randomly assigned to either the intervention or the usual treatment condition. Analysis of treatment effects was performed with logistic regression analysis. In a backward stepwise procedure confounding effects of baseline differences were eliminated.
                At 12-month follow-up, self-reported abstinence rates (including nonrespondents as smokers) differed significantly between intervention subjects and controls: 13.4 vs 7.3% point prevalence (odds ratio 1.51, P < 0.05). An analysis of consecutive abstinence, defined as being abstinent at both 6- and 12-month follow-up, showed that 8.2% of the intervention group compared to 3.1% of the controls had sustained abstinence for more than 6 months (odds ratio 3.04, P < 0.001).

5. Treatment with desipramine was well tolerated and was associated with robust clinically significant reductions in tic and ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with chronic tic disorders and ADHD diagnoses.
6. Deprenyl may improve both ADHD and tics in children with TS and warrants further study.

These findings suggest that atomoxetine, methylphenidate, and desipramine may be effective treatments for ADHD in children with comorbid tics, while deprenyl may also be effective in improving both ADHD and tics in children with TS. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of these treatments."

1. Study #1: Fetal lung maturation: the combined use of corticosteroids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone resulted in enhanced fetal pulmonic maturation superior to that achieved with corticosteroids alone.
2. Study #2: Combined hormonal therapy for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome and its consequences showed a greater post-therapy increase in L/S ratio, fewer respirator days, and a lower incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in the group receiving antenatal corticosteroids plus thyrotropin-releasing hormone compared to the control group.
3. Study #3: A randomized, controlled trial of antepartum thyrotropin-releasing hormone and betamethasone in the prevention of respiratory disease in preterm infants showed that the addition of thyrotropin-releasing hormone to antepartum glucocorticoid treatment reduced the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome and improved survival in preterm infants.
4. Study #4: Collaborative trial of prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and corticosteroids for prevention of respiratory distress syndrome showed that the combination of antenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and corticosteroids did not reduce the frequency of respiratory distress syndrome or improve the outcome of preterm neonates compared with the use of corticosteroids alone.
5. Study #5: Two trials of antenatal thyrotrophin-releasing hormone for fetal maturation: stopping before the due date showed that the addition of antenatal thyrotrophin-releasing hormone to corticosteroids, given to women at risk of preterm delivery, did not decrease the risk of death and severe morbidity associated with prematurity.
6. Study #6: Respiratory disease in very-low-birthweight infants after prenatal thyrotropin-releasing hormone and glucocorticoid showed that prenatal TRH treatment (4 doses of 400 micrograms 8-hourly) did not affect the total incidence of respiratory distress syndrome or of severe respiratory"
30,"The key findings from the provided study abstracts are as follows:

1. Diflunisal is an effective analgesic for the treatment of post-operative pain. It has a long duration of action and is comparable to or superior to other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and zomepirac sodium.

2. Diflunisal is also effective in the treatment of pain following meniscectomy. It is comparable to or superior to other NSAIDs such as suprofen and oxyphenbutazone.

3. Diflunisal is generally well-tolerated, with mild and transitory adverse effects reported in less than 10% of patients.

4. Carprofen is another effective analgesic for the treatment of post-operative pain. It has a similar duration of action to diflunisal and is comparable to or superior to other NSAIDs such as suprofen and oxyphenbutazone.

5. The use of diflunisal in post-operative pain is supported by a series of double-blind randomized trials, which demonstrate its overall effectiveness in relieving moderate to severe pain.

6. The results of these studies suggest that diflunisal is a safe and effective alternative to other NSAIDs for the treatment of post-operative pain.

7. The findings from these studies can inform clinical practice and help healthcare professionals make evidence-based decisions when prescribing analgesics for post-operative pain.

8. Further research is needed to explore the potential benefits and risks of diflunisal and other NSAIDs in the treatment of post-operative pain.

Overall, the findings from these studies suggest that diflunisal is a safe and effective analgesic for the treatment of post-operative pain. It is comparable to or superior to other NSAIDs such as aspirin, acetaminophen, zomepirac sodium, suprofen, and oxyphenbutazone.

32,"Study #27: The effect of adding salmeterol to inhaled corticosteroid therapy on airway inflammation in asthma. Salmeterol Study Group.. The addition of long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists to a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), results in better clinical asthma control than increasing the dose of ICS. However, this approach may mask underlying airway inflammation. In a double-blind parallel-group study, we evaluated the effect of adding formoterol to a low dose of budesonide, compared with a higher dose of budesonide, on the composition of induced sputum. After a 4-wk run-in period of treatment with budesonide (800 microg, twice daily), 60 patients with moderate asthma were randomly assigned to a 1-yr treatment with 400 microg of budesonide plus placebo, twice daily (BUD800), or 100 microg of budesonide plus 12 microg of formoterol, twice daily (BUD200+F). All drugs were administered via Turbuhaler. Budesonide (800 microg, twice daily) during run-in significantly reduced median sputum eosinophils from 4.5 to 0.68%. No significant changes in the proportion of eosinophils, EG2(+) cells, other inflammatory cells, or ECP levels in sputum were observed over the ensuing 1-yr treatment with BUD200+F or BUD800. Clinical asthma control was not significantly different between both groups. In conclusion, no significant differences in sputum markers of airway inflammation were observed during a 1-yr treatment with a low dose of inhaled budesonide plus formoterol compared with a higher dose of budesonide..

33,"The findings from the provided abstracts suggest that low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWHs) are effective and safe for the treatment of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) in the outpatient setting. The studies indicate that LMWHs can be administered primarily at home, with or without hospitalization, and that they are associated with a reduced risk of major bleeding and a shorter hospital stay compared to standard (unfractionated) heparin administered in the hospital.
Study #1 compared LMWH (enoxaparin) with standard heparin in the treatment of proximal DVT. The study found that the incidence of recurrent thromboembolism was similar between the two groups, but the patients who received LMWH spent a mean of 1.1 days in the hospital, compared with 6.5 days for the standard-heparin group.
Study #2 compared LMWH (tinzaparin) with unfractionated heparin (UFH) followed by acenocoumarol in the treatment of proximal DVT. The study found that the overall incidence of major events (mortality, DVT recurrence, pulmonary embolism, major bleeding, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia) was significantly different in favor of LMWH (7 versus 17 events). The study also found that LMWH produced significantly more extended overall recanalization from 3 months onwards.
Study #3 compared LMWH (tinzaparin) with UFH in the treatment of proximal DVT in the outpatient and inpatient settings. The study found that the incidence of venous thromboembolism recurrence, pulmonary embolism, or major bleeding was similar between the two groups, but a cost reduction of 56% was demonstrated for outpatient management.
Study #4 compared a once-daily regimen of enoxaparin with a continuous intravenous infusion of UFH in the treatment of patients with proximal lower limb DVT. The study found that the duration of hospital stay was significantly shorter with enoxaparin than with UFH, and that 36% of patients receiving enoxaparin did not need to be hospitalized, compared to all of the patients"

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Pilonidal sinus is a common disease in young adults that carries high postoperative morbidity and patient discomfort. Controversy still exists about the best surgical technique for the treatment of the disease in terms of recurrence rate and patient discomfort.METHODS: From January 2000 to November 2003, 100 consecutive age‐ and sex‐matched patients with chronic pilonidal sinus disease were randomized to receive surgical treatment in the forms of either excision and primary closure or rhomboid excision and Limberg flap. Time to return to work and to complete healing were recorded. To evaluate quality of life and patient comfort, all patients were asked to complete a questionnaire including short form 36, Visual Analogue Scale, time to sitting on toilet without pain, and time to walking without pain 3 months after surgery.RESULTS: Each group was composed of 50 patients. Mean follow‐up was 19 months. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of length of hospital stay (P = .005), time to complete healing (P < .001), time off work (P < .001), and wound infection rate (P = .03). Statistically significant differences were noted between the groups in items of general health perception (71.1 +/‐ 11.7 vs 78.2 +/‐ 14.1; P = .008), social functioning (87.3 +/‐ 32.8 vs 110.4 +/‐ 33.8; P = .001), and pain (54.5 +/‐ 14.0 vs 67.5 +/‐ 18.4; P < .001). Times to sitting on toilet and walking without pain showed significant differences between the groups (P = .006 and P < .001, respectively). The mean postoperative Visual Analogue Scale scores were 6.5 +/‐ 1.7 and 7.4 +/‐ 1.4, respectively (P < .00"

These techniques may be particularly effective in the acute phase after stroke, when patients are most likely to experience sensory and motor impairments.

The study by Kwakkel et al. (Study #1) found that a specific therapeutic intervention for the hemiplegic upper limb in the acute phase after stroke improved motor recovery, which was apparent 1 year later. The study by Kwakkel et al.

The study found no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups on the three outcome measures.

The study by Kwakkel et al.

The study by Kwakkel et al. (Study #4) evaluated the efficacy of intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) in treating sensory impairments in the hemiplegic upper limb in stroke patients. The study found that both groups improved in somatosensation over time, but the experimental group improved more than the control group.

The study by Kwakkel et al. (Study #5) found that improvement in upper extremity (UE) function and independence could be achieved in patients 6 months to 7 years poststroke following an outpatient rehabilitation program (supervised 1.5 hours per week for 8 weeks reinforced with home gloving unaffected side and attended, graded, repetitive sensory and motor training activities). The study found that greater than 20% (P < 0.01) improvement was measured in functional independence and UE function (fine motor, sensory discrimination, and musculoskeletal performance).

-----------------
The syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) is a severe complication of pregnancy. It is characterized by hemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The syndrome is associated with significant maternal morbidity and mortality. The majority of morbidity and mortality associated with HELLP syndrome is a postpartum phenomenon. The syndrome is usually diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy, but it can also occur in the first and second trimesters. The pathophysiology of HELLP syndrome is not completely understood. It is thought to be related to an abnormal placental implantation, which leads to the release of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. These mediators cause endothelial damage, which leads to hemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The diagnosis of HELLP syndrome is based on the presence of hemolysis, hepatic dysfunction, and thrombocytopenia. The syndrome is usually diagnosed in the third trimester of pregnancy, but it can also occur in the first and second trimesters.

1. Vitamin A and beta carotene supplementation can reduce the size of oral leukoplakia lesions.
2. 13-cis-retinoic acid can reduce the size of oral leukoplakia lesions.
3. Ketorolac oral rinse can reduce the size of oral leukoplakia lesions.
4. Topical bleomycin can reduce the size of oral leukoplakia lesions.
5. Acitretin can reduce the size of oral leukoplakia lesions.
6. Lycopene can reduce the size of oral leukoplakia lesions.
7. Tea can reduce the size of oral leukoplakia lesions.
8. 13-cis-retinoic acid can increase the number of apoptotic bodies in oral leukoplakia lesions.

These findings suggest that various supplements and treatments can be effective in reducing the size of oral leukoplakia lesions. However, more research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment for each supplement or treatment. Additionally, further research is needed to determine the long-term effects of these supplements and treatments on the prevention of oral cancer.

47,"Study #14: Effect of a primary care based epilepsy specialist nurse service on quality of care from the patients' perspective: results at one-year follow-up.. Epilepsy specialist nurses have the potential to improve the quality of care of community-based patients with epilepsy, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited by the lack of formal or long-term evaluation. Results of a controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness of a primary care based specialist nurse-led service suggested improvements in communication and satisfaction but not health status at one-year follow-up. A second follow-up was conducted to assess the effects after two years. Patients who reported having seen the nurse at least once in the two years ('users') were compared with those who had not ('non-users'). Comparisons between users and non-users were adjusted for baseline differences. Results were based on 40% of all 595 adult patients known to have epilepsy in 14 general practices and who answered questionnaires at baseline and two years later. The new epilepsy service was used more by those with greatest needs for care. Users of the new service were significantly more likely than non-users to have discussed 8 of 11 topics asked about epilepsy [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 2.42 to 7.91] with their general practitioner (GP), and 2 of the 11 topics with the hospital doctor (ORs 5.59, 5. 74). Service users were significantly less likely than non-users to feel their GP knew enough about epilepsy [OR 0.27, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.74-0.98], and significantly more likely to report epilepsy as having an adverse impact on 3 of 10 areas of everyday life (ORs ranging from 2.09 to 2.50). Users were more likely than non-users to have seen their GP for any reason in the previous year and to change their medication from use of more than one antiepileptic drug to monotherapy, although findings were not significant. Results suggest that the epilepsy specialist nurse service is not a cost-reducing substitute, particularly for general practitioner care, but it appears to improve communication and prescribing of monotherapy, and increases access for the most needy.

However, the role of early endoscopic intervention remains controversial, and previous randomized trials have not focused on the subgroup of patients with clinical evidence of biliopancreatic obstruction.
The studies also suggest that early ERCP and sphincterotomy were not beneficial in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis but without obstructive jaundice.
The studies further suggest that early EI without fluoroscopy on patients with severe acute biliary pancreatitis in the intensive care unit is beneficial for the patients.
The studies also suggest that duodenoscopy is feasible, effective and safe to apply in the treatment of severe acute gallstone pancreatitis.

The studies indicate that eye patching does not significantly affect the rate of healing, discomfort, or interference with activities of daily living. However, some studies suggest that eye patching may be beneficial in reducing pain and discomfort in the short term.

Based on the available evidence, it is recommended that eye patching should not be routinely used for the treatment of corneal abrasions. However, if the patient experiences significant pain or discomfort, eye patching may be considered as a temporary measure to provide relief.

It is important to note that the studies included in this summary are limited in scope and may not be representative of all patients with corneal abrasions. Further research is needed to determine the optimal treatment for corneal abrasions and to identify factors that may influence the effectiveness of eye patching.

In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that eye patching may not be necessary for the treatment of corneal abrasions.

53,"Study #1: Transcutaneous oxygen pressure as predictive parameter for ulcer healing in endstage vascular patients treated with spinal cord stimulation.. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that initial TcPO2 helps predict clinical outcome in vascular patients treated with spinal cord stimulation. A randomized-controlled study with one year follow-up was made in 86 Fontaine stage IV patients with endstage peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) undergoing 21 day intravenous prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) therapy for nonhealing ulcers.
                All patients had arteriosclerosis, 13 also diabetes mellitus. Entry criteria included: non-reconstructible PAOD as proven by intra-arterial angiography or patient condition, ankle systolic pressure < 50 mmHg, severe rest pain despite analgetic medication, and presence of nonhealing foot ulcers or dry gangrene. One week after the start of PGE1 therapy, patients were randomized into receiving SCS plus PGE1 (n = 45 patients), or just PGE1 (n = 41 patients). Follow-up examinations were done at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. BASELINE: There were no significant differences between both groups in the following: age, sex distribution, ischemic skin lesions, risk factors and several key group mean physiological values including ankle systolic pressure, ankle/brachial ratio (ABI) and foot TcPO2. The SCS group had more prior vascular leg surgeries (1.77 vs 1.58 per patient). RESULTS AT 12 MONTHS: There was significantly better total healing of foot ulcers in the SCS-group (69 vs 17%; p < 0.0001). Significantly more SCS-patients achieved an outcome of Fontaine stage II (claudication pain, no rest pain or lesions) (40 vs 10%, p = 0.0014).

Study #26: Effect of oxygen on exercise performance in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and only mild hypoxemia.. Oxygen (O2) has been reported to improve exercise tolerance in some patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) despite only mild resting hypoxemia (PaO2 greater than 60 mm Hg). To confirm these prior studies and evaluate potential mechanisms of benefit, we measured dyspnea scores by numeric rating scale during cycle ergometry endurance testing and correlated the severity of dyspnea with right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP) measured by Doppler echocardiography during a separate supine incremental exercise test. Both sets of exercise were performed according to a randomized double-blind crossover protocol in which patients breathed compressed air or 40% O2. We studied 12 patients with severe COPD (FEV1 0.89 +/- 0.09 L [mean +/- SEM], FEV1/FVC 37 +/- 2%, DLCO 9.8 +/- 1.5 ml/min/mm Hg[47% of predicted], PaO2 71 +/- 2.6 mm Hg). With endurance testing on compressed air, PaO2 did not change significantly in the group as whole (postexercise PaO2 63 +/- 5.1 mm Hg, p = NS), but did fall to less than 55 mm Hg in four patients from this group.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of a 12-week yoga program on dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
                A randomized controlled trial was performed. Patients with COPD were randomly assigned to a yoga group or a control group. The yoga group participated in a 12-week yoga program, and the control group received usual care. Dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life were evaluated.
                Forty patients with COPD (mean±SD age 69.9±9.5 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 second 47.7±15.6% predicted) were randomized to a yoga group (n=20) or a control group (n=20). The yoga group participated in a 12-week yoga program, and the control group received usual care. Dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life were evaluated.
                Yoga training was safe and feasible for patients with COPD. While yoga training had only small effects on dyspnea after the 6-minute walk test (effect size 0.20; p=0.60), there were greater reductions in dyspnea-related distress in the yoga group compared to the control group (effect size 0.67; p=0.08).

A total of 154 teeth (94 primary second molars and 60 young permanent first molars) were included in the study from a total of 123 4- to 15-year-old patients. The teeth had deep carious lesions but lacked the preoperative signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis. The teeth were randomly selected and treated either with 1-visit IPT, 2-visit IPT, or direct complete excavation (DCE). Follow-up examinations were conducted on the teeth over 1 year at 3-month intervals.

The pulp was exposed in 12 teeth (22%) treated by DCE, whereas 3 teeth (6%) were treated by 1-visit IPT and 4 teeth (8%) with 2-visit IPT. A statistically significant difference was found between IPT and DCE groups in terms of pulp exposure (P<.05). The teeth without pulp exposure showed normal clinical and radiographic conditions during the 1-year follow-up, except for 3 primary teeth.

Indirect pulp therapy in both primary and young permanent teeth can be used successfully with a 1- or 2-visit approach..

- Midazolam premedication did not significantly reduce either VAS or STAI score, although heart rate and systolic arterial pressure immediately before induction of anaesthesia were significantly lower in patients who received midazolam (p = 0.006 and 0.039, respectively).

- Induction of anaesthesia was achieved with a lower dose of propofol (p = 0.0009) and excellent (Grade I) conditions for insertion of a laryngeal mask airway were achieved more often after midazolam premedication (p = 0.038).

- Arterial desaturation during induction of anaesthesia and insertion of a laryngeal mask airway occurred more often in patients who received placebo (p = 0.022).

- There was a good correlation between VAS and STAI used to assess the anxiolytic effects of premedication. (Spearman coefficient 0.58, p < 0.0001)

2. Preoperative alprazolam reduces anxiety in ambulatory surgery patients: a comparison with oral midazolam:

- Alprazolam and midazolam both decreased anxiety scores more than placebo (P < 0.05).

- One hour after premedication, the Digit- Symbol Substitution Test score was similar in all groups, whereas the TDT score was greater (indicating impairment of performance) in the alprazolam group than in the placebo group (P < 0.05).

- Sedation scores, extubation time, and discharge times in the active drug groups did not differ from placebo.

- At discharge from the postanesthesia care unit, the TDT score was greater in both active drug groups compared with placebo (P < 0.05).

62,"The provided abstracts suggest that dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in treating hypotension in preterm infants. The studies show that dopamine is more effective in increasing mean arterial blood pressure and achieving a systolic blood pressure > 40 mmHg. Additionally, dopamine is more effective in increasing blood flow velocity in the superior mesenteric artery, indicating improved intestinal perfusion.

The studies also suggest that both catecholamines are equally effective in raising mean blood pressure and lead to a significant increase of intestinal perfusion. However, dopamine is more effective in raising and maintaining mean arterial blood pressure above 30 mmHg.

Overall, the studies suggest that dopamine is the drug of choice to treat hypotension in preterm newborn infants. However, since the differences in responses were small, it is proposed that dobutamine is also as efficacious and useful as dopamine.

The summary highlights the key findings from the provided abstracts, including the efficacy of dopamine and dobutamine in treating hypotension in preterm infants, the effectiveness of both catecholamines in raising mean blood pressure, and the importance of maintaining mean arterial blood pressure above 30 mmHg.

Study Overview
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of topical cyclosporine A in the treatment of blepharitis.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Blepharitis is a common ocular surface disease that is characterized by inflammation of the eyelids. The most common form of blepharitis is anterior blepharitis, which is caused by a bacterial infection of the eyelid margins. The most common bacterial species associated with blepharitis is Staphylococcus aureus. The most common treatment for blepharitis is topical antibiotics. However, the use of topical antibiotics can lead to the development of antibiotic resistance. Cyclosporine A is a potent immunosuppressive agent that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of a variety of ocular surface diseases. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of topical cyclosporine A in the treatment of blepharitis.

68,"The key findings from the provided abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question are:
1. Pain perception following first orthodontic archwire placement:
- Thermoelastic archwires produce lighter and more biologic forces than superelastic archwires and could therefore offer the possibility of reducing initial orthodontic pain.
- Patients with HANT archwires had significantly lower VAS scores (P < .005) at days 2, 3, and 4 than subjects with SE archwires.
- Initial orthodontic pain is reduced when using HANT orthodontic archwires.
2. Multiflex versus superelastic:
- Two arch wires commonly used for initial tooth alignment were compared with regard to their clinical effectiveness.
- The degree of initial alignment achieved with the two wires was similar over this 6-week period.
- Some differences were found for the lower labial segment where the superelastic nickel-titanium wire was found to give improved alignment.
3. Pain and discomfort experienced after placement of a conventional or a superelastic NiTi aligning archwire:
- Two nickel-titanium arch wires commonly used for initial tooth alignment were compared with regard to the pain/discomfort patients experience during the initial phase of tooth movement.
- The pain/discomfort experienced after placement of a Sentalloy or a Nitinol as first arch wires was similar but much greater than that found in the postextraction control phase.
- The pain score peaked on the morning after the placement of the arch wire, lasting typically for 5 to 6 days.
4. The pain and discomfort experienced during orthodontic treatment:
- A randomized controlled clinical trial was performed to compare the nature, prevalence, intensity, and duration of pain related to the use of a relatively recently developed superelastic arch wire and a more traditional multistranded steel arch wire.
- The pain response was found to be highly and consistently subjective, not related to the dental arch, crowding, sex, or social class; however, a statistically significant association was found between the age and the pain experienced.
5. Efficiency of multi-strand steel, superelastic Ni-Ti and ion-implanted Ni-Ti archwires for initial alignment:

Effects of case management on quality of life were tested with 57 home care patients with AIDS, randomly assigning individuals to either usual care or case-managed care over the duration of home services (ranging from 5 days to over 2 years). Participants were primarily male (93%), white (79%), and never married (82%). Quality of life was measured monthly using the quality of Well-Being Index (QWB). Case-managed patients showed advantages over the usual care group in descriptive analyses of quality of life and survival. Large standard deviations in the QWB scores resulting from high fatality among subjects impeded statistical analyses of effects..

Study #2: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy in HIV-infected pediatric patients improves with home-based intensive nursing intervention.. Adherence to combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been shown to be a determining factor in controlling viral replication, maintaining immunologic function and long-term survival in HIV-positive individuals. Little information is available on strategies to improve adherence in pediatric HIV-infected patients. We conducted a randomized, nonblinded, pilot study to determine if a home-based nursing intervention would improve medication adherence. The study was offered to all eligible HIV-positive patients receiving care at Connecticut Children's Medical Center's (CCMC) Pediatric and Youth HIV Program. Sixty-seven percent (37/55) of the patients and their caretakers participated. We randomized participants to either standard of care or the intervention trial. The intervention was designed to improve knowledge and understanding of HIV infection and HIV medications and to resolve or modify barriers to adherence. Both groups completed pre- and post-intervention questionnaires, assessing their knowledge and understanding of HIV, ART, and adherence. Adherence was estimated objectively from medication refill history and subjectively from a self-report score. We also inferred adherence from pre- to post-test plasma viral load and CD4+ T-cell percentages. The knowledge score (p = 0.02) and medication refill history (p = 0.002"

There were no differences between the two groups in mean systolic or diastolic pressures, mean gestational age, or initial laboratory findings at time of entry. Patients in the labetalol group demonstrated a statistically significant (P less than .005) decrease in blood pressure during treatment. No such decrease occurred in the hospitalization-alone group. Both groups exhibited significant deterioration in proteinuria, creatinine, and uric acid. The average days of pregnancy prolongation (mean +/- SD) were 21.3 +/- 13 and 20.1 +/- 14 days in the hospitalization and labetalol groups, respectively. There were no differences between the groups regarding any of the following: gestational age at delivery, birth weight, number of infants admitted to the special care unit, or cord blood gas measurements. However, the incidence of small-for-gestational-age infants was significantly higher in the labetalol group (19 versus 9%, P less than .05). There were no stillbirths, but one neonatal death in the labetalol group.

71,"Fish oil supplementation reduced serum triglyceride levels and platelet aggregation, but increased serum TXB2 levels and LDL-C levels in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Olive oil supplementation reduced serum total cholesterol levels and platelet aggregation, but increased serum TXB2 levels and LDL-C levels.
Introduction
Peripheral vascular disease (PVD) is a common disorder, affecting 10% of the population over the age of 65 years. The prevalence of PVD is increasing due to the ageing of the population and the increasing incidence of risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, and hypercholesterolaemia. The pathogenesis of PVD is multifactorial, and includes atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and inflammation.
The role of dietary fatty acids in the pathogenesis of PVD is unclear. The consumption of fish oil has been shown to reduce serum triglyceride levels and platelet aggregation in healthy subjects. However, the effects of fish oil on lipids and cell function in patients with PVD have not been investigated.
The aim of this study was to examine and compare the effects of supplementing the existing diet with fish oil or olive oil on lipids and cell function in patients with PVD.
Patients
Thirty-two patients with symptomatic and angiographically demonstrated PVD were screened, matched, and randomly allocated to take either 15 g/d fish oil or olive oil for 4 weeks. The patients were recruited from the vascular outpatient clinic at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. The patients were matched for age, sex, smoking status, and lipid levels. The study was approved by the local ethics committee, and all patients gave written informed consent.
The patients were instructed to continue their usual diet and medication throughout the study. They were asked to avoid taking any other supplements during the study period.
Fish oil and olive oil
The fish oil capsules (1 g/capsule) contained 300 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5) and 200 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6). The olive oil capsules (1 g/capsule)"

73,"Study #10: [Comparison of the influence of general and regional anesthesia on basic haemodynamic parameters during carotid endarterectomy].. Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a preventive operation to reduce the incidence of embolic and thrombotic cerebral stroke. CEA carries a significant periooperative mortality rate from stroke and myocardial infarction, which may even approach 5%. Thus, anesthetic and surgical techniques are constantly under scrutiny to try to reduce this relatively high incidence of morbidity and mortality. Anesthetic technique for CEA is divided to general (GA) and regional (RA) anesthesia, performed by cervical plexus block. The aim this study was to examine changes of basic haemodynamic parameters, which routinely fallows during CEA in condition of GA and RA. After obtaining institutional approval and informed consent, we randomized 50 patients scheduled for CEA (Tab. 1) in two groups (GA and RA). We fallow blood pressure: systolic (BPs), mean (BPm), diastolic (BPd), heart rate (HR), and RPP index at the examined patients. The examination performed in six control times: before induction of anesthesia (T1), 10 minutes after beginning of operation (T2), 5 minutes after cross clamping of arteria carotis (T3), 5 minutes after declamping arteria carotis (T4), 10 minutes (T5) and 2 hours after operation (T6). The results of study shows significant changes of blood pressure (BPs and BPm) and RPP index in T2 time in patinets undergoing GA. The changes occurred under influence of induction agent thiopental. These changes were in homeostatic range. In RA patinets, no haemodynamic changes registrated in control times. Therefore, from haemodynamic aspect RA was superior to GA..

The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of spinal manipulation on cervical range of motion and pain in patients with chronic neck pain.
                Randomized clinical trial.
                Patients with chronic neck pain were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: a control group, which received electro-thermal therapy for 5 treatment sessions, and the experimental group, which received the same electro/thermal therapy program in addition to a thoracic spine thrust manipulation once a week for 3 consecutive weeks. Mixed-model analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were used to examine the effects of treatment on pain (100-mm visual analogue scale), disability (100-point disability scale), and cervical range of motion, with group as the between-subjects variable and time as the within-subjects variable. The primary analysis was the group-by-time interaction effects for pain.
                The group-by-time interaction effects for the ANOVA models were statistically significant for pain, mobility, and disability (P< .05), indicating greater improvements in the manipulation group for all the outcome measures. Patients receiving thoracic manipulation experienced greater improvements in pain at the fifth (final) treatment session and at the 2-week and 4-week follow-up periods (P< .001), with pain improvement scores in the manipulation group of 16.8 mm and 26.6 mm greater than those in the comparison group at the 2- and 4-week follow-up periods, respectively.

The use of metformin is of benefit to women with PCOS. The study also found that the stimulation characteristics and in vitro fertilization (IVF)-embryo transfer (ET) outcomes of the standard short GnRH antagonist protocol for ovarian stimulation with or without metformin were comparable.

Prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors, such as naproxen and ibuprofen, have been shown to reduce menstrual blood loss and pain in women using IUDs. However, the effect of these drugs on early IUD removal is not clear.

In the study by Gomez et al., the authors found that prophylactic use of ibuprofen did not reduce the rate of IUD removal due to dysmenorrhea and increased menstrual bleeding. The authors suggest that the dosage of ibuprofen used in their study may not have been sufficient to reduce these symptoms.

In the study by Khalil et al., the authors found that the use of desmopressin, a synthetic analogue of the natural hormone vasopressin, was effective in reducing menstrual blood loss in women with IUD-induced menorrhagia. The authors suggest that the mechanism of action of desmopressin may be related to its ability to enhance local haemostasis.

In the study by Khalil et al., the authors found that the use of tranexamic acid, a fibrinolysis inhibitor, was effective in reducing menstrual blood loss in women with IUD-induced menorrhagia.

This Phase III trial randomly assigned 304 patients with CKD in a 3:1 ratio to two 510-mg doses of intravenous ferumoxytol within 5 +/- 3 d or 200 mg of elemental oral iron daily for 21 d. The increase in hemoglobin at day 35, the primary efficacy end point, was 0.82 +/- 1.24 g/dl with ferumoxytol and 0.16 +/- 1.02 g/dl with oral iron (P < 0.0001). Among patients who were not receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, hemoglobin increased 0.62 +/- 1.02 g/dl with ferumoxytol and 0.13 +/- 0.93 g/dl with oral iron. Among patients who were receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, hemoglobin increased 1.16 +/- 1.49 g/dl with ferumoxytol and 0.19 +/- 1.14 g/dl with oral iron. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 10.6% of patients who were treated with ferumoxytol and 24.0% of those who were treated with oral iron; none was serious. In summary, a regimen of two doses of 510 mg of intravenous ferumoxytol administered rapidly within 5 +/- 3 d was well tolerated and had the intended therapeutic effect.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether self‐monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not using insulin.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 100 patients with T2DM not using insulin were randomly assigned to receive either SMBG added to usual care, or to continue with usual care for one year. A fasting glucose value and three postprandial glucose values were measured twice weekly (including a Saturday or a Sunday). The primary efficacy parameter was HbA1c. Furthermore, health‐related quality of life and treatment satisfaction were assessed using the Short‐form 36 Health Survey Questionnaire (SF‐36), the Type 2 Diabetes Symptom Checklist (DSC‐r), the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire (DTSQ) and the WHO‐Wellbeing Index (WHO‐5).RESULTS: Change in HbA1c between groups was ‐0.05% (95% CI: ‐0.51, 0.41; p=0.507). Also, there were no significant changes between groups on the DTSQ , DSC type 2, WHO‐5 or SF‐36, except for the SF‐36 dimension 'health change' which was lower in the SBMG group (mean difference: ‐12 (95% CI: ‐20.9, ‐3.1).CONCLUSIONS: We therefore argue that the use of SMBG in this patient group is questionable, and its unlimited use and promotion should be reconsidered."
89,"The key findings from the provided study abstracts are as follows:

Study #1: Comparison of ipratropium solution, fenoterol solution, and their combination administered by nebulizer and face mask to children with acute asthma.

- The study found that the combination of ipratropium and fenoterol was more effective than either drug alone in improving lung function and clinical scores in children with acute asthma.

- The greatest improvement in lung function was seen in the patients treated with the combination of ipratropium and fenoterol, whether considered as absolute change, change in percent predicted, or percent change from baseline.

- Ipratropium/fenoterol was significantly better than fenoterol alone only when considered as percent change from baseline.

- Improvement in flow at mid and low lung volumes was significantly greater for the ipratropium/fenoterol combination than for ipratropium alone; no significant differences were noted between ipratropium/fenoterol and fenoterol for flow at mid and low lung volumes.

- Treatment with albuterol did not significantly improve pulmonary function in the groups receiving ipratropium/fenoterol or fenoterol alone, but it did increase flow at all lung volumes in the group receiving ipratropium alone.

Study #2: Comparison of inhaled metaproterenol, inhaled atropine sulfate, and their combination in treatment of children with acute asthma.

- The separate and combined effects of inhaled metaproterenol and atropine sulfate were evaluated in the treatment of 44 episodes of acute asthma occurring in 35 children ranging in age from 13 months to 13 years.

- Significant improvement in peak flow rate (P less than .04) was noted after the second inhalation of metaproterenol both with and without the combination of atropine sulfate compared with the effects of atropine alone.

- Patients treated with metaproterenol and metaproterenol combined with atropine also experienced fewer therapeutic failures (2/15 and 2/16, respectively) compared with those treated with atropine (6/13, P"

92,"The key findings from the provided study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial research question are summarized as follows:

1. Single dose gentamicin treatment of urinary infections in children was found to be effective in treating the infection, with a cure rate of 69%. However, it was associated with a higher risk of suppression upon rectal and periurethral flora, compared to conventional therapy.

2. Cefadroxil and ampicillin were found to be equally effective in treating acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children, with cure rates of 63% and 92%, respectively. However, amoxicillin therapy failed to separate upper from lower tract disease reliably and had a limited role in predicting response to conventional antimicrobial therapy.

3. Single-dose amoxicillin therapy of uncomplicated pediatric urinary tract infections was found to have a cure rate of 63%, which was lower than the cure rate of 92% in patients given conventional therapy. The failure of single-dose therapy predicted underlying radiologic abnormalities with a sensitivity of 60% and a specificity of 58%, making it a poor screening test for detecting those patients at risk for renal parenchymal damage.

4. Single-dose versus conventional therapy of urinary tract infections in female adolescents was found to have similar cure rates, with a cure rate of 69% in the single-dose group and 87% in the conventional treatment group. However, single-dose therapy was associated with increased compliance with medication and follow-up, decreased side effects, and more rapid resolution of symptoms.

5. Three-day therapy with cephalexin for lower urinary tract infections in children was found to be effective in treating the infection, with a cure rate of 90%. However, it was associated with a higher risk of reinfection, with two relapses noted in the cephalexin group and one in the nitrofurantoin group.

6. Single-dose amoxicillin treatment of urinary tract infections was found to be effective in treating the infection, with a cure rate of 26%. However, it was associated with a higher risk of reinfection, with four patients"

94,"The provided abstracts suggest that EMLA cream is an effective and safe topical anaesthetic for the debridement of leg ulcers. It has been shown to reduce pain during debridement and to shorten the time to a clean ulcer. EMLA cream has also been shown to be effective in reducing pain during the cleansing of venous leg ulcers.

The use of EMLA cream for the debridement of leg ulcers is supported by the findings of the studies. The studies suggest that EMLA cream can be used to achieve pain control during debridement and to shorten the time to a clean ulcer. The studies also suggest that EMLA cream is safe and well-tolerated.

The findings of the studies suggest that EMLA cream is a promising treatment option for the debridement of leg ulcers. It may be particularly useful for patients who experience pain during debridement or who have difficulty tolerating the procedure.

However, it is important to note that the studies were conducted in a limited number of patients and that further research is needed to confirm the findings. Additionally, the use of EMLA cream for the debridement of leg ulcers may not be appropriate for all patients, and the decision to use it should be made on a case-by-case basis.

Overall, the findings of the studies suggest that EMLA cream is a promising treatment option for the debridement of leg ulcers. It may be particularly useful for patients who experience pain during debridement or who have difficulty tolerating the procedure. However, further research is needed to confirm the findings and to determine the optimal use of EMLA cream for this purpose."

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: The Internet is a promising tool for weight loss. However, few studies have examined the effects of Web‐based weight loss programs on weight loss and health‐related quality of life (HRQOL).OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine the effects of a Web‐based weight loss program on weight loss and HRQOL in overweight and obese adults.METHODS: A total of 100 overweight and obese adults were randomly assigned to either a Web‐based weight loss program (n = 50) or a control group (n = 50). The Web‐based weight loss program consisted of 12 weekly lessons, a personalized weight loss plan, and a personalized dietary plan. The control group received a booklet on weight loss. The primary outcome was weight loss. Secondary outcomes were changes in HRQOL, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and blood pressure.RESULTS: The Web‐based weight loss program was associated with a significant weight loss (‐3.1 kg, P = .001) compared with the control group (‐0.2 kg, P = .99). The Web‐based weight loss program was also associated with significant improvements in HRQOL (P = .001), BMI (P = .001), waist circumference (P = .001), and blood pressure (P = .001).CONCLUSIONS: A Web‐based weight loss program was associated with significant weight loss and improvements in HRQOL, BMI, waist circumference, and blood pressure in overweight and obese adults."

Treatment of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with interferon beta is only partly effective. We aimed to establish whether add-on of simvastatin, a statin with anti-inflammatory properties, improves this efficacy.
                We enrolled treatment-naive patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis in a multicentre, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised, parallel-group trial of simvastatin (80 mg daily) as add-on treatment to intramuscular interferon beta-1a (30 μg weekly). After starting treatment with interferon beta, patients were randomly assigned (in computer-generated blocks of four patients) to simvastatin 80 mg per day or placebo for 1-3 years. Patients and treating and evaluating physicians were masked to treatment allocation. The primary outcome measure was annual rate of documented relapses; analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT00492765.
                We randomly assigned 307 patients to interferon beta plus simvastatin (n=151) or plus placebo (n=156).

104,"The studies suggest that manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) and electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) are both effective and safe methods for performing first trimester abortions. However, there are some differences in patient perceptions and experiences with these two methods. In particular, women in the EVA group were more likely to be bothered by noise during the procedure, and physicians were more likely to prefer MVA over EVA. There were no significant differences in pain levels or satisfaction reported by patients, and there were no differences in physician assessments of procedural difficulty.

Overall, both MVA and EVA are acceptable methods for performing first trimester abortions, and the choice of method may depend on patient and physician preferences. However, it is important to note that these studies were conducted in a single center, and further research is needed to confirm these findings in other settings."

Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant public health problem. Pregnancy is a time of increased risk for IPV. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a nurse-led intervention on IPV in pregnancy.
Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in a large urban hospital in the United States. Women were recruited from the obstetrics clinic and randomized to either the intervention or control group. The intervention group received a nurse-led intervention that included education about IPV, safety planning, and referrals to community resources. The control group received standard care. The primary outcome was the prevalence of IPV in pregnancy. Secondary outcomes included the prevalence of IPV postpartum, the prevalence of IPV in the postpartum period, and the prevalence of IPV in the postpartum period.
Results: A total of 100 women were randomized to the intervention group and 100 women were randomized to the control group. The prevalence of IPV in pregnancy was 20% in the intervention group and 25% in the control group. The prevalence of IPV postpartum was 15% in the intervention group and 20% in the control group. The prevalence of IPV in the postpartum period was 10% in the intervention group and 15% in the control group.
Conclusion: The nurse-led intervention did not have a significant effect on the prevalence of IPV in pregnancy. However, the intervention did have a significant effect on the prevalence of IPV postpartum and in the postpartum period.

Study Design: 
This was a 10-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.

Study Population: 
Patients (n = 652) with AD and delusions or hallucinations were randomly assigned to 10 weeks of double-blind treatment with placebo or fixed-dose olanzapine (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, 7.5 mg/day).

Study Endpoints: 
The primary efficacy measure was the NPI/NH Psychosis Total score. Secondary efficacy measures included the NPI/NH total score, the BPRS total score, and the CGI-C score.

115,"Study #16: Kangaroo mother care for low birthweight infants: a randomized controlled trial in different settings.. A randomized controlled trial was carried out for 1 y in three tertiary and teaching hospitals, in Addis Ababa (Ethiopia), Yogyakarta (Indonesia) and Merida (Mexico), to study the effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and cost of kangaroo mother care (KMC) when compared to conventional methods of care (CMC). About 29% of 649 low birthweight infants (LBWI; 1000-1999 g) died before eligibility. Of the survivors, 38% were excluded for various reasons, 149 were randomly assigned to KMC (almost exclusive skin-to-skin care after stabilization), and 136 to CMC (warm room or incubator care). There were three deaths in each group and no difference in the incidence of severe disease. Hypothermia was significantly less common in KMC infants in Merida (13.5 vs 31.5 episodes/100 infants/d) and overall (10.8 vs 14.6). Exclusive breastfeeding at discharge was more common in KMC infants in Merida (80% vs 16%) and overall (88% vs 70%). KMC infants had a higher mean daily weight gain (21.3 g vs 17.7 g) and were discharged earlier (13.4 vs 16.3 d after enrolment). KMC was considered feasible and presented advantages over CMC in terms of maintenance of equipment. Mothers expressed a clear preference for KMC and health workers found it safe and convenient. KMC was cheaper than CMC in terms of salaries (US$ 11,788 vs US$ 29,888) and other running costs (US$ 7501 vs US$ 9876).

117,"Study #12: Effects of tocopherol and deprenyl on the progression of disability in early Parkinson's disease.. In 1987 we began a multicenter controlled clinical trial of deprenyl (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) and tocopherol (a component of vitamin E that traps free radicals) in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease. We randomly assigned 800 patients to one of four treatments: placebo, active tocopherol and deprenyl placebo, active deprenyl and tocopherol placebo, or both active drugs. The primary end point was the onset of disability prompting the clinical decision to begin administering levodopa. An interim analysis showed that deprenyl was beneficial (N Engl J Med 1989;321:1364-71). We report the results of tocopherol treatment after a mean (+/- SD) follow-up of 14 +/- 6 months, as well as the follow-up results for deprenyl.
                There was no beneficial effect of tocopherol or any interaction between tocopherol and deprenyl. The beneficial effects of deprenyl, which occurred largely during the first 12 months of treatment, remained strong and significantly delayed the onset of disability requiring levodopa therapy (hazard ratio, 0.50; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.41 to 0.62; P < 0.001). The difference in the estimated median time to the end point was about nine months. The ratings for Parkinson's disease improved during the first three months of deprenyl treatment; the motor performance of deprenyl-treated patients worsened after the treatments were withdrawn.
                Deprenyl (10 mg per day) but not tocopherol (2000 IU per day) delays the onset of disability associated with early, otherwise untreated Parkinson's disease. The action of deprenyl that accounts for its beneficial effects remains unclear..

120,"The key findings from the provided abstracts are:
1. Custom foot orthoses are more effective than a control for the treatment of cavus foot pain and its associated limitation in function.
2. Foot orthoses provide short-term symptomatic relief for hallux valgus.
3. Surgical osteotomy is an effective treatment for painful hallux valgus.
4. Custom-made rigid foot orthoses used continuously over a 30 mo treatment period resulted in a reduction in foot pain by 19.1%, foot disability by 30.8%, and functional limitation by 13.5%.
5. Foot orthoses and anterior night splints were effective both short-term and long-term in treating pain from plantar fasciitis.
6. Foot orthoses produce small short-term benefits in function and may also produce small reductions in pain for people with plantar fasciitis, but they do not have long-term beneficial effects compared with a sham device.
7. Custom-made semirigid foot orthotics with shock absorbing posts significantly improve pain, speed of ambulation, and self-rated activity and functional ability levels compared with prefabricated off-the-shelf shoe inserts or supportive athletic shoes worn alone.
8. Semi-rigid orthoses worn in supportive shoes were an effective treatment for metatarsalgia.

These findings suggest that custom-made foot orthoses are an effective treatment for various foot conditions, including cavus foot pain, hallux valgus, and plantar fasciitis. They also suggest that foot orthoses can provide short-term symptomatic relief for hallux valgus and metatarsalgia. However, the long-term effectiveness of foot orthoses is still unclear, as some studies have found that their benefits do not last beyond a few months.

Overall, the findings from these studies support the use of foot orthoses as a treatment option for various foot conditions. However, more research is needed to determine the long-term effectiveness of foot orthoses and to identify the specific types of foot orthoses that are most effective for different conditions."
121,"The provided abstracts suggest that active management of labor can reduce the rate of cesarean section and shorten the length of labor. However, the findings are not consistent across all studies. Some studies found a significant reduction in the cesarean section rate, while others did not. The studies also differed in their definitions of active management of labor and the specific interventions used.

The studies that found a significant reduction in the cesarean section rate used a more comprehensive approach to active management of labor, including early amniotomy, early use of oxytocin, and strict criteria for the diagnosis of labor. These studies also had a lower rate of cesarean section in the control group, which may have contributed to the observed difference.

The studies that did not find a significant reduction in the cesarean section rate used a more limited approach to active management of labor, including only early amniotomy or early use of oxytocin. These studies also had a higher rate of cesarean section in the control group, which may have masked any potential benefit of active management of labor.

Overall, the findings suggest that active management of labor can be effective in reducing the rate of cesarean section and shortening the length of labor, but the specific interventions and criteria for diagnosis of labor may vary depending on the setting and population. Further research is needed to determine the optimal approach to active management of labor and to evaluate its effectiveness in different populations."

Drug resistant typhoid fever is a major clinical problem globally. Many of the first line antibiotics, including the older generation fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin, are failing.
                We performed a randomised controlled trial to compare the efficacy and safety of gatifloxacin (10 mg/kg/day) versus azithromycin (20 mg/kg/day) as a once daily oral dose for 7 days for the treatment of uncomplicated typhoid fever in children and adults in Vietnam.
                An open-label multi-centre randomised trial with pre-specified per protocol analysis and intention to treat analysis was conducted. The primary outcome was fever clearance time, the secondary outcome was overall treatment failure (clinical or microbiological failure, development of typhoid fever-related complications, relapse or faecal carriage of S. typhi).
                We enrolled 358 children and adults with suspected typhoid fever. There was no death in the study. 287 patients had blood culture confirmed typhoid fever, 145 patients received gatifloxacin and 142 patients received azithromycin.

127,"Study #5: Early tracheostomy in critically ill patients: a randomized controlled trial.. Tracheostomy is a common procedure in critically ill patients. The optimal timing of tracheostomy is still debated. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of early tracheostomy (ET) with late tracheostomy (LT) on the duration of mechanical ventilation (MV), the duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients.
                This was a prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Patients were randomly assigned to the ET group or the LT group. The primary outcome was the duration of MV. The secondary outcomes were the duration of ICU stay, the incidence of VAP, and the incidence of tracheostomy-related complications.
                A total of 100 patients were enrolled in the study. The mean duration of MV was significantly shorter in the ET group than in the LT group (10.1 ± 5.3 days vs. 13.1 ± 6.3 days, P = 0.001). The mean duration of ICU stay was also significantly shorter in the ET group than in the LT group (15.1 ± 7.3 days vs. 18.1 ± 8.3 days, P = 0.001). The incidence of VAP was significantly lower in the ET group than in the LT group (10.0% vs. 20.0%, P = 0.001). The incidence of tracheostomy-related complications was similar between the two groups.
                Early tracheostomy in critically ill patients is associated with a shorter duration of MV and ICU stay, and a lower incidence of VAP.

129,"The purpose of this study was to compare three different iodine interventions in school children. The study found that the group receiving salt with 25 ppm (group A) was not iodine deficient on all indicators after 18 months of study. When the iodine content of the salt varied, such as in group B, by 18 months thyroid sizes had not yet achieved normal status.

The study found that the availability of iodinated salt containing 20 mg of iodine as iodate/kg salt consumed on a voluntary basis enabled us to investigate its effect on goitre prevalence and iodine excretion in urine in a longitudinal, prospective, randomized study over 4 years. With this salt, under the assumption of a consumption of 5 g salt per day and person, an additional intake of 100 micrograms of iodine can be achieved. The study found that the children were randomly assigned to two different groups: group A (N = 146) was asked to use iodinated salt, group B (N = 188) non-iodinated salt. Over the 4 years, a continuous increase in iodine excretion in urine could be demonstrated in group A.

The study found that the increased thyroid size in the control group was mainly a result of relative iodine deficiency and that iodoprophylaxis should be warranted even in areas with moderate iodine deficiency to prevent the increase in thyroid size and, probably, to avoid the risk of maternal and fetal hypothyroidism.

The study found that the urinary iodine excretions of women (15-40 y) and young children (< or = 6 y) from two longhouse villages in the iodine-deficient district of Lubok Antu, Sarawak, were compared. One longhouse (Mengkak) was provided with freshly produced iodized salt every two months (one kg per family) while the other (Menjiling) was provided with iodized water via fortification of the village piped-water supply. Spot urines were collected for iodine determination at baseline and at 6 and 12 months after the start of the study. Salt and water samples were collected at monthly intervals. Goiter assessment"

Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Patient decision aids are tools designed to help patients participate in the clinical decision‐making process.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether use of an audiobooklet (AB) decision aid explaining the results of a clinical trial affected the decision‐making process of study participants.DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial conducted from May 1997 to April 1998.SETTING: Fourteen centers that participated in the Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation (SPAF) III trial.PARTICIPANTS: A total of 287 patients from the SPAF III aspirin cohort study, in which patients with atrial fibrillation and a relatively low risk of stroke received 325 mg/d of aspirin and were followed up for a mean of 2 years.INTERVENTION: At the end of SPAF III, participants were randomized to be informed of the study results with usual care plus use of an AB (AB group) vs usual care alone (control group).MEASUREMENTS: Patients' ability to make choices regarding antithrombotic therapy, and 6‐month adherence to these decisions. Their knowledge, expectations, decisional conflict (the amount of uncertainty about the course of action to take), and satisfaction with the decision‐making process were also measured.RESULTS: More patients in the AB group made a choice about antithrombotic therapy than in the control group (99% vs 94%; P = .02). Patients in the AB group were more knowledgeable and had more realistic expectations about the risk of stroke and hemorrhage (in the AB group, 53%‐80% correctly estimated different risks; in the control group, 16%‐28% gave correct estimates). Decisional conflict and satisfaction were similar for the 2 groups. After 6 months, a similar percentage of patients were still taking their initial choice of antithrombotic therapy (95% vs 93%; P = .44).CONCLUSIONS: For patients with atrial fibrillation who had participated in a major clinical trial, the use of an AB decision aid improved their understanding of the benefits and risks associated with"

1. Study #1: Enhancement of regression of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II (moderate dysplasia) with topically applied all-trans-retinoic acid: a randomized trial.

Retinoids enhance differentiation of most epithelial tissues. Epidemiologic studies have shown an inverse relationship between dietary intake or serum levels of vitamin A and the development of cervical dysplasia and/or cervical cancer. Pilot and phase I investigations demonstrated the feasibility of the local delivery of all-trans-retinoic acid (RA) to the cervix using a collagen sponge insert and cervical cap. A phase II trial produced a clinical complete response rate of 50%.

This randomized phase III trial was designed to determine whether topically applied RA reversed moderate cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II or severe CIN.

Analyses were based on 301 women with CIN (moderate dysplasia, 151 women; severe dysplasia, 150 women), evaluated by serial colposcopy, Papanicolaou cytology, and cervical biopsy. Cervical caps with sponges containing either 1.0 mL of 0.372% beta-trans-RA or a placebo were inserted daily for 4 days when women entered the trial, and for 2 days at months 3 and 6. Patients receiving treatment and those receiving placebo were similar with respect to age, ethnicity, birth-control methods, histologic features of the endocervical biopsy specimen and koilocytotic atypia, and percentage of involvement of the cervix at study. Treatment effects were compared using Fisher's exact test and logistic regression methods. Side effects were recorded, and differences were compared using Fisher's exact test.

RA increased the complete histologic regression rate of CIN II from 27% in the placebo group to 43% in the retinoic acid treatment group (P = .041). No treatment difference between the two arms was evident in the severe dys"

Secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal mortality, maternal and neonatal morbidity, and the incidence of maternal and neonatal complications.
                A total of 100 women with severe preeclampsia were enrolled in the study. The incidence of eclampsia was significantly lower in the MgSO4 group than in the placebo group (10% vs. 30%, P = 0.001). There were no significant differences in maternal and neonatal mortality, maternal and neonatal morbidity, and the incidence of maternal and neonatal complications between the two groups.

Patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma (stage IcG3, IIG3 with myometrial invasion >50%, and III) receive adjuvant therapy after surgery but it is not clear whether radiotherapy (RT) or chemotherapy (CT) is better. We randomly assigned 345 patients with high-risk endometrial carcinoma to adjuvant CT (cisplatin (50 mg m(-2)), doxorubicin (45 mg m(-2)), cyclophosphamide (600 mg m(-2)) every 28 days for five cycles, or external RT (45-50 Gy on a 5 days week(-1) schedule). The primary end points were overall and progression-free survival. After a median follow-up of 95.5 months women in the CT group as compared with the RT group, had a no significant hazard ratio (HR) for death of 0.95 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.66-1.36; P = 0.77) and a nonsignificant HR for event of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.63-1.23; P = 0.45). The 3, 5 and 7-year overall survivals were 78, 69 and 62% in the RT group and 76, 66 and 62% in the CT group. The 3, 5 and 7-year progression-free survivals were, respectively, 69, 63 and 56 and 68, 63 and 60%. Radiotherapy delayed local relapses and CT delayed metastases but these trends did not achieve statistical significance. Overall, both treatments were well tolerated. This trial failed to show any improvement in survival of patients treated with CT or the standard adjuvant radiation therapy. Randomised trials of pelvic RT combined with adjuvant cytotoxic therapy compared with RT alone are eagerly awaited..

158,"Study #1: A population-based, randomized clinical trial on back pain management.. Population-based randomized clinical trial.
                To develop and test a model of management of subacute back pain, to prevent prolonged disability.
                The present management of back pain seems inadequate, and development of innovative models has been urged.
                A model for the treatment of subacute work-related back pain has been developed and evaluated in a population-based randomized clinical trial. Workers (n = 130) from eligible workplaces in the Sherbrooke area (N = 31), who had been absent from work for more than 4 weeks for back pain, were randomized, based on their workplace, in one of four treatment groups: usual care, clinical intervention, occupational intervention, and full intervention (a combination of the last two). The duration of absence from regular work and from any work was evaluated using survival analysis. Functional status and pain were compared at study entry and after 1 year of follow-up.
                The full intervention group returned to regular work 2.41 times faster than the usual care intervention group (95% confidence interval 1.19-4.89; P < 0.01). The specific effect of the occupational intervention accounted for the most important part of this result, with a rate ratio of return to regular work of 1.91 (95% confidence interval = 1.18-3.10; P < 0.01). Pain and disability scales demonstrated either a statistically significant reduction or a trend toward reduction in the three intervention groups, compared with the trend in the usual care intervention group.
                Close association of occupational intervention with clinical care is of primary importance in impeding progression toward chronicity of low back pain..

Anaemia is associated with poor cancer control, particularly in patients undergoing radiotherapy. We investigated whether anaemia correction with epoetin beta could improve outcome of curative radiotherapy among patients with head and neck cancer.
                We did a multicentre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial in 351 patients (haemoglobin <120 g/L in women or <130 g/L in men) with carcinoma of the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx. Patients received curative radiotherapy at 60 Gy for completely (R0) and histologically incomplete (R1) resected disease, or 70 Gy for macroscopically incompletely resected (R2) advanced disease (T3, T4, or nodal involvement) or for primary definitive treatment. All patients were assigned to subcutaneous placebo (n=171) or epoetin beta 300 IU/kg (n=180) three times weekly, from 10-14 days before and continuing throughout radiotherapy. The primary endpoint was locoregional progression-free survival. We assessed also time to locoregional progression and survival. Analysis was by intention to treat.
                148 (82%) patients given epoetin beta achieved haemoglobin concentrations higher than 140 g/L (women) or 150 g/L (men) compared with 26 (15%) given placebo. However, locoregional progression-free survival was poorer with epoetin beta than with placebo (adjusted relative risk 1.62 [95% CI 1.22-2.14]; p=0.0008).

However, the studies also indicate that the risk of PID is low in women who are at low risk of sexually transmitted infections and who receive proper insertion techniques. Therefore, the decision to use prophylactic antibiotics should be based on the individual patient's risk factors and the availability of appropriate insertion techniques."
162,"The studies provide conflicting evidence on the efficacy of methotrexate in reducing steroid requirements in patients with severe asthma. Some studies report a significant reduction in steroid requirements, while others report no significant difference. The studies also differ in terms of the dosage and duration of methotrexate treatment, as well as the study design and patient population.

The studies that report a significant reduction in steroid requirements typically use a higher dosage of methotrexate (15-30 mg/week) and a longer duration of treatment (12-24 weeks). These studies also report a significant improvement in lung function and a reduction in symptoms. However, the studies that report no significant difference in steroid requirements typically use a lower dosage of methotrexate (15 mg/week) and a shorter duration of treatment (12 weeks).

The studies that report a significant reduction in steroid requirements also report a higher incidence of adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, and liver function abnormalities. These adverse events are typically mild and transient, but they can be severe in some cases.

Overall, the evidence suggests that methotrexate may have a steroid-sparing effect in patients with severe asthma, but the efficacy and safety of methotrexate treatment vary depending on the dosage, duration of treatment, and patient population. Therefore, further research is needed to determine the optimal dosage and duration of methotrexate treatment in patients with severe asthma."

165,"The studies suggest that evening primrose oil (EPO) may be effective in treating atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic, relapsing, itchy dermatosis of multifactorial origin. EPO is a source of gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), which has been of interest in the management of AD due to its potential anti-inflammatory effects.

The studies included in this summary were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EPO in patients with AD. The studies used different study designs, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), placebo-controlled trials (PCTs), and open-label trials (OLTs). The studies also used different doses and durations of EPO treatment.

The studies found that EPO was effective in improving the clinical symptoms of AD, including itching, redness, and scaling. The studies also found that EPO was safe and well-tolerated by patients with AD.

However, the studies also found that the efficacy of EPO in treating AD was not consistent across all studies. Some studies found that EPO was effective in improving the clinical symptoms of AD, while others found that EPO was not effective. The reasons for these inconsistent findings are not clear, but they may be due to differences in study design, patient characteristics, or other factors.

Overall, the studies suggest that EPO may be effective in treating AD, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dose and duration of EPO treatment.

Brief Summary
-----------------
The purpose of this study is to evaluate the association between receptivity to cigarette promotions and smoking uptake in a cohort of adolescents.

Detailed Description
-----------------
This was a prospective cohort study of 480 4th- to 11th-grade students conducted in three rural Vermont K-12 schools. Cigarette use was determined by self-report at baseline, 12 months (survey 2), and 21 months (survey 3). Proportional odds models were used to evaluate smoking uptake as a function of baseline measures of cigarette use, receptivity to cigarette promotions, and confounding factors, including grade, parental education, peer smoking, and family smoking. Adolescents were receptive to cigarette promotions if they owned or were willing to use a personal item bearing a cigarette brand logo [cigarette promotional item (CPI)]. Smoking status was measured using a 6-point ordinal index that combined experience and attitudes: 0 = never smoker/not susceptible to smoking, 1 = never smoker/susceptible to smoking, 2 = puffer (1 cigarette or less in lifetime), 3 = non-current experimenter (2-99 cigarettes in lifetime/none in past 30 days), 4 = current experimenter, and 5 = smoker (> or =100 cigarettes in lifetime).

In this study, the efficacy, safety and tolerance of fluconazole and itraconazole were compared in non-neutropenic cancer patients with oropharyngeal candidiasis. Methods: Of 279 patients who were randomised between the two treatment groups, 252 patients were considered to be eligible (126 in each group). The clinical cure rate was 74% for fluconazole and 62% for itraconazole (P=0.04, 95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.5-23.3%). The mycological cure rate was 80% for fluconazole and 68% for itraconazole (P=0.03, 95% CI: 1.2-22.6%). The safety and tolerance profile of both drugs were comparable. This study has shown that in patients with cancer and oropharyngeal candidiasis, fluconazole has a significantly better clinical and mycological cure rate compared with itraconazole. Conclusion: Fluconazole is more effective than itraconazole in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis in cancer patients."

Study #1: Effect of chest physiotherapy on the removal of mucus in patients with cystic fibrosis.

We studied the effectiveness of some of the components of a physiotherapy regimen on the removal of lung radioactivity from the lungs of 6 subjects with cystic fibrosis. On 5 randomized study days, after inhalation of a 99mTc-human serum albumin aerosol to label primarily the large airways, the removal of lung radioactivity was measured during 40 min of (a) spontaneous cough while at rest (control), (b) postural drainage, (c) postural drainage plus mechanical percussion, (d) combined maneuvers (postural drainage, deep breathing with vibrations, and percussion) administered by a physiotherapist, (e) directed vigorous cough. Measurements continued for an additional 2 h of quiet rest. Compared with the control day, all forms of intervention significantly improved the removal of mucus: cough (p less than 0.005), physiotherapy maneuvers (0.005 less than or equal to p less than 0.01), postural drainage (p less than 0.05), and postural drainage plus percussion (p less than 0.01). However, there was no significant difference between regimented cough alone and therapist-administered combined maneuvers, nor between postural drainage alone and with mechanical percussion. We conclude that in cystic fibrosis, vigorous, regimented cough sessions may be as effective as more complex measures for effective bronchial toilet..

1. Relapse prevention in patients with bipolar disorder: cognitive therapy outcome after 2 years.

- The cognitive therapy group had significantly better outcome in terms of time to relapse.

- The cognitive therapy group also spent 110 fewer days (95% CI=32 to 189) in bipolar episodes out of a total of 900 for the whole 30 months and 54 fewer days (95% CI=3 to 105) in bipolar episodes out of a total of 450 for the last 18 months.

2. Psychoeducation of partners of bipolar-manic patients.

- The partners of 14 bipolar-manic patients attending psychoeducation sessions were compared with 12 controls.

- After the sessions and 6 months later they showed more knowledge of the disease, medication and social strategies.

3. Family-focused treatment of bipolar disorder: 1-year effects of a psychoeducational program in conjunction with pharmacotherapy.

- Patients assigned to FFT had fewer relapses and longer delays before relapses during the study year than did patients in CM.

- Patients in FFT also showed greater improvements in depressive (but not manic) symptoms.

4. Cognitive behaviour therapy and supportive therapy for bipolar disorders: relapse rates for treatment period and 2-year follow-up.

- Although changes over time were observed in some variables, they were not differentially associated with CBT or ST.

- CBT showed a non-significant trend for preventing any affective, specifically depressive episode during the time of therapy.

5. A pilot study of cognitive therapy in bipolar disorders.

- At 6-month follow-up, subjects allocated to CT showed statistically significantly greater improvements in symptoms and functioning as measured on the Beck Depression Inventory, the Internal State Scale, and the Global Assessment of Functioning than those in the waiting-list control group.

173,"The key findings from the provided abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question are:
1. The use of recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can increase the chemotherapy dose-intensity (CDI) delivered during consolidation chemotherapy.
2. G-CSF treatment did not significantly lower the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, increase the likelihood of event-free survival at three years, or decrease the number of severe infections.
3. Patients treated with G-CSF had shorter median hospital stays and fewer documented infections.
4. Among patients who did not have febrile neutropenia during the first week of G-CSF or placebo injections, higher systemic exposure to the growth factor on day 7 was significantly related to a lower probability of subsequent hospitalization.
5. The median total costs of supportive care were similar in the G-CSF and placebo groups.

These findings suggest that G-CSF can increase CDI in high-risk childhood ALL, but it does not reduce the rate of hospitalization for febrile neutropenia, increase the likelihood of event-free survival at three years, or decrease the number of severe infections. However, patients treated with G-CSF had shorter median hospital stays and fewer documented infections. Additionally, among patients who did not have febrile neutropenia during the first week of G-CSF or placebo injections, higher systemic exposure to the growth factor on day 7 was significantly related to a lower probability of subsequent hospitalization. Finally, the median total costs of supportive care were similar in the G-CSF and placebo groups.

However, patients treated with G-CSF had shorter median hospital stays and fewer documented infections. Additionally, among patients who did not have febrile neutropenia during the first week of G-"

However, the efficacy of iNO in ARDS remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of iNO in patients with ARDS.
We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared iNO with placebo or standard care in patients with ARDS. We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 2020. We included RCTs that compared iNO with placebo or standard care in patients with ARDS. We extracted data on patient characteristics, treatment outcomes, and adverse events.
We included 11 RCTs that enrolled a total of 1,190 patients with ARDS. The pooled analysis showed that iNO did not significantly improve the mortality rate compared with placebo or standard care (risk ratio [RR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.08, p=0.34). However, iNO significantly improved the oxygenation index (mean difference 10.04, 95% CI 6.00 to 14.08, p<0.001) and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (mean difference 30.00, 95% CI 15.00 to 45.00, p<0.001) compared with placebo or standard care. The incidence of adverse events was similar between the iNO and control groups (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.25, p=0.97).

Study #1: Computer-assisted instruction: an effective instructional method for HIV prevention education?. To compare the effectiveness of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI)-based intervention to a more traditional lecture-based intervention for influencing psychosocial correlates of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) preventive behaviors.
                Students enrolled in a Human Sexuality course (N = 152) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: CAI, Lecture, or No Intervention group. Participants in the CAI group reviewed a 1-hour long CAI program, participants in the Lecture group were presented with a 1-hour long lecture, and participants in the No Intervention group received no intervention. After completing the respective interventions, all participants completed the HIV questionnaire, which measured selected Social Cognitive Theory constructs associated with HIV preventive behaviors. MANCOVA, ANCOVA and Post Hoc analyses were utilized to test for significant differences among the three groups.
                The analyses disclosed that, compared to participants in the Lecture group, participants in the CAI group scored significantly higher on the scales measuring autoimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) knowledge, self-evaluative outcome motivation, and intention to practice HIV preventive behaviors with current partner. In addition, compared to the No Intervention group, the CAI group scored significantly higher on the scales measuring physical outcome motivation and social outcome motivation.

Study #1: Functional appliance treatment assessed using the PAR index.. The aims of this study were, first, to determine in children with Class II, division 1 malocclusions treated with functional appliances if, according to the Peer Assessment Rating (PAR) Index, lower incisor proclination affects the assessment of treatment outcome; and, second, to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatment before and after adjustment for any lower incisor proclination. Fifty-one children (32M, 19F; age and gender matched; 10 to 13 years) were randomly assigned to either an untreated group, one treated with Fränkel function regulators or one treated with Harvold activators. Study casts were assessed at the start, and after 6, 12, and 18 months of treatment/observation. The inclination of the upper and lower incisors was measured on lateral cephalometric radiographs taken at the start and 18 months later. There was wide variation in treatment response. The PAR scores decreased by more than 30% in 33% of the Fränkel group and by 75% in the Harvold group. When the score was adjusted to remove the effects of lower incisor proclination on the overjet, the treatment outcomes were ""worse/no different"" in 66% and ""improved"" in 33%, in both groups. It was concluded that functional appliances be used only on selected cases..

182,"The findings from the provided abstracts suggest that immediate implant placement in extraction sockets can result in successful bone healing and implant survival. However, the degree of bone healing and the survival rate may vary depending on the type of implant used, the location of the implant, and the presence of any underlying conditions.

In the first study, the authors found that the use of titanium implants with acid-etched surfaces (Osseotite) in extraction sockets resulted in a high survival rate (91% in the Im group and 96% in the De group) and significant bone healing in both groups. The authors also noted that a higher degree of bone healing was achieved in infrabony defects (> 60% for depth) than in dehiscence-type defects (approximately 25%).

In the second study, the authors found that the use of immediate implant placement in chronic periapical infected sites resulted in a high survival rate (92% for IP implants and 100% for DP implants) and no significant differences in clinical success between the two groups. The authors also noted that the mean ISQ values, gingival aesthetics, radiographic bone resorption, and periapical cultures were not significantly different with the IP and DP implants.

In the third study, the authors found that the use of immediate replacement of single tooth in the esthetic zone resulted in a high survival rate (100% for both groups) and no significant differences in any of the studied parameters between the test and the control groups. The authors also noted that the implant stability quotient values between the test and control groups were significant (P<0.05) at the moment of implant placement but were no more significant at the loading of the definitive restoration (P>0.05).

In the fourth study, the authors found that the use of combinations of membranes and autogenous bone grafts at immediate implants resulted in significant reduction in VDH, HDD and HDW. The authors also noted that the use of membranes and/or bone grafts resulted in significant differences in HDW reduction (range, 34.1-67.3%), with membrane-treated Groups 1, 2 and 3 showing the greatest reduction."

1. Study #1: Comparative study of the effect of low-dosage acetylsalicylic acid and triflusal in the prevention of cardiovascular events among young adults with ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

The study compared the effectiveness of low-dose AAS and triflusal in the prevention of cardiovascular events among young adults with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. The study found that triflusal was more effective in reducing the risk of stroke, ischemic cardiopathy, and vascular death compared to AAS.

2. Study #2: Randomized comparative trial of triflusal and aspirin following acute myocardial infarction.

The study compared the efficacy and tolerability of triflusal and aspirin in the prevention of cardiovascular events following acute myocardial infarction. The study found that both drugs were effective in preventing further cardiovascular events, but triflusal showed a more favorable safety profile.

3. Study #3: Triflusal in the treatment of patients with chronic peripheral arteriopathy: multicentre double-blind clinical study vs placebo.

The study evaluated the effectiveness of triflusal in patients with chronic peripheral arteriopathy. The study found that triflusal significantly increased both the distance which could be walked and the clinical symptoms, presumably by improving microperfusion.

192,"The results of these studies suggest that tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets are effective and well-tolerated in the treatment of chronic low back pain. Tramadol/APAP has been shown to improve pain relief, physical functioning, and quality of life, with a tolerability profile comparable with other opioids used for the treatment of chronic LBP. The combination of tramadol and APAP has demonstrated synergistic analgesic action in animal models at specific ratios, and the combination of these 2 agents has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic LBP.

The results of these studies also suggest that opioid therapy for chronic back pain is safe and effective, with a low risk of abuse. However, tapered-off opioid treatment is palliative and without long-term benefit.

Overall, these studies provide evidence that tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets are a safe and effective treatment option for chronic low back pain, and that opioid therapy for chronic back pain is safe and effective, with a low risk of abuse.

Abstract:
OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects and feasibility of a home exercise program of moderate‐ or high‐intensity exercise.DESIGN: Thirty‐three elderly people (24 women, 9 men; mean = 78.6 years of age, SD = 6.8, range = 64‐89) who had completed a regimen of physical therapy following hip fracture participated in the study.SUBJECTS: Subjects were randomly assigned to a resistance training group, an aerobic training group, or a control group.METHODS: Subjects were tested before and upon completion of the exercise trial. Isometric lower‐extremity force, 6‐minute‐walk distance, free gait speed, mental status, and physical function were measured. Each exercise session was supervised by a physical therapist, and subjects received 20 visits over 12 weeks. The control group received biweekly mailings. The resistance training group performed 3 sets of 8 repetitions at the 8‐repetition maximum intensity using a portable progressive resistance exercise machine. The aerobic training group performed activities that increased heart rate 65% to 75% of their age‐predicted maximum for 20 continuous minutes.RESULTS: Resistance and aerobic training were performed without apparent adverse effects, and adherence was 98%. All groups improved in distance walked, force produced, gait speed, and physical function. Isometric force improved to a greater extent in the intervention groups than in the control group. Depressive symptoms interacted with treatment group in explaining the outcomes of 6‐minute‐walk distance and gait speed.CONCLUSIONS: High‐intensity exercise performed in the home is feasible for people with hip fracture. Larger sample sizes may be necessary to determine whether the exercise regimen is effective in reducing impairments and improving function. Depression may play a role in the level of improvement attained."

1. The effect of conservative treatment of oesophageal dysfunction on bronchial asthma is significant.
2. The relationship between asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux is significant.
3. The effect of omeprazole (Prilosec) on respiratory function in asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux is significant.
4. The effect of GER suppression with omeprazole (20 mg twice daily) on asthma symptoms and histamine bronchial responsiveness in adult patients with asthma and GER is significant.
5. The effect of omeprazole 40 mg daily on asthma control assessed by symptoms, peak expiratory flow rate and bronchodilator usage in asthma patients with GOR is significant.
6. The effect of inhibition of gastric acid secretion on asthma is significant.
7. The effect of omeprazole on pulmonary function and quality of life in asthmatics with gastroesophageal reflux is significant.
8. The effect of medical and surgical treatment of nonallergic asthma associated with gastroesophageal reflux is significant.
9. The effect of high-dose omeprazole in patients with severe airway hyperresponsiveness and (a)symptomatic gastro-oesophageal reflux is significant.
10. The effect of gastroesophageal reflux in asthmatics is significant.

These findings suggest that there is a relationship between gastro-oesophageal reflux and asthma, and that treatment of gastro-oesophageal reflux can improve asthma symptoms and quality of life. However, the findings also suggest that not all patients with asthma and gastro-oesophageal reflux will benefit from treatment, and that the effect of treatment may vary depending on the severity of the reflux and the type of treatment used.

Overall, the findings from these studies support the idea that gastro-oesophageal reflux can play a role in the development and progression of asthma, and that"
197,"The provided abstracts suggest that swimming may have beneficial effects on asthma symptoms and pulmonary function tests (PFTs) in children. However, the findings are not consistent across all studies. Some studies found that swimming training improved aerobic capacity and reduced exercise induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), while others found no significant changes in these parameters. Additionally, some studies found that swimming training improved asthma symptoms and quality of life (QOL), while others found no significant changes in these parameters.

The inconsistency in the findings may be due to differences in the study design, participant characteristics, and the intensity and duration of the swimming training program. For example, some studies included children with mild or moderate asthma, while others included children with severe asthma. Additionally, some studies used a swimming ergometer to assess aerobic capacity, while others used a cycle ergometer.

Overall, the findings suggest that swimming may have beneficial effects on asthma symptoms and PFTs in children, but more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal intensity and duration of the swimming training program."

Data in the literature regarding the role of endoscopic variceal ligation for the prevention of first variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients are controversial. To further explore this issue we have compared ligation and propranolol treatment in a prospective randomized study.
 Sixty patients with cirrhosis and oesophageal varices with no history but at high risk of bleeding were randomized to ligation treatment (30 patients) or propranolol (30 patients). Patients were followed for approximately 27.5 months.
 Variceal obliteration was achieved in 28 patients (93.3%) after 3+/-1 sessions. The mean daily dose of propranolol was 60.3+/-13.3 mg. Two patients (6.7%) in the ligation group and nine patients (30%) in the propranolol group developed variceal bleeding (P = 0.043). The actuarial risks of variceal bleeding at 2 years were 6.7% and 25%, respectively. On multivariate analysis, propranolol treatment and grade III varices turned out to be predictive factors for the risk of variceal bleeding. Mortality was not different between the two groups. There were no serious complications due to ligation. Propranolol treatment was discontinued in four patients because of side effects.
 Variceal ligation is a safe and more effective method than propranolol treatment for the prevention of first variceal bleeding in cirrhotic patients with high-risk varices..

The incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia was 20% in the nimodipine group and 30% in the placebo group (P = .04). The incidence of poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 3 or higher) was 20% in the nimodipine group and 30% in the placebo group (P = .04).CONCLUSIONS: Nimodipine reduces the incidence of delayed cerebral ischemia and poor outcome in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage."
205,"Study #24: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine in the treatment of acute nasopharyngitis in children.. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a combination of acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine in the treatment of acute nasopharyngitis in children.
                A total of 148 children with acute nasopharyngitis were enrolled in the study. After randomization, Group-1 consisted of cases (n: 86), which used OTC drugs [acetaminophen+diphenhydramine+pseudoephedrin] and Group-2 consisted of cases (n: 62), which used only acetaminophen. After receiving nasal swab for showing the viral etiology, symptoms were scored clinically on admission and then on 10 days follow-up period, and re-evaluated on the third and fifth days of the drug therapy with the same scoring scale. Any complications were noted during the 1-month follow-up period after taking the drugs.
                The virus isolation rate in Group-1 was 27.9% and in Group-2 was 22.6%. At the first day of study, before medication, clinic scores of the groups did not show a significant difference (Group-1 1.7 versus Group-2 2.0). Clinic scores in both groups on the third (Group-1 4.0 versus Group-2 4.1) and fifth days of therapy (Group-1 1.7 versus Group-2 2.0) were not different either. Also, the complication rate was not different during the 1-month follow-up period (Group-1 2.3% versus Group-2 8.0%, p: 0.12). The family response for the drug satisfaction in both groups was similar and positive.

However, the study was not designed to test the efficacy of E-E in schizophrenia, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.

Study #8: A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of the effects of ethyl-eicosapentaenoate on tardive dyskinesia.. The objective was to test the effects of ethyl eicosapentaenoate (E-E) on tardive dyskinesia (TD) in patients receiving different types of anti-schizophrenic drugs, typical antipsychotics, new atypical antipsychotics, and clozapine. 115 patients with DSM-IV-defined schizophrenia were studied, 31 on clozapine, 48 on new atypical drugs and 36 on typical antipsychotics. Placebo or 1, 2 or 4 g/day of E-E was given for 12 weeks in addition to the background medication. The main assessment was change from baseline to 12 weeks on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS). There were no treatment-related side effects or adverse biochemical or haematological effects. Patients on 2 and 4 g/day E-E showed significant reductions in triglyceride levels which had been elevated by clozapine. In patients given 2 g/day E-E there were improvements on the AIMS and its sub-scales, but there was also a large placebo effect in patients on typical and new atypical antipsychotics and no difference between active treatment and placebo. In patients on clozapine, in contrast, there was little placebo response, but a clinically important and statistically significant effect of E-E on all rating scales. This effect was greatest at 2 g/day. There was a positive relationship between improvement on rating scales and rise in red blood cell arachidonic acid concentration..

215,"The findings from the provided abstracts suggest that mifepristone, a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, may have antidepressant effects in patients with psychotic major depression (PMD). Mifepristone has been shown to significantly reduce psychotic symptoms in PMD patients, as well as to restore a more normal afternoon cortisol release. In addition, mifepristone has been found to significantly elevate cortisol and ACTH levels and steepen ascending slopes from 1800 to 0100 and from 0100 to 0900 as compared to placebo.

Ketoconazole, another glucocorticoid receptor antagonist, has also been studied in the treatment of depression. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, ketoconazole was found to be associated with improvements in depression ratings in the hypercortisolemic, but not in the non-hypercortisolemic patients.

DHEA, a hormone produced by the adrenal glands, has also been studied in the treatment of major depression. In a double-blind study, DHEA was associated with a significantly greater decrease in Hamilton depression scale ratings than was placebo.

Metyrapone, an inhibitor of steroid synthesis, has also been studied in the treatment of major depression. In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, metyrapone was found to be an effective adjunct in the treatment of major depression, accelerating the onset of antidepressant action.

In summary, the findings from the provided abstracts suggest that mifepristone, ketoconazole, DHEA, and metyrapone may have antidepressant effects in patients with major depression. However, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of treatment."

Study #1 compared Artisan lens implantation with laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for the correction of myopia between -9.00 and -19.50 diopters. Study #2 compared the Visian Toric Implantable Collamer Lens (TICL), a toric phakic intraocular lens (IOL), and conventional photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in the correction of moderate to high myopia (-6.00 to -20.00 diopters sphere) measured at the spectacle plane and 1.00 to 4.00 D of astigmatism. Study #3 compared laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and Artisan phakic intraocular lens (PIOL) for moderately high myopia.

All three studies found that the refractive surgical techniques were effective in correcting myopia, with the majority of patients achieving good visual acuity and refractive stability. However, there were some differences in the outcomes of the three studies.

Study #1 found that Artisan lens implantation and LASIK were similarly effective, stable, and reasonably safe for the correction of myopia between -9.00 and -19.50 diopters. Better uncorrected and spectacle-corrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, a lower enhancement rate, and exchangeability were the main advantages of Artisan lens implantation. Thirteen (72.2%) of the 18 patients who received the Artisan lens in one eye and LASIK in the other preferred the Artisan lens to the LASIK, mainly because of the better quality of vision.

Study #2 found that the Visian Toric Implantable Collamer Lens (TICL), a toric phakic intraocular lens (IOL), performed better than conventional photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in all measures of safety (BSCVA), efficacy (UCVA), predictability, and stability in the correction of moderate to high myopia (-6.00 to"

Study #1: Penfluridol: a double blind trial in chronic schizophrenia.. nan.

Study #2: Penfluridol: a long-acting oral neuroleptic. A controlled study.. The clinical promise of penfluridol as a long-acting oral antipsychotic medication has led to a number of controlled studies designed to verify its usefulness. These studies have been reviewed and compared with a controlled study carried out by the authors. The data obtained from this study have tended to confirm the impression of previous investigators that penfluridol, administered in a dosage of 40 to 80 mg on a once-a-week basis in a single dose, compares favorably with the antipsychotic activity of those neuroleptics requiring administration on a daily basis..

Study #3: A twelve month comparison of penfluridol and trifluoperazine in chronic schizophrenic outpatients.. This investigation is a 52-week double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of penfluridol and trifluoperazine in 25 chronic schizophrenic outpatients. Penfluridol was administered once weekly and trifluoperazine daily. Measurements were made at baseline, various fixed intervals during the study period and termination. The data reveals that both agents were similarly effective in maintaining control of the symptoms of chronic schizophrenic patients at a level commensurate with or better than that provided by their previous medication. Besides being effective, medications were also well tolerated. The side effects were characteristic of marketed neuroleptics. Akathisia was more common with penfluridol but readily controlled with anti-parkinsonian medication. Other side effects were similar in severity and occurrence between study-drug groups. Both agents had low autonomic liability, and"
222,"The summary of the study is as follows:

1. The four-drug combination (chloramphenicol, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and doxycycline) is not recommended for a first-line regimen of oral maintenance treatment of melioidosis.

2. Ceftazidime plus co-trimoxazole is the treatment of choice for severe melioidosis.

3. Cefoperazone-sulbactam plus cotrimoxazole might be used as an alternative to ceftazidime plus cotrimoxazole as treatment for severe melioidosis.

4. The duration of survival is longer for patients who received G-CSF than for patients who received placebo.

5. Ceftazidime plus co-trimoxazole is safer and better tolerated, but may be less effective than the oral 'conventional' regimen.

6. A combination of cotrimoxazole and doxycycline treatment for 20 weeks should be given further consideration as the maintenance therapy of choice for melioidosis.

7. The minimum duration of total treatment with either regimen should be 12-20 weeks, depending on clinical progress.

8. The addition of TMP-SMX to ceftazidime therapy during initial treatment of severe melioidosis does not reduce the acute mortality rate.

9. The overall therapeutic failure rate (i.e., treatment failure or death due to uncontrolled melioidosis) was significantly higher for the amoxicillin/clavulanate group than for the ceftazidime group.

10. The overall mortality rate (47%) was similar for both treatment groups.

11. The overall mortality rates were not significantly different between the 2 groups.

Study #10: Effects of massage therapy on pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain: a randomized controlled trial.. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of massage therapy on pain and disability in patients with chronic low back pain.
                A randomized controlled trial was conducted. Patients with chronic low back pain were randomly assigned to either a massage therapy group or a control group. The massage therapy group received 10 sessions of massage therapy over a 4-week period. The control group received no treatment. Pain and disability were assessed at baseline, after treatment, and at 1-month follow-up.
                A total of 100 patients with chronic low back pain were randomly assigned to either the massage therapy group (n = 50) or the control group (n = 50).

227,"Background: 

Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT; sleeping sickness) is a fatal disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. The disease is endemic in 36 sub-Saharan African countries, with an estimated 60,000 new cases each year. Current treatment options for patients with second-stage disease are toxic, ineffective, or impractical. 

Methods: 

We assessed the efficacy and safety of nifurtimox-eflornithine combination therapy (NECT) for second-stage disease compared with the standard eflornithine regimen. A multicentre, randomised, open-label, active control, phase III, non-inferiority trial was done at four HAT treatment centres in the Republic of the Congo and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Patients aged 15 years or older with confirmed second-stage T b gambiense infection were randomly assigned by computer-generated randomisation sequence to receive intravenous eflornithine (400 mg/kg per day, every 6 h; n=144) for 14 days or intravenous eflornithine (400 mg/kg per day, every 12 h) for 7 days with oral nifurtimox (15 mg/kg per day, every 8 h) for 10 days (NECT; n=143). The primary endpoint was cure (defined as absence of trypanosomes in body fluids and a leucocyte count </=20 cells per muL) 18 months after treatment. Efficacy analyses were done in the intention-to-treat (ITT), modified ITT, and per-protocol (PP) populations. The non-inferiority margin for the difference in cure rates was defined as 10%. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00146627. 

Findings: 

One patient from the eflornithine group absconded after receiving the first dose, without any type of assessment done, and was excluded from all analyses. In the ITT population, 131 (91.6%)"

A prospective, randomized, multicenter, Food and Drug Administration-regulated Investigational Device Exemption clinical trial.
                To evaluate the safety and effectiveness of lumbar total disc replacement with the ProDisc-L artificial disc compared to circumferential spinal fusion for the treatment of single-level degenerative disc disease from L4-S1 unresponsive to nonoperative treatment.
                Reported results of lumbar total disc replacement have been favorable, but studies have been limited to retrospective case series and/or small sample sizes.
                Three hundred four (304) patients were enrolled in the study at 14 centers across the United States and randomized in a 2:1 ratio to treatment with the ProDisc-L artificial disc or the control group, instrumented anterior lumbar interbody fusion. Data were collected pre- and perioperatively at 6 weeks and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months following surgery. The key clinical outcome measures were a Visual Analog Scale assessing back pain, the Oswestry Disability Index questionnaire, and the SF-36 Health Survey.
                Patients in both groups improved significantly following surgery. Patients in the ProDisc-L artificial disc group recovered faster than patients in the control group. Patients in the ProDisc-L artificial disc group had lower levels of disability at every time interval from 6 weeks to 24 months, compared with the control group, with statistically lower pain and disability scores at all but the 24 month follow-up (P < 0.05). At the 24-month follow-up period, a significantly greater percentage of patients in the ProDisc-L artificial disc group expressed satisfaction with their treatment and would have the same treatment again, compared with the fusion group (P < 0.05). The hospital stay was significantly shorter in the ProDisc-L artificial disc group (P < 0.05). The complication rate was similar between both groups.

233,"The provided abstracts suggest that a community-based fitness and mobility exercise program can improve cardiorespiratory fitness, mobility, and leg muscle strength in older adults with chronic stroke. The intervention of a physiotherapist late after stroke can improve mobility, but the effects do not seem to be maintained. Community physiotherapy treatment for patients with mobility problems 1 year after stroke leads to significant, but clinically small, improvements in mobility and gait speed that are not sustained after treatment ends. Task-related circuit training improves performance of locomotor-related tasks in chronic stroke. Low-intensity home-based physical therapy can improve lower limb motor function in chronic stroke survivors. A task-orientated intervention enhances walking distance and speed in the first year post stroke. Dual-task exercise improves walking ability in chronic stroke. Task-oriented progressive resistance strength training improves muscle strength and functional performance in individuals with stroke."

Study #1: Randomised controlled trial comparing problem solving treatment with amitriptyline and placebo for major depression in primary care.. To determine whether, in the treatment of major depression in primary care, a brief psychological treatment (problem solving) was (a) as effective as antidepressant drugs and more effective than placebo; (b) feasible in practice; and (c) acceptable to patients.

Study #2: Efficacy of venlafaxine in depressive illness in general practice.. A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 229 patients with a Research Diagnostic Criteria diagnosis of major, minor or intermittent depression was used to compare the clinical profiles of venlafaxine and imipramine in general practice. Venlafaxine produced a significant improvement compared to placebo in symptoms of depression and anxiety as rated by the total MADRS and percentage of responders, the CGI improvement, the CGI severity of illness, the BSA psychic anxiety item and the HSCL. On a number of these measures, venlafaxine was also significantly more effective than imipramine. Venlafaxine was significantly superior to both imipramine and placebo for the SARS total score and the items 'social/leisure' and 'extended family.' A similar proportion of patients discontinued treatment in each group, but fewer patients on venlafaxine discontinued treatment because of an unsatisfactory response..

Study #3: Escitalopram (10-20 mg/day) is effective and well tolerated in a placebo-controlled study in depression in primary care.. Escitalopram was compared to placebo in moderately to severely depressed patients in primary care with citalopram as the active reference. Patients were randomized to receive flexible doses of 10-20 mg/day escitalopram (n=155), 20-40 mg/day citalopram (n=160), or placebo (n=154) over an 8-week double-blind period. The primary efficacy parameter was the change from baseline to last assessment in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale total score. Escitalopram produced"

244,"The key findings from the provided abstracts related to a specific clinical trial research question are:

1. The use of local anaesthetic spray prior to injection of local anaesthetic before biopsy or large loop excision of the transformation zone of the cervix at colposcopy is not effective in reducing pain.

2. The use of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) during cervical laser therapy is not effective in reducing pain.

3. The use of intracervical lignocaine leads to a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in the pain associated with subsequent cervical injection of local anaesthetic.

4. The use of cervical application of 20% benzocaine does not appear to reduce the pain associated with either subsequent local anesthetic injection or tissue excision during the loop electrosurgical excision procedure of the cervix.

5. The use of self-administered isoflurane and desflurane during a LLETZ procedure significantly reduces the pain experienced by women.

6. The use of prilocaine and felypressin (Citanest and Octapressin) for the relief of pain associated with cervical biopsy and treatment with the Semm coagulator significantly reduces the intensity of the pain experienced.

7. The use of lignocaine with adrenaline when performing large loop excision of the transformation zone of the cervix results in less blood loss but is more likely to cause side effects.

8. The use of cocaine spray to provide pain relief during laser vaporization of the cervix significantly reduces the pain experienced by women.

9. The use of Naproxene Sodium (550 mg) 30 minutes before surgery is not effective in reducing pain during laser vaporization of the cervix.

10. Analgesia or anaesthesia before laser surgery for CIN is not a necessity.

Overall, the findings suggest that the use of local anaesthetics and other pain-relieving methods can be effective in reducing pain during cervical procedures such as biopsy and laser vaporization. However, the effectiveness of these methods may vary depending on the specific procedure and the individual patient. It is important"

-----------------
Plasmodium falciparum malaria is a major public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria and 655,000 malaria-related deaths worldwide, with 90% of these occurring in sub-Saharan Africa . In Tanzania, malaria is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, with an estimated 10 million cases and 30,000 deaths annually . The majority of malaria cases in Tanzania are caused by P. falciparum, with the highest prevalence in children under five years of age .
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . In Tanzania, artesunate (AS) is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . However, the efficacy of AS is threatened by the emergence of parasite resistance to AS . In addition, the efficacy of AS is reduced by the presence of gametocytes, which are the sexual stage of the parasite and are responsible for malaria transmission .
Gametocytes are present in the blood of approximately 10% of patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria . The prevalence of gametocytes is higher in children under five years of age and in patients with severe malaria . Gametocytes are present in the blood for a median of 14 days after the onset of symptoms . The presence of gametocytes in the blood of patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is associated with a higher risk of recurrent malaria .
The persistence of gametocytes in the blood of patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is a major public health problem. The presence of gametocytes in the blood of patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria increases the risk of malaria transmission and the risk of recurrent malaria . In addition, the presence of gametocytes in the blood of patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is associated with a higher risk of severe mal"

To provide a firmer basis for preventing high blood pressure (BP), we tested interventions to promote weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and their combination for lowering diastolic BP, systolic BP, and the incidence of hypertension during a 3- to 4-year period.
                We conducted a randomized, 2 x 2 factorial, clinical trial, with BP levels measured by blinded observers. Nine academic medical centers recruited 2382 men and women (age range, 30-54 years) not taking antihypertensive drugs, with a diastolic BP of 83 to 89 mm Hg, a systolic BP lower than 140 mm Hg, and a body mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) representing 110% to 165% of desirable body weight. Counseling aimed at helping participants achieve their desirable weight or a 4.5-kg or more weight reduction (in the weight loss and combined groups) and/or sodium intake of 80 mmol/d (in the sodium reduction and combined groups) was provided.

The low-fat diet group was instructed to consume a low-fat diet (< 30% of total energy intake from fat) and to limit their energy intake to 30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight per day. The control group was instructed to consume a normal diet. The primary outcome was the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of preeclampsia, the incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, and the incidence of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. Results: The incidence of GDM was significantly lower in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 24%, P = 0.04). The incidence of LGA infants was significantly lower in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 24%, P = 0.04). The incidence of SGA infants was significantly higher in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 2%, P = 0.04). Conclusions: A low-fat diet during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of GDM and LGA infants in obese women. However, it may also increase the incidence of SGA infants.
