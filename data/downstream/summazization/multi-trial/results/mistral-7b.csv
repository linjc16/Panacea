0,"The present review summarizes the results of 22 randomized controlled trials that investigated the effects of prebiotics on the growth and tolerance of preterm infants. The studies were conducted in infants with birth weight less than 2500 g and gestational age less than 37 weeks. The prebiotics used in the studies were mainly galactooligosaccharides, fructooligosaccharides, lactulose, and lactitol. The results of the studies showed that prebiotics were safe and well tolerated in preterm infants. The prebiotics were found to improve the growth of preterm infants, increase the number of bifidobacteria in the stool, and improve the tolerance of preterm infants to enteral feedings. The prebiotics were also found to reduce the incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis and late-onset sepsis in preterm infants. The results of the studies suggest that prebiotics may be useful in the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders in preterm infants.

1,"The studies reviewed suggest that glucomannan supplementation may have a positive effect on plasma cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels. However, the results are mixed, with some studies showing significant reductions in these parameters and others showing no significant effects. The studies also suggest that glucomannan may have a positive effect on blood glucose levels, but again, the results are mixed. Overall, the evidence suggests that glucomannan supplementation may be a useful adjunct to dietary interventions for managing plasma lipid and glucose levels. However, more research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the optimal dosage and duration of glucomannan supplementation for these purposes."
2,The present study is a systematic review of the literature on the use of autografts for anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) reconstruction. The review included 11 studies that met the inclusion criteria. The studies were analyzed according to the quality assessment tool ( QAT ) and the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias. The results of the studies showed that the use of autografts for ACL reconstruction is associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than that of allografts. The most commonly used autografts for ACL reconstruction are the patellar tendon-bone ( PBTB ) and the quadriceps tendon-bone ( QTB ) grafts. The PBTB graft is associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the QTB graft. The QTB graft is associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the hamstring tendon ( HT ) graft. The QTB graft is also associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the bone-patella tendon-bone ( BPTB ) graft. The QTB graft is also associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the double-bundle ACL reconstruction ( DBA ) graft. The QTB graft is also associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the single-bundle ACL reconstruction ( SBA ) graft. The QTB graft is also associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the quadriceps tendon-bone-bone ( QTB-BB ) graft. The QTB graft is also associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the patellar tendon-bone-bone ( PBTB-BB ) graft. The QTB graft is also associated with a lower risk of complications and a better functional outcome than the hamstring tendon-bone-bone ( HT-BB ) graft.

3,"The studies in this review examined the effects of anticholinergic medications on various aspects of cognitive function in older adults. The studies were conducted in a variety of clinical settings, including community-dwelling older adults, hospitalized older adults, and individuals with dementia. The studies used a variety of measures to assess cognitive function, including tests of memory, attention, executive function, and processing speed.

The studies generally found that anticholinergic medications were associated with impaired cognitive function in older adults. For example, one study found that anticholinergic medications were associated with a decline in cognitive function over a 12-month period in community-dwelling older adults. Another study found that anticholinergic medications were associated with impaired attention and processing speed in hospitalized older adults.

The studies also examined the effects of anticholinergic medications on specific cognitive domains. For example, one study found that anticholinergic medications were associated with impaired memory in community-dwelling older adults. Another study found that anticholinergic medications were associated with impaired executive function in hospitalized older adults.

Overall, the studies in this review suggest that anticholinergic medications may have negative effects on cognitive function in older adults. However, it is important to note that the studies had limitations, such as small sample sizes and the use of different measures of cognitive function. Further research is needed to confirm these findings and to determine the clinical significance of these effects."

34,"The studies in this review suggest that resistance training (RT) and endurance training (ET) have different effects on functional fitness and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). RT has been shown to improve muscle strength and endurance, while ET has been shown to improve cardiovascular fitness and HRQoL. The combination of RT and ET has been shown to improve muscle strength and endurance, cardiovascular fitness, and HRQoL. However, the studies also suggest that the optimal combination of RT and ET may depend on the individual patient's characteristics and needs. For example, patients with advanced COPD may benefit more from RT, while patients with moderate COPD may benefit more from ET. Overall, the studies suggest that both RT and ET can be beneficial for patients with COPD, and the optimal combination of the two may depend on the individual patient's characteristics and needs."
