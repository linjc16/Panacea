The studies investigated the efficacy and safety of different doses and formulations of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA), urokinase, and alteplase in restoring patency to occluded CVADs.

The main findings are as follows:

1. Study #1: Alfimeprase, a novel-acting fibrin degradation agent, was found to be effective in rapidly restoring patency to occluded CVADs, with a high success rate and low risk of major hemorrhagic or embolic events.
2. Study #2: Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was effective in restoring total CVAD function, with no difference in efficacy among different concentrations of r-UK. Treatment-emergent hemorrhagic events were rare.
3. Study #3: Infusion of alteplase appeared to be safe and effective in restoring flow to occluded catheters without need for pretreatment radiographic evaluation.
4. Study #4: Comparison of 1 mg/mL and 2 mg/2 mL doses of alteplase found that the higher dose was more effective in restoring catheter function.
5. Study #5: Urokinase was found to be less effective than recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in restoring thrombosed central venous catheters.
6. Study #6: Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs, with no major hemorrhagic events within 72 hours after instillation.
7. Study #7: Low-dose urokinase infusions were found to be effective in treating fibrinous occlusions of venous access devices in cancer patients, with a high success rate and low risk of major hemorrhagic or embolic events.
