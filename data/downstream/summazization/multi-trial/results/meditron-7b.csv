6,"[/INST] Your task is to synthesize the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question.
Combine the insights from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary. Your summary should integrate the findings rather than list them separately. It's crucial to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring the summary is accessible and informative.
The output should only be the summary. Do not explain how you synthesize it.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Oral ofloxacin versus parenteral imipenem-cilastatin in the treatment of osteomyelitis.. A group of 16 patients with chronic osteomyelitis were treated with oral ofloxacin (400 mg every 12 hours) and a group of 16 patients were treated with intravenous imipenem-cilastatin (500 mg every 6 hours). Organisms were considered susceptible to ofloxacin when the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) was <2 micrograms/ml, and to imipenem-cilastatin when the MIC was <4 micrograms/ml. The average duration of therapy was 30 days for the ofloxacin group and 31 days for the imipenem-cilastatin group. The average follow-up was 12 months for the ofloxacin group and 11 months for the imipenem-cilastatin group. All patients in the ofloxacin group and 15 of 16 patients in the imipenem-cilastatin group had the osteomyelitis arrested after the initial treatment. Follow-up was for 12 to 24 months (mean, 16 months) for the ofloxacin group and 11 to 24 months (mean, 15 months) for the imipenem-cilastatin group. There were no treatment failures in the ofloxacin group, and one treatment failure in the imipenem-cilastatin group. A patient receiving imipenem-cilastatin had a transient rise in serum glutamic oxalacetic transaminase and serum glutamic py"

### Summary"
30,"[/INST] Your task is to synthesize the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question.
Combine the insights from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary. Your summary should integrate the findings rather than listing them separately. It's crucial to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring the summary is accessible and informative.
The output should only be the summary. Do not explain how you synthesize it.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Diflunisal. A new oral analgesic with an unusually long duration of action.. The analgesic efficacy of single 500- and 1,000-mg doses of diflunisal (Dolobid), a new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic, was compared in a double-blind study with that of acetaminophen, 600 mg, the combination of acetaminophen, 600 mg, with codeine phosphate, 60 mg, and placebo in 159 oral surgery outpatients. Using a self-rating record, patients rated their pain and its relief hourly for 12 hours after medication. Both doses of diflunisal were significantly more effective than placebo through hours 2 and 5, respectively; both doses of diflunisal were significantly superior through the end of the 12-hour observation period. None of the active treatments produced more side effects than the placebo..

Study #2: A double-blind comparison of diflunisal and aspirin in the treatment of post-operative pain after episiotomy.. A double-blind randomized trial was carried out in 161 primiparous women suffering from moderate to severe post-episiotomy pain to compare the analgesic efficacy of single doses of diflunisal (250, 500, or 1000 mg), aspirin (650 mg), or placebo. Using a self-rating record, the subjects rated their pain and its relief hourly for 12 hours after medication. Measures of peak and total analges"

Study Abstracts: Study #1: No eye pad for corneal abrasion.. We have carried out a randomised clinical trial to assess the healing rate and level of discomfort experienced in two groups of patients with simple traumatic corneal abrasions. Patients treated with antibiotic ointment and mydriatic alone have a significantly improved healing rate compared with those treated with antibiotic ointment, mydriatic and a double eye pad with bandage (0.05 > p > 0.02). There was no significant difference in the level of discomfort experienced by the two groups. An eye pad seems to confer no benefit in healing and is uncomfortable..

Study #2: Efficacy of eyepad in corneal healing after corneal foreign body removal.. 30 patients with corneal epithelial defect due to removal of corneal foreign bodies were randomly allocated to receive either chloramphenicol with continuous application of an eyepad or chloramphenicol without the eyepad. Almost all corneal defects were healed at 24 h, and all were healed by 48 h, with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. Discomfort at 24 h was greater in the eyepad group than in the control group. An eyepad seems to confer no benefit in healing and is uncomfortable..

Study #3: The evaluation of eye patching in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions: a controlled clinical trial.. We sought to evaluate the efficacy of eye patching in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions in terms of time to healing and reduction in pain and discomfort.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Randomized, blind trial of dopamine versus dobutamine for treatment of hypotension in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome.. To compare the efficacy of dopamine and dobutamine for the treatment of hypotension (mean arterial blood pressure, < or = 30 mm Hg) in preterm (< or = 34 weeks of gestation) infants with respiratory distress syndrome in the first 24 hours of life, we enrolled 63 hypotensive preterm infants in a randomized, blind trial. Inclusion criteria required an arterial catheter for measurement of mean arterial blood pressure, treatment with exogenous surfactant, and persistent hypotension after volume expansion with 20 ml/kg (packed erythrocytes if hematocrit < 0.40, 5% albumin if > or = 0.40,) and 20 ml/kg (5% albumin if hematocrit < 0.40, 20% albumin if > or = 0.40). The study groups at entry were comparable for birth weight, gestational age, postnatal age, gender, birth depression, hematocrit < 0.40, heart rate, oxygenation index, delivery route, maternal chorioamnionitis, and maternal magnesium or ritodrine therapy. No infants in the dopamine group had a treatment failure (0/31; 0%); (16%) of 32 infants failed to respond to dobutamine (p = 0.028). Success was attained at < or = 10 micrograms/kg per min in 30"

# Discussion

## Summary of evidence
The evidence from the included studies suggests that the use of superelastic archwires is associated with a faster rate of tooth movement than conventional nickel-titanium wires. The evidence is of low quality and is based on a small number of studies.

## Quality of the evidence
The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. The quality of the evidence was downgraded for risk of bias, inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and publication bias.

## Clinical implications
The use of superelastic archwires is associated with a faster rate of tooth movement than conventional nickel-titanium wires.

## Research implications
The evidence is of low quality and is based on a small number of studies.

## Recommendations for future research
Future research should focus on the following:
- The effect of superelastic archwires on the rate of tooth movement in the upper and lower arches.
- The effect of superelastic archwires on the rate of tooth movement in the upper and lower arches in adults.
- The effect of superelastic archwires on the rate of tooth movement in the upper and lower arches in children.
- The effect of superelastic archwires on the rate of tooth movement in the upper and lower archwires in the rate of tooth movement in the rate of tooth movement in the rate of tooth movement of tooth movement of tooth movement of the rate of tooth movement of the rate of tooth movement of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate of the rate"

# Conclusion:
The results of this study suggest that single-dose therapy with amoxicillin is an effective and safe alternative to conventional therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children.

# Background:
Urinary tract infections are the most common bacterial infections in children. The majority of these infections are caused by Escherichia coli. The treatment of choice is amoxicillin.

# Objective:
To compare the efficacy of single-dose amoxicillin therapy with conventional therapy for the treatment of uncomplicated urinary tract infections in children.

# Methods:
A prospective, randomized, multicenter study was conducted in 36 girls, aged two to 17 years, with culture-proven, acute, uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections and without signs or symptoms of fever, symptoms of urinary tract infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infe infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infe infe infe infections infe infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infections infeins infections infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins infeins in"

Combine the insights from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary. Your summary should integrate the findings rather than list them separately. It's crucial to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring the summary is accessible and informative.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Cyclosporine (CSP) or CSP plus methylprednisolone for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis in patients with high-risk lymphohemopoietic malignancies: long-term follow-up of a randomized trial.. Patients with a lymphohematopoietic malignancy considered to be at high risk for posttransplant relapse were enrolled in a study to compare the use of cyclosporine (CSP) as a single agent with a combination of methylprednisolone (MP) and CSP for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sibling donor. Sixty patients were randomized to receive CSP only and 62 were randomized to receive CSP plus MP. All 122 patients were evaluable for toxicity and 104 patients were evaluable for response. The incidence rates of grades II-IV acute GVHD were 73% and 60% for patients receiving CSP and CSP plus MP, respectively (P = .01). No difference was seen for grades III-IV GVHD. However, the incidence of de novo chronic GVHD was marginally higher in patients receiving CSP plus MP (P = .08). There was a suggestion that the risk of relapse was lower in patients receiving CSP plus MP (P = .10) and, although the overall survival in the two groups was not different (P = .44), there was a trend toward a difference in favor of CSP plus MP for relapse-free survival (P = .06). These results suggest that prophylactic MP, when combined with C"

185,"[/INST] Your task is to synthesize the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question.
Combine the insights from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary. Your summary should integrate the findings rather than listing them separately. It's crucial to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring the summary is accessible and informative.
The output should only be the summary. Do not explain how you summarize it.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Physical and psychological effects of aerobic exercise in delinquent adolescent males.. Aerobic exercise has been associated with improved psychological status and physical fitness in adults, but its effects in adolescents have been less clear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of an aerobic exercise program on the self-concept, academic achievement, motor proficiency, and cardiovascular fitness of boys with learning disabilities. Fifty-four boys were randomly assigned to conditions within a true experimental design. The running program consisted of three 30-min sessions per week for 12 weeks in lieu of attendance in regular physical education classes. Findings showed that although boys tended to run faster than girls overall and that older children run faster than younger children, running-program participants performed better on an 800-m run, had lower pulse rates, and performed better on a test of creativity than did regular physical education participants. Running performance for 800 m persisted for 5 months among boys in the treatment, but not among girls. Running was judged effective for enhancing the cardiorespiratory health and creativity of school children..

Study #2: The effect of a physical activity intervention package on the self-esteem of pre-adolescent and adolescent females.. Preschool teachers from four different day care centers assessed four-and five-year-old children for deficits in gross-motor skill and self-concept. Forty subjects were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group participated in a 30 minute per day, 5 day per week perceptual-motor training program for 10 weeks, while the control group received no specialized intervention other than their regular classroom activities. Two posttests were admin"

# Introduction

### Background

Pulmonary embolism is a common clinical problem. It is estimated that 100,000 to 200,000 people in the United States die each year from pulmonary embolism. The annual incidence of pulmonary embolism is 1 to 2 per 1,000 persons. The incidence of pulmonary embolism is increasing, and it is now the third most common cause of cardiovascular death.

### Significance

Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition. The mortality rate for patients with massive pulmonary embolism is 30 to 50 percent. The mortality rate for patients with submassive pulmonary embolism is 10 to 20 percent. The mortality rate for patients with low-risk pulmonary embolism is 1 to 2 percent.

### Burden

Pulmonary embolism is a common clinical problem. It is estimated that 100,000 to 200,000 people in the United States die each year from pulmonary embolism. The annual incidence of pulmonary embolism is 1 to 2 per 1,000 persons. The incidence of pulmonary embolism is increasing, and it is now the third most common cause of cardiovascular death.

### Cost

Pulmonary embolism is a common clinical problem. It is estimated that 100,000 to 200,000 people in the United States die each year from pulmonary embolism. The annual incidence of pulmonary embolism is 1 to 2 per 1,000 persons. The incidence of pulmonary embolism is increasing, and it is now the third most common cause of cardiovascular death.

### Cost-effectiveness

Pulmonary embolism is a common clinical problem. It is estimated that 100,000 to 200,000 people in the United States die each year from pulmonary embolism."

217,"[/INST] Your task is to synthesize the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question.
Combine the insights from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary. Your summary should integrate the findings rather than listing them separately. It's crucial to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring the summary is accessible and informative.
The output should only be the summary. Do not explain how you summarize it.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Comparison of radiotherapy alone with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia in locally advanced pelvic tumours: a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial. Dutch Deep Hyperthermia Group.. Local-control rates after radiotherapy for locally advanced tumours of the bladder, cervix, and rectum are disappointing. We investigated the effect of adding hyperthermia to standard radiotherapy.
                The study was a prospective, randomised, multicentre trial. 358 patients were enrolled from 1990 to 1996, in cancer centres in the Netherlands, who had bladder cancer stages T2, T3, or T4, NO, MO, cervical cancer stages IIB, IIIB, or IV, or rectal cancer stage M0-1 were assessed. Patients were randomly assigned radiotherapy (median total dose 65 Gy) alone (n=176) or radiotherapy plus hyperthermia (n=182). Our primary endpoints were complete response and duration of local control. We did the analysis by intention to treat.
                Complete-response rates were 39% after radiotherapy and 55% after radiotherapy plus hyperthermia (p<0.001). The duration of local control was significantly longer with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia than with radiotherapy alone (p=0.04). Treatment effect did not differ significantly by tumour site, but the addition of hyperthermia seemed to be most important for cervical cancer, for which the complete-response rate with radiotherapy plus hyperthermia was 83% compared with 17% with radiotherapy alone (p<0.001).

# Discussion

## Summary of evidence
The evidence from this systematic review suggests that task-oriented interventions are effective in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors. The evidence is strongest for task-oriented interventions that are delivered in the community and that are of moderate intensity. The evidence is weakest for task-oriented interventions that are delivered in the hospital and that are of low intensity.

## Interpretation
The findings of this systematic review are consistent with the results of a previous systematic review of the effectiveness of task-oriented interventions in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors. The previous review included studies that were published up to 2005 and found that task-oriented interventions were effective in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors. The findings of the current review are also consistent with the results of a recent systematic review of the effectiveness of task-oriented interventions in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors. The previous review included studies that were published up to 2005 and found that task-oriented interventions were effective in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors. The findings of the current review are also consistent with the results of a recent systematic review of the effectiveness of task-oriented interventions in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors. The previous review included studies that were published up to 2005 and found that task-oriented interventions were effective in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors.

## Comparison with other studies
The findings of this systematic review are consistent with the results of a previous systematic review of the effectiveness of task-oriented interventions in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors. The previous review included studies that were published up to 2005 and found that task-oriented interventions were effective in improving mobility and balance in chronic stroke survivors.

### [INST] Your task is to synthesize the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question.
Combine the insights from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary. Your summary should integrate the findings rather than listing them separately. It's crucial to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring the summary is accessible and informative.
The output should only be the summary. Do not explain how you summarize it.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Effectiveness of an influenza vaccine programme for care home staff to prevent death, morbidity, and health service use among residents: cluster randomised controlled trial.. To determine whether vaccination of care home staff against influenza indirectly protects residents.
                Pair matched cluster randomised controlled trial.
                Large private chain of UK care homes during the winters of 2003-4 and 2004-5.
                Nursing home staff (n=1703) and residents (n=2604) in 44 care homes (22 intervention homes and 22 matched control homes).
                Vaccination offered to staff in intervention homes but not in control homes.
                The primary outcome was all cause mortality of residents. Secondary outcomes were influenza-like illness and health service use in residents.
                In 2003-4 vaccine coverage in full time staff was 48.2% (407/884) in intervention homes and 5.9% (51/859) in control homes. In 2004-5 uptake rates were 43.2% (365/844) and 3.5% (28/800). National influenza rates were substantially below average in 2004-5. In the 2003-4 period of influenza activity significant decreases were found in mortality of residents in intervention homes compared with control homes (rate difference -5.0 per 100 residents, 95% confidence interval -7.0 to -2.0) and in influenza-like illness (P=0.004), consultations with general pract"
