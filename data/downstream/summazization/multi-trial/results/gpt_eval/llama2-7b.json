        "summary": "There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.",
        "model_output": "[/INST]  The studies summarized in this document investigate the use of various fibrinolytic agents, including alfimeprase, r-UK, and urokinase, to treat occluded central venous access devices (CVADs) in patients with cancer. The studies show that these agents are effective in restoring patency to occluded CVADs, with varying doses and concentrations yielding different results.\n\nKey findings:\n\n1. Alfimeprase is a novel-acting fibrin degradation agent that directly dissolves thrombi without the need for plasminogen activation. In a phase II trial, alfimeprase was found to be more effective than placebo in restoring patency to occluded CVADs within 15 minutes of treatment.\n2. Dose-ranging trials with r-UK showed that a 5,000 IU/mL concentration was superior to placebo in restoring patency to occluded CVADs, with no significant difference between the 15,000 IU/mL and 25,000 IU/mL concentrations.\n3. Urokinase was found to be superior to placebo in restoring patency to occluded CVADs in a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The 2 mg/mL dose of t-PA was more effective than the 1 mg/mL dose in restoring catheter function.\n4. Low-dose urokinase infusions were found to be effective in restoring function to fibrin-occluded CVADs in cancer patients, with the addition of heparin not enhancing the efficacy of the infusions.\n\nOverall, these studies suggest that fibrinolytic agents, including alfimeprase, r-UK, and urokinase, are effective in restoring patency to occluded CVADs in patients with cancer. However, the optimal dose and concentration of these agents may vary depending on the specific patient population and the duration of occlusion. Further research is needed to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of these agents in clinical practice.",
        "eval": "Goal Alignment: 1\n\nThe groundtruth summary focuses on the lack of strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of drug interventions for treating central venous catheter (CVC) lumen occlusion, and the need for further high-quality research in this area. The generated summary, on the other hand, summarizes the findings of various studies investigating the use of fibrinolytic agents, such as urokinase, alteplase, and alfimeprase, for restoring patency to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs) in cancer patients.\n\nWhile the generated summary does not directly address the lack of strong evidence or the need for further research, it does provide information on the potential efficacy of these drug interventions, which aligns with the goal of evaluating the available evidence on their use for treating CVC/CVAD lumen occlusion.\n\nExplanation: The goals of the two summaries have partial overlap, as they both discuss the use of drug interventions for treating CVC/CVAD lumen occlusion, albeit with different emphases. The groundtruth summary focuses on the lack of strong evidence and the need for further research, while the generated summary summarizes the findings of specific studies on the efficacy of fibrinolytic agents.\n\nSummary of scores:\nGoal Alignment: 1"
