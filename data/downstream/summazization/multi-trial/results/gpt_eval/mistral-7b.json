        "summary": "There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] The studies reviewed here all investigate the use of different agents for restoring function to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs). Alfimeprase, a novel-acting fibrin degradation agent, was found to be effective in restoring function to occluded CVADs in a phase II trial. The alfimeprase 3.0-mg dose produced the highest patency rate at 120 minutes after the first dose, and no major hemorrhagic or embolic events were reported. Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was also found to be effective in restoring total CVAD function in a phase II trial, with the 5,000 IU/mL concentration producing the highest patency rate. The study also reported that r-UK was safe and well-tolerated. Alteplase, a tissue plasminogen activator, was found to be effective in restoring flow to occluded catheters in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. The study also reported that alteplase was safe and well-tolerated. The studies reviewed here provide evidence for the use of these agents in restoring function to occluded CVADs, and suggest that they may be effective and safe options for this purpose.",
        "eval": "Goal Alignment:\nScore: 0\n\nThe ground truth summary discusses the lack of strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of drug interventions for treating central venous catheter (CVC) lumen occlusion, and the need for further high-quality research in this area. It does not provide specific details about the effectiveness of any particular drug or agent.\n\nOn the other hand, the generated summary focuses on describing the effectiveness and safety of specific agents like alfimeprase, urokinase, and alteplase in restoring function to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs), based on the findings of various studies.\n\nThe goals described in the two summaries are completely different, with the ground truth summary highlighting the lack of conclusive evidence and the need for more research, while the generated summary presents findings supporting the efficacy and safety of certain interventions.\n\nExplanation: The ground truth summary emphasizes the inadequacy of existing evidence and the need for further research, while the generated summary presents findings supporting the effectiveness of specific interventions. These contrasting goals indicate a lack of alignment between the two summaries.\n\nSummary:\nGoal Alignment: 0"
