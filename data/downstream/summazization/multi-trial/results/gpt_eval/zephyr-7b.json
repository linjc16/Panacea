        "summary": "There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.",

        "eval": "Goal Alignment: 1\n\nThe groundtruth summary focuses on evaluating the evidence for the efficacy and safety of drug interventions, particularly urokinase and alteplase, in treating occluded central venous catheters (CVCs). The generated summary aims to summarize the findings from all seven study abstracts related to thrombolytic agents for restoring function to occluded CVCs. While the groundtruth summary is more specific in its scope, both summaries share the common goal of assessing the effectiveness of thrombolytic agents in managing occluded CVCs. Therefore, there is a partial overlap in their goals.\n\nSummary:\nGoal Alignment: 1"
