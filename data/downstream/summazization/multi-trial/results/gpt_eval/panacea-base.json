The most frequent complication reported for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is peristomal wound infection which occurs in as many as 30 % of patients. In the studies published so far, the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of peristomal wound infection has remained controversial. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of peristomal wound infection associated with PEG.\n                During a 2-year-period a total of 347 patients (251 men, 96 women; mean age 60.2+/-5) were included in our study. In all cases, a 9-French gauge Freka gastrostomy tube was inserted using the \"pull\" technique. The patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups (group 1, antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g cefotaxime; group 2, antibiotic prophylaxis with 4g piperacillin plus 0.5g tazobactam; group 3, no antibiotic prophylaxis). For a period of one week after gastrostomy, the peristomal area was evaluated using a wound score. According to the score, peristomal infections were classified as being of degree I-IV. Infections of up to degree III were regarded as minor, while an infection of degree IV was defined as a severe complication.\n                PEG tubes were successfully placed in 336/347 patients (97 %). Of the 336 patients, 29 were excluded because of incomplete follow up (dropout rate 9%). Cases included were: in group 1, n = 101; in group 2, n = 100, and in group 3, n = 106.

The general health package did not include any specific hypotensive procedures. Changes in blood pressure were measured at predetermined intervals over the course of a year. Within each group both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell to a highly significant extent after a year, but there was no significant difference between the groups.

Very few patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer can be cured. We have investigated whether a treatment to slow the growth of liver metastases, hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine, improves palliation in this setting. In a randomised study of 100 patients, we compared quality of life and survival in patients who received hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine and in those who received conventional symptom palliation. 95% of control patient survival time was spent with normal quality-of-life scores, which suggests that the aim of treatment should be to prolong normal quality survival rather than merely to sustain quality of life. There was a significant prolongation (p = 0.03) in overall survival in floxuridine-treated patients compared with controls (median 405 vs 226 days). There were similar significant prolongations in normal-quality (ie, normal symptom scores) survival for physical symptoms (p = 0.04), anxiety (p = 0.04), and depression (p = 0.04). This survival benefit was associated with significant reductions in metastasis size on computed tomography (p = 0.001) and in serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration (p = 0.006) in floxuridine-treated patients. There was no evidence of treatment-related hepatotoxicity as assessed by serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin measurements. This is the first demonstration that survival can be prolonged with normal quality of life in patients with colorectal liver metastases. We conclude that hepatic-artery floxuridine infusion can be recommended for suitable patients..\n\nStudy #3: General condition of asymptomatic patients with advanced colorectal cancer receiving palliative chemotherapy.

        "summary": "In adolescents and adults with sub-optimal control on low dose ICS monotherapy, the combination of LABA and ICS is modestly more effective in reducing the risk of exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids than a higher dose of ICS. Combination therapy also led to modestly greater improvement in lung function, symptoms and use of rescue \u00df2 agonists and to fewer withdrawals due to poor asthma control than with a higher dose of inhaled corticosteroids. Apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy, the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ICS treatment were seldom monitored. In children, combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk, of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions. These trends raised concern about the safety of combination therapy in view of modest improvement in children under the age of 12 years.",

The addition of long-acting inhaled beta(2)-agonists to a low dose of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), results in better clinical asthma control than increasing the dose of ICS. However, this approach may mask underlying airway inflammation. In a double-blind parallel-group study, we evaluated the effect of adding formoterol to a low dose of budesonide, compared with a higher dose of budesonide, on the composition of induced sputum. After a 4-wk run-in period of treatment with budesonide (800 microg, twice daily), 60 patients with moderate asthma were randomly assigned to a 1-yr treatment with 400 microg of budesonide plus placebo, twice daily (BUD800), or 100 microg of budesonide plus 12 microg of formoterol, twice daily (BUD200+F). All drugs were administered via Turbuhaler. Budesonide (800 microg, twice daily) during run-in significantly reduced median sputum eosinophils from 4.5 to 0.68%. No significant changes in the proportion of eosinophils, EG2(+) cells, other inflammatory cells, or ECP levels in sputum were observed over the ensuing 1-yr treatment with BUD200+F or BUD800. Clinical asthma control was not significantly different between both groups. In conclusion, no significant differences in sputum markers of airway inflammation were observed during a 1-yr treatment with a low dose of inhaled budesonide plus formoterol compared with a higher dose of budesonide..\n\nStudy #28: The effect of adding salmeterol to inhaled corticosteroid therapy on airway inflammation in asthma.

Epilepsy specialist nurses have the potential to improve the quality of care of community-based patients with epilepsy, although evidence of their effectiveness is limited by the lack of formal or long-term evaluation. Results of a controlled trial that assessed the effectiveness of a primary care based specialist nurse-led service suggested improvements in communication and satisfaction but not health status at one-year follow-up. A second follow-up was conducted to assess the effects after two years. Patients who reported having seen the nurse at least once in the two years ('users') were compared with those who had not ('non-users'). Comparisons between users and non-users were adjusted for baseline differences. Results were based on 40% of all 595 adult patients known to have epilepsy in 14 general practices and who answered questionnaires at baseline and two years later. The new epilepsy service was used more by those with greatest needs for care. Users of the new service were significantly more likely than non-users to have discussed 8 of 11 topics asked about epilepsy [odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 2.42 to 7.91] with their general practitioner (GP), and 2 of the 11 topics with the hospital doctor (ORs 5.59, 5. 74). Service users were significantly less likely than non-users to feel their GP knew enough about epilepsy [OR 0.27, 95% confidence intervals (CI) 0.74-0.98], and significantly more likely to report epilepsy as having an adverse impact on 3 of 10 areas of everyday life (ORs ranging from 2.09 to 2.50). Users were more likely than non-users to have seen their GP for any reason in the previous year and to change their medication from use of more than one antiepileptic drug to monotherapy, although findings were not significant. Results suggest that the epilepsy specialist nurse service is not a cost-reducing substitute, particularly for general practitioner care, but it appears to improve communication and prescribing of monotherapy, and increases access for the most needy.

However there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. As a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. Since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the CONSORT statement both in their conduct and reporting. \nThere is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. The priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients.

Despite the modest efficacy, the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to those living and working with the patient. Although insufficient data were available from the considered trials, a meta-analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the Food and Drug Administration suggested a significant increase in mortality (OR 1.7).

        "summary": "Behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among MSM. These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. \nResults of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.\nWhen effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).\nAmong small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.\nWhen effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.\nAmong community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.\nThe greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.\nFurther research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.",

        "summary": "The range of proven effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, randomised controlled trials of other medical, surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.Chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. The pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. Often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. There are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. A vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. As the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. Currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy, attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology, progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.",

In 1987 we began a multicenter controlled clinical trial of deprenyl (a monoamine oxidase inhibitor) and tocopherol (a component of vitamin E that traps free radicals) in the treatment of early Parkinson's disease. We randomly assigned 800 patients to one of four treatments: placebo, active tocopherol and deprenyl placebo, active deprenyl and tocopherol placebo, or both active drugs. The primary end point was the onset of disability prompting the clinical decision to begin administering levodopa.

The study found that the group receiving salt with 25 ppm (group A) was not iodine deficient on all indicators after 18 months of study. When the iodine content of the salt varied, such as in group B, by 18 months thyroid sizes had not yet achieved normal status.\n\nThe study found that the availability of iodinated salt containing 20 mg of iodine as iodate/kg salt consumed on a voluntary basis enabled us to investigate its effect on goitre prevalence and iodine excretion in urine in a longitudinal, prospective, randomized study over 4 years. With this salt, under the assumption of a consumption of 5 g salt per day and person, an additional intake of 100 micrograms of iodine can be achieved. The study found that the children were randomly assigned to two different groups: group A (N = 146) was asked to use iodinated salt, group B (N = 188) non-iodinated salt. Over the 4 years, a continuous increase in iodine excretion in urine could be demonstrated in group A.\n\nThe study found that the increased thyroid size in the control group was mainly a result of relative iodine deficiency and that iodoprophylaxis should be warranted even in areas with moderate iodine deficiency to prevent the increase in thyroid size and, probably, to avoid the risk of maternal and fetal hypothyroidism.\n\nThe study found that the urinary iodine excretions of women (15-40 y) and young children (< or = 6 y) from two longhouse villages in the iodine-deficient district of Lubok Antu, Sarawak, were compared. One longhouse (Mengkak) was provided with freshly produced iodized salt every two months (one kg per family) while the other (Menjiling) was provided with iodized water via fortification of the village piped-water supply.

Their knowledge, expectations, decisional conflict (the amount of uncertainty about the course of action to take), and satisfaction with the decision\u2010making process were also measured.RESULTS: More patients in the AB group made a choice about antithrombotic therapy than in the control group (99% vs 94%; P = .02).

Workers (n = 130) from eligible workplaces in the Sherbrooke area (N = 31), who had been absent from work for more than 4 weeks for back pain, were randomized, based on their workplace, in one of four treatment groups: usual care, clinical intervention, occupational intervention, and full intervention (a combination of the last two). The duration of absence from regular work and from any work was evaluated using survival analysis. Functional status and pain were compared at study entry and after 1 year of follow-up.\n                The full intervention group returned to regular work 2.41 times faster than the usual care intervention group (95% confidence interval 1.19-4.89; P < 0.01). The specific effect of the occupational intervention accounted for the most important part of this result, with a rate ratio of return to regular work of 1.91 (95% confidence interval = 1.18-3.10; P < 0.01). Pain and disability scales demonstrated either a statistically significant reduction or a trend toward reduction in the three intervention groups, compared with the trend in the usual care intervention group.\n                Close association of occupational intervention with clinical care is of primary importance in impeding progression toward chronicity of low back pain..\n\nStudy #2: Integrated case management for work-related upper-extremity disorders: impact of patient satisfaction on health and work status..

We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to December 2020. We included RCTs that compared iNO with placebo or standard care in patients with ARDS. We extracted data on patient characteristics, treatment outcomes, and adverse events.\nWe included 11 RCTs that enrolled a total of 1,190 patients with ARDS. The pooled analysis showed that iNO did not significantly improve the mortality rate compared with placebo or standard care (risk ratio [RR] 0.94, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.82 to 1.08, p=0.34). However, iNO significantly improved the oxygenation index (mean difference 10.04, 95% CI 6.00 to 14.08, p<0.001) and the PaO2/FiO2 ratio (mean difference 30.00, 95% CI 15.00 to 45.00, p<0.001) compared with placebo or standard care.

Study casts were assessed at the start, and after 6, 12, and 18 months of treatment/observation. The inclination of the upper and lower incisors was measured on lateral cephalometric radiographs taken at the start and 18 months later. There was wide variation in treatment response.

Cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing UTIs in three small studies. Given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing UTI is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of UTIs.

Isometric lower\u2010extremity force, 6\u2010minute\u2010walk distance, free gait speed, mental status, and physical function were measured. Each exercise session was supervised by a physical therapist, and subjects received 20 visits over 12 weeks. The control group received biweekly mailings. The resistance training group performed 3 sets of 8 repetitions at the 8\u2010repetition maximum intensity using a portable progressive resistance exercise machine. The aerobic training group performed activities that increased heart rate 65% to 75% of their age\u2010predicted maximum for 20 continuous minutes.RESULTS: Resistance and aerobic training were performed without apparent adverse effects, and adherence was 98%. All groups improved in distance walked, force produced, gait speed, and physical function. Isometric force improved to a greater extent in the intervention groups than in the control group. Depressive symptoms interacted with treatment group in explaining the outcomes of 6\u2010minute\u2010walk distance and gait speed.CONCLUSIONS: High\u2010intensity exercise performed in the home is feasible for people with hip fracture. Larger sample sizes may be necessary to determine whether the exercise regimen is effective in reducing impairments and improving function.

        "summary": "Although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. The efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics; both oral and depot. Furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. One of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. It is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. An additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low-cost intervention.\nNote: the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.",

A controlled study.. The clinical promise of penfluridol as a long-acting oral antipsychotic medication has led to a number of controlled studies designed to verify its usefulness. These studies have been reviewed and compared with a controlled study carried out by the authors. The data obtained from this study have tended to confirm the impression of previous investigators that penfluridol, administered in a dosage of 40 to 80 mg on a once-a-week basis in a single dose, compares favorably with the antipsychotic activity of those neuroleptics requiring administration on a daily basis..\n\nStudy #3: A twelve month comparison of penfluridol and trifluoperazine in chronic schizophrenic outpatients.. This investigation is a 52-week double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of penfluridol and trifluoperazine in 25 chronic schizophrenic outpatients. Penfluridol was administered once weekly and trifluoperazine daily. Measurements were made at baseline, various fixed intervals during the study period and termination. The data reveals that both agents were similarly effective in maintaining control of the symptoms of chronic schizophrenic patients at a level commensurate with or better than that provided by their previous medication. Besides being effective, medications were also well tolerated. The side effects were characteristic of marketed neuroleptics. Akathisia was more common with penfluridol but readily controlled with anti-parkinsonian medication. Other side effects were similar in severity and occurrence between study-drug groups.

Non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent, blinded outcome assessment, which was not the case in the excluded studies.

A double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 229 patients with a Research Diagnostic Criteria diagnosis of major, minor or intermittent depression was used to compare the clinical profiles of venlafaxine and imipramine in general practice. Venlafaxine produced a significant improvement compared to placebo in symptoms of depression and anxiety as rated by the total MADRS and percentage of responders, the CGI improvement, the CGI severity of illness, the BSA psychic anxiety item and the HSCL. On a number of these measures, venlafaxine was also significantly more effective than imipramine. Venlafaxine was significantly superior to both imipramine and placebo for the SARS total score and the items 'social/leisure' and 'extended family.' A similar proportion of patients discontinued treatment in each group, but fewer patients on venlafaxine discontinued treatment because of an unsatisfactory response..\n\nStudy #3: Escitalopram (10-20 mg/day) is effective and well tolerated in a placebo-controlled study in depression in primary care.. Escitalopram was compared to placebo in moderately to severely depressed patients in primary care with citalopram as the active reference.

In individual patients, it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. In practical terms, even if PQ results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria, there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community, where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated.\u00a0Since PQ is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes, there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. In terms of harms, there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where G6PD deficiency occurs.\nIn light of these doubts about safety, and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission, countries should question whether to continue to use PQ routinely in primary treatment of malaria.

        "summary": "There is not enough evidence to recommend any intervention for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy, due to the significant methodological limitations of included studies and the small observed effect sizes. More high-quality randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are required to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of a low-fat diet on pregnancy outcomes in obese women. Methods: A total of 100 obese women were randomly assigned to either a low-fat diet group (n = 50) or a control group (n = 50). The low-fat diet group was instructed to consume a low-fat diet (< 30% of total energy intake from fat) and to limit their energy intake to 30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight per day. The control group was instructed to consume a normal diet. The primary outcome was the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of preeclampsia, the incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, and the incidence of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. Results: The incidence of GDM was significantly lower in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 24%, P = 0.04). The incidence of LGA infants was significantly lower in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 24%, P = 0.04). The incidence of SGA infants was significantly higher in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 2%, P = 0.04). Conclusions: A low-fat diet during pregnancy may reduce the incidence of GDM and LGA infants in obese women. However, it may also increase the incidence of SGA infants.\n\nStudy #29: Effects of a low-fat diet on pregnancy outcomes in obese women: a randomized controlled trial.\nBackground: Obesity is associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.
