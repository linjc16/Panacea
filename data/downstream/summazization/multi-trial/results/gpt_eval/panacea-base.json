        "summary": "There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.",
        "model_output": "The key findings from the provided abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question are summarized as follows:\n\n1. Alfimeprase, a novel-acting fibrin degradation agent, was found to be more successful than alteplase in restoring patency to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs) in a phase II trial. Alfimeprase 3.0 mg produced the highest patency rate at 120 minutes after the first (60%) and second (80%) doses.\n\n2. Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was found to be superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs in a phase III trial. The primary efficacy variable was the restoration of catheter function to all treated lumens (i.e., total catheter patency) after one or two instillations.\n\n3. Urokinase was found to be superior to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) in thrombosed central venous catheters in a double-blinded, randomized trial. Urokinase restored catheter function more reliably and dissolved thrombi faster than t-PA.\n\n4. Recombinant urokinase (r-UK) was found to be superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs in a phase III trial. The primary efficacy variable was the restoration of catheter function to all treated lumens (i.e., total catheter patency) after one or two instillations.\n\n5.

The primary efficacy variable was the restoration of catheter function to all treated lumens (i.e., total catheter patency) after one or two instillations.\n\n6.

        "eval": "Goal Alignment:\nScore: 0\n\nThe groundtruth summary and the generated summary have completely different goals. The groundtruth summary discusses the lack of strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of drug interventions for treating central venous catheter (CVC) lumen occlusion and the need for further high-quality research. On the other hand, the generated summary focuses on summarizing the findings of specific clinical trials related to the efficacy of various drug interventions, such as urokinase, alteplase, and alfimeprase, in restoring patency to occluded CVCs.\n\nSummary:\nGoal Alignment: 0"
