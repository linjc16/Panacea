The most frequent complication reported for percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is peristomal wound infection which occurs in as many as 30 % of patients. In the studies published so far, the question of whether antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the incidence of peristomal wound infection has remained controversial. We therefore conducted a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether antibiotic prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of peristomal wound infection associated with PEG.\n                During a 2-year-period a total of 347 patients (251 men, 96 women; mean age 60.2+/-5) were included in our study. In all cases, a 9-French gauge Freka gastrostomy tube was inserted using the \"pull\" technique. The patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment groups (group 1, antibiotic prophylaxis with 2 g cefotaxime; group 2, antibiotic prophylaxis with 4g piperacillin plus 0.5g tazobactam; group 3, no antibiotic prophylaxis). For a period of one week after gastrostomy, the peristomal area was evaluated using a wound score. According to the score, peristomal infections were classified as being of degree I-IV. Infections of up to degree III were regarded as minor, while an infection of degree IV was defined as a severe complication.\n                PEG tubes were successfully placed in 336/347 patients (97 %). Of the 336 patients, 29 were excluded because of incomplete follow up (dropout rate 9%). Cases included were: in group 1, n = 101; in group 2, n = 100, and in group 3, n = 106.

The general health package did not include any specific hypotensive procedures. Changes in blood pressure were measured at predetermined intervals over the course of a year. Within each group both systolic and diastolic blood pressure fell to a highly significant extent after a year, but there was no significant difference between the groups.

The twin-bag system also has a lower purchase cost than the single-bag system, which may contribute to its greater monetary purchase cost. However, the total cost of infection is lower with the twin-bag system than the single-bag system, which offsets the higher purchase cost.\nThe findings from the provided abstracts also suggest that the use of Y-set disconnect systems for CAPD is associated with a lower rate of peritonitis than conventional spike systems. This is likely due to the reduced risk of contamination during the exchange process. The Y-set system also has a lower cost per bag than the conventional spike system, which may contribute to its greater monetary purchase cost. However, the total cost of treatment (pesos/patient/year) is lower with the Y-set system than the conventional spike system, due to the lower peritonitis incidence and associated hospitalizations.\nOverall, the findings from the provided abstracts suggest that the use of twin-bag and Y-set disconnect systems for CAPD is associated with a lower rate of peritonitis and a lower cost of treatment.

Very few patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer can be cured. We have investigated whether a treatment to slow the growth of liver metastases, hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine, improves palliation in this setting. In a randomised study of 100 patients, we compared quality of life and survival in patients who received hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine and in those who received conventional symptom palliation. 95% of control patient survival time was spent with normal quality-of-life scores, which suggests that the aim of treatment should be to prolong normal quality survival rather than merely to sustain quality of life. There was a significant prolongation (p = 0.03) in overall survival in floxuridine-treated patients compared with controls (median 405 vs 226 days). There were similar significant prolongations in normal-quality (ie, normal symptom scores) survival for physical symptoms (p = 0.04), anxiety (p = 0.04), and depression (p = 0.04). This survival benefit was associated with significant reductions in metastasis size on computed tomography (p = 0.001) and in serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration (p = 0.006) in floxuridine-treated patients.

Data do not show differences also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. Duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. It should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. These interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.",

Apart from an increased rate of tremor and less oral candidiasis with combination therapy, the two options appear relatively safe in adults although adverse effects associated with long-term ICS treatment were seldom monitored. In children, combination therapy did not lead to a significant reduction, but rather a trend towards an increased risk, of oral steroid-treated exacerbations and hospital admissions.

Time to return to work and to complete healing were recorded. To evaluate quality of life and patient comfort, all patients were asked to complete a questionnaire including short form 36, Visual Analogue Scale, time to sitting on toilet without pain, and time to walking without pain 3 months after surgery.RESULTS: Each group was composed of 50 patients. Mean follow\u2010up was 19 months. There was a significant difference between the groups in terms of length of hospital stay (P = .005), time to complete healing (P < .001), time off work (P < .001), and wound infection rate (P = .03).

However there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. As a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. Since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the CONSORT statement both in their conduct and reporting. \nThere is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. The priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients.

The Web\u2010based weight loss program consisted of 12 weekly lessons, a personalized weight loss plan, and a personalized dietary plan. The control group received a booklet on weight loss.

        "summary": "Behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among MSM. These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. \nResults of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.\nWhen effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).\nAmong small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.\nWhen effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.\nAmong community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.\nThe greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.\nFurther research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.",

Given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, randomised controlled trials of other medical, surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.Chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. The pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. Often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. There are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. A vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. As the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. Currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy, attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology, progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.",

We randomly assigned 800 patients to one of four treatments: placebo, active tocopherol and deprenyl placebo, active deprenyl and tocopherol placebo, or both active drugs. The primary end point was the onset of disability prompting the clinical decision to begin administering levodopa.

Their knowledge, expectations, decisional conflict (the amount of uncertainty about the course of action to take), and satisfaction with the decision\u2010making process were also measured.RESULTS: More patients in the AB group made a choice about antithrombotic therapy than in the control group (99% vs 94%; P = .02). Patients in the AB group were more knowledgeable and had more realistic expectations about the risk of stroke and hemorrhage (in the AB group, 53%\u201080% correctly estimated different risks; in the control group, 16%\u201028% gave correct estimates). Decisional conflict and satisfaction were similar for the 2 groups. After 6 months, a similar percentage of patients were still taking their initial choice of antithrombotic therapy (95% vs 93%; P = .44).CONCLUSIONS: For patients with atrial fibrillation who had participated in a major clinical trial, the use of an AB decision aid improved their understanding of the benefits and risks associated with",

These studies also report a significant improvement in lung function and a reduction in symptoms. However, the studies that report no significant difference in steroid requirements typically use a lower dosage of methotrexate (15 mg/week) and a shorter duration of treatment (12 weeks).\n\nThe studies that report a significant reduction in steroid requirements also report a higher incidence of adverse events, such as nausea, vomiting, and liver function abnormalities. These adverse events are typically mild and transient, but they can be severe in some cases.\n\nOverall, the evidence suggests that methotrexate may have a steroid-sparing effect in patients with severe asthma, but the efficacy and safety of methotrexate treatment vary depending on the dosage, duration of treatment, and patient population.

Isometric lower\u2010extremity force, 6\u2010minute\u2010walk distance, free gait speed, mental status, and physical function were measured. Each exercise session was supervised by a physical therapist, and subjects received 20 visits over 12 weeks. The control group received biweekly mailings. The resistance training group performed 3 sets of 8 repetitions at the 8\u2010repetition maximum intensity using a portable progressive resistance exercise machine. The aerobic training group performed activities that increased heart rate 65% to 75% of their age\u2010predicted maximum for 20 continuous minutes.RESULTS: Resistance and aerobic training were performed without apparent adverse effects, and adherence was 98%. All groups improved in distance walked, force produced, gait speed, and physical function. Isometric force improved to a greater extent in the intervention groups than in the control group. Depressive symptoms interacted with treatment group in explaining the outcomes of 6\u2010minute\u2010walk distance and gait speed.CONCLUSIONS: High\u2010intensity exercise performed in the home is feasible for people with hip fracture.

Patients on 2 and 4 g/day E-E showed significant reductions in triglyceride levels which had been elevated by clozapine.

The data obtained from this study have tended to confirm the impression of previous investigators that penfluridol, administered in a dosage of 40 to 80 mg on a once-a-week basis in a single dose, compares favorably with the antipsychotic activity of those neuroleptics requiring administration on a daily basis..\n\nStudy #3: A twelve month comparison of penfluridol and trifluoperazine in chronic schizophrenic outpatients.. This investigation is a 52-week double-blind study comparing the efficacy and safety of penfluridol and trifluoperazine in 25 chronic schizophrenic outpatients.

        "summary": "Cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events, cannot be ruled out.\n\nFuture trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support.

Methods: A total of 100 obese women were randomly assigned to either a low-fat diet group (n = 50) or a control group (n = 50). The low-fat diet group was instructed to consume a low-fat diet (< 30% of total energy intake from fat) and to limit their energy intake to 30 kcal/kg of ideal body weight per day. The control group was instructed to consume a normal diet. The primary outcome was the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Secondary outcomes were the incidence of preeclampsia, the incidence of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, and the incidence of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. Results: The incidence of GDM was significantly lower in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 24%, P = 0.04). The incidence of LGA infants was significantly lower in the low-fat diet group than in the control group (12% vs. 24%, P = 0.04).
