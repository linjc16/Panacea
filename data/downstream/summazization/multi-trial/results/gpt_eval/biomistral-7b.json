        "summary": "There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.",

The studies are related to the use of thrombolytic agents for restoring patency to occluded central venous access devices. The studies are randomized controlled trials that compare the efficacy and safety of different thrombolytic agents. The studies are phase II or phase III trials.

        "eval": "Goal Alignment:\nScore: 0\n\nThe groundtruth summary discusses the lack of strong evidence for the efficacy and safety of drug interventions for treating central venous catheter (CVC) lumen occlusion, and the need for further high-quality research in this area, especially in pediatric populations. On the other hand, the generated summary does not provide any evaluation or conclusion about the evidence or the need for further research. Instead, it merely lists repetitive statements about the studies being related to the use of thrombolytic agents in various patient populations and settings, without any meaningful insight or summary.\n\nTherefore, the goals described in the two summaries are completely different, with no overlap or similarity.\n\nSummary:\nGoal Alignment: 0"
