        "summary": "Behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among MSM. These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. \nResults of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.\nWhen effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).\nAmong small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.\nWhen effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.\nAmong community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.\nThe greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.\nFurther research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.",

The pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. Often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. There are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. A vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. As the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief.

The studies were conducted in the United States and included a total of 2382 men and women aged 30-54 years. The interventions included counseling aimed at promoting weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and their combination. The interventions were found to be effective in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the short-term (6 months), with weight loss and sodium reduction interventions resulting in a decrease in blood pressure of 3.7/2.7 mm Hg and 2.9/1.6 mm Hg, respectively. The effects on average blood pressure declined over time, but the interventions were found to be effective in reducing the incidence of hypertension. The incidence of hypertension was significantly lower in each active intervention group than the usual care group, with relative risks ranging from 0.78 to 0.82. The studies also found that a switch from regular salt to potassium-enriched salt was associated with a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and medical expenditures in elderly veterans. A randomized controlled trial of nonpharmacologic interventions in the elderly found that weight loss and reduced sodium intake were effective in the treatment of older persons with hypertension. The combined outcome measure was less frequent among those assigned vs not assigned to reduced sodium intake (relative hazard ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.81; P<.001) and, in obese participants, among those assigned vs not assigned to weight loss (relative hazard ratio, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.57-0.85; P=.002). The effects of nonpharmacologic interventions on blood pressure of persons with high normal levels were also studied. The results showed that weight reduction intervention produced weight loss of 3.9 kg, diastolic blood pressure change of -2.3 mm Hg, and systolic blood pressure change of -2.9 mm Hg. Sodium reduction interventions lowered urinary sodium excretion by 44 mmol",

        "summary": "Cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. Varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. Lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. More participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. Two open-label trials of varenicline versus NRT suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. Limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. The main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. Possible links with serious adverse events, including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events, cannot be ruled out.\n\nFuture trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. There is a need for further trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 weeks.",
        "model_output": "[/INST] Varenicline is a partial agonist of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and is used for smoking cessation. It is more selective for the alpha4beta2 subtype of nAChRs, which are thought to be involved in the reinforcing effects of nicotine. Varenicline has been shown to be effective in helping smokers quit in several clinical trials. It has been approved for use in many countries, including the United States, Canada, Australia, and the European Union. Varenicline is typically taken once or twice a day, and it is available in both immediate-release and extended-release forms. It is generally well tolerated, with common side effects including nausea, insomnia, and abnormal dreams.",
