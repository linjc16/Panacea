These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. \nResults of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.\nWhen effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).\nAmong small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.\nWhen effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.\nAmong community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.\nThe greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.\nFurther research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.",

The most expensive and ineffective way of treating STD was by not providing drugs. Integrated peer education, condom distribution, and syndromic STI management did not reduce population-level HIV-1 incidence in a declining epidemic, despite reducing HIV-1 incidence in the immediate male target group. Improving access to nonbarrier contraceptives among couples already using condoms for HIV prevention increased dual-method use. The use of an unobtrusive referral message that linked family planning and the Expanded Program of Immunizations (EPI) services was tested in an operations research study in Togo, and the introduction of the referral message was accompanied by an 18-percent increase in awareness of available family planning services and an increase in the average monthly number of new family planning clients of 54 percent.",

Furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. To help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. Because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials.

Moreover, these analyses only represent a highly selected population. The primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement, as noted by the manufacturers and distributors, was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. Unfortunately, evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias, while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. Non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent, blinded outcome assessment, which was not the case in the excluded studies. Therefore, because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years, we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale, despite the fact that total disc replacement seems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients, and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery.",

        "summary": "There is not enough evidence to recommend any intervention for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy, due to the significant methodological limitations of included studies and the small observed effect sizes. More high-quality randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are required to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting up to 14% of pregnancies. It is associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and the baby. The risk of GDM is increased in women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy.\n\nThe management of GDM involves dietary modification and exercise. However, there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of these interventions.\n\nThe aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of dietary modification and exercise in preventing GDM in women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy.\n\nThe review included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,500 women. The trials were of moderate to high quality.\n\nThe results of the review showed that dietary modification and exercise were effective in preventing GDM in women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy.\n\nThe review also showed that dietary modification and exercise were effective in preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy.\n\nThe review found no evidence of adverse effects of dietary modification and exercise on the mother or the baby.\n\nThe review suggests that dietary modification and exercise should be recommended to women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy to prevent GDM and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.\n\nThe review also suggests that further research is needed to determine the optimal type and intensity of dietary modification and exercise for preventing GDM and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.",
