        "summary": "There is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. There is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 mL that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of CVC lumens caused by thrombosis. Further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating CVC lumen occlusion. Research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nThe studies suggest that alteplase and urokinase are effective in restoring function to occluded central venous access devices. Alteplase is more effective than urokinase in restoring function to occluded central venous access devices. The studies also suggest that alteplase is safe and well-tolerated in patients with occluded central venous access devices.",
        "eval": "Goal Alignment:\nScore: 0\n\nThe goals described in the ground truth summary and the generated summary are completely different. The ground truth summary states that there is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions, and that further high-quality research is required. In contrast, the generated summary claims that the studies suggest that alteplase and urokinase are effective and safe in restoring function to occluded central venous access devices, which contradicts the ground truth summary.\n\nSummary of scores:\nGoal Alignment: 0"
