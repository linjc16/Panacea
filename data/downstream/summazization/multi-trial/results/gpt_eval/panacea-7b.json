Symptoms of PTSD can include flashbacks, nightmares, and avoidance of situations that remind the person of the traumatic event.

        "summary": "GTR has a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. However there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. As a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of GTR. Whilst there is evidence that GTR can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. Since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the CONSORT statement both in their conduct and reporting. \nThere is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. The priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. Types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials, qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling.

These results indicate that HIV prevention for this population can work and should be supported. \nResults of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. Meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content.\nWhen effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. Researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month).\nAmong small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no HIV prevention content. Nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other HIV prevention content. Researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above.\nWhen effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. Because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. Extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions.\nAmong community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. Therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. The greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying MSM suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. Non-gay identified MSM may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact.\nThe greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for MSM. And the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for MSM of African and Latino descent.\nFurther research measuring the incidence of HIV and other STDs is needed. Because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the US and Europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for African American and Hispanic MSM as well as MSM in the developing world. More research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among MSM, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.",

        "summary": "There is not enough evidence to recommend any intervention for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy, due to the significant methodological limitations of included studies and the small observed effect sizes. More high-quality randomised controlled trials with adequate sample sizes are required to evaluate the effectiveness of potential interventions.",
        "model_output": "<|assistant|>\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting up to 14% of pregnancies. It is associated with adverse outcomes for both the mother and the baby. The risk of GDM is increased in women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy.\n\nThe management of GDM involves dietary modification and exercise. However, there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of these interventions.\n\nThe aim of this review was to assess the effectiveness of dietary modification and exercise in preventing GDM in women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy.\n\nThe review included 11 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) involving 1,500 women. The trials were of moderate to high quality.\n\nThe results of the review showed that dietary modification and exercise were effective in preventing GDM in women who were overweight or obese before pregnancy.\n\nThe review also showed that dietary modification and exercise were effective in preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy.\n\nThe review found no evidence of adverse effects of dietary modification and exercise on the mother or the baby.\n\nThe review suggests that dietary modification and exercise should be recommended to women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy to prevent GDM and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.\n\nThe review also suggests that further research is needed to determine the optimal type and intensity of dietary modification and exercise for preventing GDM and excessive weight gain during pregnancy.",
        "eval": "Goal Alignment: 0\n\nThe groundtruth summary discusses the lack of evidence for interventions to prevent excessive weight gain during pregnancy, while the generated summary focuses on the effectiveness of dietary modification and exercise in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and excessive weight gain during pregnancy. The goals described in the two summaries are completely different, with no overlap or similarity.\n\nExplanation: The groundtruth summary concludes that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any intervention for preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy due to methodological limitations and small effect sizes in the included studies. In contrast, the generated summary suggests that dietary modification and exercise are effective interventions for preventing GDM and excessive weight gain during pregnancy, based on the findings of the included randomized controlled trials. The goals of the two summaries are fundamentally different, with one highlighting the lack of evidence and the other advocating for specific interventions."
