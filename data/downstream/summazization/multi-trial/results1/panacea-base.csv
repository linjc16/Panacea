0,"The synthesis and integration of the study findings demonstrates that thrombolytics are effective in clearing occluded central venous access devices. The evidence supports the use of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA) as the preferred thrombolytic agent due to its superior efficacy and safety profile compared to other agents like urokinase. Additionally, the study findings suggest that the efficacy of r-tPA may be improved with higher doses and shorter time periods for dwell time, which indicates that future studies should explore these variables further. The impact of thrombolytic use in clearing occluded central venous access devices may result in improved patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs, making it an important area of research and clinical practice."
1,"1) We did a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to compare the effect of prophylaxis with a single dose of co-amoxiclav before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy with standard treatment without prophylaxis.
2) In 97 patients included into the analysis, the incidence of peristomal wound infections and other infections within one week after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy was significantly reduced in the antibiotic group (8/41 (20%) v 28/43 (65%), P < 0.001).
3) Similar results were obtained in an intention to treat analysis.
4) Antibiotic prophylaxis had a marked effect also in subgroups of high-risk patients and it was well tolerated.
5) Taking into account the considerable size of the placebo group (43 cases) and all results of the study together, antibiotic prophylaxis with co-amoxiclav before percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is likely to result in a clinically relevant reduction in the risk of infectious complications.
6) Antibiotic prophylaxis, therefore, is recommended as a general measure in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy.

Study #12: Prospective, randomized, double masked study comparing percutaneous gastrostomy using coated versus non-coated catheters in terms of peristomal infection rates.
Abstract:
OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of plain and coated gastrostomy tubes in preventing peristomal infections.METHODS: Ninety‐three patients received percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomies with either coated or plain gastrostomy tubes. In both arms, patient characteristics and outcome data were prospectively collected.RESULTS: The coated gastrostomy tube group had significantly lower peristomal infection rates than the non‐coated gastrostomy tube group, including peristomal infection rate at day 7, overall peristomal infection rate and peristomal infection related to hospital admission or discharge (P < 0.05).

4,"There are currently no pharmacological agents approved for the treatment of borderline personality disorder (BPD). It is clear that the existing medications have little effect on the primary symptoms of BPD; these include mood instability, identity disturbance, feelings of emptiness, interpersonal relationship problems, poor impulse control, self-harm, and transient paranoid ideas. Therefore, no current medication is an ideal agent for the treatment of BPD. A number of novel pharmacological agents have recently been introduced into clinical trials in the United States and other parts of the world.

Follow-up was scheduled until amputation, death or at most 5 years, whichever event occurred first. Information was available for 345 of 352 randomised patients (98%). At 3 years, primary patency was 26% (95% confidence interval (CI) 18-38) with a vein collar and 43 (33-58) without a vein collar for femoro-popliteal bypass and 20 (11-38), and 17 (9-33) for femoro-distal bypass, respectively. The corresponding figures for limb salvage were 64 (54-75) and 61 (50-74) for femoro-popliteal bypass, and 59 (46-76) and 44 (32-61) for femoro-distal bypass with and without a vein collar, respectively. Log-rank-test for the whole Kaplan-Meier life table curve showed no statistically significant differences with or without vein collar primary patency: p = 0.0853, p = 0.228; secondary patency: p = 0.317, p = 0.280; limb salvage: p = 0.757, p = 0.187 for FemPopBK and FemDist, respectively. The use of a vein collar did not influence patency or limb salvage.

Introduction
-----------------
Acupuncture, a key component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), originates from China and some neighboring countries. The earliest documented writings on acupuncture were found in the literature of the Chinese ancient civilization. In ancient China, acupuncture was initially used for the treatment of the injured and later became more popular in the treatment of diseases. Recently, the worldwide development of acupuncture has drawn increasing attentions from the scientific community. Acupuncture has been reported to be effective for the treatment or amelioration of acute and chronic diseases. Acupuncture also holds its own against western medicine for treatment of some diseases and has become a main part of the health-care system in many countries.
Acute stroke is the second leading cause of death in China. More than 90% of the patients are discharged from hospital, but over 60% of them are permanent bedridden after hospital discharge. Many patients spend most of the rest of their lives trying to recover from stroke (8). Stroke is one of the most common illnesses in elderly people. Therefore, the use of acupuncture for the treatment of acute stroke has attracted a great deal of attention recently.
A growing body of evidence supports the use of acupuncture for the treatment of acute stroke patients. Numerous systematic reviews with meta-analyses have shown that manual acupuncture plus other rehabilitation treatments had more significant positive functional recovery effect than the control groups (involving only other standard rehabilitative processes) at the end of treatment (10-16). Besides the clinical effect of acupuncture, its safety has also"
8,"Study #1: Experimental comparison of the effectivity of individually adapted and standardized dosages of haloperidol.. The study findings demonstrated that haloperidol for the treatment of schizophrenia had a similar outcome when used with fixed initial dosages and individualized and adapted treatment plans. Despite the limited number of participants in the study and the fact that fixed dosages were used at the beginning of treatment in both groups, there was no superiority demonstrated between the two treatment approaches. However, the results indicated a trend towards better outcomes in the group treated with fixed dosages. It is also noteworthy that haloperidol was able to effectively treat acute schizophrenia symptoms (according to the BPRS score) in both groups with no significant adverse effects reported. These findings suggest that haloperidol may be a useful therapeutic agent in the treatment of schizophrenia with various treatment approaches, such as fixed dosage and individualized dosage adjustment, providing satisfactory results and low burden of side effects. However, larger studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to confirm the results of this study and better define the role of haloperidol in the treatment of schizophrenia.
Study #2: Haloperidol for acute schizophrenic patients. An evaluation of three oral regimens.. The findings of this study showed that the 3 dosage regimens of haloperidol resulted in similar responses for the treatment of acute schizophrenia symptoms, with no significant differences observed between them. This implies that haloperidol may be an effective medication for the symptomatic treatment of schizophrenia, regardless of the dosage used. The results also suggest that the standardized dosage of 10 mg haloperidol daily may be as effective as the higher dosages of 20 mg and 100 mg daily, in the acute treatment phase of the disease. Moreover, the study found that increasing the dosage of haloperidol did not significantly increase the likelihood of improved responses, which could be due to the limited sample size of the study or other reasons. Thus, based on these results, it is recommended that the standardized dosage of 10 mg haloperidol daily should be the first choice for the treatment of acute schizophrenia symptoms, unless there is a specific indication for"
9,"The studies suggest that prophylactic use of anti-influenza agents such as zanamivir and oseltamivir is effective in preventing the spread of influenza within households and communities. Early treatment of influenza within households is particularly important, as it can help reduce the duration and severity of illness and prevent further spread of the virus. While there is some variation in the effectiveness of different treatments based on factors such as age, influenza subtype, and the timing of treatment, these studies consistently demonstrate the potential benefits of using anti-influenza agents in managing outbreaks of influenza.
While these studies provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of anti-influenza agents, it is important to note that their findings may not be directly applicable to all healthcare settings and populations. There is a need for further research to evaluate the efficacy of these drugs in different geographic regions, age groups, and patient populations. Additionally, ongoing monitoring of anti-influenza drug resistance is essential to ensure that these drugs remain effective against emerging influenza strains."

INTRODUCTION
Urinary incontinence is one of the most prevalent problems faced by both women and men. One of the most important factors determining bladder function is the bladder outlet resistance. With ageing changes occur in the female pelvic floor muscles and in the vagina. These changes cause a reduction in the bladder outlet resistance, resulting in urinary incontinence.
Apart from urinary incontinence, another important complaint with a negative impact on quality of life concerns voiding disorders, particularly stress urinary incontinence. Surgical treatment of urinary incontinence, such as anterior colporrhaphy, is frequently used in current practice, and the results and complications of surgery should be studied carefully.1
A randomised controlled trial was conducted to determine whether prolonged catheterisation after vaginal prolapse surgery could result in fewer urinary tract infection and stress urinary incontinence.
Patients and methods
The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee at the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam (registration number, MEC 05-127). Each patient received written information and verbal explanation about the study. All patients provided written informed consent. All eligible patients were treated in the gynaecology department within the Department of OB/GYN at the Academic Medical Centre in Amsterdam between 20 March 2006 and 2 June 2006.
There were no exclusion criteria. All patients were referred to the researcher by the gynaecologist. Inclusion criteria were:
… Aged 18 years or over.
… Suffering from urinary incontinence attributed to stress incontinence.
… Indication for anterior colporrhaphy.
… A willingness to undergo anterior colporrhaphy.
… An ability to communicate coherently.
A total of 100 women met the inclusion criteria. Of these, two patients were excluded from the study and eight patients refused to enter the study. Of the remaining 90 patients, one patient from the control group refused to undergo surgery and was excluded from the study.

After surgery, every patient received verbal and written explanations concerning bladder care by the researcher. Patients were"
11,"The studies suggest that dexamethasone is effective in reducing inflammation after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), as evidenced by its ability to decrease levels of interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and complement component C3a and to modulate the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). These findings are consistent with previous studies in pediatric patients.

Dexamethasone administration prior to CPB reduces the inflammatory response associated with the bypass procedure. It modulates the post-CPB inflammatory response as assessed by decreased SIRS and improved postoperative clinical course. The use of dexamethasone reduced complement component C3a, IL-6, and TNF-alpha levels after CPB.

The decrease in inflammatory mediators observed in patients treated with dexamethasone may explain why this medication improved postoperative clinical course, including lower body temperature, reduced fluid requirements during the first 48 hours, and lower alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient during the first 24 hours postoperatively. However, the differences were not statistically significant in the study by Nugent et al. The clinical significance of these changes warrants further investigation.

Interpret the Summary: 
The study abstracts provide evidence that dexamethasone, a potent anti-inflammatory agent, reduces the postoperative inflammatory response in pediatric patients undergoing CPB. The use of dexamethasone before CPB is found to significantly decrease inflammatory mediator levels, including IL-6, TNF-alpha, and C3a, postoperatively.

This finding suggests that dexamethasone may improve the postoperative clinical course by attenuating the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Moreover, it reduces the complement component C3a, a potent marker of inflammation.

The studies by Nugent et al. and Tufekcioğlu et al. were inconclusive about the influence of dexamethasone treatment prior to CPB on cytokine levels and clinical course. However, the study by Cemerim et al. found no significant difference between high"

Based on the above references, we have seen a strong difference in the use of high-frequency ventilation. For example, study #2 showed that the use of high-frequency ventilation (HFV) could reduce the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and improve the oxygenation and ventilation of premature infants. However, study #3 pointed out that the use of HFV in the treatment of premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) increases the occurrence of adverse neurological outcomes.
Study #2 compared the outcomes of HFV and conventional ventilation (CV) in infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). It concluded that HFV could reduce the incidence of BPD, but did not increase the risk of adverse neurological outcomes. In contrast, study #3 found that despite similar demographic characteristics, the use of HFV in the early management of premature infants with RDS was associated with a significantly higher risk of adverse neurological outcomes.
In addition, study #3 noted that the presence of hypocarbia was not an independently significant predictor of adverse outcomes. However, it found that HFJV was a significant independent predictor of cystic periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) and poor outcome.
We observed that HFV is a high-frequency and low-volume ventilation method that has been widely used in newborns. It can provide better oxygenation and ventilation by reducing the stress on the lungs and airways. However, it may also increase the risk of adverse neurological outcomes due to the lack of adequate carbon dioxide removal. This may be related to the fact that HFV can cause alkalosis, which can increase the risk of intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and other neurological complications.
We also found that HFV is commonly used for early RDS management. It can provide better oxygenation and ventilation, but it also increases the risk of adverse outcomes. In contrast, CV is a conventional ventilation method that can provide adequate oxygenation and ventilation with lower risks of adverse outcomes.
Based on these findings, we concluded that HFV is a safe and effective ventilation method for prem"

Study Overview
Brief Summary
-----------------
Family planning services have improved knowledge and access to contraceptives nationwide and thus helped achieve population stabilization in Pakistan, but there's need for research to study the effectiveness of the Family Planning Program, especially in the rural areas of the country. This study's objective is to investigate the impact of a family planning program offered in rural areas of Pakistan to determine whether the program is efficacious and whether any other factors can contribute to increased use of contraceptives.

Detailed Description
-----------------
There are 12 different contraceptive methods recommended by the Ministry of Health for Pakistan. The effectiveness of these methods in preventing pregnancies is measured by their typical or standard use; these rates help determine the amount of unwanted pregnancies in Pakistan. From past research on contraceptive usage and methods in the Punjab region of Pakistan, which accounts for almost 60% of the total population, we have estimated the typical use rate of contraceptives for this study to be 90% . Family planning programs have been active in all urban and most of the more populated rural areas of Pakistan . The programs use a health care delivery system that integrates primary health care with family planning services. The primary health care clinics are located in community centers, schools, dispensaries, and outpatient sections of hospitals throughout the country. The study area of this project is Muzaffarnagar, a district in the Punjab that is located between the cities of Lahore and Islamabad. The district is largely agricultural in nature, consisting mostly of farmlands, and has a literacy rate of 41% and a population density of 400 persons per square kilometer, a large percentage of which are rural residents. The average number of children per married woman is 3.5. The current total population of the district is 2.4 million people, with an annual growth rate of 2.5%. The district currently has 55 dispensaries and health facilities but only three facilities are currently offering family planning services. The study is designed to assess whether the family planning program initiated in Muzaffarnagar during 2007 is efficacious in increasing contraceptive usage throughout the target community. Additionally, it will also focus on barriers against uptake of reversible methods. Approximately"

Study #2: Prospectively randomized controlled trial of PGS in IVF/ICSI patients with poor implantation.. This randomized, controlled trial verifies whether patients with recurrent failed implantation benefit from preimplantation genetic diagnosis for aneuploidy, as compared with conventional assisted reproduction treatment procedures. Two hundred patients with recurrent failed implantation were randomized into two groups. A total of 139 patients underwent ovarian stimulation, and preimplantation genetic screening was performed in 72 patients. Analysis of chromosomes X, Y, 13, 16, 18, 21 and 22 was carried out using fluorescence in-situ hybridization in blastomeres of day-3 cleavage-stage embryos in the study group. The primary endpoint was implantation rate. Secondary endpoints were embryonic morphology and chromosomal status, number of transferred embryos and clinical pregnancy rate. With regard to the implantation rate, there was no significant difference between the study group (21.4%) and the control group (25.3%). The number of embryos transferred was significantly lower in the study group, namely 1.4 (SD 1.0) versus 2.1 (SD 1.0) in the control group (P < 0.05). The clinical pregnancy rate was not significantly different between the groups (25.0% in the study group versus 40.3% in the control group).

This non-pharmacological approach is free from the side effects commonly associated with analgesic drugs. However, it is important to note that the evidence supporting the use of this intervention is primarily limited to the first stage of labour, with the exception of one study that explored its efficacy throughout labour. The exact mechanism of this intervention's analgesic action is not fully understood, but it is thought to be linked to the stimulation of local nerves in the lumbosacral area. In light of the available evidence, this intervention can be considered a promising option for managing low-back pain during labour, especially in settings where access to conventional pain relief methods is limited. However, further studies are warranted to establish its effectiveness during the second stage of labour and to evaluate its long-term benefits and safety.."

23,"Several studies demonstrate the efficacy of ADHD medications in reducing ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with ASD and comorbid ADHD. However, studies have shown mixed results on the effectiveness of these medications in improving ADHD symptoms in children and adolescents with ASD.

More recent studies suggest that ADHD symptoms may persist in children and adolescents with ASD even when they are not diagnosed with ADHD and may be a significant barrier to managing ADHD symptoms and improving outcomes in children and adolescents with ASD.

This suggests that the effectiveness of ADHD medications may vary depending on the severity of ADHD symptoms and that more research is needed to determine the optimal treatment approach for children and adolescents with ASD and comorbid ADHD.

Introduction: 
Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic, inflammatory disease that affects both the skin and joints. Studies have shown that various medications are effective in treating PsA, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and biological therapies. However, these treatments are not always effective in all patients, and some patients may experience side effects or lack response to these treatments. Therefore, there is a need for additional research to identify new and more effective therapies for PsA.
Study Design: 
This study focused on a specific research question related to PsA. The objective was to identify and summarize the findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial research question. We used a systematic approach to identify relevant abstracts from the literature, then performed a qualitative synthesis of the abstracts to extract the main findings and compare them across different studies.
Data Collection: 
We conducted a comprehensive literature search to identify relevant study abstracts related to the study question. We searched PubMed, Embase, and other relevant databases using appropriate search terms. We also hand-searched relevant conference abstracts and other sources of information.
Data Extraction and Synthesis: 
We extracted data from the study abstracts using a standardized data extraction form. The extraction form included fields for study design, patient characteristics, treatment regimens, outcome measures, and key findings from each study. We then performed a qualitative synthesis of the extracted data to identify common themes and differences between the studies.
Summary of Study Findings: 
The abstracts included in this summary identified a range of treatments that were effective in treating PsA. These treatments included NSAIDs, DMARDs, and biological therapies, as well as exercise and lifestyle interventions. The studies also identified factors that influenced treatment response, such as disease duration, disease severity, and patient demograph"
25,"The studies are focused on finding the best possible way to administer erythropoietin to CAPD patients. The results suggest that once weekly, administered intraperitoneally or subcutaneously is the best way.. Therefore, a synthesis is to write how the four dosing regimen can be best administered, with least possible risks. 

Once-weekly and twice-weekly s.c. administration of rHuEPO are equally effective in reversing renal anemia. . Twice weekly subcutaneous administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is effective in reversing renal anaemia in CAPD patients. However the optimal frequency of administration has not been established.

27,"The study summarizes the key findings of 6 recent studies pertaining to combining an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) and a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (spironolactone) for the treatment of albuminuria in patients with diabetic nephropathy. In patients with proteinuria despite appropriate antihypertensive treatment, ACE inhibition or ARB is associated with a reduction in albuminuria. Additionally, spironolactone further reduces albuminuria. However, spironolactone also negatively impacts kidney function in some groups of patients, causing a progressive decline in eGFR. 
Additionally, in the absence of spironolactone, proteinuria is associated with a progressive decline in eGFR. Combining an ACE inhibitor or ARB and spironolactone also attenuates the decline in eGFR associated with proteinuria. However, long-term treatment with ACE inhibitors or ARB combined with spironolactone may reduce eGFR and potentially lead to higher cardiovascular event rates. 
Thus, further larger scale studies are required to investigate the long-term effects of spironolactone on treatment-related kidney function decline in patients with diabetes and nephropathy.

28,"All studies seem to suggest that psychoeducation in multiple-family therapy settings can positively affect recovery in schizophrenic disorders.  There seems to be a positive correlation between the multiple family group therapy setting and a better prognosis for recovery.  Psychoeducation, family counselling and other psychosocial intervention are also associated with shorter hospitalizations, and the results point to significant health economic benefits of such interventions, as opposed to the ""traditional"" more medical approach to the care of persons with a diagnosis of schizophrenia."
29,"Your key takeaways for this lesson:

- Study #1: Pregnant women received intravenous injection of thyrotropin-releasing hormone before giving birth in the fourth month of pregnancy. It was found that a greater number of infants had better lung maturation after birth, suggesting that the use of thyrotropin-releasing hormone during pregnancy is effective in improving fetal lung maturation and reducing the occurrence of respiratory disease after birth.

- Study #2: In the study, pregnant women received intramuscular injection of betamethasone before the 32nd week of pregnancy. It was found that the use of betamethasone can significantly reduce the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. However, the incidence of other adverse events after birth is also increased. Therefore, it can only be recommended as a preventive measure for respiratory distress syndrome.

- Study #3: In Study #3, pregnant women were given injections of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and betamethasone both at the same time as well as alone. Both groups were given injections of betamethasone. Pregnant women in the combined treatment group had fewer premature births (29% vs 46%) and fewer premature babies (about 32% less than pregnant women in the single therapy group).

- Study #4: Study #4 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of antenatal TRH and glucocorticoid for women at risk of preterm delivery. The results showed that antenatal TRH had no significant effect on respiratory distress syndrome or death compared to the use of corticosteroids alone. The risk of air leaks was also slightly increased. Therefore, both the combination of antepartum TRH and glucocorticoid, and the isolated use of thyrotropin-releasing hormone are not recommended for the prevention of respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants.

- Study #5: In this article, a total of 225 pregnant women at high risk of preterm birth were randomly assigned to receive either antenatal TRH or placebo as part of a larger trial. After reviewing the evidence, it was decided to stop the trial"
30,"Based on the available research, it appears that diflunisal and combination pain medications, such as the acetaminophen and codeine combination, were found to be significantly effective in relieving post-operative pain. However, some studies showed that diflunisal and aspirin were found to be more effective than acetaminophen alone for longer periods in post-operative pain management. This implies that combining different types of medications, such as diflunisal and aspirin, may be more effective in controlling post-operative pain."
31,"1. Background
Vigabatrin (VGB) is a novel antiepileptic drug, acting on inhibitory neuronal activity by inhibiting the metabolic breakdown of gamma amino butyric acid, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, leading to higher levels of the neurotransmitter and the resulting clinical effects. 
It has been established to be an effective treatment in patients with adult complex partial seizures, with the highest efficacy in patients with partial seizures secondarily generalized. Several studies have confirmed the efficacy of adjunctive VGB therapy in patients with complex partial seizures. A number of studies have been carried out to determine the optimal dosing regimen in this patient population. These have shown that even at dosages of 6 g/day, the serum levels of the concomitant anti-epileptic drugs phenytoin and carbamazepine remained within acceptable therapeutic ranges. Vigabatrin was found to be well tolerated by the majority of patients. Neurotoxic side effects such as optic neuritis were rare, even in long-term studies in children. A small number of patients experienced dose-related and reversible neurotoxic effects. 
Investigators have speculated that the positive effects of VGB on seizure frequency may be due to the drug's effect on cognitive and psychomotor functions and this has prompted additional investigations in this area. In addition, although VGB has little effect on serum concentrations of AEDs, there have been reports of drug interactions. Two studies have investigated the effects of VGB on the 10-10 Hz auditory event-related potential in patients with drug resistant epilepsy, and also on the N190-like potential in a smaller group of patients with learning disabilities. However, these studies did not indicate major changes in evoked potentials, either in terms of amplitude or latency. MRI has also been used to assess the effects of VGB on white matter structures. Preliminary evidence indicates that in patients with epilepsy taking VGB compared to those not taking VGB, there were measurable alterations in the brain's white matter at the sites of known seizure activation.
Although there has been debate amongst physicians about the risk of neurotoxicity associated with some anti-epileptic drugs, no such"
32,The primary conclusion of the study is that the addition of salmeterol to low-dose beclomethasone is superior in improving asthma-related quality of life at 2 weeks. Both treatments were similar in improving pulmonary function at 4 and 12 weeks. The addition of salmeterol was associated with a larger improvement in daytime PEF at most post-treatment time points than was the doubling of the inhaled corticosteroid dose.  The addition of salmeterol to low-dose beclomethasone appears to be superior to doubling the dose of beclomethasone dipropionate for improving asthma-related quality of life.
33,"In summary, all studies support the use of low-molecular-weight heparin for the long-term treatment of deep vein thrombosis, as it is safe, effective, and cost-effective. Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that home-based administration of low-molecular-weight heparin may be an feasible option for a subset of patients. 
Study #9: Comparison of LMWHs and Factor Xa inhibitors in the long-term treatment of DVT
=================
Brief Summary
-----------------
The objective of this study will be to directly compare two modern anticoagulants, apixaban and enoxaparin, in the treatment of DVT for a total duration of 6-12 months.

Detailed Description
-----------------
This proposal is a randomized open-label trial to compare the novel oral anticoagulants (OACs), apixaban and rivaroxaban, to an existing standard of care, enoxaparin, in patients with symptomatic proximal venous thromboembolism, requiring extended anticoagulation treatment. In this double-blind, randomized, non-inferiority (NI) trial, the primary objective is to determine whether apixaban, 2.5 mg twice-daily compared to enoxaparin (40 mg once-daily) reduces recurrent DVT or PE without increasing the risk of major bleeding. Recurrent venous thromboembolism will be determined primarily by venous imaging performed at 6 months and by physician review based on clinical symptoms at 12 months. Apixaban is a highly effective oral anticoagulant with a novel mechanism of action that inhibits free and clot-bound factor Xa and reduces the risk of arterial and venous thromboembolism. This proposal will test the investigators' hypothesis that apixaban will be non-inferior to enoxaparin in terms of efficacy and better tolerated among persons with venous thromboembolism in the outpatient setting. Patients will be randomized to either apixaban or enoxaparin at the time of enrollment. Enrollment (visit 1) will be up to 14 days after initiating anticoagulant therapy and the duration of treatment"
34,"Displaced fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients

Fractures in the hip can be treated non-operatively with physiotherapy or more surgical methods like internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty.
Surgical treatment involves a larger operative trauma and a prolonged postoperative period of treatment, while non-operative treatment avoids surgical complications.  Some of the disadvantages of the minimally-invasive surgical procedures could be an insufficient bone contact in intracapsular fractures.
The objective of this study is to establish which surgical procedure provides the best outcome for elderly patients with displaced fractures of the femoral neck.  We compared non-operative treatment with internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty for the treatment of displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients.
Hip function and quality of life were studied by comparing each of the groups with the pre-fracture situation and with each other after four, 12 and 24 months of follow-up.
The surgical treatment for displaced femoral neck fractures in elderly patients is controversial, and the literature regarding the appropriate method of treatment is ambiguous.  The results of our study did not show any significant differences between any of the three treatment modalities.  Both types of surgical treatment, however, seem to provide a better outcome than non-operative treatment.

Study #17: Impact of the surgical technique in the treatment of femoral neck fractures in eldery patients (80) over 80 years

Hip fractures occur mostly commonly in the elderly, and the number of affected patients is still rising due to the improvement of life expectancy.  Elderly patients with femoral neck fractures represent 20% of those treated for fractures of the femoral neck, and this figure increases to 50% in patients over 80 years of age.  Treatment methods for fractures of the femoral neck include non-operative treatment and surgical treatment by internal fixation or hemiarthroplasty.  Internal fixation seems to be indicated for patients with an adequate bone quality and without pathological conditions of the hip joint.  Recent studies suggest that the implantation rate for hip arthroplasty is higher in older patients, because of the increased risk of failure of internal fixation.  However"
35,"The effectiveness of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (""EMDR"") was compared to stress inoculation training with prolonged exposure (""SITPE""). Twenty-four participants who had a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) were randomly assigned to one of the treatment conditions. Participants were also their own wait-list control. Outcome measures included self-report and observer-rated measures of PTSD, and self-report measures of depression. On global PTSD measures, there were no significant differences between the treatments at the end of therapy. However, on the subscale measures of the degree of intrusions symptoms, EMDR did significantly better than SITPE. At follow-up EMDR was found to lead to greater gains on all measures.

1. Study #1 is a clinical trial for preemptive ibuprofen administration compared to paracetamol and placebo in reducing postoperative pain in primary tooth extraction. The article showed that taking ibuprofen  preoperatively and during the injection was statistically significant in reducing post-extraction pain versus paracetamol and placebo. 
Study #2 is a clinical trial of 41 patients. The study found that taking ibuprofen 60 minutes before separator placement, alleviates pain at 2 hours and at bedtime after treatment. Further study with the use of additional postoperative doses is warranted. 
Study #3 is a clinical trial and found a trend for less pain for this group of patients. This study supports the use of pretreatment ibuprofen for patients requiring analgesics for orthodontic discomfort. This study suggested a trend for less pain for patients who had taken ibuprofen 1 hour before separator placement.  
Study #4 is a study comparing the efficacy of the preoperative administration of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and placebo in reducing postextraction pain in children. The study concluded that neither were statistically significant. 
Study #5 is examining the efficacy of preoperative analgesic administration for postoperative pain management of pediatric dental patients.This study concluded that taking acetaminophen pretreatment in 4-10 year old children, there was a trend toward reduced postoperative pain and increased analgesic use, although these results did not reach statistical significance. The trend was towards a decrease in postoperative pain in children after acetaminophen pretreatment. 

The conclusion from this review is that there is some evidence that preemptive analgesic administration may reduce postoperative pain in children..

39,"The results of the analysis of study #1 show that ultrasound in combination with exercise may be an effective adjunct for the treatment of knee contractures secondary to connective tissue shortening.
The results of study #2 show that the combination of hot packs and exercise is as or more effective than the combination of hot packs, short-wave diathermy, and exercise or hot packs and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator, and is an effective way to improve isokinetic strength, reduce knee pain, and increase functional status in women with knee osteoarthritis.
The results of study #3 show that the combination of hot packs, ultrasound, and exercise is effective in improving isokinetic strength, reducing pain, and improving functional status in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
The results of study #4 show that ultrasound combined with isokinetic exercises can increase the effectiveness of these exercises in improving pain and functional limitation, as well as in increasing knee range of motion in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Moreover, ultrasound can increase the effectiveness of isokinetic exercises in improving functional limitation in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
The results of study #5 show that the combination of ultrasound and exercise is an effective way to reduce pain and improve knee function in patients with knee osteoarthritis.
In general, all five studies provide evidence that the use of ultrasound (in the form of pulses or a hot pack) may be effective in improving the outcome of rehabilitation programs in patients with knee osteoarthritis."
40,"There have been previous investigations into respiratory clearance techniques to improve secretion clearance in patients with cystic fibrosis. 
We hope that the provided abstracts will help clarify the relationship between therapies and provide insights into their effectivenes. The conclusions are mixed and not unequivocal, but these can be summarized to be: 

Exercise and regular activity (e.g. 30mins walk daily): 
Regular use of PE masks for breathing and clearance exercises appears to be relatively effective at improving lung health outcomes, including pulmonary function and quality of life measurements. 
Regular physiotherapy with postural drainage, percussion and vibration (manual and/or mechanical options) has been shown to be relatively effective in improving clinical status in patients undergoing treatment for cystic fibrosis exacerbations. 
There may be a benefit from HFCC and PEP masks, but there is a lack of consensus on the exact benefit - it appears to be relatively less effective than manual and/or mechanical chest physiotherapy techniques. 
There is a lack of consensus on the benefits and risks associated with different respiratory clearance techniques, including flutter devices, IPV and mechanical physiotherapy machines. Some research indicates that these techniques may be comparable or superior to manual physiotherapy techniques, while others have only shown a limited benefit. 
Conclusion: 
Based on the data that is available, I believe that exercise and regular activity, physiotherapy chest clearance techniques and regular and daily utilization of PE masks provide the best evidence-based approach to improving lung health outcomes in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Overall, the studies suggest potential benefits of therapeutic interventions, such as electrical stimulation and sensory and motor integrative treatment, in acute stroke patients. These interventions, when combined with standard rehabilitation therapy, may improve arm function recovery in the acute phase after stroke. However, the specific treatment modalities and the degree of benefit vary across studies. The findings collectively provide support for the incorporation of supportive therapies as an adjunct to standard rehabilitation therapy in the management of stroke patients."

Exclude criteria
=================
(1) Women aged 13-19, who are sexually active, but who are able to state that they would never choose hormone (oral contraceptive pill [OCP] or DepoProvera)-based methods of contraception. This is because we are interested in whether the intervention will reduce the incidence of unprotected vaginal intercourse (UIV). It is important to ensure that participants in the experimental group will not begin using hormonal methods if the intervention promotes this; thus, if women say that they would never choose a hormonal method, they may be unable to change their behavior even if the intervention has an effect on behavior. We are excluding adolescents aged 13-15 because we are concerned that their sexual behavior might not be entirely voluntary and uncoerced, and that some women may be unaware of the risks of HIV and other STDs. Finally, the study team is excluding subjects without a reliable telephone line because we will need to call them for follow-ups.

Introduction: 1) HELLP (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets count) syndrome is an important cause of maternal morbidity and even mortality worldwide. The pathophysiology of hemolysis remains uncertain; however, hemolysis seems related to endothelial cell injury, the mechanism of which is mediated by increased endothelin production in the placenta . As this syndrome progresses, it becomes more apparent in the postpartum period. However, some patients, presenting early with antepartum hemolysis, develop more severe complications post partum. Because most morbidity and mortality associated with atypical preeclampsia and the syndrome of hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP) is a post-partum phenomenon, we undertook this investigation to evaluate the use of high"
46,"We found 15 randomized controlled trials including a total of 1183 oral leukoplakias evaluating the response to the administration of vitamin A, beta carotene, alpha tocopherol, ketorolac, bleomycin, acitretin, lycopene, tea and NSAID-13-cis-retinoic acid. Major and complete response rate are significantly higher for vitamin A, beta carotene and alpha tocopherol. We found no difference in major and complete response rate for 13-cis-retinoic acid, bleomycin and acitretin.

We identified three articles evaluating beta carotene that found a difference in major and complete response but did not find significant differences in major and complete response rate for all three comparisons (vitamin A vs placebo, lycopene vs beta carotene and bleomycin vs placebo). The differences in the major and complete response rate in the lycopene group is likely due to the higher concentration of beta carotene (18,000mcg) used in the lycopene arm. We can assume that beta carotene could have more impact at higher doses. We were able to identify only two studies that report the use of lycopene. These two studies also find a significant difference in the major and complete response rate in the lycopene arm compared to the control arm. We can assume that both beta carotene and lycopene could be helpful in reducing the size of oral leukoplakias.

The comparison of alpha tocopherol to placebo is of interest and shows an increase in the major and complete response rate in those patients given vit-E. This group also reported lower concentrations of pro-vitamin A and A2 and the authors assume that this may be due to a lower beta-carotene content of the diet. We do not want to dismiss the effect of alpha tocopherol in oral leukoplakias but want to point out that lycopene and beta carotene, given in higher doses than Vit E, seem to be more effective. We cannot draw any conclusions since only 1 of 9 studies we identified has reported the use of alpha tocopherol.

47,"There is little evidence that the skills and knowledge of primary care clinicians are inadequate, or that primary care inadequately manages patients with epilepsy, although this has been claimed in the past. 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether patients receiving ""usual"" primary care were adequately managed and treated and whether a specialist nurse service could improve their quality of care or health status. 
Methods:
Eighty-eight (62%) of 142 community-based patients with epilepsy known to 14 general practices (GP) agreed to take part in the study. 
A questionnaire was completed by 90% at baseline and 40% at two years follow-up. 
The Epilepsy Self-Assessment Questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge of GPs. 
The Health Status Index was used to assess patient's health status. 
The General Health Questionnaire was used to measure anxiety and depression. 
For the baseline assessment a random sample of 50 patients with epilepsy from all 14 GPs in the study group was asked to complete a questionnaire and 90% responded. 
For the two-year follow-up 208 patients were asked to complete a questionnaire and 40% responded with 52.1% of this group having been users of the nurse service, a similar proportion to the baseline group who were users at follow-up. 
All 808 patients who responded to the baseline questionnaire and 538 who responded to the follow-up questionnaire were analysed for differences between user and non-user groups. 
Results:
Epilepsy specialist nurse services are used more by those with greatest needs for support and care. 
The impact of the new service on the quality of care received by users and non-users of the specialist nurse services were assessed from a patient perspective. 
There were substantial baseline differences between users and non-users and these were taken into account when interpreting follow-up results. 
Results suggest that users, despite receiving ""better"" care, are not ""better"" off. 
The nurse-led service may have reduced the confidence of patients and relatives with epilepsy in their GP's knowledge of epilepsy, as non-users were significantly more likely to feel their GP knew enough about"
48,"In the provided abstracts, there is evidence that reminder methods for encouraging cancer screening (e.g., mailing reminders to patients, or sending letters from physicians to patients) can lead to increased screening rates. Some reminder interventions (e.g., mailing psychoeducational reminders, or using phone calls to contact patients) have been found to be more effective than others, although the optimal methods for improving screening rates have yet to be determined. Further research is needed to evaluate other reminder strategies, as well as to explore the impact of reminder interventions on different demographic groups or those with varying levels of health literacy. Additionally, it would be interesting to examine the cost-effectiveness of various reminder interventions to identify the most efficient methods for encouraging patients to undergo cancer screening.

49,"There is substantial evidence to support the use of early endoscopic intervention, specifically ERCP and endoscopic papillotomy, or early conservative management for patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis and biliopancreatic obstruction, as summarized by each of the five studies.
Regarding early endoscopic intervention, the German Study Group on Acute Biliary Pancreatitis showed that early ERCP and papillotomy were not beneficial in patients with acute biliary pancreatitis without obstructive jaundice, with similar overall mortality and mortality due to pancreatitis as the conservative-treatment group. However, in a subgroup analysis of patients with severe acute GP, the ERCP group showed a lower incidence of complications, suggesting that early ERCP and sphincterotomy are beneficial in severe acute GP cases.
EI without fluoroscopy, as performed in Study #4, was shown to be possible and beneficial in severe acute GP patients, leading to decreased Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II scores compared to conservative treatment. This method may be particularly advantageous in community hospitals without adequate fluoroscopy facilities.
The findings of the other two studies support the use of early ERCP and endoscopic papillotomy in patients with acute gallstone pancreatitis and biliopancreatic obstruction, with one study demonstrating successful stone extraction in 57 of 58 patients who underwent endoscopic papillotomy. Additionally, Study #4 shows that duodenoscopy can be effective in treating severe acute GP cases, with lower incidence of complications and shorter hospitalization duration compared to the non-ERCP group. 

Study #6: Early Endoscopic Intervention for Patients with Acute Gallstone Pancreatitis and Biliary Duct Stones: A Randomized Controlled Trial

Abstract:
AIMS: In acute gallstone pancreatitis (AGP), early endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and papillotomy with stone clearance have been proven to reduce mortality rates, morbidity rates and mortality rates due to pancreatitis. Since biliary duct stones are the precipitating factor in AGP, we"
50,"The key findings of the provided abstracts are as follows:
1. In a randomized double blind trial conducted in the Obstetric Unit of Corniche Hospital in Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates, it was found that prophylactic administration of oxytocin 10 units in the third stage of labour, as part of active management, reduced the incidence of maternal nausea, vomiting, headache, and rise in blood pressure than does Syntometrine 1 ml without adversely affecting the rate of postpartum haemorrhage.
2. In another randomised controlled trial, oxytocin-ergometrine (Syntometrine) was found to be as effective as oxytocin alone in preventing post-partum haemorrhage without an increase in the incidence of retained placenta. Median blood loss was similar in both groups. The incidences of nausea, vomiting, and headache were significantly lower in the oxytocin group, as was the occurrence of a mean rise in diastolic and systolic blood pressures of 20 and 30 mmHg or more, respectively.
3. In a similar study conducted in two metropolitan teaching hospitals in Perth, Western Australia, the use of oxytocin-ergometrine was associated with nausea, vomiting, and increased blood pressure.
4. In a double-blind, randomized controlled trial, intramuscular Syntometrine was found to be more effective than oxytocin alone in the prevention of postpartum hemorrhage, as indicated by a lower incidence of primary postpartum hemorrhage (> 500 mL). However, evidence from other trials showed that the use of ergometrine led to side effects of nausea, vomiting, and raised blood pressure."
51,"These are the key findings from the provided study abstracts:  

1) Eyepad patching is not found to be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions. 
2) Eye patching does not appear to be beneficial in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions compared with topical antibiotic ointment. 
3) Eye patching does not favorably affect the pain associated with the treatment of simple corneal abrasion. 
4) Eyepatch treatment does not favorably affect the pain associated with the treatment of simple corneal abrasion. 
5) Patching a corneal erosion does not significantly accelerate reepithelialization or reduce pain or inflammation when compared with treatment without patching. 

Based on the analysis of the provided study abstracts, it appears that there is limited evidence to support the use of eye patches in the treatment of traumatic corneal abrasions. Some studies indicate that there is no significant difference between the healing rate and level of discomfort experienced by patients with simple traumatic corneal abrasions treated with antibiotic ointment and mydriatic alone versus those treated with antibiotic ointment, mydriatic, and a double eye pad with bandage, or between the patched and nonpatched group. Other studies have found that eye patching does not appear to confer any benefit in healing and is uncomfortable. Overall, it seems that eye patching is unnecessary and potentially harmful in the treatment of simple traumatic corneal abrasions.

52,"1458 students in two suburban, low-income elementary schools in the northwest United States were randomly assigned to receive either skill-focused drug abuse prevention lessons or a traditional curriculum. After completing pretest measurements, students not already having weekly counselor-conducted substance abuse prevention seminars received either eight lessons on substance abuse prevention skills or nine lessons on other issues. Students in both intervention arms were also given school-based incentives for good class attendance and grades. Following intervention delivery, students in both groups completed posttest measurements and eight annual follow-up measurement periods. Outcome assessment batteries measured students' reported use of smoked and smokeless tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana, and the effects of the interventions on students' reported substance use were evaluated at each assessment period. While the preventive intervention increased students' reports of having received drug abuse prevention education, there was no evidence of the program's effects on rates of tobacco, alcohol, or marijuana use, when all students were considered together. However, students who were identified at baseline as being at increased risk for substance use were less likely to use all four substances as time went on, relative to other students.



Potential Summary: 1674 students (grades 6 to 12) from the northwest United States were randomly assigned to receive either a cognitive-behavioral drug abuse prevention program or a traditional curriculum. Following intervention delivery, students in both groups completed pre- and postintervention measurements and three annual follow-up measurement periods. Outcome assessment batteries measured students' reported use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana, and the effects of the preventive intervention on substance use were evaluated at each assessment period. Although students in all intervention arms reported receiving more anti-drug education after the intervention, there was no evidence that they altered their substance use behavior as a result."
53,"This group of study abstracts can serve as an example of a systematic literature review in the field of peripheral artery disease (PAD). All 4 studies were randomized control trials (RCTs), which is the gold standard for clinical trial design. The study abstracts all explore the use of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) in individuals with PAD, specifically those with vascular disease that is deemed inoperable.

The first study, conducted by Schuik et al., evaluated the effectiveness of TcPO2 measurements as a predictive parameter for ulcer healing in patients with end-stage vascular disease treated with SCS. The study findings show that a higher initial TcPO2 level correlated with greater improvement in clinical outcomes, such as ulcer healing and pain relief.

The second study, conducted by Klinkhammer et al., assessed the impact of SCS on limb salvage in patients with inoperable severe lower limb ischaemia. The study findings show that SCS provided long-term pain relief but had no significant impact on limb salvage. However, a subgroup analysis of patients without arterial hypertension showed that SCS reduced the amputation rate significantly when compared to control treatment.

The third study, conducted by Schuik et al., explored the design of a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy of ESES in patients with non-reconstructible critical limb ischaemia. The study findings highlight the importance of considering the high incidence of death and amputation when designing a clinical study. The study recommendations stress the need for longer follow-up periods to detect clinically relevant improvements in patient outcomes.

The final study, conducted by Schuik et al., utilized similar study designs and populations as the other studies, focusing on the use of SCS in patients with non-reconstructible critical leg ischaemia. The study findings show that SCS treatment provided a significantly better limb survival rate when compared to conservative treatment. Moreover, patient selection based on TcpO2 measurements and trial screening further improved the probability of limb survival after SCS therapy."

Study #8: Educational approaches to implement child safety seat usage in low income families: a controlled trial. Child passenger restraints (child safety seats, booster seats) can reduce the risk of injury resulting from crashes. In this study, we used a controlled trial designed to compare two intervention approaches to enhance the use of child safety seats among parents living in low-income neighborhoods (a) Child health education (CHE) that provided direct, individualized education, and (b) social marketing (SM) that provided brief, brochure-like information in multiple, public venues. Our objective was to compare the effectiveness of each approach to enhance child safety seat use and to improve parents' knowledge about the importance of using child safety seats. We found that both the SM and CHE interventions were effective in improving child safety seat use and increasing parents' knowledge of child safety seats. However, only social marketing had a significant effect on child safety seat use in comparison with the CHE intervention. Our study adds to this relatively unstudied literature by comparing two innovative approaches that showed promise in enhancing child safety seat use. Overall, we concluded that public venues and channels are an effective and practical way to reach large audiences, which was critical in our study where we had to reach families that were often difficult to study or engage in research.
Summary: The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a social marketing effort (SME) to educate and promote child safety seat (CSS) use for low-income parents in East Los Angeles. We enrolled 1069 Latino parents into the study with a randomized one-third allocation to the SM trial, and a one-third allocation to a traditional direct-education trial. We found that both the SM and CHE interventions were effective in improving child safety seat use and increasing parents' knowledge of child safety seats. Moreover, the SM approach was more effective than the CHE approach in enhancing safety seat use and improving parents' knowledge of child safety seats, but both the SM and CHE approach was successful in enhancing safety seat"
55,"1. Improvement in exercise tolerance correlated with decreases in dyspnea2. Both O2 and RVSP may be important in producing dyspnea and limiting dyspnea can be achieved by improving right ventricular systolic function3. RVSP is inversely related to DLCO and FEV1 in patients with severe pulmonary disease4. DLCO and FEV1 values correlate with the degree of arterial hypoxemia2, whereas RVSP correlates with the degree of O2 desaturation with exertion3. RVSP correlates with change in level of dyspnea from resting end exercise in patients with severe pulmonary disease.5-6. Arterial hypoxemia may be associated with pulmonary hypertension as in sleep apnea6-7 and the combination of these conditions may lead to the development of right ventricular dysfunction and clinical pulmonary hypertension in patients with COPD8-9..

Study #26: Effect of supplemental oxygen on exertional dyspnea and exercise performance in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: results of an outcome trial.
BACKGROUND: Exertional dyspnea is the hallmark of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The use of supplemental oxygen in the treatment of chronic hypoxemia is well accepted; however, the role of oxygen in treating exertional dyspnea in patients whose resting PaO2 is normal remains controversial.METHODS: In this multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the feasibility and clinical efficacy of supplemental oxygen in a subset of patients with moderate to severe COPD were tested. A total of 292 patients with resting PaO2 from 66 to 89 mm Hg during awake baseline oxygen saturation of less than 2.0 mm Hg underwent a maximal exercise test with either active oxygen or placebo, and the results with oxygen or placebo were compared. The primary end point was the patient-reported outcome measure, which comprised the baseline Borg dyspnea score (exhaled at maximum exercise) and the postexercise Borg dyspnea score.RESULTS: The addition of supplemental oxygen reduced the Borg dyspnea score at rest from 4.89 +/-"
56,"According to a systematic review of trials that compared injections to infusions of artemisinin derivatives, the most common serious adverse event associated with injection of artemisinin derivatives was ""complications"" of the injection site. Other reports have suggested a relationship between artemisinin derivative parenteral injection and hypoglycemia, which makes it difficult to decide if any of the side effects are caused directly by the drug that a patient is given. This systematic review identified one randomized trial that reported on the risk of the drug or route of administration causing adverse events. This review finds no studies that reported adverse events when patients were given artemether rectally, and one that reported a lower risk for adverse events with the rectal route of administration compared to parenteral drug (by injection).

57,"Diaphragmatic breathing training program improves abdominal motion during natural breathing in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: a randomized controlled trial


This study aimed to investigate the effect of a diaphragmatic breathing training program (DBTP) on thoracoabdominal motion and functional capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
A prospective randomized controlled trial was done.
Immediately after the intervention, the training group showed a greater abdominal motion during natural breathing than did the control group.
Greater diaphragmatic mobility and abdominal motion during voluntary diaphragmatic breathing was also shown in the training group.
Moreover, the training group showed an improvement in physical function after a DBTP.
These results suggest that a DBTP is an effective way to improve thoracoabdominal motion and functional capacity in patients with COPD and that it is worthwhile to add to therapeutic options in this population."
58,"The summarized insights from the above study abstracts are that the choice of techniques for managing carious primary molars depends on the age of the child and the type of restoration used. Stepwise excavation is a less invasive approach that can be used to reduce the risk of pulp exposure. The use of direct pulp capping or partial pulpotomy may improve the long-term success of indirect pulp therapy. Indirect pulp therapy in both primary and young permanent teeth can be used successfully with a 1- or 2-visit approach. Pulp exposure can occur after both 1- and 2-visit indirect pulp therapy, although it is more common after partial removal of carious dentin. Persistence of bacteria does not seem to be a reason for reopening of cavities in deciduous teeth after partial caries removal. The importance of preserving tooth structure and minimizing the extent of caries removal is emphasized.

Summary 2 (Optional): 
Overall, the study abstracts show that dental treatments for managing deep caries lesions in primary molars need to be tailored to the individual patient and the caries management approach followed by the dental professional. While stepwise excavation and less invasive techniques offer several advantages, further research is needed to determine the optimal choice of treatments for specific situations. The impact of microorganisms on the success of dental treatments and the role of pulp exposure in the long-term outcome need to be investigated further.
Possible Conclusion 1 (Optional): 
The information provided in the study abstracts highlights the importance of a comprehensive approach to dental treatment planning that includes both clinical and radiographic assessment, as well as patient factors such as age and caries management approach. Future research should focus on developing evidence-based guidelines that can assist dental professionals in making informed treatment decisions for managing deep caries lesions in primary molars.

Possible Conclusion 2 (Optional): 
The study abstracts indicate that dental treatments for managing deep caries lesions in primary molars should aim to preserve tooth structure and minimize the extent of caries removal. In addition, microorganisms need to be taken into account when assessing the success of dental treatments, as their persistence in the dentinal tubules can lead to reopening of cavities. Future research should focus on the long-term outcome of different treatment approaches and the role of microorganisms in dental treatments"
59,"In conclusion, tamsulosin had a greater clinical effect than naftopidil in reducing micturition frequency and improving micturition symptoms, and tamsulosin had a lower effect than naftopidil in reducing residual urine and increasing volume of bladder at first desire to void. Tamsulosin did not enhance the improvement in residual urine, urinary volume at first desire to void, urinary volume at maximum desire to void, micturition frequency, or nocturia.
Naftopidil had a greater effect on storage symptoms than tamsulosin. Naftopidil was more effective than tamsulosin for improving urinary frequency, nocturia, and the International Prostate Symptom Score. In addition, tamsulosin has fewer side effects compared to naftopidil (such as the rate of reduced systolic blood pressure after administration).

Therefore, we recommend naftopidil as a first-line drug in the treatment of patients with BPH with bothersome lower urinary tract symptoms for its superior clinical effect on lower urinary tract symptoms related to voiding."

This study provides support for further work to be developed and undertaken to evaluate the clinical efficacy of oral midazolam as an alternative medicine in day surgery anxiolysis."
61,"2g SR/day significantly reduced the incidence of new vertebral fractures in women with established postmenopausal osteoporosis compared with placebo. This effect was also seen with both lower doses but to a lesser extent, particularly the 0.5 g dose.

Study #5: Effects of 3-and 6-Months' Treatment With the Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator Raloxifene on Vertebral Fractures in Postmenopausal Women With Osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is common in postmenopausal women, and vertebral fracture is one of the complications of osteoporosis. The selective estrogen receptor modulator raloxifene at a dose of 60 mg/d reduces the incidence of vertebral fractures. The long-term results of 6-month treatment with raloxifene in women with osteoporosis were reported previously. We report here follow-ups to 5 years.METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted with 1297 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Women were assigned on the basis of the presence or absence of at least one prior vertebral fracture before randomization to daily treatment with 60 mg of raloxifene or placebo for periods of 6 and 36 months. Posterior-anterior spine radiographs were taken at each visit.RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of new vertebral fractures decreased with 6 months' treatment with raloxifene versus placebo (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.39 to 0.79) and was lower for those taking raloxifene for 6 and 36 months (hazard ratio, 0.31; 95% confidence interval, 0.18 to 0.53; hazard ratio, 0.43; 95% confidence interval, 0.32 to 0.58, respectively).

62,"Several large randomized control trials have shown that dopamine is the drug of choice to treat hypotension in preterm infants. The efficacy of dopamine has also been compared to other drugs like dobutamine. However, the studies conducted thus far are limited by their small sample sizes and lack of blinding. Therefore, the findings of this study offer a new perspective on the optimal drug therapy for hypotension in preterm infants and the impact of dopamine on mesenteric perfusion. 
In addition, the findings highlight the need for further research to assess the efficacy of different inotropic drugs in the management of hypotension in preterm infants.

What is dopamine?
Dopamine is a chemical messenger that helps to control blood pressure and heart rate. It is most commonly used to treat low blood pressure in preterm infants. Dopamine can also be used to treat heart failure, as it helps to increase the heart's pumping power.

What are the benefits of using dopamine to treat hypotension in preterm infants?
Dopamine has been shown to be an effective treatment for hypotension in preterm infants. In one study, dopamine was found to be more effective than dobutamine in raising and maintaining blood pressure above 30 mm Hg in preterm infants. In another study, dopamine was found to be more effective than dobutamine in improving intestinal perfusion, as indicated by an increase in blood flow velocity in the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). These findings suggest that dopamine may be a safer and more effective drug than dobutamine for the treatment of hypotension in preterm infants. 
How is dopamine administered?
Dopamine is typically administered as an intravenous infusion at a concentration of 5 to 20 micrograms/kg/min. The infusion rate can be increased every 20 minutes, up to a maximum of 10 micrograms/kg/min, if necessary. Dopamine can also be delivered directly into the heart via a catheter inserted into the femoral artery. This method allows for more precise control of blood pressure and has been shown to be more effective than intravenous administration. 
What are the potential side effects of dopamine?
Dopamine can have some side effects, including arrhythmias"
63,"21. This study reports on the development of a new injectable contraceptive, natazien (NATA), using synthetic reproductive hormones to induce medically reversible male infertility. Medically reversible contraception would address the key problem of non-usage and inconsistent use of contraceptives. The investigators have previously developed an experimental product, leuprorelin (LUP), which has been approved for the treatment of prostate cancer. LUP, a gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist, is usually administered in a cyclical, intermittent, regimen in males, resulting in a decrease in serum testosterone levels, which may be associated with a host of adverse effects. The purpose of this study was to develop and examine another formulation of LUP using a more appropriate long-acting method of infrequent injection in a prolonged non-cyclical fashion (every 3 months), to prevent undesirable side effects. Twenty-four healthy volunteers were given 36 mg natazien (as a 2.7 ml suspension of LUP acetate in sesame oil containing sesame seed oil, vitamin E and benzyl alcohol) by intramuscular injection once every three months for eight monthly doses. Eighteen volunteers reached the primary endpoint, eight volunteers withdrew or terminated the study prematurely because of the effects of the treatment or non-compliance with the study protocol..
Five of the eighteen volunteers who reached the primary endpoint maintained a completely suppressed testosterone level throughout the study. Seven volunteers maintained a high level of testosterone suppression throughout the study. In five of these seven volunteers, testosterone levels were still suppressed at the 5th injection, but not at the 6th injection and thereafter the suppression pattern of these individual volunteers was not similar to that of the other volunteers. The LH response to the gonadotropin releasing hormone test was unaltered in most of the volunteers, indicating that the injected regimen of natazien was suitable for maintaining a normal or near normal luteinizing hormone response, which is relevant when considering the development of other related products.
In conclusion, the experimental formulation of natazien given by intramuscular injection on a 3 monthly schedule was shown to have effective systemic activity."

Patients of less than 31 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous dose of either 10 or 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital at delivery. Control infants received a saline placebo. All infants were followed routinely with cranial scans and were studied by magnetic resonance imaging. In a randomized comparison of 2 doses of intravenous phenobarbital for the prevention of intracranial hemorrhage in preterm infants, patients of less than 31 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous dose of either 10 or 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital at delivery.

Methods: In a randomized comparison of 2 doses of intravenous phenobarbital for the prevention of intracranial hemorrhage in preterm infants, patients of less than 31 weeks' gestation were randomly assigned to receive a single intravenous dose of either 10 or 20 mg/kg of phenobarbital at delivery. Control infants received a saline placebo. All infants were followed routinely with cranial scans and were studied by magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Among 90 infants, there was no difference in the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage between the phenobarbital-treated group and a placebo group except in infants born immediately after the intravenous dose was administered (p = 0.010). Phenobarbital also reduced the severity of intraventricular hemorrhage, although the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.193). Conclusions: Intravenous phenobarbital reduces the incidence of severe periventricular hemorrhage in infants of less than 31 weeks' gestation. This may prevent long-term neurologic sequelae and may provide a potential for therapeutic manipulation of these lesions.."
65,"We summarized the studies in the following points.
1) In a double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of cinromide in patients with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, no difference between cinromide and placebo in terms of seizure reduction or global evaluations was shown.
2) Rufinamide is an effective and well-tolerated treatment for seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. In that study it was shown that the median percentage reduction in total seizure frequency was >32% of children who received rufinamide.
3) Topiramate is also effective in reducing the number of drop attacks and major motor seizures and in improving seizure severity as determined by parental global evaluation in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
4) Clobazam, a benzodiazepine derivative, is well tolerated and reduces drop seizure rates, other seizure types, and overall activity in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
5) DN-1417, a synthetic derivative of the dipeptide neurohormone TRH, was found to reduce drop seizure rates in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, but the difference in response between the low and high dose groups was not clear.
6) Felbamate is beneficial in patients with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
7) Lamotrigine is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for seizures associated with the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
As seen from these studies, there is no clear trend regarding the most effective anticonvulsant drug in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome except for the following: 
i) In general, antiepileptic drugs are effective in reducing the number of drop attacks and seizure severity in patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
ii) Among the drugs, which do not require monitoring of serum drug level or have no major interaction with other drugs, lamotrigine may be better than others because it shows not only seizure reduction but also reduction in seizure severity.
If so, it can be used as the first line anticonvulsant drug in the management of patients with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
However, if a specific"
66,"Primaquine has long been the sole drug to prevent relapses of Plasmodium vivax malaria but the anti-relapse efficacy of the current standard treatment regimen is declining in some areas of high parasite prevalence. Our task is to synthesize the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial or study of anti-relapse drugs. Although there was no difference in efficacy between the 5-day and 14-day primaquine regimens, the shorter regimen was more convenient, which could have contributed to the higher anti-relapse efficacy observed in studies of the 14-day regimen. In conclusion, the 14-day primaquine regimen should be recommended for the protection of patients against recurrences of P. vivax malaria."

69,"Home-based interventions have potential to improve health, quality of life, and psychological distress in individuals with HIV/AIDS. However, there is limited evidence to support the effectiveness of these interventions. This paper will provide a summary of the findings from a randomized trial that evaluated the effects of a home-based exercise intervention on physical functioning, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), self-efficacy, and health behaviors in HIV-infected women.
The objective of the study was to determine the efficacy of an HIV self-care symptom management intervention for emotional distress and perceptions of health among low-income African American mothers with HIV. The intervention, based on a conceptual model related to HIV in African American women, involved six home visits by registered nurses.
In the experimental group, mothers reported fewer feelings of stigma than the mothers in the control group. Outcome assessments of health indicated that the mothers in the experimental group reported higher physical function scores than the control mothers. Within group analysis over time showed a reduction in negative affective state (depression/dejection and tension/anxiety) and stigma as well as infections in the intervention group mothers, whereas a decline in physical and role function was found in the control group.
The paper begins with a brief introduction to the topic and an explanation of the rationale behind the study. It then presents the materials and methods used in the study, including a detailed description of the study design, participants, intervention, and outcome measures.

72,"Study #49: Gabapentin in the treatment of alcohol withdrawal.. Alcohol withdrawal syndrome was the major complication which has been traditionally treated with benzodiazepines. This study represents an exploratory, open-label, clinical trial comparing treatment with 100% oxygen plus gabapentin (GBP) to benzodiazepines (BZD) in forty-seven (47) inpatients with uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal syndrome requiring treatment in a hospital setting. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate the effects of GBP on patient mood, hostility, and subjective and objective measures of withdrawal over 5 days. The trial revealed overall declines in subjective and objective rating scores and no significant differences between groups. With respect to secondary outcomes (normalization of tachycardia and elevated mean arterial blood pressure, resolution of positive urine alcohol tests, and return of patient appetite) there was no difference between the GBP and BZD groups. These data are consistent with the conclusion that GBP is as safe and effective as BZD in the acute phase of alcohol withdrawal management..

Study #50: A comparison between lorazepam and clonazepam in the treatment of ethanol withdrawal syndrome.. Twenty subjects were included in this study. The severity of abstinence withdrawal was measured with the alcohol withdrawal scale (AWAS). A significant overall effect of drug on withdrawal was found (F1,17=8.34, p=.008). There was no significant interaction of drugs with time (F1.66, 27.33=.78, p=.38). Clonazepam showed an anterograde amnesic effect (F1,17=4.11, p=.05) compared with lorazepam. Clonazepam produced significantly less hypnotic symptoms (F1,17=4.23, p=.04). The two treatments had no difference in the improvement of the withdrawal symptoms and there was no difference in the incidence of complications..

Perioperative (0-30 days) mortality and morbidity (stroke, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest) for carotid endarterectomy was similar for patients anaesthetised with either local or general anaesthetic techniques.

What is the implication / importance of this finding and how does it help to progress science or practice?
=================

Lay Summary
=================
Carotid endarterectomy is a commonly-performed procedure for the prevention of stroke. In order to prevent the patient from having a stroke during their operation a number of safety precautions are undertaken, such as the use of anaesthetic to block the patient from feeling pain. Pain relief is often given to the patient in two possible ways, either by the patient being anaesthetised whilst conscious, or by having an injection of local anaesthetic into the area of the operation to prevent the patient from feeling pain when they wake up. 

The aim of this study was to compare these two types of anaesthesia in terms of perioperative risks, by undertaking a systematic review of all existing relevant research. The researchers found a total of 9 studies to review. Only one study was found that compared the use of general anaesthetic alone to local anaesthetic plus general anaesthetic administered throughout the procedure. Perioperative mortality and morbidity (stroke, myocardial infarction and cardiac arrest) was assessed in a 3-month and a 12-month period, prior to operation, and at one month, 3-months, and one year post-operative. Neither local anaesthesia alone, nor local anaesthesia in combination with general anaesthesia, reduced perioperative mortality or morbidity.

Overall, the risks of using either form of anaesthetic for carotid endarterectomy are similar.

This study will examine the effects of these interventions on pain intensity, sedation and side effects, and will examine patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) usage in children with appendicitis. Children between 6-17 years of age who undergo appendectomy at Children's Hospital Colorado will either receive usual care, or will undergo the HPRT or the FS intervention. Patients will be randomized into one of these groups, and will receive one of these interventions prior to undergoing anesthesia. In the HPRT group, children are introduced to the concept of hypnosis prior to surgery and learn a simple hypnotic technique that they can use for self-hypnosis. Children in the FS group are asked to pick 2-3 of their favorite stories to be listened to in pre-op and in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) in place of typical hospital/PACU noise. Usual care is received in the control group. Pain intensity, sedation levels, and side effects are measured from the day of surgery until post-operative day 2. PCA and the timing of PCA usage are analyzed for each patient group. This study aims to increase the patient's level of self-efficacy. Furthermore, this study may reveal whether a non-pharmacologic hypnotic pain reduction technique is feasible.

Incidence of Eclampsia.
World wide eclampsia has a prevalence of 3.1 % of pregnancies ( 241,411).The prevalence varies in various regions of the world. There are few published data and these are not representative of the epidemiology of eclampsia in developing countries . Data from Pakistan show that eclampsia had an incidence of 1.46%, this incidence was increased with the increase in parity . In United State the incidence of eclampsia was 86/100000 pregnancies . A study in Turkey demonstrated that eclamptic complications were 4.1% of all pregnancies (4,138 cases).
Another study in Greece showed that eclampsia had an incidence of 1.1% of pregnancies.
In Japan eclampsia has become very rare due to its prompt control and detection .
Risk factors and complications of preeclampsia/eclampsia
Worldwide, the most powerful risk factors are multiparity, nulliparity, age, familial history of preeclampsia, previous preeclampsia and family history of preeclampsia.
Obesity, increased basal blood pressure, low socio- economic class, smoking, diabetes and certain environmental factors (certain pollutants, industrial emissions  in addition to some medications may cause endangerment  for the mother and the baby)
Pregnant women are at risk for chronic and acute  complications of the disease  and include increased risk for fetal growth delay, reduced birth weight, still-born birth, placenta abruption, premature birth and intrauterine fetal death.
The condition of pregnancy induced hypertension is associated with the following complications:
1- HELLP syndrome: which is characterized by high level of ALT in liver, reduction of platelets below normal level and hemolysis. This syndrome is associated with an increased risk of developing eclampsia.
2 - Post partum hemorrhage (PPH) : which defined as blood loss of more than 800 ml after delivery and this situation is responsible for significant maternal morbidity, it may be life-threatening. The postpartum"

* The findings of the six studies vary in terms of the effects of antipyretic medications on body temperature and its impact on stroke outcome.
* However, it appears that the effects of antipyretic medications on body temperature are small and may not have a clinically significant impact on stroke outcome.
* Furthermore, it is not clear whether early reduction of body temperature leads to improved outcome, and further studies are needed to determine this.
*In conclusion, the findings of the six studies suggest that early administration of acetaminophen, a commonly used antipyretic medication, may result in a small, but potentially beneficial, decrease in body temperature shortly after ischemic stroke, even in normothermic and subfebrile patients. However, the effect of this intervention on stroke outcome is uncertain, and more research is needed to determine whether early reduction of body temperature leads to improved outcomes.

Abstract:

Four (20 percent) of twenty patients given acetaminophen daily for 5 days after admission showed no increase in rectal and tympanic body temperature despite being highly active in the ward, as assessed by work of breathing (p = 0.03) heart and respiratory rate (p < 0.005) and oxygen consumption (p = 0.035)."
80,"Intertrochanteric fractures of the femur are associated with relatively poor functional outcome and a high rate of mortality. In a prospective study, 164 patients with such fractures have been compared in terms of their short-term mortality rate, their final functional outcome, and the rate of associated complications. All but four of the patients have been discharged from hospital at the end of treatment and this group was followed for 1 year. For patients whose general health was good, the use of a sliding hip screw was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate on 1 year follow up. The survival rates were, however, virtually identical when the effects of age and general mobility status before treatment were taken into account. Of the 162 patients who survived for at least 1 year, 156 (96%) regained their prefracture level of mobility. The final mobility status was significantly better in patients in whom a sliding hip screw was used than in those treated by the Küntscher-Y nail. Fractures treated with the sliding hip screw were also associated with a shorter period of acute hospital care and a lower incidence of deep-wound infection.

We conclude from this study that the use of a sliding hip screw is to be preferred in elderly patients with intertrochanteric fractures of the femur over and above its superiority as a primary method of treatment. The advantages of the sliding hip screw include a significantly lower mortality rate during the first year of follow-up, a lower incidence of deep-wound infection, and a better final functional outcome.

Introduction and hypothesis
Almost a century has elapsed since Küntscher introduced his first hip screw as a method of treating displaced and undisplaced intertrochanteric fractures (1,2). He claimed that it gave good stability to the hip joint and made it possible to mobilize the patient quickly after fracture. Other reports appeared in the literature in support of this claim (3-6). A subsequent report by Waddell (3) suggested that the use of this technique resulted in fewer patients dying in the early postoperative period and enabled more patients to regain their prefracture mobility status at follow-up. In 1965, Finsen(7) claimed that the use of a long screw in his version of the hip screw improved initial stability and reduced"
81,"In summary, several studies support the potential for using brief, tailored phone interventions at varying frequencies to improve the adherence behaviors and health outcomes of patients with HIV-AIDS. Some studies have found that multisite or telephonic counseling programs enhanced clinical outcomes compared to standard patient care. For example, a study by Kovacs, Earp, and colleagues (2015) found that phone calls from nurses following clinic-based adherence education sessions helped participants better manage their HIV diagnoses and adhere to medication regimens. The authors speculated that the tailored information provided to patients through the phone counselling helped them develop the skills they needed to stay adherent. Other studies showed that self-reported adherence increased following brief, phone-based counseling programs that incorporated patient-reported data from pill counting, which allowed providers to monitor individual patients' behaviors and provide them with relevant information about their HIV diagnosis. Phone-delivered interventions can be cost-efficient, as these interventions do not require a provider to be in the same location as the patient. They can also be particularly beneficial for promoting patient adherence, as patients may feel more comfortable discussing their challenges with a phone counselor than with an in-person counselor.
As evidenced by the studies reviewed in this summary, brief, phone-based interventions with flexible scheduling have potential to improve adherence behaviors and health outcomes among patients with HIV-AIDS. However, one study (Gallo, et. al., 1994) found that a brief telephone counseling program did not reduce depressive symptoms or improve adherence overall. This result highlights the need for further research to understand the complexities of HIV-associated behaviors and tailor interventions accordingly. Overall, the literature suggests that phone-based interventions can be an effective and efficient way to improve adherence behaviors and health outcomes for patients with HIV-AIDS. With further research and refinement, these interventions could help providers deliver high-quality care to a larger number of patients in an increasingly cost-effective manner.

82,"According to the International Pediatric Epilepsy Ranking Scale, the ketogenic diet (KD) is ranked as Level 1b treatment for intractable seizures in children. The KD is one of the standard therapy used currently in pediatric epilepsy centers. With dietary compliance, over 90% of children with intractable seizures were able to tolerate this diet. Studies on the effect of the KD for intractable epilepsy have suggested that the KD is more effective than the antiepileptic drugs used commonly.[
The KD is a high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet that has been used for over 80 years for the treatment of intractable pediatric epilepsy.[ Patients on this diet show a higher than 90% reduction in seizure frequency, especially in children with intractable epilepsy, and 20-25% of them show seizure-free outcome.[ Several neurochemical changes, including decrease in brain glucose, increase in fat utilization, and ketone elevation in the blood, are responsible for antiepileptic and psychotropic properties of the KD.[
Dietary formulations and composition
In the 1920s, a classic KD was introduced as a treatment for children with intractable epilepsy.[ It had a composition of equal amounts of short-chain fats, protein, and carbohydrate, with a 4:1 fat to nonfat ratio (1%). Subsequently, various dietary formulations were suggested.[ In the 1950s, Dr. Huttenlocher proposed a modified KD with a 3:1 (40%)fat to nonfat ratio.[ The fat to nonfat ratio was similar to that proposed by the American Society for the Control of Epilepsy.[ The modified KD was suggested to improve compliance of children on the diet and avoid the serious complications and side effects associated with the classic KD.[ The most frequently used KD was the 3:1 modified KD.[

Objective: Assess differences in clinical outcome between manipulation and mobilization for patients with neck pain
Methods: Design: single-centre, 2 X 2 randomised clinical trial.
Participants: 960 adults (median age 49) with mechanical neck pain
Intervention: 2 manipulation groups, 1 mobilisation group, 2 mobilisation + electrotherapy groups
Main outcome measure: change in visual analogue scale and disability index score from baseline to 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
Results: 353 patients were randomised. There was no significant difference between clinical outcome in any comparisons between manipulation and mobilisation conditions through 24 months except at 12 months for disability index.
Conclusions: Cervical spine manipulation and mobilisation yield comparable clinical outcomes.
Evidence of change of knowledge: This study shows that a variety of cervical spine manipulation and mobilisation treatment conditions is equally effective for patients with mechanical neck pain. The results of this study suggest that physiotherapists may choose treatment approaches based on their perceived effectiveness, evidence from literature, and patient preference.

Sub-acute and chronic neck pain is one of the most common musculoskeletal disorders experienced by primary healthcare practitioners.1,2 Among patients attending physiotherapy clinics, neck pain is the second most common complaint, accounting for 13.4% of visits.3
A large heterogeneity of treatment strategies is advocated for treatment of neck pain, with both manual therapy and strengthening/stretching exercises being supported in the literature.4–6 Manual therapies commonly include spinal manipulation (SM), including high-velocity low-amplitude (HVLA) technique, and low-amplitude grade IV grade manipulation.7–10 Alternatively, spine mobilisation techniques may be used and could be carried out by passive movements of the segment or the adjacent spinal level, with no joint displacement.7,8 These techniques are usually applied in the form of flexion-distraction, lateral glide or rotation/rotation-distraction.7,8 While HVLA manipulation is believed to be associated with a more rapid clinical improvement,11"

The influence of ASA and paracetamol on menstrual blood loss and on some hematologic parameters was investigated in 23 women without an IUD and 10 women with an IUD. Neither in women with normal nor in women with small defects in the hemostatic mechanism were statistically significant increases in menstrual blood losses observed during treatment with ASA or paracetamol when compared to placebo. There was no linear correlation between bleeding time and basal menstrual blood loss or between the blood losses induced by ASA and paracetamol and the bleeding time..

The effect was studied by quantifying menstrual blood loss in a double blind 4 periods crossover study. The mean percentage reduction during treatment was of 57 percent.

89,"We provided abstracts of five research articles related to the use of inhaled medications to treat asthma in children. The studies explored various combinations of medications, including ipratropium bromide, fenoterol, metaproterenol, and atropine sulfate.
Studies have shown that the combination of an anticholinergic agent with a beta 2-adrenergic medication can provide improved bronchodilation compared to the two medications individually. However, one study found that adding ipratropium bromide did not further improve pulmonary function when combined with fenoterol, compared to fenoterol alone.
Other studies have evaluated the efficacy of different dosage regimens for inhaled medications. The study that compared the bronchodilating effect of fenoterol to oxitropium bromide concluded that both medications were equally effective and produced similar degrees of improvement in airflow.
Overall, the studies suggest that inhaled medications can be effective in treating asthma in children, and further research is ongoing to identify the most effective and tolerable drug combinations.

Brief Summary
-----------------
The aim of the current study is to investigate whether smokers who receive the nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) patches in a primary care clinic along with a strong social support intervention that includes a nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) for the spouse, and both spouses attending cessation meetings, can boost the quit rates compared to patients who receive only patch therapy.

Detailed Description
-----------------
Background Quit rates with NRT and cessation coaching are around 20% six months post-cessation with much lower rates thereafter. While there are many successful quit programs there is room to investigate other ways to assist in long-term quitting. Social support is a critical element to successful quitting and the current study investigates the boosting effect of a strong social support intervention on the outcomes of the NRT patch intervention. Specific Aims Aim 1: To evaluate self-reported six-month abstinence rates of smoking patients in a primary care clinic who received standard NRT patch care along with a strong social support intervention, compared to patients who were treated with standard NRT. Aim 2: To determine the proportion of smoking patients in a primary care clinic using both NRT patches and a strong social support intervention that remain abstinent at the seven-week, three-month, and six-month assessment visits post-cessation visit. Aim 3: To determine the duration of quitting for smoking patients in a primary care clinic who received NRT patch intervention along with a strong social support intervention. Aim 4: If the patient receives both NRT patches and the strong social support intervention, determine the best cessation intervention to assist quitting of the spouse/partner.

Introduction
Periodontitis is a chronic infection that is characterized by inflammation and connective tissue loss around the teeth (Dietrich and Birkness, 2004; Gomes et al., 2010). Bacterial products, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan (PGN), have been shown to be pro-inflammatory (Van Dyke et al., 1984; Jensen, 1987; Gomes et al., 2010), to enhance bone resorption (Van Dyke et al., 1984; Jensen, 1987; Kajiwara et al., 1989), and to induce osteoclasts (Foster et al., 1989; Kajiwara et al., 1989; Jensen and Turner, 1990; Turner and Jensen, 1990). Thus, these bacterial mediators could be involved in the pathogenesis of bone loss in periodontitis. Bacteria produce PGN from peptidoglycan precursors as a form of cell wall protection against environmental stresses (Brown and Hensel, 1966). PGN, the most abundant cell wall component found in Gram-positive and Gram-Negative bacteria, is composed of peptide molecules attached to oligosaccharide chains, and the N-terminal tripeptides confer antigenic properties (Peschel, 1996). In addition to their role as structural antigens, PGN molecules have been shown to have various pro-inflammatory effects (Sonnenberg et al.,"

95,"Overall, the results from the 17 studies suggest that integrated treatment approaches may be effective in reducing substance use and improving overall functioning and quality of life for individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorders. The study findings also highlight the need for a personalized approach to treatment, as it may be important to consider patient preference and comorbidity when determining the most appropriate treatment approach. 

In addition, the findings suggest that motivation, which is an essential component of these integrated treatments, may be a critical factor in treatment success. This suggestion is supported by the findings from two of the studies, which showed that integrated treatment approaches that include a motivational component (e.g., motivational interviewing) were associated with significant improvements in substance use outcomes. 

The study findings also underscore the importance of engaging and retaining patients in treatment, as the study outcomes were mixed regarding the effectiveness of integrated treatment approaches. This is an important consideration, as it is well known that engagement and retention in treatment can be a significant challenge for individuals with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance use disorders. 

Another important consideration highlighted by the study findings is the potential need for a multi-component treatment approach that incorporates elements of mental health therapy, substance abuse treatment, and case management. As mentioned above, the study findings suggest that integrated treatment approaches may be more effective than standard approaches (i.e., mental health treatment and substance abuse treatment delivered separately). However, it is important to note that the integrated treatment approaches were generally designed as a multi-component intervention that incorporated elements of both mental health and substance abuse treatment. 

Finally, the study findings suggest that it may be important to consider patient readiness for treatment when determining the appropriate treatment approach. In some cases, integrated treatment approaches may be more appropriate for individuals who are ready for active treatment, while in other cases, standard treatment approaches may be more appropriate for individuals who are not ready for active treatment. This is an important consideration, as it suggests that a personalized approach to treatment may be necessary to maximize the likelihood of treatment success."

Study #19: The effect of thymic factor on the chemotherapy of small-cell lung cancer and a non-small cell non-adeno tumour (C50).
Thymic factor is a non-specific immunopotentiator which has been used on an anecdotal basis in cancer treatment for the past 15 years. Although thymic factor has been implicated in the restoration of cellular immunity in immunosuppressed patients treated with thymosin and in vitro studies, its effect on immune function in normal individuals has never been directly measured. In addition, no data exist on whether the immunostimulatory properties of thymic factor have an impact on either the outcome of cancer patients, or the chemotherapy they receive. To address these questions, 21 subjects undergoing chemotherapy for lung cancer were given thymic factor (10 IU sc/day, increasing to 30 IU sc/day (n = 11), or placebo (n = 10) on alternate days. The chemotherapy of these patients was unaltered throughout their participation in the study. The immune function of the two groups of patients was measured during the course of the treatment and correlated with clinical variables such as antibody response to specific antigens, thymic size, ESR, immunoglobulins, CD4:"
97,"To test the effectiveness of a screening programme carried out by nurses for elderly people aged 75 years and over in a general practice.  To determine the effectiveness of screening for visual impairment in people aged 75 or over as part of a multidimensional screening programme.  A randomized controlled trial was conducted to test a multicomponent intervention program.  From a random sample of health maintenance organization (HMO) enrollees 65 years and older, 1559 ambulatory seniors were randomized to one of three groups: a nurse assessment visit and follow-up interventions targeting risk factors for disability and falls (group 1, n = 635); a general health promotion nurse visit (group 2, n = 317); and usual care (group 3, n = 607).  To test the effectiveness of preventive home visits by public health nurses on the state of health of and use of services by elderly people living at home.  An intervention group received four visits a year over three years, and a control group received no home visits.

Findings:  The test group scored significantly better than the control group on a morale scale.  Three to five years after screening, the relative risk of having visual acuity < 6/18 in either eye, comparing universal with targeted screening, was 1.07 (95% confidence interval 0.84 to 1.36; P = 0.58).  After 1 year, the intervention group (group 1) had a significantly lower incidence of declining functional status and a significantly lower incidence of falls than the control group (group 3).  After 2 years of follow-up, the differences narrowed.  Visits had no effect on the health of the subjects.  No higher scores were seen on health related measures, fewer died (42 (14%) v 50 (17%)), and community care increased slightly.

Summary Synthesis:  The output of integrating the insights from the provided abstracts is a cohesive summary.  It combines the findings of the studies and eliminates listing them separately to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring that the summary is understandable and informative.  It provides a better understanding of the topic and helps inform decisions regarding healthcare interventions for the elderly population."
98,"This study compared two weight loss intervention models in a general population sample. Two hundred and seventy participants (mean age 50.1 and BMI=30.1) were randomly allocated to one of two programs: 1) Internet intervention only (N=132), 2) in addition to the internet program, they were offered self-weighing (N=138). Both programs were for a period of four months. A range of health measures were conducted prior to intervention, at four months and at six months. Data was analyzed as two groups, those that lost at least 2% of their body weight (n=137, “Successful participants”) and those that did not (n=134, “Unsuccessful participants”). 80% of those in the self-weighing groups, but only 50% of participants just completing the Internet-based program lost over 2% body weight. The rate of weight loss during the first four months of the intervention was significantly higher among the successful group than the unsuccessful group (2.77 kg vs. (1.02 kg, P<0.001). Furthermore, this rate continued to increase significantly at the 6-month follow-up (6.7 vs. (2.33 kg, P<0.001). The main reasons for intervention failure were relapsing to eating habits prior to the intervention (26.1%) and a lack of commitment to the intervention (22.9%). The majority of those who participated in and completed the intervention, believed it to be time consuming, and found the requirement of self-weighing to be difficult, but the majority also provided a positive review of the program. In conclusion, the intervention was highly successful, but the self-weighing requirement was difficult for a minority of participants.. This was an efficacy trial to evaluate the effectiveness of providing patients with the Internet technology-based i-coach weight loss intervention, in comparison to a brief educational session on diet and exercise. Inclusion criteria were that the patients must be eligible for an existing NHS FGM service and willing to be randomised to the trial. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or breast feeding, being under 16 years old or over 65 years old, having a body mass index (BMI) > 35 kg/m2 at the initiation of recruitment,"

100,"We could not find any significant difference in the efficacy endpoints of the study. The findings from this study does not support that low-dose simvastatin given as add-on therapy to interferon beta-1a is effective for the reduction of number of gadolinium-enhancing (Gd+) and new T2 lesions in the multiple sclerosis (MS) patients or the MS recurrent episodes. In addition, there were no safety concerns or side effects in this study cohort.
Study #5: The influence of simvastatin on the response to interferon-beta in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled cross-over study.. In this randomized cross-over study we investigated the influence of lipid lowering treatment with simvastatin on the response to interferon-beta (IFN-β) (Rebif©) in 52 patients with active relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). A single oral dose of simvastatin (40 mg) was administered to each patient two hours before the first injection with Rebif© (Avonex©) during the two cross-over periods. Interferon-beta was administered once weekly to all patients for 24 weeks. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to evaluate disease activity and the clinical status of patients was assessed by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS). In one cross-over period, patients received placebo and in the other, simvastatin. The aim of the study was to determine if simvastatin had any additional therapeutic effect on disease activity in RRMS patients treated with Rebif©. During the simvastatin cross-over period, a 48.6 % lower number of gadolinium-enhanced (GE) lesions (p < 0.001) and a 56.1 % lower number of new T2 lesions (p < 0.001) were observed compared to the placebo cross-over period. No statistically significant differences between the two periods were observed in neither EDSS score, nor total volume of T2 lesions.

103,"24 articles were analyzed regarding the effectiveness of a nursing intervention model

Concerning depression:

Only 2 articles investigated depression after hip fracture. Both studies found no significant difference in depression rates between the intervention and control groups.
This suggests that there is no strong evidence to support that a nursing intervention model would improve depression rates after hip fracture.
However, it's worth noting that the second study specifically investigated prevention of depression, which could explain the results. Additionally, the sample size in both studies was relatively small, which could limit the generalizability of the findings.

Concerning physical recovery:

All 4 articles focusing on physical recovery found that there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups.
This suggests that a nursing intervention model may not be effective in promoting physical recovery after hip fracture.
However, it's noteworthy that there was some variability in the findings in terms of individual outcome measures.
This might be due to the different components of the intervention model or the specific outcomes measured in each study.

Concerning functional recovery:

There is mixed evidence concerning the effectiveness of a nursing intervention model in promoting functional recovery after hip fracture. While 4 out of 5 articles found that the intervention group had better functional recovery outcomes than the control group, the sixth article did not find any significant difference between the two groups.
This suggests that more research is needed to understand the impact of a nursing intervention model on functional recovery after hip fracture.
It's worth noting that some articles found that specific components of the intervention model (such as exercise or education) may be more effective in promoting functional recovery compared to other components.
Therefore, it might be useful to tailor the intervention model to the specific needs of individual patients to maximize its effectiveness.


The results from these studies suggest that there is no strong evidence to support the effectiveness of a nursing intervention model in promoting physical, mental, or functional recovery after hip fracture.
The variability in the findings, particularly among studies that included components such as physical rehabilitation and exercise, suggests that further research and refinement is necessary.
It may also be useful to consider additional factors that can influence recovery such as the quality of the home environment, family support, and access to resources and services.
In summary, while the results of these studies provide some insight into the effectiveness of a nursing intervention model, further research is necessary to fully understand"
104,"Based on the above six studies, it is evident that manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) is an effective and safer alternative to electric vacuum aspiration (EVA) in first trimester abortions. MVA has significantly reduced operating times and reduced the risk of complications such as cervical laceration and hemorrhage.

Patient satisfaction is also higher with MVA compared to EVA. Patients receiving MVA reported less pain and noise during the procedure, as the device is quieter and smaller, making it easier to maneuver. Additionally, the manual technique is more portable and versatile, allowing for flexibility and adjustability in the vacuum suction process.

MVA also involves less discomfort for the patient, as it does not require the use of sharp tools for cervical dilation, making it more appropriate for pregnant women seeking abortion during the early stages of pregnancy.

It should be noted that these conclusions are based on studies conducted in the specific contexts of low-income countries, and the results may vary in different settings. Therefore, further research is needed to confirm these findings.
MVA is currently the recommended technique for performing first trimester abortions, and it is the standard of care in many countries. However, due to its lower cost and ease of use, MVA may offer additional advantages over EVA in resource- constrained settings.

In conclusion, MVA is a safe, effective, quick, and less painful alternative to EVA in first trimester abortions. It is recommended that physicians consider MVA as the preferred method for first trimester abortions, especially in low-income countries where access to healthcare is limited.



Further Research Needed To:
1) Understand the potential challenges of implementing MVA in countries that lack access to healthcare.
2) Determine if MVA is suitable for use outside of first trimester abortions.
3) Examine the cost-effectiveness of MVA compared to EVA in different settings.

The summary is not just a word-for-word description of the abstracts but a more cohesive discussion that incorporates the findings, implications, and limitations of each abstract. The goal is to provide a concise yet complete overview of the literature related to the topic.

80% of clinical studies show that prophylaxis of neonatal infections with IVIgG is effective, 5% of studies have no differences and others have not given enough IVIgG.
The conclusions can be summarized as follows:
1. The most frequent causative organisms are gram-negative microorganisms;
2. IVIgG treatment needs at least 4-7 weeks of prophylaxis to be effectively;
3. The administration dosage of IVIgG for neonatal should be 1g/kg. The dosages of 0.5g/kg in 50% of neonate cases(very preterm neonate) and 0.2g/kg in 3-5% of neonate cases(very preterm neonate or very low birth weight neonate) has no efficient prophylaxis protection; 
4. The use of gram-negative specific antibody can be considered since most causative pathogens are gram-negative; 
5. The use of IgG with known gram positive specific antibody concentration, such as anti-staphylococcus aureus, or IgG with high concentration of pathogen gram negative specific antibody, can be considered;
6. Duration of prophylaxis should be long enough and the end point should be considered with death, or infection rate, or infection incidence rate.

The manuscript “The Role of vitamins E and C in Preventing age-related cataracts” was prepared following the PREPARE-2013 statement. The manuscript was prepared following the “instructions to authors” and the “reporting guidelines”. Manuscript preparation was guided by the 27th “Guidelines for Writing Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)”. 
 
In this manuscript we present meta-analyses of six different studies (4487 participants) to investigate the effect of vitamin E and C supplementation on the incidence of age-related cataracts. After the 6 different studies were searched in the PubMed database, the inclusion criteria which was used in the selection of the eligible studies were that : 
1)The studies should have had vitamin E and C supplementation
2)The study should have had a meta-analysis option
3)The study should have had a control group
4) The studies were all RCTs
5)The studies should focus on the incidence of age-related cataract
6)They should be published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition or The Clinical Journal of Ophthalmology
Note: After we added the search criteria, the study was expanded to 103 publications.The articles that did not fit to our criteria are as follows:
a)They were systematic reviews.
b)They did not have a meta-analysis option.

109,"1. The cost of acute psychiatric inpatient treatment is between 4 and 10 times that of acute psychiatric day hospital treatment, and this difference has been confirmed in a number of studies in the United States and Australia.
  2. Day hospital treatment of acute psychiatric disorders may be preferred to inpatient care because of shorter duration in the day care unit, better prognosis, more rapid return to community, and lower cost than inpatient care.
  3. A large study conducted by the European Psychiatric Association (EPA) compared the effectiveness of acute day hospital treatment and inpatient treatment in a large sample across 5 European countries. The results showed that there was no significant difference between the 2 treatments with respect to clinical symptoms, treatment satisfaction, and quality of life. However, day hospital care was more effective in reducing social disabilities.
Introduction
The use of day hospitals in acute treatment of psychiatric patients has increased throughout the world in the last two decades. Day hospitals are seen as an attractive form of treatment because they cost less and do not disrupt the everyday life of patients , and the evidence from a limited number of randomized controlled trials supports this assumption . Since the early 1990s, day care has been used in a wide variety of services, including crisis units , aftercare day hospitals , intensive day treatment units , and partial day hospitals . Acute day hospital treatment of the most serious cases of mental illness is increasingly discussed because of its clinical effectiveness in reducing readmissions , its cost-effectiveness and efficiency , and its reduced level of restriction and stigma . However, existing knowledge is mainly derived from evaluations of partial open wards or small-scale, intensive day treatment units, and only 1 study, although published in a high-impact journal , has included a significant proportion of patients with psychosis.
Therefore, to establish whether day care has advantages for acutely ill psychiatric patients, we set out in 2000 to conduct a large-scale multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT) in 5 European countries with an acute day hospital. The results in terms of psychopathology, social functioning, and patient satisfaction are reported here, and other results are reported elsewhere .
Methods
The study was carried out during the period December 2000 to September 2003. The countries that were involved in the study were England, Sweden, Switzerland"
110,"Although all studies are interventional in character, their methodology ranges from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, to randomized, double-blind, comparative, to non-randomized, non-blind, open label studies. Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies are the gold standard of investigations in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients as these studies are designed to assess the true effect of an intervention (e.g., aerosolized antibiotic) on the outcomes of interest (e.g., pulmonary function, nutritional status, antibiotic resistance). Because true blinding is difficult to achieve in studies involving aerosolized interventions, double-blind assessment of outcomes is difficult to achieve, and for this reason, patients, clinicians and investigators are generally not blinded to the treatment, but rather the outcome assessors are asked to perform the study assessments blindly in order to reduce bias. The number of patients studied in randomized, placebo-controlled studies in CF ranges from 52 to 400 patients. The duration of the randomized, placebo-controlled periods ranges from twenty-eight days to twenty-four weeks. All randomized, placebo-controlled trials in CF showed similar safety profiles, in that none of these studies reported significant adverse events associated with aerosolized tobramycin delivery. One of the studies, however, suggested an increased risk of respiratory hospitalization in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)-colonized CF patients, but subsequent studies did not confirm these findings. In contrast to randomized, placebo-controlled studies, the number of patients enrolled in randomized, comparative studies of aerosolized tobramycin range from 22 to 54 patients. Randomized, comparative trials comparing aerosolized tobramycin and nebulized colistin have shown improvements in clinical outcomes such as reduction in PA in sputum cultures, lung function, and increased nutritional status in the aerosolized tobramycin group vs. the nebulized colistin group. While aerosolized colistin has been used for many years to treat PA infections, recent studies in neonates and adults have shown that nephrotoxicity may be a significant side-effect of"

A randomized and comparative study will be conducted to identify the most effective drug. Methods: There will be a total of 125 patients in this study, which will be conducted over a period of 6 months. During this time, clinical assessments will be carried out at baseline and then monthly for 6 months. Data will be collected on clinical outcome measures, including clinical global impressions, positive and negative symptoms scores, and the quality of life. In addition, blood samples will be taken at each visit to measure drug levels. The main outcome measure will be the clinical global impressions score, which will be used to classify patients into remission, partial response, or nonresponse. Data will be analyzed using appropriate statistical methods. Results: The results of this study will provide valuable information on the efficacy and safety of different antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. This will help to inform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. Conclusion: This study will provide important information on the effectiveness of different antipsychotic drugs in the treatment of schizophrenia. The results will help to inform clinical practice and improve patient outcomes. We estimate the number of subjects required for the study to be 125.

There is emerging evidence that peer-led, self-directed programs can reduce HIV risks in homosexual men more effectively than programs focused primarily on counseling. By integrating community out-reach into programs aimed at motivating men to make safer or healthier sexual choices, the peer-led prevention approach described here has the potential to reduce HIV incidence by engaging risk-taking young men in interventions at a time when their risk is highest (1-3). Prevention efforts implemented in sexual health clinics have focused almost exclusively on individual risk reduction. The approach described here can complement clinically based programs by providing intervention activities before men first become infected with HIV and engage in sexual health care.

113,"A series of clinical trials are provided to answer the question: What are the effects of psychological treatment on sexual pain in women with endometriosis?
These trials provide varying degrees of evidence for the effectiveness of psychological treatment in reducing sexual pain in women with endometriosis. Overall, the results suggest that psychological treatment may be a useful adjunctive treatment for women with endometriosis who are experiencing sexual pain.

Methods: 
A literature search was conducted to identify relevant studies addressing the effectiveness of psychological treatment on sexual pain in women with endometriosis. The search included publications in English from 1980 through 2022, as well as relevant conference proceedings reports, dissertations, and book chapters. The following databases were searched: PubMed MEDLINE DHHS National Guideline Clearinghouse Cochrane Library ClinicalTrials.gov EBSCOhost Database of Psychological Abstracts EMBASE PsycINFO.
In addition to the literature search, reference lists of relevant articles were examined for additional articles, and key researchers in the field were contacted to identify additional unpublished or ongoing research studies.
The following inclusion criteria were used: 
Studies must be randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least two arms (one receiving psychological treatment and one receiving standard care). 
Studies must examine the efficacy of psychological treatment on sexual pain in women with endometriosis. 
Studies must have been published in English. 
Studies must have been conducted on adults (age 18 or over).

The overall goal is to provide a cohesive summary of the key findings related to specific research questions, combining insights and maintaining the scientific integrity of the original studies. It is important to avoid re-listing the individual study results, instead integrating them into a cohesive discussion."
115,"There were six major studies. Most studies found that babies experienced many benefits when they received KMC rather than hospital care. A few studies found that the benefits were not different depending on how the baby was cared for, but these were small studies.
In summary, KMC is a simple and effective way to care for premature or small babies. It gives very important human contact, and this reduces stress and improves breathing. Mothers find it very rewarding to be able to hold their babies, and the mothers are much more likely to want to breastfeed their baby if they have received KMC. Overall, the evidence suggests that babies grow faster, suffer fewer infections and are more likely to be alive and have normal development at three years of age, if they are cared for in this way in the first few weeks of life.

Taken together, the available data from multiple randomized trials provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of KMC in neonatal care units. It is well established that KMC improves growth and reduces morbidities in low birthweight infants. It is safe, simple, and easily accepted by mothers and families at home. Further research is needed to examine long-term outcomes, to develop models for training health care professionals, and to assess the cost-effectiveness of KMC in different settings."
116,"Treatment modalities such as CPA, spironolactone, and ketoconazole are effective in the treatment of hirsutism in hyperadrogenic hirsutism. Treatment with finasteride, flutamide, and cyproterone acetate are equally effective in decreasing hirsutism, despite different mechanisms of action.
The effect of different pharmacological treatments for hyperandrogenism associated with hirsutism on body composition and lipids was studied to determine whether the metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance are related to hyperandrogenism. Twenty-four otherwise healthy premenopausal women with hyperandrogensim associated with hirsutism (clinical Ferriman–Gallwey score of greater than 15) were enrolled in a prospective double-blinded randomized study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive 100 mg cyproterone acetate and 30 µg ethinyl estradiol daily or 150 µg cyproterone acetate daily, added to 70 mg ketoconazole daily for 6 months of treatment. Control group comprised 11 women with regular menstrual cycles. No abnormalities in mean glucose level during a 2-hour OGTT were detected. Insulin sensitivity (SISI) index was significantly decreased in patients from the ketoconazole group compared with the controls (7.48 +/- 1.5 and 8.51 +/- 1.4, respectively). A significant weight gain (4.46 +/- 2.07 kg), an increase in waist circumference, and a significant decrease in HDL cholesterol, accompanied by a significant increase in the LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio occurred in the group treated with ketoconazole (3.89 +/- 0.43 and 3.3 +/- 0.44, respectively, p < 0.05). No other abnormalities were detected.
Our findings suggest that a low-dose ketoconazole treatment of hyperandrogenic hirsutism can lead to a transient modification of lipid profile and insulin resistance in premenopausal women..

Abstract of study #1:
Abstract:
Objectives: To evaluate sponging and of oral antipyretic therapy to reduce fever. Patients and Methods: Two hundred and twenty-four children aged 6 months to 5 years, with rectal temperatures greater than or equal to 30 degrees (104 degrees F), were randomly treated with sponging alone or with medication including a single oral dose of aspirin 15 mg/kg, or paracetamol 15 mg/kg, or ibuprofen 8 mg/kg. Twenty-three children were excluded from the final analysis because they did not complete the study. Demographic characteristics of the patients were found to be comparable in all groups. Rectal temperatures were recorded every 30 min for a 3 h period. During the first 30 min of intervention, sponging was found to be more effective than all of the three medications. After 60 min, the effects of each medication became superior to sponging with tepid water in reducing body temperature. Twenty-three children were excluded from the final analysis because they did not complete the study. Comparing the effect of the three different medications, it was seen that the antipyretic efficacy of aspirin and ibuprofen were significantly more than paracetamol 3 h after intervention (P < 0.05). For the management of fever over 39 degrees C, it is therefore recommended to give children an antipyretic drug, preferably ibuprofen, and at the same time to begin sponging to provide a rapid and sustained antipyresis.
Abstract of study #2:
Objective: To determine whether antipyretic therapy in young children is associated with potential risks (interference with enhanced host defences at febrile temperatures) or benefits (improved comfort and behaviour), a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of paracetamol was conducted among 225 children 6 months to 6 years of age who presented with acute (less than or equal to 4 days) fever (greater than or equal to 38 degrees C per rectum) without evident bacterial focus of infection.

120,"Overall, from the studies synthesized there seems to be significant evidence that foot orthosis can provide significant short-term improvements in pain and function. There was a consistent finding of the reduction in pain across the studies.
However, the studies were heterogeneous and it is difficult to compare them across studies. There are several ways to explain the inconsistency.
1. Population diversity – the studies included participants with varying demographic and clinical (age, sex, type of diagnosis) characteristics which may have led to varied responses to the intervention.
2. Different types of intervention (different materials/procedure of fabrication, different types of designs) can account for the varied response to the intervention.
3. Different outcome measures can also contribute to the heterogeneity.
4. Length of follow-up varied between studies.
There are a few other limitations of the studies:
1. Small sample size, particularly related to the randomized controlled trial design in study #1 and study #2.
2. Length of follow up was short in some studies.
3. Some studies used non-validated outcome measures.
4. Only one of the studies (study #6) used a blinded procedure (patients did not know what orthotic/intervention they were getting).
5. Most of the studies reported significant improvements short-term but longer-term follow up (more than 12 months) was not reported which limits the interpretation of the results.
It was difficult to assess the quality of the studies included in the review. However, according to our understanding none of the included studies was of high quality.
In summary, although preliminary evidence suggests that foot orthoses can be effective in the management of foot pain, further high-quality studies with large sample sizes are needed to strengthen the evidence supporting the use of custom-made foot orthoses for the treatment of the painful cavus foot or people with hallux valgus, and to provide further support for the use of foot orthoses (with or without night splints) for the management of patients with plantar fasciitis.
It is worth noting that some of the studies included in the review measured and reported the adverse events associated with the use of foot orthoses. However, it is not clear whether adverse effects were reported as a result of the actual orthotic intervention or the general procedure in place for wearing foot orthoses or other devices of similar type.

122,"1. All studies were RCTs, with different doses, routes and timing of administering rLH or rhCG compared with u-hCG. 
2. All studies demonstrated rLH or rhCG are effective, with the same efficacy of u-hCG for inducing final follicular maturation, early luteinization, and ovulation induction for assisted reproductive treatment. 
3. Recombinant hCG are associated with significantly better patient tolerance and thus higher patient acceptability, while there are no statistical differences were found between groups in relation to total number of oocytes retrieved, percentage of mature oocytes, number of injected oocytes, fertilization rates and number of embryos transferred. 
4. No moderate or severe OHSS was reported in patients who received a single dose of rhLH up to 30,000 IU.

123,"The hypothesis of accommodative drive is not so likely. As in all optical experiments, there is a risk that the investigator will be misled should the lenses of the apparatus contain an error, albeit one perhaps in one tenth of the optical power. This applies equally to the experiments of Purves and Smith, to Sclander’s experiments, to those of Gubisch, and so on. The risk is that of overlooking, instead of recognizing and exploiting, the most essential of optical effects.

Background and objective
The literature shows that it is difficult to reach an agreement between the two techniques as their role for minimizing blood loss has not been clearly defined. Several studies have shown that ischemic preconditioning reduces the amount of bleeding in liver surgery, as in other types of surgery . However, most of the articles on preconditioning compare only this technique with the controls, without comparing it with each other. In addition, many of the studies are uncontrolled, without a well-defined sample size calculation. It has also been shown that the reduction in bleeding is not the same with the two techniques . Thus, this study aimed to compare the reduction in bleeding between preconditioning and intermittent vascular occlusion through analyzing articles published in the databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Google scholar. We believe that this analysis will allow a better understanding of the role of each of these techniques and how they compare in reducing the bleeding during liver surgery.

131,"The summary of the collected studies provided key findings and insights into the management of lower urinary tract infection (UTI) during pregnancy. The summary highlights the use of oral antibiotics, such as nitrofurantoin and ampicillin, as a safe and effective treatment for acute UTIs in pregnant women. However, studies have shown mixed results for their effectiveness in treating acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy. Cefuroxime, a second-generation cephalosporin, has been shown to be more effective and tolerable than cephradine, a first-generation cephalosporin, in the treatment of acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy. The use of multiple-dose antibiotic regimens, such as intramuscular ceftriaxone, has been suggested as an option for inpatient treatment but not for outpatient treatment.
The summary also highlights the use of antibiotic suppression for women who have experienced multiple episodes of UTIs during pregnancy. Patients with cystourethritis characterized by the association of symptomatic lower urinary tract infection with low-count bacteriuria (10(2)-10(5) UFC/mL of urine) were found to respond well to treatment with nitrofurantoin or ampicillin. Additionally, the findings suggest that a 10-day course of antibiotics, such as oral nitrofurantoin or ampicillin, is a safe and effective treatment for acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections in pregnant women.
Overall, the summary of the collected studies highlights the need for effective and safe treatment options for lower urinary tract infections during pregnancy.

134,"The study did not find that the Virtual Retinal Display (VRD) technology was universally helpful for all low-vision users. However, for some individuals--and in particular for those with optical low vision--the VRD outperformed a standard cathode ray tube (CRT) monitor. The theoretical explanation for the mixed results is that individuals with high retinal disease and limited retinal reserve were prone to visual overload with the VRD. The implications of these findings are that, with further refinement, VRD-based low-vision aids could have tremendous potential.

Study #10: A Headmounted Display in Low Vision-Is it for Everyone?.. The aim of this study was to examine objectively and subjectively a group of electronic low vision devices (LVD) in daily use of persons with visual problem. Our purpose was to examine their different types, their possible advantages and limitations as well as the personal experiences of the users. A single-centre non-comparative retrospective study was conducted. The LVD we used were electronic magnifying devices, such as Electronic magnifier NuVision®, Magnifier Flipperport®, Zoom magnifier Pupil®, Headmounted Display (HMD) Jordy®, Headmounted Display (HMD) Maxport®, Headmounted Display (HMD) Variofocus®, and Electronic magnifier Tsi Genie®. The study was conducted on a group of 33 patients, who were using these electronic LVD daily. We examined the following: 
1. Reading speed with and without LVD in an optimum situation.
2. The critical print size with and without LVD in an optimum situation.
3. Subjective experience of LVD usage in everyday life.
4. Their acceptance and their opinion about usability of these devices.
Objective
-----------------
We hypothesized that electronic magnifying devices could improve patients' visual acuity, reading speed, and reading comfort. In addition, we assumed that the personal experiences and acceptance of the users of these devices would differ and that there could be differences between the different types of devices.

135,"Prenatal and early environmental allergens reduction, combined with maternal smoking cessation advice, has been suggested as an effective tool for asthma prevention. However, several large randomised trials failed to show any positive effects. Nevertheless, the PREVASC study showed that specific measures to reduce the exposure of the foetus to allergens (such as mite, pet and food allergens) and passively smoking, in high-risk children, significantly reduce bronchial hyperresponsiveness at 18 months of age. Furthermore, in the control group, the prevalence of asthmatic-like bronchial symptoms doubled between 3 and 8 months of age and bronchial hyperresponsiveness increased significantly at 18 months (16). Hence, our study revealed that early exposure to allergens and passively smoking had long-term effects in high-risk children, and that primary prevention is particularly effective in female children..

Study #28: Effect of long-acting beta 2-agonist formoterol on lung hyperresponsiveness in asthma patients. A placebo-controlled study.. To be recruited into this 8-week placebo-controlled, single-blind study, patients had to meet the following criteria: a) history of asthma and a documented FEV(1) or PEFR(maximum) of less than or equal to 80% of the predicted normal values in the preceding twelve months; b) a documented response to an aerosol of bronchodilator; c) a documented reversibility on a short-acting bronchodilator; d) FEV(1) values > or = 50% of predicted normal values; e) symptoms of asthma present at least twice per week; f) 18 years of age or older.

Patients received either formoterol (F) 12 micrograms (mug) twice daily via Turbuhaler (Delivered dose of 9 mug) or a placebo (P) also twice daily via Turbuhaler (P) during 2 consecutive 4-week periods, separated by a 4-week wash out period.

At visits on Days 2, 14, 28, 42, and 56, all patients assessed their asthma symptoms using an Asthma Control Diary (ACDD), they completed a Symptom Diary, assessed lung function, performed a methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge (BPC), and self-administered a rescue dose of the study medication.

Bronchial hyperresponsiveness was established between the ages of 16 and 18 years if the patients had a history of atopy or had evidence of atopy (a positive skin test or a positive in vitro reaction to a common inhalant allergen). Lung hyperresponsiveness was not tested when the methacholine PC(20) exceeded 2.5 mg/ml or when subjects experienced bronchoconstriction with less than or equal to 5% of the maximum methacholine concentration. PC(20) is calculated as the dose of methacholine (in milligrams) required to cause a 20 percent"

139,"Community-based Interventions to Prevent Atherosclerosis Related Disease Atherosclerosis is a process of the gradual, progressive accumulation of lipids and fibrous materials along the sides of our major arteries. Atherosclerosis can be measured in the carotid and femoral arteries and is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease. Although the prevalence of carotid artery disease (CAD) is relatively high, few clinical trials have been shown to be effective in the treatment of atherosclerosis. Given these limitations, an alternative approach for reducing CAD is the use of community-based interventions. Community-based Interventions Community-based interventions provide participants with behavior modification programs which help them control the risk factors associated with heart disease. Over recent years community-based projects have been highly successful in changing certain risk factor behaviors such as smoking and diet . Many community-based interventions are multi-site and target the risk factors associated with coronary artery disease.  However, few have employed strategies to increase the adherence to treatment for CAD or other cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention programs.  Although the prevalence of exercise in the United States has increased over recent years, most individuals do not follow long term exercise programs .  In fact, 66% of individuals who begin an exercise program drop out within six months .  Additionally, few exercise programs employ strategies to keep participants adhering to a regular exercise program.  Although it is clear that community based interventions have been extremely successful in changing CVD risk factors, there continues to be a great deal of room for improvement in the efficacy of these community based interventions. The Stanford Five-City Project In 1980, the Stanford Five-City Project conducted a national survey of residents in four California cities and one non-Californian city.  A key feature of this survey was that it provided information on the frequency in which men and women engaged in various CVD risk factor behaviors. The findings from this study were extremely influential as they provided support for the current dietary guidelines and physical activity guidelines for men and women.  This study also provided important information regarding the efficacy of school based health education curricula. According to the school based curricula, participants were taught that regular physical activity, a diet low in fat, lower amounts of alcohol intake, and"

Baseline characteristics such as age, parity, height, and weight showed no significant differences between two groups. Onset of analgesia was calculated as time from intradermal or epidural injection of local anesthetic to the first pain score less than 4. VAS is a 10 cm visual analogic scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain imaginable. Adequate analgesia is defined as a VAS of less than 3.

400 subjects were randomly assigned to the combined spinal epidural or epidural group. Onset of analgesia was calculated as time from intradermal or epidural injection of local anesthetic to the first pain score less than 3. VAS is a 10 cm visual analogic scale with 0 being no pain and 10 being worst pain imaginable. Adequate analgesia is defined as a VAS of less than 3.

Introduction:
Epidural analgesia has been used for many years to manage labor pain. Despite its numerous benefits, it is associated with several undesired effects. These undesired effects are related to the systemic absorption of local anesthetic (LA) and the high volume of the epidural infusion that causes motor blockade and disruption of the parturients normal body mechanics that may be undesirable to both mother and fetus.. The combined spinal epidural (CSE) technique is considered a safe and effective alternative to conventional epidural analgesia. In CSE, a smaller dose of LA is delivered into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with less systemic absorption of LA compared to epidural analgesia. It provides excellent analgesia with immediate gratification and faster onset compared to epidural analgesia. The immediate response to the intraspinal injection of a small dose results in immediate pain relief, improved patient satisfaction and reduced requirement for additional local anesthetic . Furthermore, CSE has been associated with a lower incidence of pruritus and nausea compared to epidural analgesia . A number of different bupivacaine concentrations, together with fentanyl, have"

144,"Study Summary:: 
Background
-----------------
Myofascial pain is a chronic condition affecting 20 to 50% of the general population. It presents clinically as local and deep pain associated with restricted range of motion, and tenderness to manual palpation around the origin and/or insertion of muscles. Trigger points are the most common source of referred pain in myofascial pain syndrome (MPS). In general, patients with MPS exhibit reduced mandibular ROM due to the presence of pain and other physiological and psychological responses, with the greatest limitation being observed in maximal mouth opening. The most prominent restriction appears to be in protrusive mandibular movement. This could suggest that the lateral pterygoid muscle is particularly vulnerable to the development of MPS. Some authors hypothesize that the muscles of mastication play a role in chronic orofacial muscle pain, such as TMD- related pain, whereas other researchers emphasizes the fact that the presence of pain seems to create a protective state that limits the movement of the masticatory muscles, leading to an abnormal posture and aberrant pain-induced reflex activity of the masticatory muscles.
The etiology of MPS is often multifactorial, with psychological stress, dental trauma, and psychogenic illness being the most frequently identified factors responsible for the development of chronic muscle pain. 
In order to address the impact of psychological stress on pain, studies have been conducted using the application of an occlusal appliance before or during dental treatment to reduce the impact of psychological stress. The results of these studies have been inconsistent, with some authors demonstrating that the use of an occlusal appliance prior to dental treatment is effective in reducing the incidence of pain immediately after treatment, while others have failed to demonstrate this effect. However, these studies may have biased results by their use of an apnea bite technique that could have affected the mandibular position and the movement of the masticatory muscles. In order to circumvent this issue, one study compared the effects on the development of pain during dental treatment when an occlusal appliance and standard dental techniques were used to those in which standard dental techniques were used alone. The results showed that the combination of an occlusal appliance and standard dental techniques did not alter the development of pain.
It should be noted that these studies were not designed to specifically address the impact"
145,"From an empirical research perspective, the task of summarizing is one that is frequently done yet seldom recognized as a distinct subcategory of empirical research. This is most unfortunate since it is just as valid and just as important as any of the primary tasks involved in the empirical research process. It is frequently not mentioned or not explained very often. And, that is a true pity. Why? Because summarizing is an essential task that is necessary for a researcher to successfully execute any of the primary functions of an empirical researcher: (a) writing an empirical research proposal, (b) writing an empirical research report, (c) conducting a meta-analysis, (d) conducting a systematic review, or (e) creating a theory synthesis. Thus, it is not only a necessary task for an empirical researcher, it is also an extremely important task for an empirical researcher since summarizing is such a vital subcomponent of the aforementioned tasks. And, if the researcher doesn’t know how to summarize correctly, it is highly unlikely that he or she will be able to complete the assigned tasks properly.
This is why it is so important that this book not only contains detailed instructions on how to summarize correctly, but that it also explains why summarizing is one of the most important aspects of the empirical research work that a researcher could ever do. And, as will be explained in far more detail later on, one of the things that a researcher should ALWAYS keep in mind whenever he or she is attempting to summarize anything is that he or she should never leave ANYTHING out of a complete and accurate summary. To learn a few more things about this topic, I strongly recommend that you pay very close attention to one of the research methodology textbooks that are listed on page 18 of this book, especially if you are interested in summarizing the main research findings that are reported in a book, a journal article, or a webpage.
How To Summarize Correctly
The first step in the summarization process is to make darn sure that you really understand exactly what it is that you are attempting to summarize. This is important because, unless you have a solid understanding of what you are summarizing, it is highly unlikely that you will be able to summarize it very well. This is why it is so important for you to learn how to summarize things correctly instead of summarizing them"
146,"The provided abstracts contain important insights into the effectiveness of naltrexone in treating opioid dependence. The key themes in the abstracts include the following:
• Patient Response to Naltrexone: The studies highlight that naltrexone can help patients maintain abstinence from opioids by blocking their euphoric effects and reducing cravings. However, it is crucial to note that naltrexone is not effective for all patients and that there are potential adverse effects, particularly insomnia and hyperexcitability. Therefore, patients should be carefully screened for suitability before initiating naltrexone treatment.
• Naltrexone Pharmacotherapy for Opioid Dependent Federal Probationers: The study found that a combination of naltrexone and drug counseling showed greater effectiveness than counseling alone, especially in reducing drug use. These results suggest that the use of naltrexone in a comprehensive treatment plan can be highly effective, with 66.7% of patients who began with naltrexone remaining opioid-free compared to 62.1% of the control group.
• Naltrexone plus benzodiazepine aids abstinence in opioid-dependent patients: The study showed that the addition of benzodiazepine to naltrexone can help patients sleep better, which may in turn improve treatment outcomes. Furthermore, a combination of naltrexone and benzodiazepine can be particularly effective in patients who experience severe withdrawal symptoms.
• [Naltrexone--an effective aid in the psychosocial rehabilitation process of former opiate dependent patients]: This study found that naltrexone can be effective in reducing drug use and improving treatment outcomes, especially when combined with social and psychological support. The combination of naltrexone and therapy can help patients achieve and maintain sobriety, leading to overall improvements in mental and physical health.
• A naltrexone double blind placebo controlled study in Israel: The study found that naltrexone did not appear to be superior to the placebo when it came to retaining patients in treatment or maintaining opioid-free conditions. This suggests that naltrexone may not be the most effective treatment for all patients with opioid dependence.

147,"Overall survival in the 4 studies is highly comparable. However, there was a trend for better survival in Study #1 and Study #4 than in Study #2 and Study #3, respectively. The reason for this is not clear. It may be because of differences in the baseline characteristics of the patients or because of the lack of randomization of patients to the CSP plus PSE vs CSP alone arm in Study #1, or a combination of both.
Study #6 did not report on overall survival.
The results of these studies suggest that the addition of PSE does not have a positive impact on the incidence of acute or chronic GVHD or event-free or overall survival.
A study conducted by the Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) Center at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) also evaluated the role of PSE in the prophylaxis of GVHD. However, the study did not follow the conventional CSP/MTX GVHD prophylaxis regimen but, instead, compared CSP to CSP plus prednisolone (MP) using 6 vs 12 months of treatment, respectively. In the control arm, PSE was given in 4 patients (74%). The results of this study also do not support the addition of PSE to the GVHD prophylaxis regimen for improving the outcomes of patients undergoing allogeneic HCT.
Incidence of acute GVHD in Studies #2-6 is variable, ranging from 19% in Study #2 to 64% in Study #6. Study #6 does not appear to have provided any explanation for the variability in incidence, but this may be related to the baseline characteristics of the patients (i.e. age, gender, underlying diagnosis, etc.). Notably, incidence of acute GVHD in Studies #3 and #5 is relatively high, which could be because of the different formulations of steroids/MP in these studies (i.e. intravenous infusion and daily injections for first 20 days and gradual taper of dosage in Study #3 vs intramuscular injections in Study #5).
In conclusion, the results of this study show that the addition of PSE to the cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen used for GVHD prophylaxis was associated with"
148,"What is the research question?
-----------------
We compare the effectiveness of naltrexone based interventions in reducing opioid overdose.

How is the research question addressed?
-----------------
We use a quasi-experimental pre post design. This design is used because there are no true control groups. We compared number of opioid and other drug overdoses in a large cohort of heroin dependent persons (before and after treatment with a sustained release naltrexone implant) in WA Data Linkage (a large, de-identified administrative linked data base maintained by WA Health Statistics Research group). We further analysed results from this cohort by comparing results from patients who have also received treatment with oral naltrexone in the past.  Finally, we use a retrospective case control study.

What are the anticipated results?
-----------------
The results show a reduction in opioid related overdoses after using naltrexone based interventions. There are also more sedative overdoses. These observations are in line with evidence that naltrexone has effects in non-opioid using populations.

Are the anticipated results supported by existing knowledge?
-----------------
The study results are consistent with the existing pharmacokinetic data on this implant, which indicates maintenance of blood naltrexone levels at or above 2 ng/ml for approximately 6 months. 

What are the potential implications of the planned research?
-----------------
The findings support the clinical efficacy of this sustained release naltrexone implant in preventing opioid overdose in heroin dependent patients. However, given the high prevalence of poly-substance use among dependent heroin users, programs offering this type of treatment should also focus on preventing, detecting and managing poly-substance use.

Who are the main intended users/beneficiaries of the research?
-----------------
Research has shown benefits of naltrexone implants, both in terms of abstinence from opioids and the impact on hospital presentations for overdose. These findings are expected to benefit researchers, clinicians and policymakers working to treat opioid dependent individuals.

150,"From the summary of the studies, it seems that low-dose topical delivery of all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), 9-cis-retinoic acid (aliretinoin), and 4-hydroxyphenylretinamide (4-HPR) for 4 days to women with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) II/III did not show significant efficacy compared to the placebo group. These treatments were not effective in preventing progression of low-grade SIL to high-grade lesions or cervical cancer. However, there was a high rate of histological regression in biopsied CIN II/III patients.

The side effects reported in the studies varied. AtRA treatment for 4 days was effective in inducing regression in CIN II cervical biopsies, but not in CIN III, and was associated with mild and reversible local side effects. However, the regression rate of low-grade SIL with isotretinoin in HIV-positive women was not significantly different from the observation group. Headache was the most common clinical side effect of aliretinoin and was experienced more frequently in the high-dose aliretinoin group. In the 4-HPR treatment group, toxicity was not significant compared to the placebo group.
There are some limitations in the presented studies that should be considered:
•	Sample size: The sample size in the clinical trials was relatively small, and the results may not be generalizable to a wider population.
•	Duration of treatment: The duration of treatment in the clinical trials was relatively short, and the long-term effects of the treatments were not evaluated.
•	Compliance: Compliance with the treatment regimen was not assessed in all the studies, which may have affected the results.
•	Placebo effect: The placebo effect may have contributed to the results, and the lack of significant differences in some of the studies may be due to placebo effect rather than the efficacy of the treatments."

Research  questions/Hypotheses
To assess whether telemedicine has advantages over usual care in terms of the quality of information delivered to patients
To analyse the influence of telemedicine on the clinical outcomes and the costs of healthcare in comparison to usual care strategies
Brief description of methods
The authors reviewed the studies based on information retrieved using the Medline, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature. We also searched through the abstracts of the conference proceedings of the American Medical Informatics Association and the proceedings of the AMIA Symposium on Telemedicine and the proceedings/abstracts of the 1st European Conference on Telemedicine and Telecare held in Prague 11-14 December 2001.
A total of 15 studies were identified which met various inclusion criteria in terms of the technology used and the patient population, with respect to both the quality of information delivered to patients and its influence on clinical outcomes and costs of healthcare.
Six studies dealt with videoconferencing technology. The other studies were mainly concerned with monitoring or controlling of the cardiovascular, respiratory and muscular system parameters.
Five of the selected publications presented significant clinical advantages or improved outcomes of the intervention group, four showed no advantages, whereas six of the reviewed publications reported cost reductions of various telemedical systems.
The main limitation of telemedicine technologies remains the lack of direct human to human contact and this is not likely to allow a full diagnosis of patients.
Our conclusion about telemedicine is that its clinical and cost effectiveness, as well as its clinical outcomes remain to be demonstrated."

157,"Quinine is a bitter alkaloid that has several pharmacological properties, namely cardiac and CNS, but also antimalarial activities. It is used in oral, intramuscular, and intravenous formulations for the treatment of moderately severe, severe, and uncomplicated malaria in patients older than 6 months old or who weigh more than 5 kg. Pharmacokinetic data from healthy volunteers have shown that quinine is rapidly absorbed and widely distributed to tissues and body fluids, including breast milk. This leads to high plasma concentration that can be detected for up to 12 hours after administration. Furthermore it has been found that the plasma concentrations of quinine are higher in children than in adults for an equivalent dosage. The drug is excreted in urine and feces, and its half-life is 10 to 12 hours. The half-lives of quinine can vary greatly in children, depending on several factors, including age, body weight, plasma protein concentration, pathophysiology, and hepatic and renal function. The plasma protein binding for quinine ranges from 28 to 50% in children. The drug is contraindicated in patients with severe allergic reaction to the Cinchonaceae alkaloids, who have cardiac arrhythmia, long QT syndrome, or who are on drugs that prolong the QT interval, such as verapamil, methadone, or cilostazol. In addition, quinine must be avoided by patients with severe liver or kidney impairment, myasthenia gravis, and/or Parkinson's disease. Quinine is a potential teratogen, hence it is best avoided by pregnant women. In healthy volunteers, the most common side effects of quinine include itching, headache, gastrointestinal upset, nausea, and abdominal discomfort; however, neurological side effects are reported in children.  Quinine should be used with caution in combination with non-selective mono-amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI), such as isocarboxazid, selegiline, and tranylcypromine, due to risk of hypertensive crisis and serotonin syndrome. It is suggested to start isocarboxazid, selegiline,"

Brief Summary
-----------------
Work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WRMSD) are a global health problem, causing significant pain, disability, and healthcare costs. Workplace interventions have shown to be effective in reducing the incidence of WRMSD and improving patient outcomes. This systematic review aims to synthesize the scientific literature on workplace factors and their impact on patient outcomes. The review will focus on interventions that target specific occupational or environmental factors and their impact on functional status, pain, and disability.

Detailed Description
-----------------
The prevalence of work-related pain has been steadily rising in recent years, with over 550 million people globally experiencing work-related pain according to data from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study 2020. This represents an increase of 45% since the year 2004. Work-related pain can range from mild to chronic, and it can be caused by a variety of occupational factors, including physical, chemical, biological, and psychosocial factors. Physical factors include factors related to the physical environment, such as the layout of the workplace, the type of equipment being used, and the amount of physical activity involved in the job. Chemical factors include exposure to harmful chemicals or substances, such as solvents or pesticides. Biological factors include exposure to biologic agents, such as allergens or microorganisms. Psychosocial factors include factors related to workplace relationships and communication, such as job satisfaction, social support, and work demand. Workplace interventions are interventions that target specific occupational factors and aim to reduce the incidence of WRMSD and improve patient outcomes. Several studies have shown that workplace interventions can be an effective way to prevent and manage WRMSD, and they can also reduce healthcare costs. The interventions can be tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the workplace, and they can be implemented at different stages of the employment cycle. Interventions can target specific occupational factors, such as physical factors, or they can be more comprehensive and address multiple factors. The ultimate goal of workplace interventions is to create a safe and healthy workplace that promotes optimal patient outcomes"
159,"There is a collection of studies that shows the value of a multimodal approach to care following major elective colon surgery. These studies describe an array of patient outcomes that are generally improved with a multimodal approach. This includes faster return of bowel function to tolerance for food intake through the mouth, earlier mobility, lower rates of complications, and shorter hospital stays.


A summary of these studies follows:

Study #1: Fast-track in open intestinal surgery: prospective randomized study (Clinical Trials Gov Identifier no. NCT00123456).
This study investigated the impact of a fast-track protocol on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing open bowel resection. The primary outcome was length of stay (LOS).

In total, 103 patients were enrolled in the study and randomized to the fast-track group (FT group) or control group (non-FT group).

Patients in the FT group were administered an interdisciplinary fast-track protocol, which involved a combination of preoperative and postoperative strategies to promote early recovery and reduce LOS. This protocol included a range of interventions, such as prophylactic antibiotics, intravenous fluid management, enhanced analgesia, early rehabilitation, and optimized nutritional support.

Patients in the non-FT group received standard-of-care management.

The results showed that patients in the FT group had significantly shorter LOS compared to the non-FT group (median seven days compared to ten days, P < 0.001).

Additionally, in the FT group, there was a significant reduction in postoperative pain, improved rehabilitation, faster restoration of GI functions, and fewer postoperative complications.

Study #2: Randomized clinical trial of multimodal optimization of surgical care in patients undergoing major colonic resection.
This study investigated the impact of a multimodal optimization strategy on postoperative outcomes in patients undergoing major colonic resection.

In this double-blind parallel-group randomized controlled trial, 31 patients were randomized to receive the multimodal optimization protocol while 32 patients were treated according to the standard postoperative care.

The optimization protocol included a"
160,"There are known adverse events associated with Erythropoiesis Stimulating Agents (ESA) which appear independent of HGF/c-MET pathway activity and may be more severe in patients with malignancy. These adverse events include deep vein thrombosis (DVT), arterial/cardiovascular events, and thromboembolic events."
161,"The results of the clinical trials included in this summary are mixed with respect to the potential effectiveness of antibiotic prophylaxis for IUD insertion in reducing the risk of post-insertion pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and the associated medical visits associated with PID and other IUD-related complications.

Study #1 (IUD Study Group) and Study #5 (Nazifi et al.) found no significant reduction in the frequency of post-insertion medical visits or cases of PID between the antibiotic-treated and placebo-treated groups, whereas Study #4 (Gottlieb et al.) showed a marginal decrease in post-insertion morbidity associated with the use of prophylactic doxycycline.

Overall, although the evidence remains inconclusive, there appears to be some indication that the use of prophylactic doxycycline may modestly reduce the rate of PID and related complications after IUD insertion. Given the potential severity of IUD-related PID and the associated negative health outcomes, further research is needed to clarify the efficacy of antibiotic prophylaxis in this context.
The current research study aims to evaluate this approach through the use of a 200 mg dose of doxycycline given orally one hour before IUD insertion in comparison with a placebo control group which will receive no prophylaxis. This will enable a more precise assessment of the potential benefits or harms of such an approach for preventing PID and other IUD-related complications following IUD insertion.
The specific aim of this research study is to assess the efficacy of prophylactic antibiotic administration in preventing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and other complications among female IUD users in Kenya. The goal is to determine if a 200 mg dose of Doxycycline prescribed orally at the time of IUD insertion can reduce the occurrence of PID and unplanned IUD-related visits to the clinic.
The null hypothesis is that the administration of prophylactic doxycycline does not significantly reduce the occurrence of PID or unplanned IUD-related visits to the clinic compared to a placebo control group. By testing this hypothesis, the proposed research can provide valuable insights into the potential benefits"
162,"Although there is some variation in study conclusions, no study provided evidence that methotrexate treatment provides a statistically significant reduction in steroid-requiring asthmatics. There is no evidence that the effect on dosing is consistent throughout these studies. The data show that although there is a reduction in daily steroid requirement, most of the studies show that this is minor. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that methotrexate can significantly reduce steroid requirements in a significant number of asthmatics..

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Short term effect of methotrexate in severe steroid-dependent asthma.. The steroid-sparing capacity of methotrexate in asthmatics is still being debated. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of low-dose methotrexate on steroid consumption in patients with severe asthma, who require very high doses of systemic corticosteroids. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, parallel clinical trial in 24 patients with long-standing asthma. After a 3-week run-in period, patients received a 16-week course of either 15 mg of oral methotrexate weekly or matched placebo in addition to their previous asthma therapy. The daily steroid dose (at run-in 30 +/- 14 mg/day in the methotrexate group; 25 +/- 9 mg/day in the placebo group (NS)) decreased by 24% in the methotrexate group (p < 0.01) and by 5% in the placebo group (NS) during weeks 9-16 of the treatment period when compared with run-in values. However, there was no difference in steroid consumption between the two groups at any time. We conclude that in patients with severe"

165,"The findings from the provided study abstracts generally suggest that there is not sufficient evidence to support the use of evening primrose oil (EPO) / gamma linolenic acid (GLA) as an effective treatment option for atopic eczema (AE) in children. Although some studies showed initial promise for the use of EPO / GLA, none of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were able to demonstrate a significant difference in improvement between the EPO / GLA group and the placebo group in AE patients. 
The overall effect of EPO / GLA treatment on clinical outcomes in RCTs was not statistically significant for reducing severity scores, improving symptoms, or reducing topical steroid use. Some of the included studies did note improvements in subgroups of patients (e.g., those with higher baseline levels of GLA or those with concurrent allergic asthma), but this was not consistently observed across studies. 
Furthermore, the studies did not report any adverse side effects associated with EPO / GLA treatment, suggesting that it is generally well-tolerated. 
In summary, the current body of evidence suggests that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of EPO / GLA as a primary treatment option for AE in children. More high-quality RCTs are needed to determine whether there is a specific subgroup of patients who may benefit from this treatment."

Youth smoking has been linked to tobacco advertising receptivity. However, results of prospective longitudinal studies are limited. This study aimed to explore the effects of pro-smoking movie scenes and advertising receptivity on smoking status.

Objective: -----------------
In this study, we aimed to explore the effects of exposure to movie smoking and tobacco marketing receptivity on adolescent smoking onset and progression.
Methods:
This cross-sectional study used data pooled from five surveys collected as part of the North American International Tobacco Control Policy Evaluation (ITC) Project – ITC New England (NEN). NEN included three population-based random samples of adolescents aged 10–14 years in northern New England. In 1999, a cross-sectional survey was administered to 6681 adolescents. In 2000 and 2001 two longitudinal follow-up surveys were administered to 4524 of this sample: 3913 participants provided 12‐month retention; 2603 provided retention at 24 months.
Introduction
Smoking is the leading cause of preventable deaths in high-income nations, as well as in lower- and middle-income countries . It also contributes to global economic burden, such as healthcare and productivity costs. Exposure to pro-smoking advertising is a key factor behind the increase in smoking prevalence among adolescents from lower to higher socio-economic backgrounds . This association between pro-smoking advertising exposure and increased smoking prevalence was first explored by US public health authorities in the second half of the 20th Century . Smoking prevalence increased drastically among adolescents during the 1960s and 1970s, paralleling the rapid growth of the tobacco industry. The tobacco industry and advocates have contested the link between the growth of pro-smoking advertising and increases in smoking prevalence . They argue that the observed increase in smoking prevalence was the result of a greater propensity for consumption among the more affluent segments of society . Conversely, the US Surgeon General's 1964 report, established that the growth of pro-smoking advertising caused the rise in smoking prevalence .

Introduction
Oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) is a potentially painful and debilitating fungal infection that commonly afflicts patients with HIV/AIDS, hematological malignancy and a variety of other clinical conditions. With recent advances in antifungal therapy, it is possible to cure approximately 80% of patients with OPC using either fluconazole or itraconazole.  In this prospective comparative randomized study, we compare efficacy, tolerability, and cost of using itraconazole and fluconazole for the treatment of oro-pharyngeal candidiasis in patients with advanced cancer.
Material and Methods
Patients
This prospective comparative randomized study was designed to evaluate itraconazole versus fluconazole therapy for oro-pharyngeal candidiasis. All patients had refractory solid malignancy with at least two courses of chemotherapy for local or metastatic disease with concomitant oro-pharyngeal infection with Candida sp. Patients were included in the study if they had the following: i) age ?18, ii) adequate hematologic and renal functions, iii) proven solid tumor, iv) OPC with moderate to severe dysphagia, iii) Candida species on oral culture, iv) documented radiographic evidence of solid tumor, and v) signed informed consent for study participation.
Primary End Points: The study endpoint was clinical and mycological cure at 2 weeks using the guidelines of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Candidiasis Study Group (1). Clinical cure was defined as a decrease in dysphagia or disappearance of mucosal lesions with no new lesions. Mycological cure was defined by the presence of no microscopic evidence and no growth of Candida species on culture of either a swab of oral lesions or salivary cultures.

Additional studies are needed in this area as more research is required before recommendations can be made for clinical implementation.
In this research protocol, a pilot experiment was conducted to explore the effectiveness of incremental speed-dependent treadmill training on postural instability, dynamic balance and fear of falling in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The results showed that this intervention was effective in improving postural instability and fear of falling.
A second pilot study was also conducted to identify the effects of high-intensity exercise on functional performance and corticomotor excitability in people with early Parkinson's disease (PD). The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of high-intensity exercise on motor performance and corticomotor excitability in people with early Parkinson's disease (PD). The results showed that high-intensity exercise can lengthen corticomotor excitability and improve motor performance in people with PD.
In a third pilot study, we examined whether treadmill training with body weight support is beneficial in improving ambulation speed and stride length. The results showed that this intervention can improve ambulation speed and stride length in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
We also conducted a fourth pilot study to assess the effects of high-intensity exercise on motor function in people with PD. The results showed that high-intensity exercise can improve motor function in people with PD.
In a fifth pilot study, we examined whether treadmill training with body weight support is effective in improving functional outcome and ambulation speed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The results showed that this intervention can improve functional outcome and ambulation speed in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).
The findings of this pilot study suggest that treadmill training with body weight support may be effective in improving motor function in people with PD. Future research is needed to determine the long-term effects of this intervention on motor function in people with PD.

Study #1: Assessment of the value of treatment with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: a randomized clinical trial..
Abstract:
Background: Induction chemotherapy for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is intense and includes 2 distinct phases: a phase to induce remission (Induction Blocks, IBs) and the second phase to increase the likelihood of remission success and to consolidate it (Second and Third Induction Blocks, SIBs and TIBs). Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (G‐CSF) can reduce the duration of the second phase of induction chemotherapy. Objective: We conducted a randomized clinical trial to assess the value of treatment with G‐CSF in children with newly diagnosed ALL. Methods: Patients of Sina Children Hospital were randomized into two groups of 20 each. One group received G‐CSF (5.5 micrograms/kg subcutaneously and daily), and the other received placebo, from day 5 to day 11 of the second phase and from day 19 to day 25 of the third phase of induction therapy. The primary outcomes were the evaluation of the number of days of fever (temperature >/=38.5C) and the number of days with neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) </=1x109/l). Secondary outcomes were to evaluate the number of days without fever, number of days without neutropenia, number of days of hospitalization, number of days of antibiotics, and frequency of positive bacterial cultures, as well as complete neutrophil count recovery (ANC >2x109/l in 3 consecutive days)."

Study #10: The impact of integrated and unintegrated care on HIV outcomes for pregnant women with known HIV and antenatal care attendance in Cape Town, South Africa: a cluster-randomised trial.
Abstract:
BACKGROUND: Integrated HIV services are increasingly offered to pregnant women and their children. However, the benefits for maternal and infant HIV outcomes remain unstudied in the African context of a high HIV prevalence and burden. DESIGN: A cluster‐randomised trial comparing 90 HIV‐positive pregnant women at each of 20 health facilities from 1 October 2008 to 30 September 2009 in Cape Town, South Africa. Four facilities had integrated (INT) HIV services and 16 control facilities (CTRL) continued to offer nonintegrated (UNINT) services during the trial. HIV outcomes for both the mother (composite end point of HIV transmission, death, or loss to follow‐up [LTFU] by four months after delivery) and the infant (any HIV infection and death or LTFU) were assessed using Kaplan‐Meier and log‐rank testing. RESULTS: 1719 women in INT facilities and 408 in CTRL facilities delivered during the trial. Mother‐to‐child HIV transmission in INT and CTRL were 8.7% and 10.4%, respectively (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.39‐1.76). HIV‐infected women and HIV‐infected infants did not differ significantly by facility type. The RRs for infant outcomes in INT versus CTRL were 1.16 (95% CI 0.56‐2.39) for death by four months postpartum, 0.57 (95% CI 0.22‐1.44) for LTFU, and 1.33 (95% CI 0.55‐3.28) for any HIV infection.

175,"Introduction: Acute lung injury (ALI) and the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are important respiratory complications associated with critical illness. ALI and ARDS are marked by increased vascular permeability and pulmonary edema, and they can lead to respiratory failure, multiple organ dysfunction, and death. Current therapies to treat the hypoxemia associated with ALI and ARDS include prone positioning, high positive end-expiratory pressure, fluid restriction, and increased use of surfactant. More recently, use of inhaled high concentrations of nitric oxide (iNO) has been suggested to reduce pulmonary arterial pressure and improve oxygen availability by increasing the fraction of the arterial alveolar gradient. iNO concentrations used in patients with ALI and ARDS range from 2 to 40 ppm. In one phase III randomised multicenter study, administration of iNO for 30 days reduced the incidence of severe respiratory failure, but it did not improve survival.

Study Description:
-----------------
Forty-one adult patients with ALI and ARDS were randomly allocated to receive either iNO or low-flow oxygen for up to 30 days in the setting of critical illness. Patients were included if they were able to tolerate the test doses of iNO; if their PaO2/FIO2 ratio did not improve by more than 25% after 24 hours; if they had no contraindications to the use of inhaled NO. Patients were treated with iNO in a randomized, controlled, open-label trial. The patients were blinded to their assigned treatment. Nitric oxide was delivered by high-flow humidified oxygen at a concentration of 20 ppm or less via a ventilator circuit at a gas flow rate of up to 3 l/min. iNO was continued for up to 30 days or until death.

There is now a growing interest in using [18F]-FDG PET in the assessment of tumor responses upon immunotherapies and in the monitoring of antigen specific immune responses, in vitro and in vivo. Tumor antigen specific immunotherapy stimulates the immune response, which may lead to tumor shrinkage and /or reduced metabolic activity. Although tumors shrink mainly as a result of apoptosis, a complete tumor lysis is only observed in patients where an intense memory response has been elicited with a successful clearance of the tumor cells by the immune effector mechanisms. Monitoring the course in time on the metabolic activity of the tumor by PET and/or SPECT may therefore prove essential in the evaluation of immunotherapeutics.

This study is designed to evaluate the PET responses to the therapeutical E75 vaccine, already shown to have a high safety profile and with demonstrated clinical activity. With this study we aim to establish whether the response profile observed on PET imaging is in line with the clinical response profile, and thus whether [18F]-FDG PET can predict the outcome of treatment and eventually become a non-invasive tool for stratifying disease progression upon immunotherapy treatment.

Objective
-----------------
Evaluation of the PET response in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with E75, a vaccine targeting the human tumor antigen hTERT (for hTERT, please refer to the study protocol).

Design
-----------------
Single centre observational study in patients with recurrent ovarian cancer, treated with E75. Before and 12 weeks after the start of immune therapy with E75, all patients have a [18F]-FDG PET/CT with the GE Advance Tomograph.


Study Population
-----------------
Patients enrolled in this study are women with recurrent ovarian cancer for which treatment with E75 has been initiated, according to the local standard of care. All patients have to provide written informed consent prior to study entry. Enrolment is only allowed after the patient has fulfilled the diagnostic"
180,"87 patients with chronic schizophrenia or other chronic psychotic disorders in whom 15 to 90 days of remission had been induced by acute treatment with reserpine (0.52 to 2.98 mg/day) or chlorpromazine (1.84 to 29.02 mg/day) were randomly assigned to chlorpromazine (1.38-29.02 mg/day) or reserpine (0.39-0.8 mg/day) and received treatment for 18.8 to 67.8 months in a multicentre double-blind study. There were significantly more relapses in the reserpine-treated patients than in the patients continuing to receive chlorpromazine, although this difference was not statistically significant in the patients whose remission had been induced by reserpine or chlorpromazine. Relapses occurred more frequently in patients who had received reserpine than in those who had been treated with chlorpromazine. Chlorpromazine-treated patients who experienced a relapse were more likely to regain remission than patients who had been receiving reserpine. The findings suggest a better prophylactic effect of chlorpromazine than of reserpine in the maintenance treatment of patients with schizophrenia or other chronic psychotic disorders.."
181,"1. These studies demonstrate that functional appliances such as Twin Block, Herbst, Bionator, and Bass appliances can significantly correct Class II malocclusion. 
2. These appliances have varying degrees of skeletal and dental effects, with functional aspects potentially contributing to treatment outcomes. 
3. A systematic analysis of the findings from these studies provides insights into the mechanisms underlying these effects, and offers potential avenues for further research into the development and application of more effective treatment methods for Class II malocclusion.
1) First, all these appliances produce significant skeletal changes in the treatment of Class II malocclusion. This is evidenced by improvements in maxillary and mandibular length observed in all these groups, as well as an increase in lower face height in the Bionator and Twin Block groups. These effects are crucial factors in correcting skeletal Class II malocclusion.
2) Second, functional changes could be another contributing factor. The Bionator and Twin Block groups showed significant improvements in mandibular forward growth and reduced overjet, likely due to the activation of masticatory muscles. Similarly, the Bass group demonstrated a decrease in the proclination of the lower labial segment as a result of the posterior positioning of the lower anterior teeth.
Overall, these findings highlight the importance of considering functional as well as skeletal factors in the treatment of Class II malocclusion, and underscore the potential benefits of functional appliances in achieving optimal treatment outcomes.
3) Third, a systematic analysis of these studies also provides insight into the effectiveness of various functional appliances. For example, the Herbst appliance showed lower treatment failures than the Twin Block group, while the Twin Block group required fewer appointments for repairs compared to the Herbst group. Additionally, the Bass group showed minimal changes in the inclination of the upper incisors, suggesting that this appliance may be better suited for patients with a high risk of proclination.
4) Fourth, a broader comparative analysis of these studies could also contribute to our understanding of the effectiveness of various modalities in the treatment of Class II malocclusion. Furthermore, further research with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods would be useful in establishing definitive conclusions regarding the long-term effectiveness of these appliances and the mechanisms underlying these effects.
Conclusion: Class II malocclusion can be effectively treated with functional appliances"
182,"Abstract #1: Efficacy and safety of long-acting glatiramer monomethate acetate in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis: results from the three-year extension phase of the randomized phase 3 VITALITY study.
Background: Treatment options are limited for patients with CIS or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and there is an unmet need for long-acting self-injectable therapies that demonstrate effectiveness in reducing disease activity and providing sustained efficacy. Patients who enroll in long-term extension (LTE) studies can maintain the initial treatment effect observed during the RCT phase. Methods: In Phase 3 study VITALITY (NCT02548481), 970 patients with RRMS or CIS received monthly placebo for a 6-month run-in period followed by 12 months of 40-μg GA monomethacetate (MMAC) and 160-μg GA MMAC; and 26-μg or 15-μg MMAC every month or every 3 months (EO) during a 12-month treatment period. Following 12 months of treatment with GA MMAC during the RCT, patients without any protocol-specified major protocol deviation were eligible to enter the LTE. Patients received GA MMAC 40-μg or 20-μg (GA LT) every 3 months or 160-μg/40-μg GA MMAC EO during a 24-month LTE. The safety and efficacy of GA LT were analyzed and reported separately. During Phase 3, the key endpoint was annualized relapse rate (ARR). Patients with any confirmed relapse were retreated with 40-μg GA MMAC every 2 weeks for a total of 24 weeks. Results: At the VITALITY open-label Phase 3 entry visit, 786 patients (419/357 GA 160-μg/40-μg and 367 on 40-μg GA) entered the LTE. 704 patients with available"
183,"These two studies suggest that the use of dietitians to decrease blood cholesterol is more effective than using a diet fact sheet. This could be attributed to several reasons. One possible reason is that the dietitians provide better interventions. Another possibility, however, is that the dietitians provide better interventions because they are dietitians who have training in nutrition care. The diet fact sheets could also be improved in order to provide effective advice that can be used to help people decrease their blood cholesterol without having to provide extensive advice from a dietitian. Other studies have shown that the use of technology, like computers, to provide health advice can be just as effective as in-person health advice (10). This is likely due to an enhanced ability of the computer to communicate the same health message to many people. In addition, it is likely that people are more willing to follow the advice of a computer, because they do not feel judged in the same way that they feel judged by a human being. Overall, it appears that using computers to provide information about lifestyle changes may be more effective and may also reduce health care costs.


Study 3 – Reduction of blood cholesterol levels with a cholesterol-lowering dietary advice compared to medical treatment with a statin-like lipid lowering fact sheet provided with no intervention during two years follow-up. 
Study Summary
=================
Lay Summary:: Patients with peripheral vascular disease (PAD) are known to have an increased risk of cardiovascular heart disease (CHD), type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia. In this study, the investigators aimed to compare the effects of two different dietary interventions with one lipid-lowering medication (simvastatin) on the metabolic profile in patients with PVD. The study results demonstrated that the metabolic changes with the statin, including blood pressure, blood glucose, and blood lipids are the same whether the patients are treated with a diet or the statin medication. This also suggests that patients with PVD, who are unable to tolerate statins, may be offered alternative treatments.

185,"This study examines the effect of participation in a competitive endurance training program (ET) on self-concept and peer approval factors in adolescent males. Specifically, the authors investigate the impact of ET on the five dimensions of self-concept (personal, academic, physical, moral, and social), as well as peer approval factors in the areas of athletic ability, social acceptance, and physical appearance. They also explore the relationships between the study variables. The study was conducted with 28 adolescent males from the general population, randomly assigned to an ET group or a control group. The ET group participated in a 5-week training program supervised by a certified instructor, while the control group engaged in regular physical education activities. The study employed a pretest-posttest design with a waitlist control group. At the conclusion of the study, the authors found that the ET group experienced significant improvement in self-concept and peer approval in all study dimensions (except physical appearance), and that the ET group experienced greater improvement in these variables than the control group. The study also found that the ET group exhibited greater improvement in self-concept and peer approval than the controls. The results suggest that a competitive ET program significantly enhances adolescents' overall self-concept and peer approval in different dimensions, especially in the areas of athletic ability and social acceptance. These findings provide valuable insights into ways to enhance adolescents' self-esteem and adjustment to social settings through participation in competitive endurance training programs..

Introduction: Antisocial personality disorder has been a well-documented prognostic factor for pharmacotherapy of other psychiatric and substance use disorders. This study aims to explore whether medication treatment affects substance use in antisocial personality disorder patients diagnosed with substance use disorders. Methods: The effects of psychoactive substance use during 90-days of treatment on antisocial personality disorder patients (based on DSM-IV criteria) were observed in a group of patients undergoing 3-month inpatient treatment in a public general hospital, with and without antisocial personality disorder, including male and female patients diagnosed with any substance use disorder. In this study, the patients will be followed for 3 months after treatment or discharge. A range of demographic and clinical factors will be used to identify how treatment may have worked to change any psychoactive substance use among the patients. Results: The study findings show that the antisocial personality disorder group showed a statistically significant increase in frequency of alcohol use, but the group without the antisocial personality disorder did not show any significant increase or decrease in frequency of alcohol use. However, among the patients with antisocial personality disorder, they did have a significantly increased risk of smoking marijuana after treatment. Both groups showed no significantly increased or decreased risk of smoking other psychoactive substances (such as tobacco, amphetamine, methamphetamine, cocaine, opiates, MDMA) after treatment, according to the urine and blood testing. Conclusions: Treatment of patients with antisocial personality disorder as part of a substance use disorder treatment could help them decrease their alcohol consumption."

Bacteriuria is an independent risk factor for kidney disease. The natural cranberry juice is used as a folk remedy to counteract bacteriuria.
Cranberry juice exerts antiadhesive effect on bacteria through its acidity. Cranberry juice consumption has been reported to decrease the incidence of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTI). However, the effect of cranberry juice on bacteriuria and pyuria remains unknown. To determine the effect of cranberry juice on bacteriuria and pyuria, we randomly assigned 104 people with spinal cord injury (SCI) to receive cranberry or plain juice in a prospective, randomized, controlled, comparative study.
Subjects: 104 people with SCI (males 65 subjects, females 39 subjects). Subjects with SCI without sensory perception of normal voiding reflex were excluded.
Intervention: 1 liter of cranberry juice was given once a day for 6 months followed by 1 ½- year of washout period.
Outcome measurements: The outcome measurements including urinalysis, culture (midstream clean void urine), urinary cytokine excretion (CXCL8, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-alfa, MCP-1, bFGF, GM-CSF, ICAM-1) were conducted at baseline, 1, 2 and 3 months, and at 6 months.
Results: Bacteriuria and pyuria were decreased in the SCI group with cranberry juice consumption for 6 months. Levels of urinary cytokines were increased in groups with bacteriuria. CXCL8, IL-6, and IL-8 was decreased in groups with cranberry juice consumption. Moreover, a good correlation was detected between levels of urinary CXCL8 and IL-6 and pyuria.
Conclusions: Cranberry juice was able to inhibit growth of uropathogen in urine and decrease inflammatory reactions. These data support the effect of cranberry juice to prevent bacteriuria and pyuria.

192,"Four different studies were conducted to investigate the efficacy of tramadol in the treatment of chronic low back pain. The findings from these studies suggest that tramadol is effective in reducing pain, improving physical function and quality of life, and has a tolerability profile comparable with other opioids used for the treatment of chronic LBP. In particular, the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen (Ultracet) has shown synergistic analgesic action in animal models at specific ratios, and the combination tablets have demonstrated efficacy and safety in the treatment of chronic LBP.
                Overall, the findings from these studies support the use of tramadol and combination tablets as effective options for the management of chronic LBP. However, it is important to note that the potential risks and side effects of long-term opioid therapy must be carefully considered and managed to minimize adverse outcomes.. 

Study #1: Tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets for the treatment of chronic lower back pain: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study.. 
Abstract:
Background: Tramadol has shown efficacy in the treatment of lower back pain (LBP), and studies combining this drug with acetaminophen (APAP) have demonstrated synergistic analgesic action in animal models. This study evaluates the efficacy and safety of tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets in the treatment of chronic LBP. Methods: Patients with lumbar radiculitis due to spinal stenosis or degenerative joint disease, and with at least moderate LBP scores (pain visual analog scale [PVA] score >/=40 mm), were randomly assigned to receive up to 8 tablets of tramadol 37.5 mg/APAP 325 mg combination tablets or placebo for 91 days. Medications were titrated from 1 to 4 tablets/day by day 10. The primary efficacy measure was PVA score at the final visit.

193,"In summary, the available literature suggests that olanzapine may be an effective and well-tolerated option for the treatment of bipolar mania, with a consistent pattern of improvements in symptoms, response, and euthymia when compared to placebo or other mood stabilizers. The main advantages of olanzapine include its rapid and sustained improvement in symptoms, high remission rates, and overall safety profile. However, olanzapine also has several potential limitations, including its significant weight gain and risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS). These side effects should be monitored carefully and managed with appropriate clinical management. 
In terms of the impact of this information on clinical practice, healthcare professionals managing patients with bipolar mania should consider the potential benefits and risks of olanzapine before initiating treatment. Clinicians should weigh their patients' individual clinical characteristics and treatment preferences before making the decision to prescribe olanzapine. They should also be aware of the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of olanzapine, and be prepared to adjust the dosage or provide additional support as necessary to optimize outcomes and minimize side effects. Overall, olanzapine may be an effective and well-tolerated treatment option for patients with bipolar mania, provided that clinicians exercise caution and monitor their patients closely to minimize potential side effects."
194,"Background and Objectives
-----------------
Non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) increases the probability of lower extremity amputation (1). Poor foot care and peripheral neuropathy are the leading causes of lower extremity amputations in these patients (2).
Several interventions designed to reduce patient and provider failures in managing foot complications, through health education, professional reminder systems, and reimbursement to health care providers for foot examinations, have not been shown to reduce lower extremity vascular complications (3). The effectiveness of patient and provider interventions may have been limited by barriers to compliance with prescribed foot-care behaviors (4)(5). In our study, we hypothesized that a systems intervention that focuses on reducing the barriers to compliance with evidence-based medicine foot care guidelines could improve patient foot-care behaviors and reduce the prevalence of lower extremity clinical disease in patients with NIDDM (6)(7).
Patients with diabetes must adopt new self-care behaviors, such as daily foot examinations and proper foot care, to avoid complications (8). These patient activities are essential because NIDDM patients cannot feel their feet (9), and many are unable to visit health care providers regularly (10). Therefore, we designed an intervention to promote optimal foot care by: (1) incorporating patient foot-care education in the routine office visit, (2) providing reminders to patients and to health care providers to monitor and promote patient foot-care behaviors, and (3) providing incentives for health care providers to discuss and incorporate foot-care education and monitoring into visits with NIDDM patients.
Intervention
The 33-month intervention consisted of three components: patient education, health care provider education, and practice guidelines and flow sheets to facilitate patient management. The intervention was conducted at an urban academic medical center with about 60 primary care physicians and 15 podiatrists. We identified all the patients with NIDDM who were enrolled in 25 community-based primary care practices operated by 14 internists, 12 family physicians, and 1 general practice nurse practitioner. Before the study, all of the primary care physicians identified their NIDDM patients and completed questionnaires that solicited information about their perceptions of barriers to optimal diabetic foot care, their past practice patterns, and their perceived need for practice"
195,"The study findings were not as expected. The investigators did not demonstrate that intensive physical therapy decreased the duration of physical rehabilitation or that it affected the need for longterm care afterwards. The investigators found that the intensive physical therapy group of patients required a longer period of bed rest and had substantially longer need for assistive ambulation and for assistance by a caregiver. Early death from medical or infectious complications was common in both groups.
Implications for practice using the results from the study:
The use of intensive physical therapy does not reduce the duration of stay in rehabilitation, and such an intervention may even delay the ability of the patients to ambulate independently, and will require a caregiver to assist the patient with activities of daily living. According to the trial results intensive physical therapy is associated with increased medical and infectious complication resulting in prolonged hospital stay, higher death rate and consequently higher costs for treatment.
Adequacy of work or the study design and the quality of the data collected with potential explanations:
The results from the study can be questioned concerning the representativeness of the patient group and adequacy of the rehabilitation staff with respect to exercise skills. The study patients were all transferred to an rehabilitation unit for 3-4 weeks. In order to be able to compare the results from the different rehabilitation units all patients had to fulfill the same criteria for admission to the unit. Thus the results are applicable to a comparable heterogeneous group of frail elderly patients with hip fractures and represent the current standard for rehabilitation after hip fracture. Only some of the patients were able to ambulate independently, and the majority required functional electrical stimulation or intensive physical rehabilitation to be able to gain the necessary strength and coordination.
The staff at the rehabilitation unit consisted mainly of nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists in addition to physical therapists. None of the staff at the participating rehabilitation units were able to perform functional electrical stimulation, and all supervised training with exercise machines or free weight training, although their training skills differed from those of the physical therapist who had performed the training sessions. It may very well be that the patients in the control group were unable to perform the prescribed free weight training, as they were required to work out on their own in the rehabilitation ward without any guidance or supervision. This may have contributed to"
196,"Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) is known to commonly occur in asthma patients . The relationship between them is still controversial. Both asthma and GER are chronic diseases and both of them have a high prevalence 18. GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) is a clinical condition that results from the reflux of stomach contents into the oesophagus, and causes troublesome symptoms or complications such as oesophagitis or dysphagia 14. Asthma and GER may occur independently and cause different symptoms. However, GERD can also cause asthma symptoms or may worsen respiratory symptoms in patients with asthma . The mechanism may be that the acid and irritants in GERD can trigger bronchoconstriction through vagal reflex or through airway inflammation . A study shows GERD may increase the risk of recurrent asthma . However, others study suggests the link between asthma and GERD is unclear . The pathophysiology may be different in the two diseases. There are many mechanisms of GERD, such as increased gastric volume after meals or after a day of fasting, decreased gastric resting pressure, decreased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure, delayed LES relaxation and decreased oesophageal clearance time. Some of these mechanisms may be mediated through neurogenic inflammation . There are also many theories about the pathogenesis of asthma. The most basic mechanisms are allergy and airway inflammation. Airway inflammation is mediated through bronchial responsiveness and airway remodeling . Bronchial responsiveness is induced by the presence of inflammatory factors in the airway. These inflammatory factors increase the activation of mast cells and result in the production of leukotrienes. These results further activate T cells and produce more inflammatory factors . In addition, these inflammatory factors can weaken the structure of bronchial smooth muscle and induce airway remodeling . GERD is another way to trigger asthma through neurogenic inflammation induced by stomach acid entering the airway.

197,"1. Children with moderate to severe asthma and their parents expressed a preference for physical activity programs that are supervised, focus on asthmatic children only, and are scheduled during the school day or after school because the risk of exposure to allergens and exercise-induced asthma is reduced and access to transportation and parental supervision is facilitated.
    2. Previously, anecdotal reports had linked swimming with an increased occurrence of asthma episodes. However, the results reported here show that this is not an accurate or widely substantiated description. While the mechanisms behind this are not fully understood, one possible explanation may be the difference in chlorine concentrations between pools used for swimming training and those used in competitive swimming events.
    3. Children with asthma who actively participated in physical activity programs may benefit from improvements in asthma control, exercise tolerance, and disease-specific QOL that may be important for reducing the burden of the disease on both the child and the family and for fostering adherence to a lifelong exercise program.
    4. Previously, moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity physical activity programs have demonstrated some efficacy in children with asthma. However, there is some debate as to the optimal duration and intensity of the program, along with the timing of the program (after vs. before school). The study reported here provides preliminary data that help inform both the type and timing of a physical activity intervention program for children with asthma. The authors recommend future research to validate their findings and to confirm the mechanism of impact of moderate to vigorous physical activity programs on asthma control and disease-specific QOL in children with asthma.."

199,"From these studies, it seems that delayed cord clamping (DCC) for at least 30 seconds results in higher blood pressure and hematocrit for the premature neonates (less than 35 weeks). DCC may be more beneficial for vaginally delivered neonates and those born at lower gestational age. However, further large randomized controlled trials and additional meta-analysis of studies are needed to confirm the possible clinical benefits and determine the most appropriate duration for cord clamping. For neonates born less than 30 weeks, additional studies on DCC techniques and its effects are warranted, as some of these studies were not feasible in that age group. Overall, it seems that DCC may be a safe and feasible approach to improve the hematologic and clinical outcomes for the preterm neonates. However, further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and the appropriate duration for cord clamping. Additionally, studies on the effects of DCC on maternal outcomes and its impact on the long-term health outcomes of the neonates are warranted.
As a result of these studies, there was a growing interest in the potential effects of DCC and its impact on the long-term health outcomes. DCC has become a part of standard clinical practice in many hospitals and countries, but its adoption and implementation is not widespread. This may be due to the lack of rigorous evidence from larger randomized controlled trials and the need for further studies to understand its long-term effects. Additionally, the lack of consensus among neonatologists and obstetricians on the most appropriate duration for cord clamping and its potential benefits and risks may also impede its adoption and implementation. To address these issues, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of DCC in preterm neonates. Furthermore, studies on the impact of DCC on maternal outcomes, such as postpartum hemorrhage and blood loss, and its effect on the long-term health outcomes of the neonates, such as neurodevelopment and cognitive function, are also warranted."
200,"OBJECTIVES: In patients presenting with embolic events, therapy is directed at restoring perfusion. Recent reports have shown that urokinase (UK) given together with heparin facilitates the breakdown of clots in patients with major pulmonary embolism (PE) more quickly than heparin alone. However, the value of this approach remains to be demonstrated in randomized studies. DESIGN: A phase I, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial was conducted to assess whether urokinase therapy compared with placebo reduces the number of fatal PE events in patients treated with heparin. Eight participating institutions were selected to ensure a diverse population with varying degrees of severity of the PE event. SETTING: The trial was conducted in 8 geographically diverse sites between June 1994 and September 1996. PATIENTS: Adult patients (>18 years old) who presented to any of the participating institutions with objectively documented PE events. Intervention: Patients were randomized to either receive urokinase at 7,000 ku/hr (up to a maximum of 42,000 ku administered over 6 hours) or a placebo intravenously. All patients received heparin anticoagulation after the resolution of any hemodynamic instability. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measurement was death within 14 days of the PE event; the secondary outcome measurement was resolution or decrease of embolic events (improved perfusion) in pulmonary angiography or CT scan. RESULTS: At 14 days, death or no change in perfusion occurred in 45% of patients that were treated with urokinase compared with 58% of patients that received placebo. When compared to patients treated with placebo, patients treated with urokinase did not have adverse effects in terms of more frequent systemic bleeding or heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that UK combined with heparin in patients with major PE is feasible, improves survival, and has good safety. Further larger trials are needed to assess whether UK alone or together with heparin in patients with embolic events is superior to current available therapy."

205,"Study #24: A study comparing two doses of the drug azelastine for the treatment of allergic rhinitis.. In the last week of each of the two 12-week treatment periods, the mean daytime and nighttime scores from the patient daily symptoms diary were compared between both dose levels in patients who had completed the 24-week treatment period. The mean ± standard deviation daytime and nighttime scores were significantly reduced from baseline for each treatment period and dose level compared to the score at baseline. All patients receiving the higher dose (205/418 mcg twice daily) had significantly improved scores for both the daytime and nighttime symptoms diary scores compared to those receiving the lower dose (102.5/205 mcg twice daily). A single dose treatment evaluation was performed at weeks 5, 9, 13, 17, and 21 of each treatment period to assess the duration of effect after administration of study medications. Peak effect (assessed by a nasal congestion score of 0 [none] to 3 [severe]) occurred within 1 to 2 hours after drug administration at each of the treatment periods and at each of the dosage levels (0.09 mg, 0.15 mg, or 0.45 mg) evaluated. The mean ± standard deviation nasal congestion scores from 0 to 2 hours after dosing ranged from 0.95 ± 0.66 to 1.39 ± 0.48 for the 0.09 mg dose, 0.73 ± 0.34 to 1.24 ± 0.53 for the 0.15 mg dose, and 0.55 ± 0.21 to 1.13 ± 0.47 for the 0.45 mg dose after administration of azelastine in treatment periods 2 and 3. The duration of effect ranged from 3 to 7 hours depending on the dose level of azelastine administered.

209,"There has been considerable interest in delaying subsequent pregnancy among adolescent mothers (AMs) in the United States. The current study investigated the effect of a novel home-based motivational intervention plus enhanced home visit (CAMI+), when compared with a computer assisted motivational intervention (CAMI), and enhanced home visit alone (CAMI-hv), on the likelihood of a repeat pregnancy among AMs. Data were analyzed from a randomized controlled trial in which women aged 18 or older and recruited from a network of urban prenatal clinics serving low-income, predominantly African American communities that provided free prenatal, obstetric, and postpartum care. After enrollment at a minimum of 24 weeks of pregnancy, women were randomized to one of three groups: (1) CAMI+ received CAMI sessions at quarterly intervals for 2 y postpartum and received monthly home visits with parenting education and support; (2) CAMI-hv received CAMI sessions at quarterly intervals for 2 y postpartum; and (3) Usual care (control) comprised standard usual care, as described above. Women completed study interviews and reported pregnancy outcomes at the time of enrollment, and at 6 and 12 months following delivery. For the purpose of this report, the primary outcome was a repeat pregnancy prior to 24 months' postpartum among women who completed baseline interviews. Intent-to-treat analyses, performed using Stata version 8.0, compared the three groups on pregnancy outcomes. We also used proportional odds regression to estimate the risk for a repeat pregnancy for women receiving CAMI sessions ± home visits compared with control, and compared groups using Kaplan-Meier curves of repeat pregnancy status. For this analysis, we included women in both CAMI groups because the risk and hazard of repeat pregnancy appears to be reduced by any number of CAMI sessions. Unadjusted differences and the unadjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for repeat pregnancy by group are shown in Table 3. Controlling for group differences at baseline, the model also accounted for any CAMI sessions completed by any woman in either CAMI group. The results of these analyses are presented in Table 3. These analyses revealed a reduction in the risk of repeat pregnancy among all groups who completed at least 2 CAMI sessions compared to"
210,"In summary, this article has presented a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial research question. The key findings from these abstracts have been summarized and integrated, highlighting the potential role of ethyl-eicosapentaenoic acid (E-EPA) as an efficacious and tolerable treatment supplement in patients with chronic schizophrenia. The studies have shown that E-EPA may improve symptoms, reduce dyskinesia scores, and enhance the efficacy of antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia.
However, it's important to note that these results were based on exploratory studies and not definitive clinical trials. Thus, further research is warranted to evaluate the effectiveness of E-EPA in a larger sample size and to investigate its mechanism of action. Larger, well-designed clinical trials are necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of E-EPA as a treatment supplement for patients with schizophrenia.
It would be beneficial for future research to investigate the optimal dosage and duration of E-EPA, as well as its effects on cognitive function and quality of life in patients with schizophrenia. Overall, this literature review has shown that further scientific scrutiny is needed to determine the effectiveness of E-EPA as a treatment supplement in patients with schizophrenia.
However, the existing studies provide a valuable foundation for future research and offer promising insights into the potential role of E-EPA in the treatment of schizophrenia"

Summary of findings: In summary, 10 published studies of treatment of MDD in pediatric and adolescent patients that were identified by a PubMed search strategy suggest that antidepressants are generally effective and well tolerated in the treatment of pediatric and adolescent patients with depression; the most reliable finding is that fluoxetine seems to be somewhat more effective in treatment of adolescent depression compared with placebo. Only three of the above-mentioned ten studies directly compared the two antidepressant classes (SSRIs to MAOIs) that are approved for use in the treatment of MDD in adults which is very disappointing considering the major impact child and adolescents can have on the future. Another major concern is the fact that five of the ten studies focused exclusively on the treatment of adolescent patients which does not do justice to the fact that child depression is a much more serious and potentially chronic problem that needs special attention.

Introduction
The need for an adequately functioning and well-tolerated dialysis access is essential for effective renal replacement therapy. The most common dialysis access options currently available for patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis are arteriovenous fistula (AVF), graft and the catheters. Although catheters, such as the dialysis catheters, have been traditionally considered as temporary dialysis access options, they have been increasingly incorporated into the long-term vascular access planning for hemodialysis patients. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy, also known as percutaneous nephrostomy, is a surgical procedure which involves the insertion of a percutaneous nephrostomy tube into a kidney via external puncture. Percutaneous nephrolithotomy tubes, also known as nephrostomy tubes, are commonly employed as temporary dialysis access options in some emergency scenarios.

A nephrostomy tube is a thin plastic tube that is inserted into a puncture in the kidney. The tube is placed into the kidney during surgery and is then secured in place with sutures. A nephrostomy tube is a long, thin tube with a small balloon at the tip that is placed into the kidney to drain urine. The urine is collected in a bag that is attached to the tube.

The peritoneum is the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity and is used as a dialysis modality called continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Peritoneum biopsy is a minimally-invasive procedure for diagnosing peritoneal diseases, such as peritoneal mesothelioma. Peritoneum biopsy is used in patients with suspected mesothelioma to obtain tissue for diagnosis. This procedure involves inserting a needle into the abdominal cavity through the skin so that the needle is positioned in the peritoneal cavity. A small amount of tissue is removed from the peritone"
214,"Study #1: A study conducted on 62 patients with the common cold found that treatments consisting of two 20-minute sessions of inhaling saturated, hot (42 degrees to 44 degrees C) air through the nose resulted in alleviation of cold symptoms and increased nasal patency in higher percentage of patients compared to the placebo group. The subjective response of the patients was recorded daily on a symptom score card, and nasal patency was measured before and after treatment. The results showed that steam inhalation was effective in improving nasal patency and reducing cold symptoms.
Study #2: A study conducted on 68 Cleveland Clinic employee volunteers with symptoms of the common cold found that steam inhalation treatment had no beneficial effect on the cold symptoms of the volunteers. The temperature required to inactivate rhinovirus was also determined: a temperature of 43 degrees C lasting at least 1 hour was needed. The study involved 32 active group participants who received 40 L/min of heated saturated air that raised the intranasal temperature to 43 degrees C, while 36 placebo group participants received 2 L/min of ambient air at 20 degrees C to 24 degrees C. The only statistically significant differences between the groups were lower nasal resistances at baseline in the steam group and percent improvement in nasal resistance favoring the placebo group on day 7. However, these differences were of questionable clinical significance, and it was concluded that steam inhalation treatment had no beneficial effect on the cold symptoms of the volunteers.
Study #3:A study conducted on 87 unselected patients with typical acute nasal and upper respiratory symptoms (general practice study) found that treatment with fully humidified air at 43 degrees C gave more benefit than treatment with air at 30 degrees C.

Patients treated for 20 minutes at 43 degrees C had roughly half the score for symptoms of those treated at 30 degrees C, while treatment of volunteers for 20 minutes at the onset of the cold and for 10 minutes on succeeding days showed no difference between 43 degrees C and 30 degrees C.

Introduction:
Depression is characterized by a number of symptoms, such as sad mood, anhedonia (reduced or absent experience of pleasure from normally pleasurable activities) and reduced level of activity, all of which reflect a lack of motivation. Psychomotor retardation (i.e. reduced level of activity and slowed motor reactions) is a specific feature of major depression that may indicate that the underlying dysfunction is located in the locus coeruleus, which is characterized by a low basal firing rate. 
Depression may also be a manifestation of hypocortisolism, which is characterized by low levels of glucocorticoids. Hypercortisolism is also a prominent feature of some types of depression (i.e. psychotic major depression), which tend to be more resistant to treatment, but also to be more likely to respond to treatment with adrenal suppression. Moreover, patients with hypocortisolism may not react to conventional antidepressants or treatment with serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors has been shown to be effective in the treatment of depression with hypocortisolism and no psychosis. Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone are potent antidepressants that act very rapidly and that also induce remission in patients with psychotic depression which has proved to be refractory to conventional antidepressants and treatment with electroconvuls"
216,"19 papers were found in MEDLINE and selected through an abstract / publication title screening process. A summary of these studies is presented above. These studies investigate the effect of a small drink of water on gastric fluid volume and pH in elective surgical patients, and the effect of ingestion of unlimited clear fluids on thirst, hunger and gastric contents. The studies indicate that, in all, ingestion of water 3 h before surgery is not harmful to patient recovery. Several studies indicate that, 2 h before surgery, or a few minutes before surgery, ingestion of 150 ml of water (3 cups), may not carry any risk of aspiration during anaesthetic induction. However, one study also indicates that, in this situation, gastric fluid volumes could be as high as in controls who ingest nothing or, at most, 100 ml orange juice. Thus, while it does not seem unsafe, it may be less safe than allowing patients to drink up to 3 cups of water. Overall, for non-pregnant, healthy patients, the evidence for pre-operative water is good and there does not appear to be any harm in allowing patients to drink up to 3 cups of clear water 3 h before surgery."
217,"These studies indicate that adjuvant hyperthermia in combination with external-beam radiation therapy significantly improved complete response rates in locally advanced pelvic tumors. Combination therapy also resulted in a significant prolongation of local control. However, the long-term survival rate did not show a significant difference. The findings imply that hyperthermia combined with radiation therapy may be most beneficial for the treatment of locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas. Therefore, it is suggested that further studies with larger patient cohorts are needed to validate the findings and assess the potential benefits of hyperthermia for the treatment of advanced pelvic tumors."

Study #1: The nature of feeding in infants with unrepaired cleft lip and/or palate compared with healthy noncleft infants.. Feeding difficulties are reported widely in infants with cleft lip and/ or palate. There is, however, a paucity of objective information about the feeding patterns of these infants. This study compared patterns of feeding in infants with unrepaired cleft lip and palate with healthy noncleft infants of a similar age.
6 Methods. North Thames Regional Cleft Centre. The noncleft cohort was recruited from West Middlesex University Hospital, a general hospital with similar demographics.
Infants with a nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate or a cleft of the soft and at least two thirds of the hard palate who were referred to the North Thames Regional Cleft Centre participated. Parents of 20 randomly selected, noncleft infants agreed to participate.
Feeding patterns were rated using the Neonatal Oral Motor Assessment Scale. Additional objective information was collected using the Great Ormond Street Measurement of Infant Feeding (Masarei et al., 2001; Masarei, 2003).
7 Results. Infants with nonsyndromic complete unilateral cleft lip and palate or a cleft of the soft and at least two thirds of the hard palate had less efficient sucking patterns than their noncleft peers had. They used shorter sucks (mean difference, 0.30 second; p < .0005), a faster rate of sucking (mean difference, 34.20 sucks/second; p < .0005), higher suck-swallow ratios (mean difference, 1.87 sucks/swallow; p < .0005), and a greater proportion of intraoral positive pressure generation (mean difference, 45.97% positive pressure; p < .0005).

Better uncorrected and spectacle-corrected visual acuity and contrast sensitivity, a lower enhancement rate, and exchangeability are the main advantages of Artisan lens implantation.. 
In the second study, the TICL performed better than PRK in all measures of safety (BSCVA), efficacy (UCVA), predictability, and stability in this comparison, supporting the TICL as a viable alternative to existing refractive surgical treatments.. 
In the third study, LASIK and Artisan phakic intraocular lenses seemed to produce a similar predictability. The best-corrected visual acuity and subjective evaluation of quality of vision were better for Artisan..  
From these three studies, it can be concluded that LASIK, Artisan lens implantation, and the TICL are all effective methods for the correction of moderate to high myopia, either alone or in combination with other vision correction techniques. However, Artisan lens implantation seems to have certain advantages over LASIK and the TICL, such as more predictable outcomes and better safety profiles. Moreover, the TICL may be a more cost-effective option compared to LASIK. Additional studies are needed to further compare these techniques and to evaluate their long-term effects on patients' vision.. 
The overall study concluded that all three methods are effective methods for the correction of myopia, but the TICL and Artisan lens implantation are the closest comparisons to each other."

222,"All studies show that TMP-SMX has an important effect in treating severe melioidosis. 
Together, all of these studies showed that there is no difference in survival between patients who received either doxycycline or TMP-SMX in combination with a third drug in the maintenance treatment of melioidosis. 
Only one study showed that doxycycline alone had a higher treatment failure rate than TMP-SMX in combination with a third drug and, therefore, cannot be recommended in the initial treatment of severe melioidosis. All other studies demonstrated that TMP-SMX, in combination with either ceftazidime, cefoperazone-sulbactam, cotrimoxazole plus azithromycin, or amoxicillin/clavulanate, has a higher overall therapeutic efficacy than patients who received either chloramphenicol, doxycycline, or amoxicillin/clavulanate alone. 
Furthermore, a combination of TMP-SMZ and doxycycline should also be considered for the maintenance treatment for at least 12-20 weeks because there is a much higher incidence of recurrent melioidosis in patients who take doxycycline alone for a shorter duration. All studies showed that TMP-SMX is more effective than doxycycline alone or doxycycline in combination with another oral drug. 
In conclusion, we believe that TMP-SMZ is a necessary component in the treatment of severe melioidosis.

224,"Study #8: The efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG 400) versus lactulose for chronic constipation in children: a double-blind, randomized trial..
Chronic constipation is one of the most common problems in pediatric clinical practice. Polyethylene glycol 3350 (PEG 3350), lactulose (Lac), and sorbitol (Sor) are the most commonly prescribed laxatives for the treatment of childhood constipation. The mechanism of action (MOA) for PEG 3350 is different from Lac or Sor. In our trial, we tried to determine whether PEG 400, which is the same salt as PEG 3350 but having a different MOA, is comparable to Lac for the treatment of chronic constipation in children.. 
Study design: 

Study population: Children with a history of chronic constipation, defined as 2 or more of hard stools, stool withholding, and/or fewer than three bowel movements per week for more than three months

Intervention: Oral PEG 400 10mg/kg/day or oral Lac 10mg/kg/day

Main outcome measures: Resolution of constipation symptoms

Results: 
PEG 400 and Lac treatment produced the same rate of constipation resolution (55.6% vs. 55.8%, p= 0.778). No severe adverse events were observed in any children. The proportion of patients with treatment-related adverse events was 32.3% for the PEG 400 group (mostly abdominal discomfort or stool accidents) and 28.8% for the Lac group (mostly abdominal discomfort or loose bowel movements).

Conclusions:

225,"OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the efficacy of imipramine in the treatment of enuresis.MATERIAL AND METHODS: This comparative, randomized, double-blind study was conducted between July 2002 and February 2003 in the outpatient department of the Department of Pediatrics, R.N. Tagore College of Dental Sciences, Guntur (India) (Institutional Ethical Committee number: No/23/02). Sixty children of age between 6-14 years with a minimum history of at least 6 months of primary enuresis were selected randomly and divided into two groups. Group I patients received 1 mg/kg of imipramine and group II patients received placebo. Patients in both groups were closely followed for 2 months. Primary outcome measures included an increase in number of dry nights, number of patients with complete cure, overall efficacy and safety of the drug. The efficacy in group I and group II patients was compared with paired Student's t test and the percentage of cured in both groups was compared with chi-square test.RESULTS: Imipramine given at an oral dose of 1 mg/kg was superior to placebo in increasing dry nights per week. The mean number of wet nights in group I was 4.49 +/- 1.47, while in group II patients it was 3.03 +/- 1.45. The mean number of wet nights in group I was significantly higher than in group II (p = 0.00). This difference was even more prominent at the one-month follow-up (p < 0.001), suggesting a continuous improvement. The overall efficacy in both groups was good, as 81.25% and 56.5% patients in group I and group II respectively, were symptom free during the last week of the study.CONCLUSION: Imipramine showed significant improvement in dry nights per week. The overall efficacy of the drug was good and the treatment was well tolerated..

226,"The effects of massage therapy on low-back pain remain controversial, with few studies of appropriate design and quality having been conducted. This study evaluated the effectiveness of comprehensive massage therapy in subacute (between 1 and 8 months) low-back pain. The group receiving comprehensive massage therapy (soft-tissue manipulation, remedial exercise and posture education) had improved function (mean RDQ score 1.54 compared with the other 3 groups, p < 0.001), less intense pain (mean PPI score 0.42 v. 1.18-1.75, p < 0.001) and decreased perception of pain quality (mean PRI score 2.29 v. 4.55-7.71, p = 0.006) compared with the other 3 groups. The study showed that patients with subacute low-back pain benefit from massage therapy when delivered by experienced massage therapists whose therapy is regulated."
227,"1. In 143 (modified intention to treat) patients with stage 2 T b gambiense infection, the cure rate (based on trypanosomes remaining undetectable for >72 h after last dose of study drug) was 96.5% (138/143) in the NECT group and 91.6% (131/143) in the eflornithine monotherapy group. The difference in cure rates was 4.9% (1-sided 95% CI, -0.3 to 10.0; p<0.0001).

2. In 133 patients from the eflornithine group and 132 patients from the NECT group who completed the 10-visit endpoint assessment without major protocol deviations or intercurrent disease, the cure rate was 91.7% (122/133) in the eflornithine group and 97.7% (129/132) in the NECT group. The difference in cure rates was 6.0% (1-sided 95% CI, -1.5 to 10.3; p<0.001).

Interpretations: The efficacy of NECT (including prophylaxis) is substantially more effective than the efficacy of eflornithine alone for second-stage HAT. The lower toxicity of NECT compared with eflornithine alone might reduce costs that are associated with the provision of additional human and financial resources to manage toxicity-related events."
228,"Through these five studies, investigators were able to establish various insights on the impact of fluid restriction on the health of premature and newborn infants. However, after synthesizing all the findings, a trend of negative effects was observed with fluid restriction, including an increased incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intracranial hemorrhage, and dehydration. While some studies reported no significant difference in mortality rates, the overall outcome showed a decrease in weight gain, prolonged hospital stays, and a higher prevalence of metabolic disturbances. Fluid restriction during the first week of life appears to be safe, but further research is needed to explore its long-term effects on the growth and development of premature and newborn infants..

In group A radiotherapy was delivered at an initial dose of 1.4 Gy/day in 25 fractions given in five treatments a week, for a total dose of 64 Gy. Patients in group B were submitted to the same radiotherapy schedule with an initial dose of 1.3 Gy/day, in 32 fractions given in five treatments a week, for a total dose of 59.2 Gy. After two weeks radiotherapy was interrupted for one week, and then resumed at the same dose, for a total dose of 64 Gy. Radiotherapy was administered using a linear accelerator machine (6 MV energy). Treatment was not interrupted in case of radiotherapy induced toxicity.
Patients' characteristics were: age 60(1) years, 22 women, 50% performance status 2, 38% histological type squamous non-small cell lung cancer, 39% poorly differentiated or anaplastic non-small cell lung cancer, T4 in 79 patients and N2 in 77 patients. Among the patients randomised to receive radiotherapy plus cisplatin the median number of cycles of chemotherapy was 4 (75% confidence interval, 4-5). The median number of cycles of chemotherapy was 2 (75% confidence interval, 2-3) in patients treated only with radiotherapy. The median delay between the end of chemotherapy and the beginning of radiotherapy was 10 days (range 5-49 days). The radiotherapy technique was external. The median number of fields was 3 (75% confidence interval, 2-3). All the patients randomised to receive radiotherapy plus cisplatin completed the first and the second cycle of chemotherapy.

232,"5-day, randomized, double-blind, controlled evaluation of an anti-adhesive topical application (BioAde®-F) that inhibits adhesion of enteric bacteria to gastric mucosa.
Study Design: 38 adult subjects with acute and uncomplicated diarrhea were randomly assigned either BioAde®-F or placebo. At Day (D) 1(± 18 hours) of diarrhea, study product was administered in 50 cc sodium bicarbonate-buffered (0.08 N) saline according to a preset dosing regimen (i.e., treatment lasted at most 5 consecutive days) such that a greater dosage corresponded to subjects with more severe diarrhea. BioAde®-F was administered once daily each morning after breakfast, until the stool frequency, which was recorded daily for 12 days , became less frequent than 4 loose stools per day.
End point(s): primary efficacy endpoint was calculated as: number of days needed for stool frequency to become less frequent than 4 loose stools per day + 1 day, and the goal was reached by 70% of the subject population. Secondary efficacy endpoints were: time to resolution of symptoms of diarrhea, time to resolution of diarrhea, time of first treatment failure, and stool type. Safety, tolerability and palatability was evaluated during the whole study period.
Statistical analysis: data from 35 subjects who met the Diarrhea Disease Criteria (DDC) for entry into the study was used in the efficacy analysis. Analysis of primary and secondary endpoints used the Mann-Whitney U test to compare the study product and placebo groups.
Results: mean days before stool frequency was less than 4 loose stools per day was 3.99 ± 1.97 for BioAde®-F and 5.12 ± 2.16 for placebo. The difference between the BioAde®-F and placebo groups was not statistically significant (P = 0.0842).

235,"Study #15: Effect of intramuscular carbamazepine in the treatment of facial pain.. The effectiveness of oral carbamazepine in the treatment of facial pain and the effects of intramuscular carbamazepine were evaluated. A group of patients with chronic pain of the lower jaw, ear, teeth and other cranial facial regions were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 29 patients given oral carbamazepine; group 2, of 32 patients, received intramuscular injections of carbamazepine. The patients in each group were followed up throughout the treatment period, which consisted of 3 months of therapy. Clinical effectiveness was measured by the intensity of the pain, evaluated by a pain intensity score (PIS), and by the daily amount of rescue drugs taken by the patients, as well as by the results of physical and laboratory examinations. The results of the study indicated that intramuscular and oral application of carbamazepine showed similar clinical results; both were effective in relieving pain in patients with facial pain. Carbamazepine caused improvement on the 3rd day of treatment. During treatment, carbamazepine had mild adverse effects (fatigue, dizziness, insomnia, nervousness and dry mouth). During this study we concluded that carbamazepine can be effectively and safely used to relieve pain in patients with facial pain and that both intramuscular and oral carbamazepine show good clinical results..

Study #16: Comparative double-blind crossover trial of carbamazepine and phenobarbitone in the treatment of diabetic neuralgia.. The relative efficacy of phenobarbitone and carbamazepine in diabetic neuropathy has been compared. A double-blind crossover trial of two dosage levels of both drugs in eight patients was carried out. The patients were followed up for a six-month period and were evaluated by clinical observations and the Visual Analogue Scale. This trial suggests that phenobarbitone may be more effective than carbamazepine for the relief of painful diabetic neuropathy. However, larger doses of carbamazepine can reduce some of this drug's side effects..

Study #12: The effect of magnesium sulphate on eclampsia in pre-eclamptic women: a randomised-controlled trial from a tertiary care centre in Thailand.. Eclampsia is still one of the major causes of maternal mortality and morbidity in the developing countries. Several regimens for preventing eclampsia in pre-eclamptic women have been tried for decades, and magnesium sulphate is one of the most commonly used drugs in several countries. No sufficient studies have been conducted regarding optimal dosage of magnesium sulphate for preventing eclampsia. The aims of this study are to evaluate the effect of administration of magnesium sulphate to pre-eclamptic women, and also, to determine the optimal dosage. This is a prospective randomised-controlled trial in which 160 women with hypertension between 24 and 37 weeks of gestation were randomised into an intravenous magnesium sulphate treatment group and a placebo group. Each patient had two magnesium loading doses of 4 g (25 ml) in combination with 20 ml 5% dextrose, and then received maintenance dose (8 g/25 ml) with a similar solution every 4 hours until termination of pregnancy. Frequency of seizures and maternal and neonatal outcome were compared between the two groups. There was no difference in eclampsia between magnesium sulphate and placebo arms. Magnesium sulphate group had significantly higher incidence of aspiration pneumonia, prolonged labour, neonatal hypothermia and postpartum hemorrhage. There was no significant difference in neonatal outcome and maternal mortality between both groups. Optimal dosage for preventing eclampsia was 0.12 gr/kg body weight. Magnesium sulphate used as anticonvulsant in severe pre-eclampsia has no beneficial effect; its prolonged administration can increase maternal and fetal side effects. Therefore"

Abstract:
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of infant stimulation on the development of premature infants. METHODS: From the beginning of their hospitalisation, 25 patients were randomly assigned to a group of patients receiving stimulation and a 'control' group, receiving standard clinical care. At the end of hospitalisation, and at 1 and 1.5 years corrected age, the patients were assessed by means of three different developmental/behavioural rating scales. Additionally, the parents were assessed in terms of their quality of life 1 and 1.5 years after the child's birth. RESULTS: The premature infants that were assigned to the group receiving standard care, did significantly poorer on the Mental Development Index of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development. Moreover, a significantly larger proportion of the children from the active group could be placed at school compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Early stimulation during hospitalisation can improve the health care of children born with a birth weight less than 1500 g and stimulation after discharge can be continued with support from the parents, resulting in a good level of development."
238,"144 subjects with mild to moderate postoperative pain following removal of impacted upper third molars were randomly assigned double-blind to receive flurbiprofen 100 mg (n = 35), 50 mg (n = 38), cefaclor 500 mg (n = 37), cefaclor 250 mg (n = 37) and placebo (n = 37). All patients rated their pain intensity by VAS before dosing, at 15 min, and then hourly for 6 hours after dosing. Relief of pain was assessed every hour for 6 hours on a seven-category pain relief score. Pain relief scores were used to derive sums of pain relief intensity differences (SPR) and sums of pain relief differences (SPRD). Cefaclor and flurbiprofen 50 mg produced significantly better pain relief than placebo (p < 0.05) when assessed at 1 h. The mean SPRD for cefaclor and flurbiprofen 50 mg were 19.9 +/- 1.3 and 21.5 +/- 1.3 respectively and significantly less than flurbiprofen 100 mg (31.6 +/- 1.7, p < 0.05) and cefaclor 250 mg (25.6 +/- 1.4) after the first 1 h after treatment. SPDRs and SPRDs were greater for the 50 mg than the 250 mg dose of cefaclor but this was significant only at 1 h for SPDR (p = 0.03). When compared at 30 and 60 minutes after dosing, the mean SPRD for cefaclor 500 mg (6.1 +/- 0.9, p = 0.04; 1.6 +/- 1.5) was higher than that for cefaclor 250 mg (2.3 +/- 0.8, p < 0.05; 1.8 +/- 0.9) and greater analgesia was noted earlier (15 min) after the higher cefac"

240,"Study abstracts indicate that the studies of antidepressants compared to placebo are the most rigorous with all other studies showing the efficacy of problem solving treatment, cognitive behavioural therapy, and combinations of pharmacotherapy and counselling. 
Efficacy was evaluated using a number of scales and questionnaires, but there was high concordance among all measures. Escitalopram was the only SSRI evaluated in three studies, with one study showing only modest efficacy, and the other two not reaching statistical significance with placebo. The sample size of the smallest study was 32, the other was 155, and the largest was 263. In contrast, several studies evaluated problem solving treatment and a combination of escitalopram and simple counselling combined was significantly more effective than simple counselling alone, even with smaller sample sizes of 48-80. 
In general, SSRI s were well tolerated, with nausea, dry mouth, and dizziness being the most frequently reported adverse events. Overall, escitalopram was well tolerated with the exception of gastrointestinal symptoms which were usually transient. Patients in studies evaluating cognitive behavioural treatment did not report any adverse events. 
Overall, the above data suggests that psychotherapy for depression in primary care is at least as effective as SSRI s. However, patients who are more resistant to non-pharmacological treatments may benefit more from more intensive therapeutic interventions like escitalopram 10 mgs/day and/or problem solving treatment."
241,"Background: Institutionalized elderly people are a high-risk population for a severe course of influenza infection. Vaccination is the major preventive measure for influenza.
Methods: We sent questionnaires to 134 nursing care facilities, long-term care facilities, and public welfare institutions of elderly people to collect data on influenza vaccination levels and illness.
Characteristics of participants: Three hundred ninety-four facilities returned completed questionnaires; 265 (67.2%) were public institutions, and 129 (32.8%) were private facilities. The average age of participants was 84.6 years (range 65-102); 96.4% were aged >65 years.
Results: The vaccination levels were 43.0%, 44.4%, 45.9%, and 50.5% for 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively. During the 1995-1996 epidemic season, influenza A (H3N2) spread quickly in the whole prefecture; 93.4% of the facilities experienced an influenza outbreak during this epidemic season, and the mean number of cases per facility infected with the H3N2 strain was 1.51. The outbreak rates (p=0.949) and numbers of cases (p=0.949) were significantly (p<0.001) lower in the vaccine-administering facilities than in the other facilities.
The number of cases per participant of the influenza A (H3N2) strain was significantly (p<0.001) lower in persons who received influenza vaccination compared with those who did not receive vaccination (11.2 vs. 21.9%).
Conclusions: Influenza vaccinations are strongly recommended for institutionalized elderly people.

Prostatectomy is one of the most common operations in UK urology. Its main indication is prostate cancer. About half of the patients have side effects, although major complications are uncommon. One of the most common side effects is urinary incontinence (UI). About 30% of them have persistent moderate UI lasting up to 12 months. 
UI can have a significant impact on QoL. Some of these problems can be managed by simple behavioural methods or by drugs (anticholinergics), but some require further investigation, such as urodynamic studies, or more invasive interventions, such as slings and peri-urethral injections. Such interventions have been shown to be successful in patients after vaginal surgery and after prolapse surgery (as they have similar underlying aetiology, involving the integrity of the pelvic floor and support of the bladder neck). However, there is very limited information on the benefits and harms of any interventions in males with UI after surgery. 
This is a research study aimed at trying to explore how best to manage the symptoms of UI after prostatectomy. There are two potential phases. The first phase involves a simple education programme. You will be asked to provide feedback on this. This phase will last for 12 weeks. If this initial education programme is successful, then we will proceed to a further phase involving some more intense behavioural interventions. You will only proceed to the second phase if you successfully pass the first phase. A successful outcome to the first phase would lead to more intense behavioural interventions, which involve pelvic floor muscle training, electrical stimulation and/or biofeedback.

The second abstract describes a study that compared the effects of a protein and energy dense supplement enriched with n-3 fatty acids and antioxidants (called ""E"" for the rest of the summary) with an isocaloric isonitrogenous control supplement (called ""C"" for the rest of the summary). The study was conducted in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer who were experiencing weight loss. Both groups took two cans/day of the supplement for eight weeks. The study found that patients in both groups stopped losing weight (delta weight E: -0.25 kg/month versus C: -0.37 kg/month; p = 0.74) and LBM (Delta LBM E: +0.27 kg/month versus C: +0.12 kg/month; p = 0.88) to an equal degree (change from baseline E and C, p<0.001). However, there was evident non-compliance in both E and C groups, as the patients' intake of the supplements were below the recommended dose (2 cans/day) and averaged 1.4 cans/day. This non-compliance made it difficult to determine whether the supplements had any significant effect on patients' symptoms or nutritional status.
The study also found that E patients demonstrated significant correlations between their supplement intake and weight gain (r = 0.50, p<0.001) and increase in LBM (r = 0.33, p = 0.036). Such correlations were not statistically significant in C patients. The relationship of supplement intake with change in LBM was significantly different between E and C patients (p = 0.043).

The children were diagnosed to have asexual parasitaemia between 300 and 30,000 parasites/�L.The children were randomly assigned into two groups that were treated with either a combination of a fixed dose of chlorproguanil (CPG), a long-acting sulphonamide drug at 45 mg/kg body weight and sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) at 12.5/25 mg per kg body weight (CPG-SP) or a combination of CPG, SP at 7.5/25 mg/kg plus primaquine at 0.75 mg/kg body weight (CPG-SP-PQ). 
Children in both groups were followed-up for a period of 28 days to monitor their clinical and parasitological response. Haemoglobin concentrations were assayed at entry into the study and at pre-arranged intervals up to 12 months after completion of treatment. 
Efficacy of the two drug combinations was assessed by comparing the numbers of patients achieving an adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) 28 days after treatment. ACPR was defined as a complete cure at 28 days post-treatment with a blood slide negative for asexual Plasmodium parasites, and no development of new parasitaemia or reappearance of old parasites. Relapse was defined as the development of parasitaemia (as defined by clinical parasitological criteria used to define ACPR) in a patient more than 28 days after treatment, with no evidence of recrudescence at any previous visit.

Abstract:
CONTEXT: To provide a firmer basis for preventing high blood pressure (BP), we tested interventions to promote weight loss, dietary sodium reduction, and their combination for lowering diastolic BP, systolic BP, and the incidence of hypertension during a 3‐ to 4‐year period. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a randomized, 2 × 2 factorial, clinical trial, with BP levels measured by blinded observers. Nine academic medical centers recruited 2382 men and women (age range, 30‐54 years) not taking antihypertensive drugs, with a diastolic BP of 83 to 89 mm Hg, a systolic BP lower than 140 mm Hg, and a body mass index (the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters) representing 110% to 165% of desirable body weight.

-----------------
A double-blind pilot trial of varenicline use in hospitalized smokers will be conducted. This study will evaluate the efficacy, safety and feasibility of implementing a medication assisted smoking cessation intervention in hospitalized smokers. As part of the proposed research, smokers admitted to the hospital will be offered varenicline and post discharge behavioral support. Participants will be administered 1mg doses of varenicline prior to hospital discharge. They will also be contacted approximately one week after hospital discharge by a research assistant for follow-up. Data will be collected prospectively during the course of the study.

Epidemiologic studies have shown that smoking c"
249,"We see that overall, aspirin is associated with a decrease in colorectal adenomas, which have the potential to become cancerous. The APACC trial (Study #8) shows that aspirin in particular has protective effects against large adenomas. The study results are supported by several other well-performed studies. Therefore, I believe that an important and safe chemopreventive agent has been discovered.

I plan on continuing my research in this field and will eventually submit for approval a research protocol that will evaluate the effectiveness of chemoprevention through means of an aspirin regimen.

Abstract:
The effect of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, in familial adenomatous polyposis.
Patients with familial adenomatosis have a nearly 100% risk of colorectal cancer. In this disease, the chemopreventive effects of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may be related to their inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2.
METHODS:
In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we randomly assigned 77 patients to treatment with celecoxib (100 or 400 mg twice daily) or placebo for six months. Patients underwent endoscopy at the beginning and end of the study. We determined the number and size of polyps from photographs and videotapes; the response to treatment was expressed as the mean percent change from base line.
CONCLUSIONS:
In patients with familial adenomatous polyposis, six months of twice-daily treatment with 400 mg of celecoxib, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, leads to a significant reduction in the number of colorectal polyps.


Abstract:
A randomized trial of aspirin to prevent colorectal adenomas in patients with previous colorectal cancer.
Experimental studies in animals and observational studies in humans suggest that regular aspirin use may decrease the risk of colorectal adenomas, the precursors to most colorectal cancers.
METHODS:
We conducted a randomized, double-blind trial to determine the effect of aspirin on the incidence of colorectal adenomas."
250,"The objective of this study is to determine whether single-dose prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin before transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the prostate is effective in preventing bacterial prostatitis. We will evaluate prostate bacterial culture and other biochemical laboratory tests to determine whether they might influence our study outcome.

Objective
-----------------
To determine whether single-dose prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin before transrectal ultrasonography-guided biopsy of the prostate is effective in preventing bacterial prostatitis. We will evaluate prostate bacterial culture and other biochemical laboratory tests to determine whether they might influence our study outcome.

Intervention
-----------------
We expect that a single-dose regimen of antibiotics will be an effective and economical prophylactic measure. We will compare our findings with previous studies.

Participant Inclusion Criteria
=================
We included a total of 36 patients (median age 56 years) in our study. All these patients underwent transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate between March 2015 and February 2016. A total of 34 patients were included in the control group (ciprofloxacin), which were compared with 34 patients in the intervention group (single-dose prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin one day before the biopsy). All of them had urological problems on transrectal ultrasonography and underwent the biopsy on routine basis. The control group was used as the reference group to compare the results after antibiotic prophylaxis

251,"Abstract
Purpose: We investigated the effects of aerobic training on the body weight, percentage of body fat, and the muscle strength of breast cancer survivors from a tai chi approach. Methods: This prospective randomized trial included 34 breast cancer survivors. The control group (n=17) received a self‐management guideline, and the exercise group (n=17) took part in an intensive aerobic training program, which was 3-month walking, 3-month cycling, and 3-month water aerobic training of equal duration of exercise. Results: At posttest, body weight (129±15 kg), percentage of body fat (28±4.7%), and muscle strength (18.3±3.5 kg) had reduced significantly in the exercise group compared with the control group (body weight: 129±16 kg, P=0.3; percentage of body fat: 28±5% versus 32±5%, P=0.001; handgrip strength: 18.3±3.5 kg versus 23.8±4.6 kg for the exercise and control group, respectively, P<0.001). Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to have investigated the effects of a 3-month intensive exercise program on the health‐related quality of life and physiological measurements of breast cancer survivors. These findings highlight the importance of a physically active lifestyle for breast cancer survivors.

Background
The incidence rate of breast cancer remains high, and its morbidity has increased exponentially in the past decade1, which has resulted from an increase in the percentage of elderly women in the United States. According to an American Cancer Society review, there are 289,000 new cases of breast cancer in 2017 and 41,000 deaths, ranking breast cancer as the second most common cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States3. Compared with the general population, breast cancer survivors (CSs) have a reduced health-related quality of life and a shorter life expectancy, and experience a range of physical and mental symptoms such as lymphedema, fatigue, and cognitive decline4-7. The physical symptoms are thought to be directly related to cancer progression and"
