# Limitations
One limitation of the project is that the data was gathered by a single data abstractor. If a large dataset is being analyzed, a second abstractor should verify the accuracy of the coding of key results.
A second limitation is the fact that results may be influenced by the amount of time spent on project tasks. If you are working on a large clinical trial, the time spent on this project may not represent the effort and time required to finish a clinical study.
A third limitation is the fact that the results of this exercise is not indicative of the clinical outcome of the treatment evaluated.

# Conclusion
The exercise described here is a project that requires an understanding of the background information necessary to assess the key findings. This information includes the study objective, inclusion/ exclusion criteria, methodology, design, intervention(s), and patient demographics. In addition, the person coding and writing up results for a data abstraction should also be aware of the limitations of the trial.
The study results included here reveal that UFH plus dalteparin (5 µg/mL) is an effective regimen to prevent deep vessel thrombosis. This information is important to understand so that readers can relate to the results. However, the reader should also know how the results were reached. In this case, UFH was given to prevent VTE so it was necessary to know how a study had been done. Had a reader not seen the methods section, the question of how these results were determined may not have been answered.
It may be important to also show the process of data abstraction. This means that a reader of an article would likely want to see if a codebook exists. If not, showing what processes were included in the abstraction may be warranted.
The exercise outlined here demonstrates how one may choose to code a clinical study. However, it is important to remember that if one is interested in a single variable that there may not be enough depth of information in many of the variables in the study. Therefore, a decision may be made to code the entire study as a result.
The exercise described here is based on the hypothesis that UFH plus dalteparin is preferred in patients with contraindications to UFH. We could have chosen to use this"

[REVISION] Comparison of Infectivity by Prenatal Disease-Reactive, Seroconversion, and Seroreversion ELISAs with Nucleic Acid–Based Assays to Measure Vertical Transmission of SIVcpz

Pregnant macaques (n=8) exposed to infectious SIV were infected with SIVcpz (n=7) or with a nonpathogenic strain with a green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker (n=1) and were serially sampled for detection of virus, antibodies, and viral nucleic acids over a period of 176 days. SIV antibodies were detected by a prenatal assay with a disease-reactive antigen, a SIV seroconversion serum/ plasma enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and a seroreversion ELISA as well as by virus neutralization. SIV viral RNA and proviral DNA were detected by real-time reverse transcription quantitative PCR amplifing Nef to monitor viral loads in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and for provirus detection in PBMCs, the gag region was amplified. Plasma and PBMC nucleic acid levels were also evaluated longitudinally with a provirus amplification system using a nested multiplex seminested PCR. Virus in plasma, and proviral gag DNA in PBMCs, were detected by reverse transcription multiplex seminested PCR. SIVcpz PBMC proviral detection was more sensitive than plasma provirus assessment.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: A randomized controlled trial on the treatment for acute partial ischemic stroke with acupuncture.. The effectiveness of acupuncture in acute stroke remains largely untested and unproved. A randomized, controlled trial was carried out to study the feasibility of acupuncture in combination with conventional supportive treatment for acute stroke patients. A total of 30 patients, aged 46-74, with the onset of symptoms within 36 h were enrolled into the study after appropriate screening. All patients gave informed consent. Basing on the same supportive treatment, patients were randomly assigned to a treatment with or without acupuncture. The procedure and acupoint selection were discussed and decided through several meetings of a group of senior acupuncture doctors in Taiwan. Acupuncture was applied 3 times/week for 4 weeks. During the study period, there were no problems in conducting this trial in terms of patient availability and acceptance, and physician cooperation. A significantly better neurologic outcome was observed in the acupuncture group on day 28 and day 90. The improvement in neurologic status was greatest in patients with a poor neurologic score at baseline. There were no important side effects except for one episode of dizziness related to acupuncture treatment. The data and results of this study will be used as a guideline for planning a full-scale clinical trial, e.g. sample size calculation, method of randomization with stratification of prognostic factors, choosing acupuncture points and technique of acupuncture..

Study Abstract #1: Does the addition of an SSRI improve the efficacy of a low-potency antipsychotic in patients with schizophrenia?.. The study will involve double-blind, parallel, random assignment to the addition of an SSRI to the existing, clinically approved treatment for 16 weeks. The SSRI will be fluoxetine given to schizophrenic patients at 20 mg/day.
                The comparison group consisted of continuation of the initial drug.
                It is reasonable to select 800 mg/day of chlorpromazine [CPZ] in the initial antipsychotic drug as a reference in this study because this dose represents the lower third of the dose distribution.
                The primary endpoint is PANSS score at 15 weeks from screening (i.e., 14 weeks after the initial drug is given). Patients with more than 3 CGI-S score of 4 will be selected. It is expected that the trial will require approximately 96 subjects (48 per group) to show 1.55 points of PANSS difference by two-sided alpha = 0.05 and 80 percent power.
                The most important secondary endpoint will be the PANSS score at 15 weeks from the start of random assignment.

Study Abstract #2: Effectiveness of fluoxetine in patients with schizophrenia. A randomized, double-blind, two arm study design will be used. The treatment group consists of fluoxetine and conventional treatment, and the conventional group is an equivalent comparison of 119.5 mg/day of fluoxetine.
                Both groups are expected to show similar clinical outcomes. In the fluoxetine group, drug-induced sexual disturbances will probably occur rarely.

In an effort to reduce the incidence of influenza and its serious complications, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended annual vaccination. The influenza virus has the ability to induce a wide range of clinical syndromes and to affect all age groups. Immunity to influenza acquired through infection is usually short-lived, and persons are susceptible to infection with each new strain of the virus. Although vaccination of the elderly, the young, and persons with underlying disease can reduce the severity of influenza, the degree of protection is often less than desired. The recent emergence of resistant influenza virus strains makes prevention of infection all the more critical. Prophylactic treatment with the oral neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir (Tamiflu) significantly reduced the duration and severity of influenza in the immunocompromised and elderly at higher risk for complications.

Study #1: Efficacy of oseltamivir treatment of influenza in children with asthma.

# Discussion questions:
1. Why would oseltamivir affect clinical outcomes in patients with asthma?

a. Prophylactic use is recommended for asthmatic patients at high risk of complications from influenza.

b. Prophylaxis can stop viral shedding in patients with influenza.

c. Clinicians can start patients on oseltamivir earlier in the day.

2. Why do you think study #3 did not get published?

a. Study #3 was a retrospective study.

b. There was no placebo control group in the study.

c. Influenza patients had been taking oseltamivir too long to make a good comparison between groups.

d. Patients who were treated within 12 hours of symptom onset had no difference in outcome compared with placebo-treated patients.

The current study indicates that glucocorticoids may limit myocardial inflammation and improve hemodynamic outcome, without affecting the rate of neurodevelopmental delay, neurological status or rates of perioperative complications, including acute renal failure and necrotizing enterocolitis.

# Introduction.
[/INST/] Recent studies suggest that infants and children who undergo congenital heart surgery have an increased risk of neurodevelopmental abnormalities.

## Review:
There are multiple reasons, with both clinical and surgical confounds. In addition, in the absence of a randomized controlled trial, it's possible that the clinical and surgical confounds of the various studies could be equally explained by the differences in the perioperative corticosteroid usage in the patients treated vs. not treated with steroids. For example, there was a marked difference in the use of inotropic agents such as dopamine, milrinone, and dobutamine (used in over 80% of steroid-treated patients but less than 40% of patients not treated with steroid) in both clinical trials and retrospective reports of these high-risk patients. Additionally, in our current cohort, we have shown a trend towards an increased incidence of acute kidney injury and prolonged ventilation in the steroid-treated patients.

## Steroid dosing and timing.
[/INST/] The steroid dosing and timing used by Wernovsky and colleagues and Hutchison et al. in their cohorts are similar to the pre-operative treatment strategies. A major difference between the earlier and the current study was that the Hutchison study used lower doses of dexamethasone. Although our study demonstrates a trend towards an association with improved neurodevelopmental outcomes with lower doses of steroids (dexamethasone 0.7 mg/kg in the current study compared with 1 mg/kg in the Hutchison study), the use of low-dose dexamethasone is common clinical practice today. Our study is much more recent and the results are generalizable to this current practice. In addition to the dosing and timing of steroids"
12,"[/INST] The three main topics in this chapter are the following:
1. Describe four potential uses of a qualitative study.
2. Describe the essential components of a qualitative study.
3. Describe five qualitative data analysis strategies, along with examples of their application.

What Are Qualitative Studies?. [INST] A qualitative study looks to describe a phenomenon based on the participants' experiences and perspectives. It is not about generalizing findings to make a wider inference, and the findings cannot be compared with those of other studies. Qualitative studies can be of three types. They can focus on individual cases, which are called single case studies. They can be of a group (either a few or a whole population). In the latter case, the findings are also called descriptive. Qualitative studies are most commonly known as ethnographic studies where the findings are descriptive and/or ethnographic.

Why Conduct Qualitative Studies?. [INST] Qualitative studies can give an answer to any question that cannot be answered by a quantitative study. Qualitative studies may be conducted to get an answer to a question like: What is the perception of the participants regarding a phenomenon such that this may not come out if you use a quantitative approach to the question? Another important use of qualitative studies is to help identify the need for a quantitative study. For example, if a quantitative study finds a statistically significant difference between two groups (in an experimental design, for example), but some of the basic assumptions of the study are not clearly answered, a qualitative study may be the only choice to help answer these questions. Qualitative studies may also be used to refine, elaborate, or explain the results of a quantitative study; in this type of qualitative study, the research team works in tandem with the quantitative team, as opposed to stand-alone qualitative work. Some researchers believe that qualitative studies may be conducted to find the solution to quantifiable problems. This is done by combining the qualitative interview with a quantitative part (using a scale for example); once qualitative data helps define the quantifiable, it can be taken out of the quantitative study.
Even though quantitative research is dominant and is becoming more popular, there are still many topics or questions that require answering qualitatively. Qualitative research is not as popular as quantitative research because it is not quantifiable. However"

## Post Processing
The following processing steps were performed on the training data for all of the tasks:

1. Duplicates and short inputs were removed.

2. The outputs of the tasks were merged into one file.

3. Each line in the file contained information about a single input-output pair for one sentence from training data for one of the tasks. The inputs were the words from the sentence (delimited by blank separators) and the outputs were the task labels (delimited by tabular separators).

4. All of the input and output texts were transformed into individual vectors (described below) and these vectors were concatenated to form a single string.

## Vectors & word vectors

#### Sentiment lexicon
The following list defines a lexicon that is used with sentiment analysis of the inputs from the input-output tasks. ""positive"" and ""negative"" are the two sentiment categories used with the sentiment analysis. The sentiment categories are mutually exclusive. ""neutral"" was omitted as the sentiment of the sentence when the sentiment categories are positive or negative. The sentiment categories were defined by manual human expert annotation and were made to be mutually exclusive. This work is a first step of the first version of a lexicon for a sentiment analysis of Arabic language which is underway.

### Positive categories:


### Negative categories:


### Neutral category:


## Semantic relations semantic relations
The sentence graph is the graphical representation of a sentence. The nodes in the semantic relations graph are the words in the sentence and the edges in the graph are relations between the words in the sentence. This work is a first step of the first version of the semantic relations for the ACL Arabic Sentiment Lexicon corpus which is underway. In a future work, the semantic relations need to be trained on a large body of Arabic language texts. The data sets that are currently available are limited in size. The following are some examples for semantic relations from the ACL Arabic Sentiment Lexicon corpus.

I am a computer programmer in Bangkok, Genome-Wide Association Mapping and Genetic Constraint on Insecticide Resistance in Culex pipiens

Enslaving an arthropod vector can reduce the risk of contracting mosquitoborne diseases, which causes 700,000 deaths per year. Targeted vector control relies on knowledge about the spatial distribution of vector species, but their complex life cycle and adaptability to anthropogenic and environmental perturbations hamper traditional approaches to quantify mosquito distributions. Furthermore, vector distributions can change in response to interventions such as insecticide spraying. We present a novel method that combines genome-wide SNP markers with an abundance model in a machine learning framework for classifying sites into high-, medium-, and low-density regions. We apply our method to study habitat suitability of Culex pipiens, a mosquito known to transmit West Nile virus. SNP markers were genotyped to distinguish northern Cx. pipiens f. pipiens (North American subspecies of Cx. pipiens) from Cx. pipiens f. molestus (European subspecies of Cx. pipiens) from their natural and anthropogenic habitats in New York City. An abundance model was used to combine the genetic markers with the known distributions of the subspecies to generate habitat suitability maps for both species. These findings illustrate the success of the machine learning technique in genotyping, modeling, and environmental niche estimation of Culex mosquitoes. These genetic-based methods can be combined with entomological data collected from the field to improve the effectiveness of vector surveillance and control.

18,"[/INST]Infertile couples with AMA and a ""good prognosis"" often have a poor response to controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF treatments and often have an increased pregnancy loss rate. This is related to aneuploidy of embryos, which may be detected by PGS. On the basis of RCT findings, it appears beneficial to patients with AMA and a ""good prognosis"" to perform PGS to analyze whether all embryos are structurally unanomalous and genetically normal (euploid). Although no differences with respect to pregnancy or implantation rates are found between PGS and conventional IVF, PGS resulted in lower live birth rates and higher multiple birth rates (see[/INST])..

## Internal stent vs external stent and other pancreatic anastomosis methods
Summary: [INST] Following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) with a pancreaticojejunostomy (PJ), a pancreatic duct stent may be placed. Stent placement remains controversial because of conflicting data from multiple studies. In particular, there are limited data regarding internal pancreatic duct stent versus external pancreatic duct stent.

## Research question

        [Abstract] A prospective randomized controlled trial of internal versus external drainage with pancreaticojejunostomy for pancreaticoduodenectomy.
        Internal drainage versus external drainage for pancreaticoduodenectomy.

## Study title
        A prospective randomized controlled trial of internal versus external drainage with pancreaticojejunostomy for pancreaticoduodenectomy.
        The pancreatic duct was stented in 43 patients and a closed-suction drain (Blake Drain, Tyco Healthcare Group) was placed in the main pancreatic duct or the area of the pancreatic anastomosis in 10 patients undergoing a PD with a pancreaticojejunostomy at Yazd University of Medical Sciences.
        The postoperative complication rate was not affected by pancreatic duct stent placement. The incidence of grade B or C pancreatic fistula was 25.6% in patients with pancreatic duct stent versus 15.0% in patients without (P = .226).

In reality, everyone who uses sterile water injections has the same results, regardless of which intervention they used.

Study #1: This was a well-written and clear trial, conducted in the UK and published in the BMJ in 1985.

Study #2: The authors were unfamiliar with the technique of sterile water injections via the lumbo-sacral region for the treatment of low back pain and requested that I educate myself on the method. Having reviewed the study from the perspective of someone trained in sterile water injections and with experience injecting sterile water into the skin of people with chronic low back pain, I concluded that the trial did not provide evidence that sterile water injections were effective for low back pain because the control group was not receiving the same treatment so it was not a true experiment.

Study #3: From the title and abstract it is not fully clear what was studied. The treatment group was injected with sterile water whereas the control group received subcutaneous injections of isotonic saline as a placebo. The control group was also injected with a needle on the lower back without injecting anything into the skin.

Study #4: The primary objective of the trial was to determine whether the intervention has an effect on the frequency of women giving birth via caesarean section. The article does not present data on caesarean rates because the intervention did not reduce the use of caesarean sections. The conclusions stated in the abstract are not warranted.

Study #5: The authors were unfamiliar with the technique of sterile water injections and requested that I review the trial to see if sterile water injections were effective. I decided to read the original article published in Acta Obstet Gyne col. and concluded that there was no evidence the sterile water injection was effective for low back pain. 7]

While MPH was a safe and well tolerated medication that reduced the severity of tic symptoms and ADHD symptoms in children, its effectiveness was limited, probably due to the small sample size, low MPH dosages, and/or short duration of treatment. CADRIs, such as clonidine, appear to be more likely efficacious and beneficial compared to stimulant medications for comorbid ADHD symptoms in pediatric TS patients, which warrants further study via placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.

# Introduction
The Cochrane Renal Group completed the Cochrane systematic review 1 for this topic in 2004, in which evidence based on the 20 articles, 2-21 were analyzed. The authors concluded that data regarding the safety and efficacy of spironolactone in diabetic nephropathy are insufficient. The studies included in the Cochrane systematic review are summarized in Table 22. We have summarized the latest related papers, which meet the inclusion criteria.

## Evidence for study interventions:
[/INTRODUCT]

Rationale:

## Evidence-based review of the effectiveness of thyrotropin-releasing hormone for use in prenatal glucocorticoid therapy to prevent lung disease in preterm infants

Thyrotropin-releasing hormone is a promising therapeutic agent to enhance antenatal therapy through corticosteroid administration.

To reduce preterm pulmonary disease, the combined use of maternal glucocorticoids and thyrotropin-releasing hormone was evaluated in infants at risk for respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary disease. The study design was a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, controlled clinical trial utilizing 996 women with preterm labor at <30 weeks' gestation. Infants 32 weeks of gestation and older.


# BACKGROUND..

Respiratory distress syndrome occurs in approximately 50-70% of infants with birth weight <1500g (less than 32 weeks' gestation). It causes significant respiratory morbidity, is associated with increased pulmonary mortality, and is a major risk factor for chronic lung disease in extremely preterm infants.


# OBJECTIVES..

To examine the evidence for the use of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in conjunction with glucocorticoid administration during the antenatal treatment of the woman with premature contractions in late pregnancy for improving subsequent neonatal outcome. The secondary objective was to examine the use of thyrotropin-releasing hormone in prenatal therapy in reducing preterm premature birth and the occurrence of postnatal respiratory distress syndrome and chronic lung disease in the premature infant with very low birth weight.

[/INST] There was a trend for fewer recurrent events with enoxaparin (n = 3/41; 7%) compared with unfractionated heparin (n = 7/43; 16%) for the combined endpoint of recurrent DVT or PE (p = 0.060). However, when considering a post-hoc combined endpoint of recurrent DVT or PE, the incidence of recurrent events with enoxaparin was significantly lower than that with unfractionated heparin (p = 0.026) . The incidence of adverse events (n = 12/103 [12%]) or bleeding episodes (n = 9/103 [9%]) was similar in the enoxaparin (n = 10 [10%];  = 28) and unfractionated heparin (n = 23 [23%]; = 23) groups. Major bleeding occurred with lower-extremity bleeding in 1 patient who had received enoxaparin and 2 patients who had received unfractionated heparin. The 60 enoxaparin-treated patients who went home on day 1 all received home-care treatment. There were no deaths in either group and no cases of symptomatic postthrombotic syndrome.

36,"[/INST] A New Method for Measuring Fibrinogen in Whole Blood
Summary A new turbidimetric method for measuring the turbidity of fibrinogen in whole blood is presented. Turbidimetric measurements of the precipitate of plastein fibrin as well as of the original serum fibrinogen are compared to the results of the thrombotest, a widely used method for estimating fibrinogen. The thrombotest is shown to be a suitable method when blood containing clots is used for fibrinogen determination. However, the thrombotest is sensitive to such interfering proteins as Beta G globulin, when sera free from clots are evaluated. When sera free from clots are used in place of whole blood, it is found that they show a tendency to give high fibrinogen determination if measured by the proposed new turbidimetric method. The results obtained from different methods seem to be better correlated with the thrombodynamometer than to each other. A positive correlation between age and turbidimetrically determined fibrinogen was found using a method in which the clotting reaction was induced by the addition of thromboplastin. No correlation was found between fibrinogen measured by the two methods used to be most appropriate for analysing whole blood. Clinical Presentation of Cutaneous and Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Diagnosed in a Dental Hospital in Southwestern Iran

Aim: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a tumor of the upper aerodigestive tract, has a heterogeneous clinical presentation. We review 70 cases of cutaneous SCC and oral SCC to assess their presenting complaints, time of diagnosis, and treatment. The patients were divided into two groups: 25 patients with cutaneous SCC (cSCC) and 45 patients with oral mucosal SCC (oSCC). Results: While cSCC patients had a higher mean age of 79.2 years (SD: ± 10.5) than oSCC patients (64.84 years ± 9.45), the difference was not statistically significant. Among cSCC patients, 88% gave a history of sun exposure, whereas"

Assignment.. Assignment.[INST:] Include a title page that must consist of the course title, author information, date of submission and your university’s name (if applicable as it is in this case study).
Your abstract should be 300 words maximum, and you should include the following information:
- Background of the study and the related research question.
- Method of conducting the study.
- Result of the study and its findings.
Provide a discussion, implications and conclusion part. The word count limitation is set at 1500 words.
Suggested references: You should cite no more than 10 relevant sources. Do not just restate what you reported in your abstract since that would make your text longer than allowed. Instead, you can use those lines to describe how and why some outcomes occurred, but please also try to focus on the significance rather than the trivial detail of your study.
Remember that all the information you provide and use in the discussion section must come from the sources you included (referencing).

References must be presented using Vancouver method. Any resources such as webpages, images, videos, books and documents that you do not own must be cited using proper referencing style, regardless of the date, or even the copyrights.
Copyrights: You are to use the copyrights you own on your own, and provide the exact and legitimate references for any work or data that you refer to, whether it is published or not and whether it is published online or in print, and regardless of whether it requires a fee or not to access.

39,"[/INST] Considering the results of the summaries of the included studies, the best strategy would be to synthesize the information from the summary rather than just re-present the individual summaries. In particular, the summary could highlight any positive results across studies, the differences between the studies, and/or how the different results affect our understanding of treatment recommendations.

**Note: I've included a few additional questions below. Feel free to include these in your report if you wish, but I think you should leave them out of the summaries for the studies. If you have the time, feel free to provide more explanation for why you chose to include one summary format over another. This isn't strictly required, but it would be a nice addition and will make it easier for readers who are less familiar with Cochrane methods to understand how the results were synthesized.**
Question 1: How many participants were enrolled in each study?

Question 2: How often were treatments applied to each participant? (i.e. once/twice a week for 5 weeks, daily for 2 weeks, etc…)

Question 3: What types of co-interventions were administered? (e.g. exercise, education, medication, and/or other non-pharmacological therapies)

Question 4: How many and what types of authors were included/excluded in this particular citation?

Question 5: What types of treatments (alone or in combination) were received?

Question 6: What outcome measures were used?

Question 7: What was the direction of results (positive, negative, both, conflicting, etc…)?

Question 8: Which type of study design was used? (e.g. Randomized control trial, controlled trial, observational, etc…)

Question 9: If a specific type of study design was used, was it considered low/moderate/high risk of bias based on pre-determined quality assessment criteria?

Question 10: What is the level of evidence based on the Sackett scale and/or other critical appraisal tools?

To compare the effect of oxytocin and Syntometrine when used as part of active management of third stage of labour on postpartum haemorrhage, hypertension, nausea/vomiting and retained placenta.
                A randomised double blind trial was conducted in the Obstetric Unit of Corniche Hospital, Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Between 1 January 1991 and 30 June 1991, 2040 women were randomly allocated either to the oxytocin (n = 1017) or the Syntometrine (n = 1023) group. Twelve patients had to be excluded from the trial (oxytocin, 5; Syntometrine, 7) after randomisation because they no longer fulfilled the inclusion criteria. All women in the trial received either oxytocin 10 units or Syntometrine 1 ml (oxytocin 5 units+ergometrine (ergonovine) 0.5 mg) by intramuscular injection with delivery of the anterior shoulder of the baby. Relative risk with 95% confidence intervals was calculated for each variable.
                Oxytocin (10 units) alone was as effective as Syntometrine (1 ml) in preventing post-partum haemorrhage without an increase in the incidence of retained placenta. Median blood loss was similar in both groups. The incidences of nausea, vomiting and headache were significantly lower in the oxytocin group, as was the occurrence"

## Strengths and limitations of the review

### Strengths of the review:
1.
We performed a literature search aimed at identifying all randomized or quasi-randomized trials evaluating interventions for the treatment of corneal abrasion.
2.
We reported our selection process and reasons using a PRISMA flow diagram and the PRISMA statement for reporting systematic reviews.

### Limitations of the review:
1.
Some studies may have been missed during the search process as only studies reported in English and French and those with English abstracts were included in the analysis; however, the search terms were comprehensive and 64% of the studies were found even when we only searched for articles in English and French.

54,"[/INST] Isolation of the human homolog of the mouse cysteine string protein (Csp) gene: expression in normal and regenerating human peripheral nerve.
The mouse cysteine string protein (Csp) gene encodes multiple isoforms and is the first identified member of a novel gene family. The function of Csp remains unknown although expression in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nerve (PN) has suggested an important role. Based upon the homology between the gene sequences of the mouse and human, a cDNA clone encoding the human analog of Csp has been isolated and sequenced. Expression analyses of Csp by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction, Northern blot and in situ hybridization techniques have shown that transcripts encoding Csp protein are abundant in several neuronal cell types. Northern analyses also show the expression of these transcripts during the first week of murine brain cell culture. In addition, transcripts have also been detected for the first time in the human PN. Interestingly, expression of Csp transcripts within the neuronal cell bodies of the dorsal root and sciatic nerves showed a pattern that was correlated with the level of regenerative activity in these tissues.

[/INSTRUCTIONS Rehabilitation training increases the excitability of the motor cortex in patients with chronic motor deficit from ischemic stroke
Brain plasticity is essential for successful motor recovery after stroke. Functional neuromodulation techniques including rehabilitation training, treadmill walking, and physical therapy have shown benefits for improving motor recovery and reducing motor impairment in stroke patients. The excitability of primary motor cortices in these patients remains unknown. It is important to identify the neuronal changes associated with motor recovery after treatment to further elucidate the mechanisms. We used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to test cortical excitability. Motor evoked potentials (MEPs) were recorded from finger flexor muscles using electromyography (EMG). The cortical excitability was found to be significantly higher in the nonhemiparetic motor cortex when compared to that in the contralateral damaged primary motor cortex by evaluating motor threshold (MT). The results also uncovered that rehabilitation training and treadmill walking might be more effective than no training and nonphysical therapy for reducing motor impairment and improving motor recovery.

# Discussion and Exclusion Criteria

# Discussion of Evidence

# Strength of Evidence

## Rationale for Number of Studies Reviewed
The goal of evidence synthesis here was to develop a concise, yet comprehensive summary of the evidence (literature) for the treatment of adults with OA. We felt that it made most sense to conduct a scoping review to accomplish this goal. OA is heterogeneous and a scoping review was thought to represent the best opportunity to cover the broad range of questions and sub-questions that could be answered through a rigorous systematic review (SR) of the published literature.
As evidence emerged, the study team noticed that the evidence was limited and thus we added a secondary aim focused on identifying gaps in the existing evidence. Through this process, we identified several gaps and were able to create a concept for a more robust SR that is planned through December 2020. While the current discussion was able to address specific questions in the context of OA management and treatment, there were many limitations. To understand the limitations of our scoping review process better, we have provided an overview of our results in the next box.

## Summary of findings: strengths and limitations

# Summary of Findings (Key Evidence): Summary:  a) There is strong evidence to support that physiotherapy combined with education and supervised exercise may minimize pain and increase function in people with knee and hip OA. b) There is weak evidence that exercise alone is recommended in reducing symptoms of knee OA. c) There is weak evidence to suggest that pain reduction achieved with a rangeof-motion exercise program could be achieved with a conventional physiotherapy program. d) There is moderate evidence to support that, for people with knee OA, there is no significant difference between aerobic and resistance/ strengthening exercise programs in improving pain, physical function, or quality life. e) There is weak evidence to suggest that exercise has no differential benefit in reducing pain and function in people with knee OA based on baseline disability level. f) There is weak evidence to propose that the addition of exercise to patient education is effective in reducing pain compared to patient education alone. g) There is weak evidence to suggest that education alone is effective in reducing disability in knee OA. h) There is"

Antenatal phenobarbital appears to be a safe and effective alternative to prophylactic indomethacin administration.

### Reproductive:

Study #1: Effect of antenatal betamethasone and phenobarbital in the prevention of postnatal complications in the very low birth weight infant. (10-week-old mice) were infused with 100 ml of culture medium containing 1-100 micrograms of phenobarbital/ml and the mice were killed at various times after the injection. Barbiturates were determined in the liver, brain, and serum. In addition, the animals were tested to determine their coordination capacities, their spontaneous movement, and their learning capacity. Barbiturate concentrations were determined in the liver, brain and serum and correlation of these concentrations with the various parameters of brain damage was attempted. A significant correlation was observed between barbiturate concentration in the liver and cerebellar ataxia; between barbiturate concentration in serum and ataxia of the hind legs; and between barbiturate concentration in the brain and spontaneous movement. No such correlations could be obtained between barbiturate levels and learning capacity. However, a significant correlation was found between the various parameters relating to brain damage and serum barbiturate concentrations, indicating that the cerebellar ataxia, the inability to find the platform in maze learning tests, and the histological brain damage in treated rats could be associated to the high serum barbiturate levels.. Our results indicate that phenobarbital has a neurotoxic effect. There was no correlation between the dose of barbiturate intrauterine and the brain damage in the treated animals. The neurotoxicity of phenobarbital probably does not differ significantly from that of other barbiturates. In addition to its anticonvulsant properties, phenobarbital induces histological brain damage and impairs the behavioral capacities of treated animals.

# Strategies for Integration of Study Summary Findings
Consider your summary as an integral section of the entire EBM project; you have worked hard to earn your grade, so don't waste the chance to integrate all elements so they work together to answer your research question and formulate a clinical decision.

# Introduction#INTRO, #Q2

  * The reviewed studies, including the meta-analyses, will help you focus and clarify the scope of your investigation.
  * The summary of studies should be succinct and clearly labeled as background or literature review. It is inappropriate to copy and paste the entire manuscript of a primary study into your background section.
* Review the clinical questions you generated from the pre-applied PICOT.
* Review the list of your search results and the screened studies; assess how useful each study is to the population, intervention, comparison, or treatment effect in each, or none of these, questions. 
  * Really consider the evidence you have read, how it supports or disconfirm the PICOT. Write about this.
  * Write about the search bias, if any. 
* Write about unexpected findings, if any. Include the relevance and possible significance of the findings to your intended clinical decision making. Remember you are forming an EBM base, and now we will use that information to create an application to practice.  
* Discuss how the body of evidence in the reviewed articles either confirms or rejects your initial PICOT. Are you surprised?

# Discussion#DISC
  * As you wrote the previous sections of the manuscript, try to integrate these ideas here too, but avoid repeating yourself. For example, summarize how clinicians can better understand the body of evidence to decide on use of the medication. 

* Revisit your clinical practice question, if necessary. Revise it in terms of the study results -- you would apply the mediation to this question and the EBM for this project.

### Background
This is an interim response from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to your inquiry on the intermittent primaquine treatment of vivax malaria.  The response is based in part on a review of the published medical literature on the subject of intermittent primaquine. The following is a summary of the evidence available at this time and is intended as a resource in deciding whether to adopt intermittent primaquine.

### Primaquine in the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria
Chloroquine treatment is often followed by a blood stage relapse a few weeks later (approximately 20-70% of cases depending on geographic region of the world), and thus primaquine is highly indicated when malaria control agencies wish to decrease relapse of P. vivax. At the 1959 World Malaria Conference a committee was convened to discuss the primaquine, which brought together a group of scientists and physicians that had long experience. When a 5-dose course of primaquine was recommended the dose length was also agreed upon. 14-patient on both had been given the of experience and relapse. The decision to include 7 day(s and the malaria and the drug of primaquine at this tool for its study for a clinical evaluation of drug administration of the course.

Ticks harvested from dogs and cattle were examined for the presence of Anaplasma platys, which is the tick-borne agent found in ticks collected from cattle in Spain. Seventy-eight ticks, collected during the spring of 2005, were tested using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a pair of primers designed for A. platys 16S ribosomal DNA. DNA from 12 samples (15.4%) was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Of the A. platys-positive ticks, 7 of 32 ticks were adults, 2 of 26 were nymphs and 3 of 19 were immatures. Of the 12 sequenced samples, 8 were positive for A. platys with a sequence similarity of 99.7-99.8% (38% nt variation of nucleotide identity). The positive results of 1 of 310 ticks collected from cattle and 5 of 38 from dogs was performed; E. chaffeensis was detected in 2 of 150 ticks with a sequence similarity value of 95.2%. Nested PCR-positive ticks are identified A. chaffeae. chaffirmedi infection. PCR. chaffe. Tickets were negative PCR of a. 24 ticks.

74,"[/INST] This analysis of this set of nine articles confirms a few general findings. Most of the studies use some sort of summary statistics, and they have a focus on what we might call a clinical summary, i.e. they include an actual assessment of the disease state. In the studies, we have a number of different ways to look at the disease. There is at least one study looking at disease prevalence -- at the highest level possible -- looking at a population; we have studies assessing disease at an aggregated level, assessing disease prevalence or levels for certain subsections of a population. These aggregated data are combined, often with an approach using odds ratios; a subset of those studies are based on meta-analytic approaches; and the other sets of studies are all at an individual level, all looking at an individual.

The other thing that is a bit more difficult to unpack is the use of a meta analysis. I don't personally think we are very good at that concept, which I understand can be used in more than one way.
So here are the articles for this set. I will not provide a full abstract for each of them, since my goal is to point out that, as you move through this set, if you know that there was some sort of meta analysis being applied, then you will see that the summary statistic is usually of an average; I think it is also the case that the disease is often assessed as some sort of continuous trait.
First, we see an association study (meta-analysis) between fluoride in water and caries..

 A randomized controlled trial comparing the effect of single and multisite acupuncture on nausea associated with radiation therapy to the breast

Background: Nausea is a frequent complaint in women undergoing radiation therapy (RT) to the breast following surgery for breast cancer. While acupuncture offers an effective option to manage nausea in some oncology populations, its application to radiation-related nausea has not been examined. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antiemetic efficacy of acupuncture in the treatment of nausea associated with RT to the breast. Methods/design: Seventy women with breast cancer who are receiving adjuvant breast RT for node positive breast cancer will be randomized into two groups: 1) low intensity laser acupuncture plus sham acupuncture, or 2) real acupuncture plus sham acupuncture. Women will receive laser acupuncture (real or sham laser acupuncture) twice weekly between the second week of RT and the completion of treatment. All patients will receive two traditional acupuncture treatments, real or sham. Acupuncture treatments will use points chosen for their specific antiemetic properties and needling will be done at each of these points. Following completion of RT, participants will be asked to report nausea and associated outcomes (quality of life) on an online questionnaire weekly for three weeks and will undergo a clinical interview at these time points for collection of standardized nausea assessment and other symptom scores. Primary outcome measure is area under the nausea score curve, i.e. the area under the nausea score for the first 3 weeks of RT. Secondary outcomes include other symptom scales at these three time points. Discussion: The purpose of this study is to determine whether acupuncture is an effective treatment to rel"

 Bone Resorption by Osteoclasts.
The skeleton is a dynamic structure that undergoes constant renewal due to bone resorption by osteoclasts, while new bone is formed by osteoblasts. Osteoclasts derive from hematopoietic precursors, which migrate from the hemopoietic system into the bone marrow space during development. Osteoclast precursors in vitro differentiate in the presence of receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANKL) into mononucleated osteoclasts that form multinucleated osteoclasts via cell fusion. Proliferation and differentiation are driven by RANKL but a second signal is essential for full activation and functions. Osteoclasts are large plasma cell-like cells with a huge ruffled border, actin-rich lamellipodia and filopodia. They resorb bone in two different ways: first a small pit is formed followed by progression in a larger pit in a directional movement toward the resorption site. The osteoclast ruffled border acts as a secretory organ that acidifies, demineralizes and releases cytokines and collagens into the resorption site. Osteocytes located inside the bone are essential for osteoclast functions. In addition to mechanosensation, they regulate bone turnover, they signal to the immune system to inhibit osteoclast formation and in vivo act in concert with the local immune response for bone homeostasis. Sustained bone destruction by osteoclasts is associated with degenerative bone diseases such as osteoporosis or cancer-induced skeletal changes. Understanding the function of osteoclasts in bone turnover and disease conditions will provide novel therapeutic targets to treat inhibition and stimulation of bone resorption and new insights into the"

There is also evidence that metformin improves the cycle outcome in PCOS. Although the evidence is limited and derived from studies with small number of participants, these data are promising and give a strong rational for the use of metformin during a controlled ovarian stimulation program in this patient group but this fact needs to be investigated further in a future research study with more patients. Finally, metformin given prior to and during ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (IVF) in insulin-resistant women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) significantly reduced the requirement of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone and significantly increased the retrieved oocytes. Prevalence and socioeconomic patterning of childhood underweight, stunting and wasting in rural South Africa.
BACKGROUND
The prevalence of malnutrition (underweight, stunting and wasting) in children under five years in South Africa is high. Data from the available national household surveys do not provide sufficient information to monitor progress towards the South African Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which include improvements in nutrition. We provide up-to-date estimates of child underweight, stunting and wasting prevalence in South Africa using the 2003 South African National HIV and Malnutrition in Children Survey, which is representative of rural areas. The present study examines the relationship between low weight status and socioeconomic status.


METHOD
A total of 4,206 children aged 6 - 59 months were selected from 411 enumeration areas. Anthropometric measurements were conducted in the children's households.


RESULTS
Approximately 20% of the children underweight and 34% of the children are stunted; 11% are wasted. Child underweight, stunting and wasting all show a strong socioeconomic gradient. Children in the lowest socio"

Combined therapy with ipratropium bromide and fenoterol should allow clinicians to reduce the total amount of these drugs and the total number of administrations, and thus decrease the side effects of these therapies. Ipratropium bromide is a muscarinic receptor antagonist. We investigated the effectiveness of inhaled ipratropium bromide alone and in combination with a short-acting beta2-agonist, fenoterol, for in the treatment of mild to moderate asthma. We also evaluated the safety and tolerability of this new drug.

Patients and Methods:
The patients (1291) were children and adults who had a history of asthma and a diagnosis of asthma confirmed at the time of enrollment. The patients who had received either ipratropium bromide or fenoterol within 24 hours of enrollment were excluded. Patients 18 years of age or younger received a single dose of ipratropium bromide 0.02 mg by inhalation. Patients 19 years of age or older received a single dose of ipratropium bromide 0.04 mg by inhalation. Each patient recorded on a form the symptoms of airflow blockage and the use of rescue medications before receiving medication. After medication administration, patients recorded the symptoms every 20 minutes for a total of 20 minutes and then every 40 minutes until 120 minutes had elapsed. If improvement was noted in a recorded symptom the patients were advised to stop recording the symptom, but they were not required to do so. In addition to the reported symptom scores, pulse rate and blood pressure were also determined.

Results:
Fenoterol, a beta2-agonist, 5 mg was administered over the first half hour of the study period. Within 20 minutes, fenoterol reduced wheezes, short breaths, and nighttime awakenings"

Study #11: Evaluation of a partner support intervention for improving smoking cessation among pregnant women in the United Kingdom..
                To examine (a) the effect of including partner support to self-help materials for smoking cessation during pregnancy; and (b) the combined effects of including partner support over various time-points.
                The trial comprised two groups: (a) a partner support intervention group who were sent self-help materials and self-help materials to give to friends and family, and six telephone calls with a Health Advisor over 12 weeks; and (b) a usual care group who received self-help materials only. Self-help materials comprised a comprehensive booklet and 8-week planner. Telephone calls started within 2 weeks of baseline. After the 6-week posttreatment test, the partner support intervention group received two reminder/support calls every 2 weeks up to week 12. The trial was carried out in two maternity hospitals in Belfast, Northern Ireland. Participants were recruited at booking visits into the trial after the 12-week postpartum test had been completed. Eligibility for both groups was that participants had an intention to quit smoking during pregnancy and were between 10 and 24 weeks pregnant.
                Participants randomized to the partner support intervention group were contacted by an experienced Health Advisor. The Health Advisor established with each participant the most appropriate telephone contact and frequency. Health Advisors encouraged smoking cessation in the participant, discussed nicotine replacement therapy and other smoking cessation treatments, and discussed any problems participants may be having in quitting smoking.
                Abstinence among pregnant women was self-reported and verified by exhaled carbon monoxide levels at the 32-week and 36-week gestational assessments.

Pooled results showed pain relief from surgical debridement using EMLA, without evidence of major adverse events. Pain control was achieved by the reduction of the amount of tissue debrided. We concluded that topical analgesia with EMLA provides sufficient pain relief for debridement of venous leg ulcers..

## Preclinical Summaries:
The table summarizes the four preclinical studies included for use case #2: Preclinical Summaries

# Risk of bias:
The risk of bias in the preclinical and human studies is described in Section 4.6 of the PICO Table above..

# Study Design Notes:
1) In order to be sure of the methodology of the studies, the full text, or if not available, and when a conference abstract was used, the entire proceedings of the conference containing the abstract were obtained.
2) To assess the level of evidence, it was necessary to convert the study designs to study objectives, and the results were evaluated based on the main outcome.
For clinical trials (which are the focus of the present report), the study design can be considered on three levels: single objective, secondary objective, and exploratory objective. Thus, a trial with multiple endpoints can have one primary endpoint, e.g., pain, and several secondary endpoints, e.g., efficacy of ulcer debridement.
Objectives can also be divided into two classes: treatment related and surrogate. Surrogate endpoints are those which stand in for the desired endpoint (pain in the example cited above). A study with a single primary endpoint (pain) would constitute a single objective treatment-related study. However, an investigation with two primary endpoints (pain, and debridement) would be considered as a double objective treatment-related study, while a study with an additional objective (surrogate, e.g., efficacy of ulcer debridement) would be considered as a double objective treatment-surrogate study.
We evaluated studies primarily on the basis of the treatment-related endpoints, when any were provided. If a study had only surrogate objectives, that study was eliminated"

 Pituitary hormones: in vitro binding to bovine pituitary membranes.
The binding site for somatotropin (STH) to adenohypophyseal membrane preparations was investigated in a series of radioligand binding experiments. At 37°C, the binding of radioiodinated STH was rapid and attained equilibrium within 16 to 18 hours. The specific binding of STH to pituitary membrane preparations was saturable, reversible, and of low affinity. The membrane preparation was stable in the presence of STH and a single class of binding protein for STH was demonstrated. A binding of STH to the pituitary membrane preparation was prevented by the addition of thyroid hormones or luteinizing hormone. LH also had a suppressive effect on the binding of TSH and prolactin. However, insulin and glucagon did not have the same inhibiting effect. These experiments indicate that the binding sites are of single class, have low affinity, and are competitively inhibited by STH and TSH. The pituitary membrane preparation is stable and specific in its binding of STH but has a low affinity for this hormone. Assumptions and consequences of bivariate normality in cluster randomised trial designs
A clustered randomised controlled trial (RCT) is recommended when there is good reason to suppose that the unit of randomisation is not a good approximation of the unit of intervention. However, when the unit of measurement of the outcome variables is, or may be, the same as the unit of randomisation this assumption does not hold and an analysis of the aggregate data from the trial must be conducted. The analyst assumes that there is a normal distribution of the random effects. This assumption is untestable in the context of RCTs and may be unrealistic since the distributions of the interventions in the clusters will rarely be normal. In this paper we consider the theoretical distribution of the clustered treatment effect to assess the extent of departures from normality. We then look at how these departures relate to the inferential consequences of the analysis and the effect of alternative approaches on the results and the conclusions drawn. It is shown how different estimators for"

Study #5: Evaluating the use of statin therapy in MS (SEASMO): protocol for a parallel, randomised controlled trial of simvastatin in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. . MS is a chronic, demyelinating, inflammatory disease of the central nervous system manifesting clinically as relapses. Current treatment is based on the use of immunomodulatory drugs, that have been largely ineffective against the progressive phase of the disease. Studies in EAE and MS lesions suggest a role for the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway in the inflammatory demyelination that characterises the disease. Simvastatin, a cholesterol lowering drug and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce relapse rate in a parallel, randomized study in RRMS. A parallel, double-blinded randomized study of 200 mg simvastatin versus placebo. The clinical and MRI primary end-points are number of relapses, number of new and enlarging lesions in the period 12 - 24 months post randomisation. Safety and adherence to medication are secondary outcomes. The study enrols patients with RRMS and at least one relapse in the previous year. The duration of the study is 24 months. Preliminary data of the on-going SEASMO trial will be used to power the sample size calculation. If the SEASMO trial will have a positive result, the use of statins would become an off-label second-line option for RRMS patients and would contribute to the treatment of MS. Furthermore, we are interested in understanding molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of statins in RRMS.

# Discussion
In patients with HFS, the effect of treatment on functional outcomes should be analyzed using a validated outcome instrument with evidence of psychometric properties. The outcomes that are more commonly evaluated are walking capacity, balance, ambulation and mobility, physical strength and function, lowering fall risk, and quality of life of patients.
The primary data analysis reveals that patients managed with Fracture Liaison Services (FLSs) have a high number of patients screened and treated. Furthermore, patients are less likely to experience additional hip fractures, have a better quality of life and are more likely to return to the community for long-term care, as compared to their matched controls. However, it is unclear from the available data if HFS improves the patient's ability to perform his/her daily activities.
A study using a standardized physical therapy (PT) screening and triage program indicated that 66% of patients screened underutilized the rehabilitation services in hospital, and there was very little access to outpatient community PT services among patients postdischarge. Another study reported that early intervention in PT, by hospital staff and physical therapist home health, can improve the mobility of older patients posthip fracture. Although there are no specific protocols published to date, this study suggested that early initiation of rehabilitation will improve the functional abilities of older adults postfracture.
We reviewed several articles published in the literature. All of these articles focus on determining the clinical outcomes in patients with HFS; these outcomes included functional activity, mobility, gait, and balance, pain, functional mobility, fall risk, and quality of life. Furthermore, articles also focused on a secondary fracture, discharge location, mortality, cost of care, hospital stay, and surgical procedures. However, based on our current best available evidence, FLS did not lead to a change in healthcare utilization in adults with HFS.

[/CONTRI] Evaluation of the impact of a clinical decision management alert in the treatment of children for acute diarrhea using the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness approach.
BACKGROUND
Low rates of identification and treatment of acute diarrhea contribute to the persistence of childhood diarrhea, despite the global availability of oral rehydration salts (ORS) solutions.


OBJECTIVE
To investigate the impact of clinical decision management (CDM) alerts on acute diarrhea diagnosis and treatment using Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) guidelines in a tertiary hospital in Uganda.


DESIGN
We used a randomized trial design to measure changes in diagnosis and treatment of acute diarrhea.


SETTING
The study took place in Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda.


PATIENTS
We enrolled 455 children younger than 5 years with diarrhea.


MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
We reported treatment rates for acute diarrhea and correct identification of acute diarrhea as a primary outcome measure, and diarrhea signs and symptoms.


RESULTS
Most (83.2%) patients received ORS solutions; 73 (49.7%) of 148 patients in the intervention group correctly identified acute diarrhea compared with 39 (43.9%) of 89 patients in the control group (P =.009). After the intervention, 40 of 76 patients in the intervention group (52.6%) had a reduction in dehydration status compared with 17 of 65 patients in the control group (26.1%; P =.003). Differences in clinical improvement were statistically significant between the intervention group and the control group (29  of 76 vs 13  of 65, respectively; P = .03), with 2 patients"
105,"[/INST]

These seven studies are a diverse group, the only common denominator being the use of systematic reviews. Other notable differences include the research settings (a health care system, a public or university-based hospital, and a county mental health clinic), the participant population (primarily ethnically diverse adults), and the scope of the interventions (abusive relationships, preventive health, prenatal support, and screening).


### Conducting research

All seven of these studies were systematic reviews or other research-based summaries that identified specific interventions for specific problems. The types of interventions varied from simple to highly complex, depending on the type or severity of the problem.

Some of these interventions, especially those dealing with abuse or prenatal support, have been described as very complex. When developing and implementing these programs, researchers often have to work with a variety of stakeholders. These stakeholders, who might include clinicians, policymakers, researchers, and patients, must be brought together to design and deliver a comprehensive and effective treatment or support program. It is important to remember that this type of collaboration may require a different approach than traditional research, one based more on relationships and partnerships than strictly on scientific rigor. Aspects of this kind of groupwork are discussed in greater detail later in this book.

It is important to note that it is nearly impossible to be completely unbiased in these evaluations. Each researcher has his or her biases and perspectives, ranging from clinical insights to specific research interests. If you have a strong opinion on a topic, it is important to understand what is already known about it and what remains unknown. Some of the more recent studies included in this book make use of meta-analysis as a primary approach and have extensive literature reviews in the background of the study. In addition, it is vital to remember that a systematic review is only as valid as the research included, the quality of the research, and the review itself.

Once a systematic review has been conducted, the researcher must decide how to put it to use. At this point, we'll touch on some strategies the researcher might use, including the development of new practices, the revision of an existing approach, or the dissemination of the findings to the target population.

Study #3: Day hospital/crisis respite care versus inpatient care, Part I: Clinical outcomes.. The authors investigated the clinical feasibility and the outcome for patients of a program designed as an alternative to acute hospitalization.
                This was a random-design study comparing a conventional inpatient program for urban, poor, severely ill voluntary patients who usually require hospitalization to an alternative experimental program consisting of a day hospital linked to a crisis residence. Patients were assessed with standardized measures of symptoms, functioning, social adjustment, quality of life, and satisfaction with clinical services upon admission to the study, at discharge from the index admission, and at follow-ups 2, 5, and 10 months after discharge.
                One hundred ninety-seven patients were enrolled in the 2-year research program and followed for 10 months. Of the voluntary patients who would have been admitted to the hospital, 83% were appropriate for the experimental program. The clinical, functional, social adjustment, quality of life, and satisfaction outcome measures were not statistically different for the patients in the two treatment conditions; however, there was a slightly more positive effect of the experimental program on measures of symptoms, overall functioning, and social functioning.
                The experimental condition, a combined day hospital/crisis respite community residence, seems to have had the same treatment effectiveness as acute hospital care for urban, poor, acutely ill voluntary patients with severe mental illness..

 Enhanced electrocatalytic activity and stability of Ag NP and Au-Ag NP nanobranched nanowires synthesized by a simple hydrothermal technique.
Ag nanobranched nanowires (Ag NBWNs) have been synthesized by a simple hydrothermal procedure using ascorbic acid and NaOH. In addition, Au-Ag NBWNs were also synthesized, and Ag was used as the support material to fix Au nanoparticles (NPs). Morphology analysis showed that the length and diameter of the NBWNs were around 60-120 µm and 20-40 nm, respectively. The Ag NBWNs and Au-Ag NBWNs as electrocatalysts were applied for the reduction of 4-nitrophenol (4-NP) to 4-aminophenol (4-AP), which is used to evaluate catalytic activity. Cyclic voltammetry investigations showed that there was a higher current in the electrocatalytic reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP with Ag NBWNs compared to the other catalysts of Au-Ag nanocubes (Au-Ag NPs) and Au-Ag NBWNs. On the other hand, all of the three electrocatalysts for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP were stable and the catalytic activity can be maintained for 10 h after five successive cycles. The higher current of the Ag NBWNs for the reduction of 4-NP to 4-AP may be due to a higher specific surface area and lower pore size. Meanwhile, the synergy effect of Au and Ag can also help to improve the electrocatalytic activity and stability of Ag NBWNs. The as-prepared Ag NBWNs as electrocatalysts can also demonstrate their efficient catalytic activity for the reduction of dyes for dye-sensitized solar cells and the reduction of dye to an optical thin film for organic light-emitting diodes.

114,"[/INST] Evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of deprenyl and co‐trimoxazole therapy in combination compared with deprenyl therapy alone. Also investigate whether deprenyl and co‐trimoxazole therapy had beneficial effects on the general condition and motor functions of these patients.

Thirty‐nine patients with advanced Parkinson's disease were randomized to receive 10 mg deprenyl per day during the first 12 weeks. Subsequently, half of the deprenyl group received additional 48 mg of co‐trimoxazole per day, while the rest continued receiving 10 mg deprenyl. All of the patients were evaluated at 3‐month intervals and the data were submitted to statistical analyses.

[/INST] In the study there were 22 patients in the deprenyl group during the 12 months. In the co‐trimoxazole group there were 17 patients. The primary effect of the deprenyl treatment was an increase in dopamine metabolism and significant improvements in motor functions. During the co‐trimoxazole treatment a significant deterioration was found in the motor functions without any change in the dopamine metabolism. No significant decline was observed in the mental functions or in quality of life of patients in either of the two groups. [/EXTRA] In patients with Parkinson's disease, a higher than normal level of dopamine was observed in the platelets as a consequence of the disease, and deprenyl therapy enhanced the dopamine content even further.

In this study there were 8 patients with essential tremor. These patients were treated with the same dosages of deprenyl and received placebo for the first 12 weeks. After that, the placebo group patients were administered deprenyl. No significant change was seen in the clinical, neurological, or dopamine metabolism. Deprenyl and co‐trimoxazole therapy seem to be not beneficial in the treatment of patients with advanced Parkinson's disease.

All other areas of concern include normal growth and mental health (with no history of depression, anxiety, self-injurious or self-injurious behaviors, or sexual activity). She notes that her older sister currently takes an oral contraceptive pill. She admits to significant weight fluctuations of up to 10 to 12 pounds within the past few years following a high school athletic career. She has been single since menarche.


The relevant systemic history is significant strangulations are anemia, and menstruments history systemic data is relevant history menstrual history system, which she takes note that of the most appropriate history of the historymenstructions in history information history.

                   It takes 27 minutes for it to recognize that it has ten toes. By this time a person’s body recognizes that they have legs, feet and toes. The process of recognizing that one has all parts is called body scheme.
                   A doctor named Joseph Wood is given credit for being the first person to prove the existence of the body scheme.
                   The body scheme can now be measured scientifically using a technique called mirror visual search.

Your task is to synthesize the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question.
Combine the insights from the provided abstracts into a cohesive summary. Your summary should integrate the findings rather than listing them separately. It's crucial to maintain the scientific integrity of the original studies while ensuring the summary is accessible and informative.
The output should only be the summary. Do not explain how you summarize it.

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Tracheostomy in ventilator dependent trauma patients: a prospective, randomized intention-to-treat study.. Tracheostomy is a commonly performed procedure in ventilator dependent patients. Many critical care practitioners believe that performing a tracheostomy early in the postinjury period decreases the length of ventilator dependence as well as having other benefits such as better patient tolerance and lower respiratory dead space. We conducted a randomized, prospective, single institution study comparing the length ventilator dependence in critically ill multiple trauma patients who were randomized to two different strategies for performance of a tracheostomy. We hypothesized that earlier tracheostomy would reduce the number of days of mechanical ventilation, frequency of pneumonia and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay.
                Patients were eligible if they were older than 15 years and either a Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) >4 with a negative brain computed tomography (CT) (no anatomic head injury), or a GCS >9 with a positive head CT (known anatomic head injury). Patients who required tracheostomy for facial/neck injuries were excluded. Patients were randomized to an intention to treat strategy of tracheostomy placement before day 8 postinjury or after day 28.
                The study was halted after the first interim analysis. There were 60 enrolled patients, who had comparable demographics between groups. There was no significant difference between groups in any outcome variable including length of ventilator support, pneumonia rate, or ICU length of stay.
                A strategy of tracheostomy before day 8 postinjury in this group of trauma patients did not reduce the number of days of mechanical vent"

## St. john wort[INST]
Summary: [/INST] This sample of studies represents the general clinical trial results of St. John wort in depressed students or adults without severe or chronic depression. St. John wort was generally more effective than a placebo or an SSRI. St. John wort is typically a dietary supplement, and therefore the quantity and dosage were not consistent across the studies. The studies varied in dosages, time for taking St. John wort, and study size. For example, three of these studies compared St. John wort to placebo for 6 to 8 weeks, and found that St. John wort had a higher therapeutic effect for short-term anxiety. One study showed that St. John wort was more effective than a SSRI (fluoxetine hydrochloride). It should be considered that because St. John wort is typically a dietary supplement, there was significant variability in dosages or time that the St. John wort was ingested. Finally, the research on efficacy of St. John wort is considered to be low based on limited RCTs conducted with non-clinical depressed patients. St John's wort is typically a dietary supplement, and therefore a high dosage/quantity was not consistent across the studies. [/INST]

These study abstracts share in common the fact that inorganic iodine compounds can be used to prevent or treat iodine deficiency among school children. The first four study abstracts describe how these compounds are effective at preventing excessive hypothyrotropinemia among school children with mild iodine deficiency. The final study abstract describes an intervention with iodized salt to school children in the Kangra Valley in India to prevent goiter.

For each of the five abstracts you read, take notes on paper in your table as you examine the content, structure, and readability of each abstract. Record your responses to the following prompts (include a brief rationale for each):

# Abstract

134,"[/INST] This study was conducted to determine whether a head-mounted video magnifier (LVES) and a closed-circuit television CCTV (Innovents Magni-Cam) were equivalent for performance and preference in low-vision patients. Using a within-patients design, 16 low-vision participants used the LVES and CCTV, at a distance of three feet, to read words under controlled conditions. Subjects were provided with all low vision aids available to them and were allowed free choice of CCTV settings. To maintain experimental control but still to offer the most realistic setting possible, subjects were given access to one, three, or five lines of text. Subjects were asked to read words through closed loop (simulated reading) and through open-loop (actual reading) testing conditions. All participants completed a three-month intervention period with three-month return visits. Reading Speed, Word Perception Efficiency, and the Preference/Intention to Recommend questionnaire were used to measure performance and preference. Results were analyzed on the primary dependent variable of subjects' average, reading speed and adjusted for the main effects of independent variables (reading level, viewing mode, and type of lens). The analysis revealed no statistically significant differences between the two vision enhancement devices in either reading efficiency or subject preference. Tumour suppressor p53 inhibits hypertrophy-mediated myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion injury.
AIMS
The tumour suppressor p53, a DNA-binding protein, is implicated as an important regulator of cell cycle, growth, and cell death. Despite the fact that p53 has been reported to exert a protective effect on ischemic myocardial injury in both wild-type and genetically modified mice, its biological roles during hypertrophy and hypertrophy-induced ischaemia and reperfusion are not well defined.


METHODS AND RESULTS
Neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with forced expression of p53 mutant H175/181, p53 wild-type (G159H), and shp53 (small interfering RNA of p53) or empty vector, respectively, were subjected to an ex vivo 'hypertro"

The mortality rate for all three groups and cardiovascular inpatient mortality for the first two groups were similar. Mortality occurred principally from non-cardiovascular causes.
Drugs which inhibit platelet aggregation, particularly aspirin, and warfarin, reduce the overall risk of vascular events in non-rheumatic heart disease. Cerebral ischemia is a more common cause of stroke in rheumatic heart disease than elsewhere. Both aspirinhibitors.

# Summary:
We believe that our study provides convincing evidence of significant benefits from colorectal cancer screening in asymptomatic average risk individuals. We also believe that the study provides the basis for the population-based clinical practice program and for further research. We have demonstrated that screening using the Hemoccult fecal occult blood tests can significantly reduce CRC-specific deaths in average risk asymptomatic persons. CRC is less likely to occur in the lower colon after the onset of screening thus avoiding unnecessary colonoscopy by focusing attention to the lesions in the lower third.

## Background and objective:
Population-based screening for reducing colorectal cancer mortality is a widely accepted concept. Although screening modalities with high sensitivity and high specificity like fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) are available, there is no consensus for the optimal screening interval, nor is there consensus on population preferences. The aim of this study is to elicit the stated preferences for screening interval from the target populations. 

# Methods:
The study was conducted in six counties, comprising in total about 2,900,000 population and a mean age of 44 years. A D-optimal design was applied to obtain data representative for the target populations. A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed to investigate the trade off between the two attributes for FOBT screening, as well as the general preference of screening interval (2-year intervals versus 3-year intervals). 

# Results:
A total of 8547 subjects participated in the DCE. It is concluded that the average of willingness to pay (WTP) for FOBT screening is €61 (95% CI 56-65) per person, or €5.19 per year per person. It appears that the population is willing to pay a significant amount to be given an option of choice on screening interval, more than a 2-year rather than a 3-year interval. 

# Conclusions:
The preferences of the target population for the FOBT program were elicited. People are willing to pay for the option of shortening the screening interval. The WTP is higher for 2-year than for 3"

# Background.
Myofascial pain with TM disorders is a combination of myocytes that have contracted to a tonus other than physiological and this may be due to psychological or organismic factors.. The result of contracture of the myocytes to an abnormal tonus is a series of effects including: 1) restriction to mandibular movements; 2) reduced mobility in all planes resulting in a less effective bite and lower masticatory forces; 3) increased muscle activity; 4) increased muscle thickness; 5) muscle shortening, leading to temporomandibular joint discomfort, crepitation, clicking or noise, and pain in masticatory movement; and 6) discomfort in the neck and in the masseter muscles, which can result in pain in the neck; these disorders can interfere with the function of the temporomandibular system and can have repercussions on the patient's physiological status, health, and comfort..

# Stomatognathic treatment.
The most commonly used and successful treatment methods in stomatognathic therapy for TMD involve the correction of faulty occlusal contacts that may arise as a result of TMD. 
Evidence of the value of occlusal treatment is found in the research by and in the studies of and . As a result of the treatment proposed by and , including occlusal and other oral appliances, 
The treatment of TMD has recently moved into the field of occlusion, and the main treatments can be grouped in the following areas: 
Orofacial orthopedics. The concept of orthopedics, which was introduced by D. G. Hunter at the end of the 19th century (Hunter 1980), 
In orthopedics, an orthopaedic device may be a removable appliance such as an orthodontic activator (Skoog 1933; . It may also be a splint or occlusal plate (McCanney 1960). Finally, jaw exercises can be considered as a new way of treatment to modify the activity of the masticatory muscles (Granger 1930,

146,"[/INST] There is limited but consistent evidence that naltrexone reduces heroin use, improves relapse-free days, reduces HIV risk, psychiatric symptoms, and overall adjustment, although it does not improve retention or reduce days of heroin use. Naltrexone with fluoxetine was inferior to naltrexone plus placebo fluoxetine despite equivalent retention and clinical improvement. One month (56 d) of combined counseling and naltrexone could be a sufficient time to produce a clinically significant benefit. There was heterogeneity of effect, with one study showing no benefits of naltrexone and the others showing significant benefits. The 640 mg naltrexone/day was as effective as 160 + 500 mg naltrexone/day for HIV risk and psychiatric symptoms. The benefit-to-risk analysis suggests substantial clinically important benefit with naltrexone and some benefit with naltrexone with buprenorphine. While naltrexone reduces both opioid craving and use, buprenorphine only reduces opioid craving.

# Introduction
It's very interesting to do research on your chosen topic. Many studies have been conducted on this subject in the past with similar findings in general. As you read this research, you should identify some gaps. As a result, it's important to understand all the important information on your research question before you analyze anything else. It is also not enough to focus on the intervention.
You should also be aware of how they have carried out and analyzed the data. To do so, it's also very important to consider the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the study, and these points should be discussed in detail. For example, what about the validity of findings, the sample size, attrition rate?

A clinical trial was performed at the University of California Los Angeles. The Institutional Review Board and Data Privacy Officer approved the work (#12-000980). All methods were carried out in accordance with relevant guidelines and regulations. Patients provided informed consent and the data were anonymized.

## Sars-cov-2 vaccine
The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine was inactivated. Its components were isolated from cultured cells.

## Study participants
Healthcare workers who were asymptomatic for COVID-19 were enrolled. The study participants were 20 (9 males and 11 females). Their ages were: 55, 21, 39, 29, 45, 30, 58, 32, 56, 33, 35, 31, 58, 38, and 31

## Treatment
The SARS CoV-2 vaccine was given to the participants at day 0 and day 28. They were given 2.5 mg/d of the vaccine into the abdomen for the first injection. 2.5 mg/d of the vaccine was injected into either the arms or the abdomen for the second injection which was given 28 days later.

## Sample preparation
Approximately 100 uL of whole blood was used for each participant for sample preparation. The cells were separated from the plasma by centrifugation.

## Measuring the cytokines
Several different cytokines in the samples were measured by using the Bio-Plex Suspension array system ("

                A low dose of 400 mcg/mL retinoic acid (RA), a synthetic derivative of vitamin A, has been shown to increase epithelial proliferation in a variety of epithelial cancers including Barrett adenocarcinoma, esophageal high-grade dysplasia, and low-grade dysplasia.
                The objective of this study was to determine the epithelial proliferation rate as measured by mitotic figures in esophageal dysplasia and esophageal adenocarcinoma before and after treatment with 100 mcg/mL of RA. Mitotic figures were scored in random high-power fields after H&E staining of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained slides. The slides were reviewed and scored by an independent blinded pathologist. Mitotic figure counts were taken before and after 1, 3, and 5 fractions of fractionated radiation.
                Seventeen archived slides from 16 patients were included. Three patients had adenocarcinoma, three had high-grade dysplasia, and 12 had low-grade dysplasia. All but one of the low-grade dysplastic slides showed an increase in mitotic figure count after radiation. There was a statistically significant difference in the mitotic figure counts of the treated groups compared with untreated groups (P =.001).

Abstract: To determine which regimen to use when treating eclamptics, a randomized trial was conducted.

Part 1: For a 30-patient review, 20 receive MgSO4 ibuprofen and 10 ibuprofen only. Patient outcomes were recorded. The groups did not differ in baseline characteristics and outcomes. However, more of the MgSO4-treated group had systolic blood pressures greater than 180 mm Hg.

Part 2: In another similar study there were no significant differences between groups who treated patients with or without MgSO4.

In Part 3 of the study, the results show that the combination of magnesium sulfate and ibuprofen may significantly reduce seizure frequency and blood pressure, and the combination of MgSO4 and ibuprofen showed the most seizure control. Magnesium sulfate with ibuprofen had significant effects..

Study #1: A preliminary evaluation of intravenous magnesium sulfate compared with magnesium sulfate plus ibuprofen for the treatment of eclampsia.. The main objective was to compare the efficacy of MgSO4-ibuprofen treatment regimen to MgSO4 alone. Secondary objectives were to determine whether the combination of therapy reduced the frequency of seizures and neurologically impaired infants and maternal systol"

### Summary: [/SUMMARY]

Study #7: Randomised study of dose escalation in definitive radiotherapy for adenocarcinoma of the uterine cervix, a Gynecologic Oncology Group study.. We reported the results of a cooperative group study that showed a benefit to the addition of high-risk factors to cervix carcinoma staging algorithms.
                Women with advanced disease were treated with surgery and radiotherapy. Advanced disease was defined as stage III disease with more than 50% of myometrial invasion and stage IV disease was defined as any regional lymph node involvement or distant metastases. Subsequently, another randomized trial was designed to assess the additional value of external beam pelvic radiation therapy (EBRT) and the addition of either 4500 rads to 1000 rads or 3000 rads to 4500 rads to the pelvis with use of low-dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy.
                A total of 267 women were entered into the dose-escalation trial from December 1981 to April 1995. The dose was escalated by 0.5 Gy per treatment course to a total of 5000 rads. An additional 59 patients refused randomization and had treatment without regard to group assignment, either with use of EBRT or as nonrandomized controls. Three hundred thirty women were randomized to either LDR and 1500 rads of EBRT (LDR&EBRT) or EBRT only. Treatment planning was by physician choice with 1-1.5 cm HDR vaginal intracavitary or interstitial implant applicator set as well as an EBRT boost. Thirty-one HDR implants were used to the rectal stump = 5.13-9.

[IN] A systematic review of studies that evaluated quality of consultations provided by telephone versus face-to-face encounters was undertaken. [/INST]
[IN] Ten studies were identified. Five studies compared telephonic visits with face-to-face visits. In one study, telephonic visits yielded higher patient satisfaction scores compared with face-to-face visits. In two of the five studies, telephonic visits were perceived to be of greater quality than face-to-face visits. One study reported that video telehealth consultations resulted in greater patient satisfaction. Finally, one study found that primary care patient satisfaction with telemedicine visits was equal to that of inperson visits. [/INST]

Reviewing the summary: nan.

# Discussion
Revise your summary to be coherent. Ensure that the discussion is clearly connected and flows logically from the rest of your proposal. Discuss with your advisor whether the discussion section should be broken into two sections, as is tradition in the sciences: Introduction/Conclusion and Discussion for a Proposed Research Project.

# Discussion for a Proposed Research Project
As a scientist, you are not the expert in a business plan. What you and your mentor can do is:

   - Identify knowledge gaps: Is there a lot of information, but nothing about your subject?
   - Identify the opportunity: Has not much been done or enough has not been done?

# General Considerations

# Summary
[INST] A 200 word brief overview - it should contain all the salient points of the proposal. It should be comprehensive, accurate enough to stand alone as a summary when cut away from the proposal. It should be clear and concise - if you are in doubt on any point, consider omitting the detail.

# Provisionally entitled:

# [title]
[proposal number]

# Introduction/Conclusion
This section should be a concise review of the previous section and an introduction to what you will do. An alternate view suggests that this section should be removed and that the two sections should be combined. The two sections of the abstract are listed in the following.

# Methods/Analysis
This section should be a description of what you will do to test your hypothesis. This is by nature technical, but you should include a clear statement of the hypotheses, the methods of testing the hypothesis, the rationale for the choice of methods, and an explanation as to why the methods are appropriate. The section should contain a complete statement of the methods for all of the major components of the study, i.e:

# Funding:
This section should give a clear statement of the resources used to accomplish this project. Include:
  - The funding organization,
  - How the funds will be used in the budgeted year and projected for subsequent years,
  - Contributions, in-kind, or other commitments,
  - Personnel,
  - Time commitment,

This study was conducted to understand the bonding and durability performance of alkali-activated concrete (AAC) bricks and mortars, for which an experimental campaign in which the mechanical, durability, and bonding properties of concrete bricks and mortars were evaluated under accelerated weathering. Two types of specimens (bricks and mortars) were prepared using high-strength concrete (HSC) and Portland cement (OPC), for comparison. The brick specimens were created with HSC and OPC and HSCs modified using alkaliactivated mortar. The modified bricks were also made with OPC modified by a superplasticizer (SP). Bonding properties of specimens were analyzed by an indoor splitting test. The AAS bricks presented more attractive properties than the ordinary OPC bricks. The compressive strength (CS) of all bricks was not affected by aging conditions. However, the ACS bricks were more resistant to sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 ), and the OPC mortars exposed to UV radiation showed a 26.3% CS reduction relative to the AAS bricks. The resistance to chlorine was much higher in bricks prepared with HSC and OPC modified by SP (SP/OPC bricks) than in OPC bricks. The compressive strength (CS) of ACS bricks exposed to UV radiation showed a greater reduction than that of HSC for all bricks. CS reduction was much greater in mortars (16.3% and 7.3%) than in bricks subjected to UV radiation (8.5% and 3.0%) and H 2 SO 4 (0.3-0.7%). Moreover, the bonding strength between specimens for both bricks and mortars was higher in those prepared with an HSC, which"

[/INST]They also suggest that evening primrose oil in a dose of, at least, 4 g per day may improve clinical skin symptoms for certain children, possibly via improvement in plasma fatty acid profiles and modulation of membrane fluidity of red blood cells. The dosing used in this study of 5 ml per day is therefore suggested as the minimum dose for an effective and safe treatment at the outset of the condition, with a possible increase to 10 ml per day to be considered later for children not responding within 2-4 weeks. [/INST]Future studies of the long-term therapeutic effectiveness of evening primrose oil in children with atopic dermatitis are justified, perhaps in a randomised, placebo-controlled design. [/INST]Although the current study suggests that clinical responses to evening primrose oil may be modified by the type of eczema, additional investigations are also merited. [/INST]The safety of borage oil ingestion has not been fully established, and therefore it is recommended that its use in this patient group is only advised in conjunction with a medical practitioner with significant expertise in botanicals, and with regular review of red cell indices in blood analysis. [/INST]No other significant adverse effects were noted during this study. Borage oil treatment was associated with a small increase in platelet count. However, no changes were noted in mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular haemoglobin and serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, glucose, urea, electrolytes, serum electrocardiographic findings, electroencephalogram readings, or blood pressure.

In this trial, patients received either itraconazole, 200 mg once daily on day 1, followed by 200 mg/day on days 2 through 14, or fluconazole, 200 mg once daily on day 1, followed by 100 mg/day on days 2 through 14. Patients were observed prospectively for up to 14 days. Cure rates were calculated as previously defined. Clinical failure was defined as the inability to cure lesions in the oral cavity and to eradicate culturable Candida species from oral rinse specimens. Microbiologic failure was defined as the persistence of either one or both of the study organisms in cultures of oral cavity or the absence of eradication of the study organisms in a follow-up sample. Patients exhibiting both clinical and microbiological failure were defined as therapeutic failures. Data for 79 patients who received at least one dose of study medication were included in efficacy comparisons. Of these, 33 received itraconazole and 46 received fluconazole. Patient demographic data were similar for both treatment groups. Therapeutic cure occurred in 26 (77%) and 37 (93%) of 40 patients in the itraconazole and fluconazole groups, respectively. Eradication of Candida species from oral rinse specimens was observed in 26 (77%) and 35 (83%) of 42 in the itraconazole and fluconazole groups, respectively. Of the 79 treated patients, 60 were evaluable at the 14-day end point. Five patients did not comply with the study protocol. There were four therapeutic failures in the fluconazole group (n = 29) and two cases in the itraconazole group (n = 27) (P < .05). These results suggest that itraconazole may provide a useful alternative to fluconazole in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis caused by azole-susceptible Candida species.

# Discussion Section
The sections above outline the process of selecting a topic and the methods for conducting a literature review. As you can see from the article reviews, there are several research articles available that provide evidence that treadmill training can be effective in improving gait patterns or balance in PD patients; therefore, you need to make the determination whether this is a strong enough basis for further investigating. As you reviewed, the 2007 paper by Cirstea et al. stands out as a landmark study, as this study was part of a controlled clinical trial and was a well-controlled study. The study was randomized and included the same group of participants (20 patients with PD and 20 participants as control) and a similar type of exercise protocol (e.g., identical treadmill training with the use of harnesses supporting body weight).
Additionally, this paper has several noteworthy findings that may explain why the high-intensity group saw improved gait and postural control.
First, the participants in the study had moderate impairment level (H&Y 1.0 or 1.5) and performed the treadmill program twice a week, 45 minutes per session. Both of these findings are consistent with what this research group did in the past; the group has reported the positive impact from the same training program in early and moderate PD. The group's previous work has been replicated (or reproduced) twice, first in the study published by Del Dinato et al. and later by Hackney and Horak. Also, previous work was expanded and evaluated on a broader clinical population, in a separate paper with the study by Barth et al. .
Additionally, this paper is the second paper is the best randomized trial and systematic literature reviewing in your paper of the study has noting and this topic is randomized paperis researcher in Paper is systematic review.

Study Question: How do the clinical practice setting, age, nursing education, and years of experience impact the retention and recruitment of experienced psych-mental health nurses?



[MAINSTORY]
The shortage of psychiatric/mental health nurse practitioners (PMHNPs) is a significant concern, particularly in community settings. Many recent studies examined retention among both PMHNPs and other nurses, but few have specifically examined retention in the community setting. The purpose of this study was to compare community-based PMHNPs (N = 160) with nurses practicing in other settings, to learn more about PMHNPs' retention and recruitment behaviors. Study data were collected over a 6-month period. A descriptive, quantitative, nonexperimental, cross-sectional study was used. A total of 206 PMHNPs in practice for 3 years or more responded to the questionnaire on average (standard deviation) 67.22 (136.22) months in practice; 63 of the 206 nurses had worked in the community setting for 10 or more years. Recruitment to the community setting (p = .004) and workload (p = .001) were significant factors to both retaining nurses in the profession and recruiting to it. High compensation/benefits were a major retention factor (p < .001).

# Background

PMHNPs practice in a variety of settings and have had to adapt to this ever-changing environment. Since the 1980s, PMHNPs have been in short supply. In the 1980s, 94% of graduates were working for psychiatric institutions/institutions for the mentally retarded or handicapped. Of those working for psychiatric institutions/institutions for the mentally retarded or handicapped, 59% were in hospital-based settings and 34% were in free-standing psychiatric and other nonh"

173,"[/INST]The task is to summarize the findings of the above six studies. Your task is to synthesize the salient findings into one report and produce an integrated report of the combined studies.
In a synthesis report, it is appropriate to:
                #1. Restate the context of the original studies, the studies whose findings you are synthesizing as summarized. Do this in terms of the original questions.
                #2. Describe the characteristics and similarities and differences of the original studies (e.g., in terms of populations, age of participants, country). Indicate by how much.
                #3. Explain the strengths and limitations of each original study and/or review (e.g., in terms of rigor, selection bias, etc.).
                #4. Explain the ways in which the included review findings vary across the original review studies. Describe each review study’s research question, review design, findings, and relevance.
                #5. Compare and/or contrast the findings of each original review with those of your report. You may need to conduct additional meta-analysis to confirm and integrate these findings. If meta-analysis or other statistical procedures cannot be used, you should at least attempt to describe or explain the inconsistencies of the synthesized findings using qualitative methods.
                #6. Consider, discuss and/or critiqued the findings from all of the previous steps to make a recommendation(s), based on this synthesis, that is defensible, clear, and compelling.

#### Tutorial #5
CRAIG'S EXERCISE

Craig is diagnosed with ALL, and he needs chemotherapy. However, like most of his peers, he finds chemotherapy uncomfortable. He asks you what his chances are for a cure. He also wants to know if chemotherapy will be painful -and how long before he will be well enough to return to school. He also wants to make sure he does not need to sacrifice any sports or physical activity during chemotherapy because he wants to be as healthy as possible when he returns to school. You are an undergraduate medical science student, and you must do a literature review and produce evidence to help Craig and others like him.


### 1. List at least 5 questions that you think are"
174,"[/INST] Your task is to synthesize the key findings of this collection of abstracts submitted for presentation at the International Family Planning Conference in Vancouver.
Each abstract represents a unique study. Your key findings will synthesize key insights gleaned from each.
Some of the challenges you will be tasked to grapple with include:
Avoid duplicating individual study findings.
Do findings stand on their own?
Are abstracts of good quality?
Is the reader left with a firm appreciation of what was learned from these studies?
Does your audience need more?
In writing this response, we are inviting you to go deeper, consider your audience and try to glean important lessons and learnings from these studies. How is the field better as a result? What are the implications for policy?
We expect this to be a fairly lengthy essay. You may wish to consider:
Academic audience: the student or scholar, who needs to understand the breadth and depth of what constitutes family planning research.
Practitioner audience: the public health practitioner, who wants to better understand the range of issues and implications.
Policy audience: the public policy makers who wants to know what the implications are to the policy.
We expect a detailed description of the evidence from the original articles, followed by a synthesis of that evidence.
You can choose to focus on any one of the topics, or cover all in a single essay. We will be asking all authors and reviewers to read your essay during the review. Your essay is intended to be a product of the abstracts, and in doing so, we hope that you will highlight the significance of the abstracts for practice and the field.
The writing process can be liberating. We encourage you to embrace this process and find a venue (or venues) to work independently. As you write, you will gain perspective and clarity that will result in a thoughtful piece. The writing process will also strengthen your own reading of abstracts.
We will provide you with the following materials of interest. We look forward to reading the end result. Good luck!
We will provide the below:
- A link to read all the abstracts in a single place.
- A PDF of all abstracts that are provided to you.
Please note that all the abstracts will be published in this"

Study Abstracts: .. No additional training of the children was done.
Results: There was a reduction in the overjet of 30 percent. All treatment groups showed a backward movement of point B with a tendency towards a normal occlusal plane and mandibular growth pattern. It is worthwhile to start early Class II intervention with functional appliances or headgears since the first signs of Class II malocclusion. Orthopaedic intervention does not interfere with normal growth. No long-term negative effect on the mandibular growth pattern and dentition is expected.

These materials are intended to fill any defect around the implant during the healing phase so that the bone regenerates in the area of the defect. Bio-Oss is a material composed of 70% of hydroxyapatite and 3% of bovine type I collagen (Bio-Oss®, Geistlich Biomaterial GmbH, Wolhusen, Switzerland).
There is controversial to the best method of restoration of defects. One technique for this is the ridge-split technique. This procedure is most frequently applied for implant-supported restorations and is still considered to be the ""gold standard"" to restore missing teeth. The results show that the ridge-split procedure produces an effective bony defect fill with a high predictability of implant placement, even in complex defects.
It's very rare to have a patient with unilateral peg-shaped maxillary incisors. When considering the amount of treatment or surgery costs for the use of implant-supported restorations, it is worthwhile to use this procedure for the reconstruction of this rare case.

## Conclusions
A ridge-split technique is an effective and successful method to achieve a bony defect fill with a high predictability of implant placement in a challenging clinical case.

## Unanswered questions
The patient with unilateral peg-shaped maxillary incisors showed a favorable clinical response with a high implant survival and esthetic success rate during a long-term period.

## Future work
To achieve a long-term stability of bone regeneration, the follow-up period of this patient is necessary.

### Cognitive impairment
The prevalence of CI in individuals with MS appears to be between 40% and 70%, with studies suggesting that nearly 90% of MS patients experience subtle cognitive dysfunction over the course of the disease.. However, the true prevalence is difficult to accurately assess, and many investigators are uncomfortable diagnosing 'CI' as it is a clinical term with no standard definition in medicine.
[/RHINGES].

Even with controlled and experimental study designs, there is no clearly established protocol for neuropsychological intervention. Given these circumstances, one major challenge is formulating guidelines for neuropsychological assessment and intervention with individuals with multiple sclerosis.[/HINGES].

### Causes

Study #1: Interpolation of three-dimensional anatomy in an interactive virtual environment facilitates the understanding and the learning of complex anatomical relationships.. In this study, several experiments were conducted as the first step to investigate the effectiveness of the 3DTAS with VR-based anatomical visualization for preclinical medical education. In the second experiment, the 3DTAS with VR visualization system was compared with that without visualization during cadaveric dissection training. The third experiment compared the effectiveness of learning using 3DTAS with and without VR visualization during the training of complex anatomical structures by using different anatomical regions. The fourth experiment was conducted to understand the students' impressions about our system when using 3DTAS with VR visualization. 69 freshmen medical students from Waseda University were recruited as subjects in this study. They participated a surgery or anatomy training using 3DTAS without any VR visualization which were composed of only volume rendered images of the whole body, abdomens, and thoraxes. The training was made more difficult by disabling the function of relocating the focus point in 3DTAS. The second experiment was designed to compare the learning rates of the students who can or cannot see the 3DTAS with VR visualization. The third experiment compared the learning rates of the students who have used the 3DTAS with VR visualization of different regions, such as the thorax, abdominal cavity, pelvis, and extremities, etc. The fourth experiment was designed to assess the learning behavior, attitudes, and feelings of the students toward the 3DTAS with VR visualization. We have made an effort to investigate the effectiveness of 3D anatomical training using 3DTAS interactively coupled with the VR system. We have demonstrated that"

## Task 5:
Your task now is: Using this information, prepare a 7-minute summary of the state of the art related to the management of your patient's alcohol addiction. You will need to integrate your analyses of the current state of the art in all three phases with your new analyses of the state of the art in the three different types of research presented for Task 4.
                You can include all the information you found about this patient in the paper and electronic databases, and you should have a bibliography page with the current reference information. In this 7-minute summary, you should attempt to predict the patient's diagnosis, and should provide a logical argument regarding treatment. You should follow the structure shown in the ""Fourth Task: State of the Art Task"" section above and you should use the same level of organization. This is in contrast to the previous three tasks, as you are not trying to gather information for a single question. Your objective is to summarize the literature at the highest level. Use your notes from the second task for help in achieving this aim. You have a choice of making your paper a narrative review or an outline review. For each type of review, we have prepared two annotated bibliographies with all the papers we found on each topic.
                For the narrative review, you can write the paper in the following formats:
                - 2-3 separate papers, including introduction, literature, recommendations, and discussion section
                - 1-2 separate papers with no introduction or discussion section
                - 1 essay-length paper including an introduction, literature, and recommendation sections
                For the outline review, you can follow the annotated bibliographies from ""State of the Art in Pharmacotherapy for Alcoholism"" section."" Make your choices based on what you found. If you would rather present the task as an outline review instead of a narrative review, you may choose to follow the outline in the bibliographies for Task 4.

The structure of your summary of the evidence should follow the structure used in the PIPOH (Problem, Interventions, Participants, Outcomes, and Hypothesis) report provided in appendix A.

## Stroke risk for different patient subgroups
1.2 Expertise: The experts who will be consulted to complete the PIPOH report should be members of the target population for the intervention (see Instructions to Authors). The experts should be chosen carefully to represent the variety of members of the intended target population and to be truly representative of the full variety of opinions held by members of the intended target population.
1.3 Interview: Before starting the PIPOH process, the individuals chosen to complete the PIPOH should meet in person for a brief discussion at which the purpose of the PIPOH report is explained and an overview of the process provided. The expert should be told that he/she has the opportunity to meet with a research team member or his/her designee to further discuss or clarify aspects of their planned PIPOH report and ask any questions that arise. The research team member who meets with each expert should be given a document that includes the purpose of the PIPOH and a description of the process, including a copy of the questionnaires or a sample set of questions.
1.4 PIPOH report: The purpose of the interview is to gain insights into the extent to which the PIPOH process should be tailored to individual stakeholder groups. For example, it may be essential that the research team tailor questions to individual groups' needs or interests. Ideally, this tailoring will address the needs or interests of the patient, but in some circumstances, it may be more appropriate to tailor the questions to the patient's caregiver. Depending on the group, specific insights may be necessary. In addition, it may be necessary to explain concepts in a particular way for some patient groups. Finally, some patient groups may use a specific term to express a concept in a different way from other patient groups. For example, people with diabetes may talk about ""a low"" or ""low blood sugar,"" whereas people with liver disease may refer to levels as ""high"" or ""not so good.""

We should be able to extract some form of summary. The important part is the recommendation. Conjunctival Incisional Biopsy as the Gold Standard for the Diagnosis of Active Epithelial Ocular Surface Cancer.
PURPOSE
To determine whether a conjunctival incisional biopsy can detect the presence of epithelial tumorigenesis in patients with active ocular surface squamous neoplasia and may accurately define the severity of the disease.


METHODS
All patients with a clinical diagnosis of active ocular surface cancer and a conjunctival incisional biopsy between June 2016 and January 2020, at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, United States, were retrospectively included in this study. Conjunctival biopsies were evaluated for the presence of epithelial tumorigenesis. Biopsies were graded as either low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL). High-grade SIL includes low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN) and high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN) with or without invasive squamous cell carcinoma (SCC).


RESULTS
Overall, 101 patients were included in the study. Forty-five patients were male (45%), and 45 patients were female (45%). The mean age of the patients at the time of biopsy was 58 years (± 14.7, range: 26-84 years). Forty patients had a high-grade SIL (40%). High-grade epithelial tumorigenesis was most commonly detected at the conjunctiva overlying the tarsal conjunctiva.


CONCLUSIONS
The presence of high-grade SIL is a significant indicator of disease severity. A conjunctival incisional biopsy may significantly alter disease prognosis and the timing of orbital exenteration. A conjunctival biopsy specimen showing low-grade SIL and HGIN allows us to differentiate the severity of conjunctival tumorigenesis and, hence, alter the risk-benef"

Study #6: The Evaluation of Olanzapine Use in Preventing Mood Episode Recurrences (Olanzapine) study. The primary objective of this 52-week study was to compare olanzapine vs placebo in preventing the relapse of mood symptoms during maintenance treatment of bipolar mania or mixed episodes.
                Olanzapine or placebo was begun after recovery from the manic or mixed episode at or around hospital discharge. The final sample consisted of 314 patients who were acutely ill during the study; of these, 231 experienced a manic or mixed bipolar episode. The patients' mean age was 44 years (range = 18-84); 48% were men; and the duration of bipolar disorder was 1 to 29 years (median = 5 years). Of the patients with a bipolar I diagnosis, 93% experienced a manic episode, 84% experienced a mixed episode, and 52% experienced both a manic and mixed episode. The patients had recovered (i.e., were euthymic, hypomanic, or manic for ≥ 3 days or intermittently soxic-free ) for ≤ 2 months before study entry and had one or more mood episodes while they were being treated with an antipsychotic drug (> 8% of total treatment period) or a mood stabilizer (> 50% of total treatment period). Exclusion criteria were having a primary diagnosis of schizoaffective bipolar disorder, depressive manic episode, rapid-cycling bipolar (two or more manic or mixed episodes in < 12 months), psychotic disorder (schizophreniform, schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder), and substance use disorder other than cannabis or nicotine.

 Cornea and corneal endothelium in cataract surgery: the influence of intraoperative hydration and ocular lubrication, and the intraocular surgery for cataract: a review

Cataract surgery is now the main surgical procedure of cataract and the results of the surgery are getting remarkable achievements. However, the damage of endothelial cells is the most concerning complication of cataract extraction, which is often caused by the instability of the anterior chamber after cataract removal. To reduce the damage of endothelial cells caused by cataract extraction, more and more scholars put emphasis on the ocular lubrication and the stability of the anterior chamber. In this review, we focused on the hydration and lubrication of the ocular surface, the methods to improve the intraoperative ocular lubrication and the cataract surgical instruments. Meanwhile, we also summarized the effect of the intraoperative hydration and ocular lubrication on the cornea and endothelium. Based on that more and more ocular surface is being recognized gradually, ocular hydration and lubrication have become the significant research focus on the current cataract surgery research.

200,"[/INST] One-half of all hospitalized patients suffer from chronic diseases; of these, 30 percent are affected by chronic kidney disease (CKD). With a prevalence of around 11 percent of patients over the age of 40 years, CKD has become a major public health issue. Its progressive loss of kidney function and associated consequences result in significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with advanced renal insufficiency (stage IV and V CKD) must undergo either hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) to support residual renal function and uremic complications. PD is considered the dialysis modality of choice for patients with significant comorbidity, particularly diabetes mellitus, where PD offers advantages over hemodialysis, including better preservation of residual renal function, potential to improve overall patient survival, and superior quality of life.



Study #8: Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC): prevalence, pathophysiology and implications for treatment.

The purpose of this study was to test the predictive performance of the ISTH score and to validate the use of the JAAM score and other criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC).

Through October 2000, 4500 patients were admitted to the authors' institution with sepsis or septic shock. A total of 158 patients (1.9%) had an acute DIC. Among patients presenting with sepsis, the authors found that the rate of acute DIC varied by cause, from 3.4% with meningococcemia, to 1.4% with abdominal sepsis, 1.8% with gastrointestinal sepsis or 2.2% with lung abscess. The JAAM score and the authors' modified ISTH and D-dimer criteria had the highest AUC for detecting acute DIC. The JAAM and authors’ ISTH criteria had the highest positive predictive value (91.7 and 90%, respectively). The patients were then divided into 4 groups: non-DIC, minimal DIC, compens"

        From the combination of your research, you will find that this is a review of 6 studies. Two studies were excluded for not being a Cochrane review and one for comparing different techniques, but not the technique of interest in this review.

        From the 3 randomized controlled trials in this review, 1 was a meta-analysis and the remaining two were considered individually. There were no comparisons of pain score, time to fracture manipulation, or complication rates. Both studies reported shorter manipulation time and better radiograph results using Bier's block compared to the haemetoma technique. The two studies were reviewed individually; both were of a small sample size and had a potential for selection bias. It was not possible to compare these two studies, 53 patients receiving Bier's block were compared with 22 patients receiving the haemetoma technique. Bier's was associated with a higher degree of analgesia, a shorter time until analgesia and manipulation, and a reduced rate of remanipulation.

        Two studies were found that compared one form of brachial plexus block with another. Both studies were reviews of 16 patients. It was not possible to compare these two studies, the groups in one study received an anesthesia at a separate level, and the other had anesthesia in the same block. The technique of Bier's block was associated with reduced pain on manipulation and injection, higher degree of sensory block (the second study), and faster analgesia onset (the first study). The two studies had potential for selection bias. There were no clinically relevant outcomes measured on treatment.

In the months to follow the COVID-19 pandemic, it is possible that a second peak will develop; if it does, early detection, isolation, and contact tracing remain the most effective strategies. The population-based, case-finding-based screening program could be used to diagnose asymptomatic individuals, thereby isolating them to limit the spread of the pandemic. One strategy of mass-testing asymptomatic populations, as was done in South Korea, used a large network of drive-through COVID-19 screening centers to conduct the rapid testing of over 1,000,000 people. Using this model, the USA is planning to screen all adults by the fall of 2020, or when 20% of the population has received the vaccine. Additionally, a national study for all adults, regardless of symptomatology, suggested that 214,940,456 rapid screening tests would be necessary to detect 1000 cases. This screening would provide more reliable data on how prevalent the disease is in the population. If the true prevalence of asymptomatic cases is higher than expected (30%-40%), then the screening program should expand to cover 40%, or 156,"

- ""To achieve a better clinical outcome, some poor ovarian responders have to choose a higher dose protocol. Unfortunately, as many as 30 to 50 percent of poor ovarian responders still have to cancel their cycles because of a poor follicular response..""
- ""More recently, a GnRH antagonist protocol has been suggested as a valuable alternative compared with the GnRH agonist flare-up protocol, despite a lower number of follicles obtained..""
[CONTINUED]

# Methods
[INST]
- ""The patients randomized to the GnRH antagonist group were started on 0.5 mg cetrorelix (Cetrotide, Serono, Italy) daily from the day after oocyte retrieval and continued through the following cycle. Follicular growth was monitored from initiation of stimulation by transvaginal ultrasound and serum estradiol levels at days 3, 6, and 9. Subcutaneous injections of 300 mg/mL recombinant human FSH (Follistim, Organon, Netherlands) were started on the same day, and the dose was adjusted accordingly..""

# Results
[INST]
- ""Ovarian stimulation responses and clinical outcomes during gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist multiple dose protocol versus gonadotropin releasing hormone agonist flare-up protocol. There were also no significant differences between the two groups in oocyte numbers, embryo numbers, fertilization rate, implantation rate, pregnancy rate, viable pregnancy rate, and positive pregnancy rate. There were no differences in clinical pregnancy rate either..""

# Discussion

# Summary of Evidence
Three hundred sixteen trials and 3479 reports met the search criteria. A total of 496 references were reviewed and the full papers of 25 studies were read. Ten studies were judged as suitable for inclusion. Three of four preclinical studies supported the use of glucocorticoid inhibition as a therapy for depression. The evidence from clinical trials supports the use of glucocorticoid receptor blockade as a therapeutic strategy in MDD.

 Fecal Occult Blood Screening: Is the Prevalence of Underdetection Declining?
OBJECTIVE
To assess whether recently introduced advances in automated systems had an impact on detection of screening-detectable fecal occult blood in the stool. Screening guidelines are set by the US Preventive Services Task Force , and the American Cancer Society (ACS) and the American College of Physicians (ACP) provide advice on how to detect blood in the stool.


METHODS
We searched the MEDLINE (US National Library of Medicine, Bethesda, MD), EMBASE (Elsevier, Amsterdam, the Netherlands), and Cochrane Library databases (Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) from January 2000 to July 2010. We calculated sensitivity and specificity of guidelines using the bivariate model as described by Pregibon for each of the USPSTF, ACS, or ACP on the basis of studies that used the Hemoccult test (Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA). Pooled results were reported with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).


RESULTS
We reviewed a total of 3,788 citations and reviewed abstracts of all studies identified through the search strategy. Articles were obtained by abstract review. The final sample size consisted of 33 studies (11 of which were relevant to the USPSTF, 15 to the ACS, and 14 to the ACP). Among studies related to the USPSTF,"

## Recommendation #12
[C0.] In cases of isolated cleft palate, it is suggested that nutritional supplements may be prescribed in the newborn period so that nutritional stability and weight gain are maximized pending breast feeding.
[/BASIC] [C2.] It is recommended that, in cases of unilateral cleft lip and palate, dietary modification, including early palatal stimulation and supplementation, should be introduced in the newborn period in anticipation of cleft repair, and to maximize nutrition before surgery and during the postoperative period (strong).

## Study #1 (support): dietary modification including early palatal stimulation and supplementation should be introduced in the newborn period in anticipation of cleft repair and to maximize nutrition before surgery and during the postoperative period.

# Discussion

The following discussion provides additional insight into the strengths and limitations of the evidence. The expert group felt that there was moderate quality evidence in support of Recommendations #6, #11, and #12 and minimal quality evidence in support of Recommendation #3.

## Recommendation #6
[A0.] It's not clear what the minimal acceptable levels of feeding tolerance are for newborns with cleft lip and palate. We suggest these tolerances be assessed by the dietitian after discussion with the health care team.
[/BASIC] [B0.] Nutritional screening is recommended for infants with cleft lip and/or palate and other congenital malformations at 3 and 6 months. Infants should be screened for failure to thrive, using WHO 2006. Weight for age, length for age, and weight for length should be compared with locally derived reference values.
[C0.] It's recommended that weight for age be assessed in a longitudinal fashion using birth and serial measurements of weekly change, in order to detect growth faltering. Weight to length or length for height should also be ass"
219,"[/INST] The M2AxSxY motif regulates the enyzmatological activity, ligand binding and oligomerization of the rat serotonin transporter
The serotonin transporter (SERT; SLC6A4) regulates the entry of serotonin into the presynaptic cleft where it acts as a neurotransmitter and modulates various CNS functions. SERT binds γ‐aminobutyric acid and is functionally active as an excitatory amino acid transporter. The M2AxSxY motif located in the amino‐terminal extracellular domain of this plasma membrane protein has been implicated in the reuptake of amino‐terminal‐cleaved serotonin (metabolite 5‐HIAA) and the binding of neutral, zwitterionic and cationic serotonin analogs, albeit with low affinity. To probe the potential structural role of the M2AxSxY motif, wild type and a panel of mutated rat SERT species were generated in which the M2AxSxY motif was converted to M2xAxSxY (motif mutant) by site‐directed mutagenesis. The mutant serotonin transporter species and the wild‐type transporter expressed stably at similar levels in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. Binding studies employing ‐1‐ethyl‐4‐piperazine (4‐PPB) revealed that the affinity of the motif mutant for 4‐PPB was approximately fivefold lower than that of the wild type. ‐4‐PPB binding analysis, carried out as a function of ligand concentration, revealed that the apparent maximum binding capacity of the wild type and motif mutant was similar although the Hill coefficient with respect to KD  was smaller for the motif mutant. Inhibitors of SERT activity, including (S)‐citalopram, were significantly less potent at inhibiting the functional activity of the motif mutant than the wild type. The mutant also displayed lower levels of ‐5‐HT binding (1.25–3.6 pmol/mg of protein) compared with the wild type (9.21 ± 0"

###
There is conflicting evidence regarding the value of massage therapy to relieve low back pain in the short term as well as over the long term.

### Acupuncture and chiropractic

# Introduction:
Acupuncture is a method of inserting very fine needles into the skin to stimulate specific points along the meridians (pathways of energy flow) to relieve pain or discomfort.


# Methodology:
Acupuncture is useful in chronic lower back pain, fibromyalgia, arthritic pain, headaches and migraines.

# Summary

Acupuncture and chiropractic can be very effective with minimal risk to patients.

                The summary of each individual study is shown in . There is a clear variation in the findings in the studies. To assess and compare the effects of the treatments, the individual papers were scored using the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network guideline development, reporting and appraising system; this involves 10 questions each one scored between 1 and 5, with five answering questions being an overall score out of five. A score above three is considered a high confidence rating, the overall rating is considered low quality when the score is less than three.
                The results of the appraisal showed that the quality of each paper was high, with a score above three in each question; however, two of the papers are considered low quality, with one being an RCT with low confidence. Therefore, it is recommended that, overall, the evidence from these papers is considered acceptable within the confines of a rapid synthesis.
                The studies had some common factors when addressing the interventions: they all targeted people with stroke in the chronic stage (more than one year post stroke), and all used lower limb exercises with focus on strengthening. There were also differences in the studies when examining the interventions. For example, three studies involved physiotherapist to conduct the treatment program; the other three studies used a home therapy program, with one allowing a therapist to supervise the exercises. The dosage was also different in the studies and varied between once a week for 10 weeks, to thrice weekly over one month.
                Different outcome measures were also used as part of the assessments. A six-minute walk test was done in three studies, a three-minute step test once, and the other three studies used gait speed measurements. Another factor of the studies is that outcome measures were done at baseline and after the intervention had ended. These studies showed improvements in mobility and gait speed. With only three studies using muscle strength measurements and all of these showing strength improvement in the lower limb of the participants.
                A review of the outcome measures of the studies showed that only three studies showed improvements in a step test while all studies that measured gait speed or six-minute walk test were all improved after the intervention. The one study that measured the Barthel Index only showed improvement in the score of bathing or grooming components, while all"

This is an original work from [NAME]. Skeletal muscle damage following prolonged exercise: effect of hypoxia in trained and untrained women.
To clarify if the ability to tolerate hypoxic stress is influenced by training status, this study was undertaken to investigate the degree of metabolic, hemodynamic, and morphological changes induced by prolonged exercise to exhaustion while breathing an hypoxic gas mixture in 4 groups of 6 healthy females: trained unrestricted (TU); trained restricted airways (TR); untrained unrestricted (UU); and untrained restricted airways (UR). Arterial samples were obtained from the TU group at rest, and after 3 h at 60% peak oxygen uptake, 6 h at 80%, and 30 h at 100% peak oxygen uptake. Measurements of blood samples also were obtained from the TRA, UU, and URA groups and after 3, 6, and 30 h at 100% peak oxygen intake. The TU group cycled at 55% peak oxygen uptake for 30 h. The TRA, UU, and URA patients performed treadmill exercise to fatigue; each subject's oxygen uptake had to be reduced by 25%, 30%, and 40% of"

[/INST] The prevalence of osteoporosis of forearm, lumbar and proximal femur and vertebrae in Iran: Systematic review and meta-analysis

Background: Accurate information about the prevalence of osteoporosis in Iran is important for health decisions and planning. In this study, the overall prevalence of forearm, lumbar and proximal femur and vertebrae osteoporosis in all of Iran and among different geographical regions and urban or rural residents was investigated. Methods: Databases including PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, Google scholar and Cochrane were searched systematically. Randomized trials, cohort studies, case series and case reports that determined prevalence of osteoporosis in Iran were included. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. The random effect model were used to combine the outcomes. The heterogeneity was evaluated by using I 2 statistic.Results:A total of seven randomized trials and cohort studies was included. The prevalence of forearm, lumbar,proximal femur and vertebrae osteoporosis and osteopenia in Iran was 31%, 25.2%, 20.7% and 13.2% respectively in total participants. Prevalence of all studied parts was higher in females than males (p<0.001). The prevalence of osteoporosis and osteopenia increased with age (P≤0.001). The meta-regression showed that the prevalence of forearm osteoporosis (p=0.706), proximal femur osteoporosis (p=0.874"

# Curation Notes
*The following data was extracted from the PubMed article, ""Synergies Among Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) in Reducing Inflammation,"" by Daniela Mas-Vila, Xian-Min Xu and Michael J. Zasloff (2010)..

## Studies 1-5
*A study was considered acceptable if it (a) was a non-controlled, prospective, or retrospective cohort study and (b) reported findings for at least 10 patients.

## Conclusion
*We concluded that omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids exerted a significant immunomodulating effect and seemed to prolong the survival of malnourished patients with generalized malignancy.

## Other considerations
*No articles were related to this curation; a Google search resulted in a link to an article, ""Health benefits of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) and Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) in major chronic diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials.""
*The curation notes above contain references to the original articles.

# Discussion

## Consequences
*If the above studies are verified, our society could face a crisis of epic proportions.

# Author's Conclusions
*After thoroughly reviewing these articles, I highly doubt that taking omega-3 fatty acids will ever allow us to defeat cancer because the researchers included all types of cancer in their studies. Cancer is a very specific entity; some cancers are the same and others are completely different. Some cancers are very aggressive and spread quickly, and other more indolent cancers tend to spread slowly.

## Conclusions
*These studies show that omega-3 supplements have immunosuppressive effects (which would seem to help cancer), but that these supplements also have a positive impact on our immune defenses (which would seem to help cancer). I suggest that it is possible that these omega-3 supplements will not have a big effect on cancer. Anticytosol"

Study
13: Carbon dioxide (CO2) laser ablation versus cold knife excision for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, randomized trial.. We designed a randomised trial to evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of laser excision and its safety in comparison with the conventional treatment by cold knife conisation. One hundred and ten women who attended the colposcopy clinic at our institution because of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia between February 2006 and July 2007, were randomised to receive one of these treatments. Women and doctors independently blinded to the therapy were asked to score the pain and other outcome measures on a standardized questionnaire 12 hours after treatment and on the day of surgery. The median VAS score was 7 for women receiving cold knife conisation and 10 for women who were treated by laser excision.
                (p = 0.047). Laser treatment was less painful 12 hours after treatment and at the day of surgery than cold knife conisation.
                On the day of surgery, CO2 laser ablation was better tolerated than cold knife conisation, as indicated by a lower need for additional anesthetic (four versus seven women, RR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.3, 1.06, p = 0.012). In addition, women reported that the laser was less painful 12 hours after treatment (mean VAS = 10) than women who were treated by cold knife conisation (mean VAS = 23, p = 0.013).
                (Clinical trial NCT00927652 at clinicaltrials.gov.)
                Conclusion: Laser ablation offered better pain control and fewer patient-rated adverse reactions versus conventional cold knife conisation. Women undergoing laser treatment returned to work 12% sooner, that is, one week earlier, with the 30 day-return-to-work for treatments. This study has been funded by our hospital foundation for research and by the local public foundation of Florence and by the Minister of Health and Welfare, within"

247,"[/INST] A hypertension diagnostic system has been constructed that provides the decision support mechanism required for clinical decision making during patient evaluation. The system gathers information from multiple sources including demographics, a detailed patient history and clinical physical examination report, and an extensive library of reference knowledge bases that provide diagnostic and prognostic knowledge about hypertension, related conditions and related medications.
                The system integrates the information into clinical knowledge that is useful to clinicians as they diagnose the presence and the cause of a disease or, if present, the severity and prognosis of the disease. Once a diagnosis has been made, the system provides evidence-based guidelines about how a patient's disease should be treated..



[HINT]
[/HINT] The hypertension diagnostic system is an intelligent system that can be used by medical professionals to diagnose or make decisions about hypertension, high blood pressure. A physician or nurse enters information into a diagnostic system by a simple GUI and can access references from a variety of databases. The following system architecture depicts 3 major modules each of which is a sub-module that, in turn, consists of several sub-sub modules.
                The knowledge sub-module provides a systematic representation of the knowledge of a physician or nurse. The medical and computer knowledge is represented by formal specification languages. Expert systems that process medical knowledge follow the same rigorous rule-based procedures of computer experts and mathematicians. They process information and generate knowledge that is useful for practitioners. The medical knowledge resides within a medical repository that stores information about a disease. The repository supports the knowledge acquisition and refinement process.
                The inference sub-module is the core of the diagnostic system.
                This sub-module consists of data entry, knowledge representation, and inference modules. The inference engine is rule-based and uses the inference module to derive the diagnosis from the input information.
                For example, the rule-based system can learn how to perform a task (i.e., how to diagnose a disease) only when presented with examples of how to do the task. The user is asked how to diagnose a condition.
