Results of the current review are consistent with those of a previous review suggesting that catheter thrombosis occurs in approximately 25% of patients after placement, and that the rate of recurrence is high with spontaneous thrombolysis. This underscores the pressing need for strategies to prevent thrombosis, as well as for effective therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat catheter thrombosis. The two most promising and safe strategies in current use are to remove and replace the catheter, and locally activated recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (r-tPA). The risk of cardiac tamponade suggests that r-tPA should be considered when thrombolysis is indicated, but it is not clear when r-tPA should be replaced with surgical or other interventions because of bleeding or other complications. There is a pressing need for larger, well-designed, controlled studies in various clinical populations, using either r-tPA or other lytic agents to compare their effectiveness, safety profiles, and overall cost-effectiveness."

Borderline patients may benefit from a psychosocial treatment focused on improving their impulse control. There is promising evidence for omega-3 fatty acid and mood-stabilizing agents (e.g., divalproex, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine), for reducing anger and aggression (with topiramate and aripiprazole), for reducing severe core symptoms such as depression, and for a possible protective effect in suicide prevention. More research is needed to confirm this promising evidence and to differentiate between specific effects of drugs on different emotional and behavioral manifestations.."

Despite the widespread use of synthetic grafts in infragenicular arterial bypass despite good long-term survival of these patients, graft patency remains a problem. Most authors recommend use of autologous veins as the first choice graft material, and if not possible to use prosthetic graft with a vein cuff at the anastomotic site. This randomized controlled prospective trial demonstrated that the choice of conduit did not influence the long-term primary and secondary patency and limb salvage. Use of an autologous vein patch was less costly than the pre-cuffed grafts and may be as efficacious. However, prosthetic grafts may be a reasonable salvage strategy when an autologous vein is not available.."

Overall, the literature suggests that oral antimicrobial therapy may be effective in the treatment of osteomyelitis caused by susceptible organisms, with cure rates ranging from 50 to 90 percent. The most frequent side-effect of oral antimicrobials was transient diarrhea, and the two most common isolates were P. aeruginosa and S. aureus, followed by gram-negative bacilli (GB) Enterobacteriaceae (E). Ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and other oral quinolones have shown similar efficacy as oral parenteral antibiotics, and they may have a role in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis that is caused by susceptible gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. Further research is needed to confirm the role of quinolones in pediatric and other patients with more complex problems such as prosthetic joint or diabetic foot osteomyelitis."

The studies included in this review have yielded inconsistent results, and any conclusions reached are therefore likely to be tenuous.

The majority of studies have focused on the optimal oral dosage of haloperidol in the treatment of acute exacerbations of schizophrenia. This has been examined in the context of a fixed dosage, increasing dosage, and the relationship between plasma levels and the clinical response. Only one study, the one by Meltzer, demonstrated a difference in outcome between patients administered 10 mg per day and those administered 80 mg per day, with the latter showing significantly greater improvement. There were, however, fewer discontinuations of treatment, as well as more extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) in the lower dose group. At least one patient died in each group. These results have to be interpreted cautiously, however, as Meltzer did not employ a double-blind technique.

Several other studies have suggested that higher dosages, or plasma levels above 8 to 10 ng/ml, may not lead to a differential clinical outcome in relation to lower dosages or plasma levels below this threshold. Some studies have found a curvilinear relationship not only between dosage and outcome in patients treated with haloperidol, but also between dosage and the development of side effects.

One study by Rydström and von Knorring administered three oral dosages of haloperidol during a fixed period, but this produced neither significant differences in clinical improvement nor in side effects. Two studies by Shopsin and colleagues and by Levendowskie and colleagues investigated the clinical importance of haloperidol plasma levels. The findings from both studies were discordant.

The dose-response threshold described by Meltzer was investigated by Mintz and colleagues, who did not find any difference in clinical outcome between haloperidol-treated patients within the lower and middle haloperidol plasma level ranges. When patients who did not respond were reassigned to treatment with a higher plasma range, those who received low-level treatment responded significantly better to the higher range than those who received higher-level treatment.

In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 19 trials and 6846 patients/caregivers conducted, we find that inhaled zanamivir is effective for both treatment and prevention of influenza in children and adults. Our findings also suggest that post-exposure prophylaxis is effective when given to close household contacts of the index case. We also found evidence of efficacy for the reduction of disease severity, but not duration, of influenza infection and reduction of fever, in adults, and of influenza disease in pediatric subjects. The data show that zanamivir is safe and is associated with few side effects and no evidence of adverse effects on lung function.."

The randomised controlled trials, studies comparing urethral with suprapubic catheter drainage, and prospective, randomised controlled studies that compare immediate catheter removal with conventional catheter management suggest that the advantages of early catheter removal outweigh any potential disadvantages. However in patients at high risk of urinary retention, it would be wise to advise caution in removing the catheter. Further randomised controlled studies on large populations would provide definitive evidence to aid clinicians in determining a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of different postoperative catheter management strategies."

Early use of high-frequency jet ventilation (HFJV) reduces the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) at 36 weeks and the need for home oxygen in premature infants with uncomplicated respiratory distress syndrome. Multicenter clinical trials have yielded conflicting results with regard to the effects of HFJV on both morbidity and mortality rates associated with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). We assessed whether the use of HFJV in a multicenter controlled clinical trial of patients with uncomplicated RDS would reduce these rates, using a predefined primary outcome measure comparing BPD rates between the two groups. The trial was conducted in a total of eight tertiary neonatal intensive care units and enrolled 130 patients. The HFJV group was divided into two distinct subgroups: HF-LO (HFJV with low airway pressures) and HF-OPT (HFJV with optimal lung volume recruitment). Survival, incidence of BPD, airleak, pulmonary hemorrhage, intaventricular hemorrhage, and other nonpulmonary complications were similar between the ventilation modes. Optimal lung volume strategy improved oxygenation, reduced exposure to hypocarbia, and reduced the risk of grade III-IV intraventricular hemorrhage and/or periventricular leukomalacia, but at the cost of increased incidence of pneumothorax..
                High-frequency jet ventilation is an effective alternative to conventional ventilation for premature infants with uncomplicated RDS. However, the optimal lung volume strategy appears to be associated with higher rates of pneumothorax. The results do not support the routine use of high-frequency jet ventilation in uncomplicated RDS.
                Conventional mechanical ventilation is at least as effective as high-frequency jet ventilation in reducing bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm infants. Premature babies who receive high-frequency jet ventilation have more airleaks and brain lesions that are associated with periventricular/intra-ventricular hemorrhage.
                Our findings do not indicate a survival benefit for high-frequency jet ventilation. Our results"

There is evidence that various interventions, including counseling and informational strategies, have the potential to improve contraceptive use among women in low-income and middle-income countries. However, the effectiveness of such interventions may be limited by program quality, population characteristics, and study design. Further research is needed to determine the most effective approaches to increasing contraceptive use among women in these settings. Non-biomedical approaches to increasing contraceptive uptake and other aspects of health care should be considered, including postnatal home visits and community-based distribution, as these may have the most sustained impact in low- and middle-income countries."

Disconnect systems for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) have been used in several developing countries. These systems, which have a lower rate of catheter-related infection than single-bag systems, have been used in large numbers of developed countries, but have not been widely adopted in developing countries because of the higher initial cost. Because of low initial cost, the Y-set (Baxter) is a very cost-effective alternative method to conventional CAPD method for patients with limited educational and economic means. For the above reasons and because of its simplicity, a randomized study of the Y-set was undertaken. A total of 42 patients were randomized to receive either the Y-set or the control group of single bag. Time to first peritonitis or exit site infection was compared between the groups. No patients in the control group had completed 1 year of observation; in the Y-set, only five patients had been observed for 1 year or less. The Y-set was superior to control group (P < 0.005) with regard to infection prevention. All patients in Y-set group completed at least 1 year of observation without any episodes of peritonitis or exit site infection. No patients were lost to follow up. We conclude that the Y-set is an effective and cost-effective alternative disconnect method for CAPD even for developing countries.."

Most of the randomized controlled trials reviewed show that the SSRI paroxetine has a reasonable chance of relieving anxiety and/or compulsions in children and adolescents with anxiety disorders or obsessive-compulsive disorder. The trials reviewed suggest that SSRIs at standard doses are safe and effective for most children and adolescents with these disorders. However, these findings are limited by the small number of randomized, controlled trials, and more long-term trials are needed.

Two phase III trials of tauromustine (TCNU) in advanced colorectal cancer.

Study #1: nan.

Study #2: Very few patients with liver metastases from colorectal cancer can be cured. We have investigated whether a treatment to slow the growth of liver metastases, hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine, improves palliation in this setting. In a randomised study of 100 patients, we compared quality of life and survival in patients who received hepatic-artery infusion of floxuridine and in those who received conventional symptom palliation. 95% of control patient survival time was spent with normal quality-of-life scores, which suggests that the aim of treatment should be to prolong normal-quality survival rather than merely to sustain quality of life. There was a significant prolongation (p = 0.03) in overall survival in floxuridine-treated patients compared with controls (median 405 vs 226 days). There were similar significant prolongations in normal-quality (ie, normal symptom scores) survival for physical symptoms (p = 0.04), anxiety (p = 0.04), and depression (p = 0.04). This survival benefit was associated with significant reductions in metastasis size on computed tomography (p = 0.001) and in serum carcinoembryonic antigen concentration (p = 0.006) in floxuridine-treated patients. There was no evidence of treatment-related hepatotoxicity as assessed by serum aspartate aminotransferase and bilirubin measurements. This is the first demonstration that survival can be prolonged with normal quality of life in patients with colorectal liver metastases. We conclude that hepatic-artery floxuridine infusion can be recommended for suitable patients..

The current practice of pancreatic duct stenting for high‐risk PD is still controversial. The aim of the present study is to compare the results of pancreaticoduodenectomy with insertion of an external drainage of pancreatic duct to the duodenejunal anastomosis (end-to-side) to those without stent for soft pancreatic texture and a nondilated pancreatic duct.
                This is a single-center prospective randomized trial. Between January 2009 and April 2012, 120 patients randomly underwent PD with an external stent (n = 60) or no stent (n = 60). Stented group had a significantly lower pancreatic fistula (PF) (6.7% vs. 20%, P = 0.031). Stented group had a significantly shorter hospital stay compared with nonstented group (mean 17 vs. 23 days, P = 0.039). On multivariate analysis, no stenting and pancreatic duct diameter <3 mm were significant risk factors of PF. In conclusion, external drainage of pancreatic duct with a stent decreases leakage rate of pancreaticojejunostomy following pancreaticoduodenectomy in high-risk patients. Stented group had a significantly lower morbidity rate compared with no stented group due to the significant reduction of PF and need for surgical/radiologic procedure, and had a significantly lower hospital stay compared with nonstented group.."

Rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, and metformin are insulin-sensitizing oral antidiabetic drugs. Rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are thiazolidinedione or ""glitazone"" preparations, while metformin is a ""biguanide"". These drugs are safe and effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes when used in combination with other oral agents or insulin. Both agents improve glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and dyslipidemia. Longterm trials to assess the clinical role of these drugs are warranted. The choice of a particular drug depends on the pattern of diabetes in an individual patient and the other drugs used in treatment. More research is needed to assess the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of these agents as second-line treatment."

The effectiveness of treatment for patients using methadone continues to be a popular area of research. Methadone maintenance treatment is an effective way to reduce opiate use and decrease criminal behavior; however, many patients experience concurrent problems with other illicit drugs, including cocaine.
While few well-controlled studies have evaluated the most effective mode of treatment for co-abusing patients, results from available studies suggest that, at a minimum, treatment should involve methadone as the primary treatment for opiate addiction. Several of these studies also included some form of behavioral therapy, including individual counseling, contingency management (CM), self-help groups or some combination. For instance, CM has been used effectively during methadone treatment to reduce cocaine use, although these studies were small and short and the interventions were not as intense as the ones in our study. Similarly, group therapy alone was not found to be effective in reducing cocaine use in methadone-maintained patients when it was combined with drug education.
In summary, further research is needed to improve treatment approaches for the large proportion of patients who are not responding adequately to standard methadone treatment. To this end, the present study attempted to replicate and extend findings from previous research."

The review of existing literature on the administration of vigabatrin (gamma vinyl GABA) as add-on therapy in a daily dose of 3 grams in patients with focal epilepsy, in particular patients with drug-resistant partial seizures, demonstrates that vigabatrin is a useful antiepileptic drug with few clinically important side effects. Vigabatrin is particularly effective as an adjunctive treatment for complex partial seizures with and without secondary generalization.(2) The few controlled treatment trials are generally in agreement with this conclusion, although they vary in regard to the efficacy, especially the percentage of patients with over 50% reduction in seizure frequency.(3) Side effects are usually mild and consist primarily of drowsiness, ataxia, and dizziness, usually with no important impact on safety or quality of life.(4,5) Some patients, however, cannot tolerate vigabatrin at the highest daily dose of 3 grams, and therefore only a proportion of patients may benefit from this medication. In all studies, a small additional benefit was seen in patients with higher plasma levels at a dose of 3 grams of vigabatrin.(6) In individual patients the dose of vigabatrin may need to be adjusted to obtain optimal efficacy while maintaining therapeutically unimportant levels of plasma GABA.(7) Thus, it is important to continue and expand the research on the pharmacokinetics, dosing and efficacy of vigabatrin as an antiepileptic drug, as well as on its effect on cognitive function and quality of life in the long-term."

Laboratory investigations were conducted from October 1999 through April 2000 and included a history and physical examination, anthropometric measurements, laboratory tests of the serum erythrocyte antioxidants and blood glutathione peroxidase (GSHpx) activity, and liver (L) histology. One hundred and seventy men and women (73 men and 97 women) ages 24-77 years, with a median age of 50 years had normal liver histology. Their mean body weight (73.2 kg) and serum total cholesterol (5.23 mmol/L) levels were significantly higher than the norm. Serum LDL cholesterol (4.1 mmol/L) was significantly higher in males. Females had lower mean plasma selenium (0.77 mumol/L) levels but plasma vitamin E (21.98 microg) and GSHpx activity (12.37 U/g/h) levels were lower in males. Plasma vitamin C was significantly higher in females. There was a negative correlation between vitamin E and LDL cholesterol and BMI in males and, as expected, a positive correlation between plasma selenium levels and BMI. No other statistically significant correlations were evident.
                The antioxidants were significantly lower in men with a fatty liver (6.28-10.14 U/g/h, p less than 0.0001). No such decrease was evident in subjects with normal liver histology.
                These findings support the hypothesis that antioxidant levels decrease in obesity and that in fatty liver this decrement, which may be related to increased hepatic lipid peroxidation, is more pronounced. This decrement was primarily related to decreased plasma vitamin E levels and not associated with an increase in oxidant stress in the blood as reflected by higher plasma levels of malonic dialdehyde. This may reflect hepatic sequestration of oxidants or metabolic redox balance alterations that preserve circulating antioxidants as was previously found in patients with fatty liver..

The following is a summary of the key findings from the given study abstracts related to the use of pre-emptive analgesics in reducing post-operative pain in children:

1. Pre-emptive administering of ibuprofen, paracetamol, and placebo in the dental clinic can lessen post-extraction pain in children, with ibuprofen showing higher efficacy compared to placebo.

2. Pre-emptive and/or post-operative ibuprofen therapy reduces pain that is experienced after orthodontic separator placement.

3. Preoperative ibuprofen can reduce pain associated with orthodontic separator placement, with patients receiving ibuprofen 1 hour before separator placement showing the least amount of pain.

4. Pre-emptive administration of ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and placebo can reduce post-extractive pain in children, although the difference is not statistically significant.

5. Pre-emptive administration of acetaminophen can lessen the pain-related behavior of 4-10 year-old children following routine dental care.

Overall, the findings suggest that pre-emptive administration of analgesics, particularly ibuprofen, can have significant benefits in reducing post-operative pain in children. Further research is needed to provide more evidence-based guidelines for the use of pre-emptive analgesics in pediatric dental care."

Surgical treatment of the pilonidal sinus through wide excision and primary closure showed significantly better outcomes than leaving the area open for secondary healing and granulation. Wide excision with primary closure (PECS) showed a low wound complication (20.7%), a high wound healing rate (95%), and early patient recovery with low complication rate. The best time frame for PECS is the acute phase of an infected pilonidal sinus. However, in a chronic recurrent pilonidal sinus PECS is not advised, as the disease tends to re-occur. In all other cases, PECS is recommended as it is a simple procedure with minimal morbidity, resulting with the patient in much less pain. No randomized studies have been published about the long-term results of PECS, but results of primary closure versus the conventional treatment of left-to-open were encouraging. The results of other studies are comparable with those of PECS, but were performed in an acute or subacute setting. Primary closure seems to be a procedure of choice in most cases of pilonidal sinus.
The most frequent postoperative complications after PECS were pain, skin complications, and wound infections with anaerobic bacteria. If these complications are adequately treated, most of them can be successfully resolved. Therefore, early treatment can diminish and shorten the treatment of these complications. If there are no signs of improvement within a week after PECS, surgical revision should be done. The most significant and challenging complication of PECS is the re-occurrence of the pilonidal sinus, occurring in 2--11% of patients. Re-recurrence of the disease is not a complication, but, unfortunately, is one of the most unpleasant features of a persistent or recurrent pilonidal sinus disease.
The postoperative wound complications after PECS are a reason for a high rate of recurrence. Wound infection and sepsis, the most common complications of wide excision with primary closure, are responsible for the most frequent postoperative problems in the treatment of pilonidal sinus. Most of these complications can be avoided if adequate antimicrobial prophylaxis is given before skin closure, and if the wound is adequately treated after the operation.

Multiple interventions have been tried to improve the quality of care for patients with epilepsy. The most effective interventions appear to be education (for example, provided by specialists, specialist nurses, or group sessions) or nurse-led support and advice programs. In future research, it will be interesting to see whether interventions that are both multi-faceted and more intensive in nature (for example, involving frequent monitoring and contact) will be required. Moreover, it remains to be seen whether some or all of the identified effective interventions can be improved or adapted to reflect contemporary changes in service provision and to address the additional healthcare and social care needs of people with epilepsy who are becoming older. Finally, in both high- and low-income countries, there are increasing numbers of asylum seekers, refugees, and migrants who have epilepsy. It is essential that services are tailored to meet the needs of these patients, who are often at a greater risk for epilepsy-related problems such as homelessness and social isolation. Future research will need to make a strong effort to address the different needs of people with epilepsy in these diverse and rapidly changing contexts."

Previous cancer screening trials had found no impact or negative results with intervention or outreach methods. We conducted a randomized controlled trial using invitation reminders to improve attendance at colorectal cancer screening among Veterans.
           A total of 183,157 Veterans aged 50 to 62 years who were due for a screening colonoscopy in the next 2 years were mailed a one-page letter that was designed to motivate a visit to a primary care physician for a screening referral. In a second intervention group, a letter followed by a phone call from a study team member was used. The study team, unaware of intervention group assignment, mailed a series of letter reminders at 3-month intervals. The main study outcome was attendance at a screening colonoscopy. Secondary outcome measures were attendance at a screening sigmoidoscopy and attendance at a primary care physician for a screening referral. Patient satisfaction with the reminder process was also measured.
                Attendance at a screening colonoscopy was 35.6% in the control group, 34.6% in the letter only intervention group, and 41.7% in the letter plus phone call intervention group. There was no statistically significant difference in attendance between the control group and either of the intervention groups. Attendance at a screening sigmoidoscopy was 4.0% in the control group, 5.2% in the letter only intervention group, and 4.0% in the letter plus phone call intervention group. Attendance at a primary care physician for a screening referral was 28.4% in the control group, 24.3% in the letter only intervention group, and 35.6% in the letter plus phone call intervention group. There was no statistically significant difference for either of these secondary outcome measures among the three groups. Veterans rated the reminder letter and the reminder letter plus reminder phone call as helpful. Conclusion
           The implementation of a simple, inexpensive, and efficient reminder process by using invitation letters to Veterans did not significantly increase the number of them who attended for screening colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy. The telephone reminder did not further improve the outcome. Further studies to explore potential modifiers of the intervention effects are needed.."

                Multivariate repeated measures analyses revealed that compared to the educational intervention, the community norms intervention led to significant decreases in dating violence and marijuana use. A significant decline in cigarette use was also observed in this group. The educational intervention was associated with a decline in alcohol use among females and among males at follow-up.
                Although promising, the results of the current study must be viewed with caution, given the small sample size, lack of control schools, and attrition in completing follow-up measures..

Study #17: Primary prevention of adolescent alcohol misuse: results from Project PROCEED.
                This study describes primary prevention of substance abuse among teens using a theory-based program in school.
                A randomized cluster trial was undertaken in 12 California junior/senior high schools. Program effects were tested on 2776 student participants (1391 males, 1385 females) and 153 teachers who completed baseline, post-intervention, and follow-up surveys (retention 90%). Two intervention programs were tested: ""Resisting Underage Pressure,"" the only program tested that included peer educators and peer-related normative messages; and ""Making Positive Choices,"" the largest evaluation of middle school and parent substance use prevention.

Results of multiple studies demonstrate increased limb salvage and decreased overall mortality in patients undergoing SCS therapy for severe lower limb ischemia. The evidence is weak, likely due to the small numbers included in each study. However, a consistent pattern of significant improvement suggests that SCS therapy should be considered as part of a treatment strategy for severe critical ischemia of the lower limb until further large-scale randomized trials may be completed."

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of oxygen supplementation on exertional dyspnoea in patients at risk, such as those with COPD or asthma. The investigators will assess the physiological data as well as the patients' own perception of alleviation of dyspnoea.
The secondary objective is to test and fine-tune a novel approach (e-PAD) to the education module. The investigators will evaluate any perceived impact of the education module on the subjects' own perceived benefits in alleviation of dyspnoea.
The specific outcome measures for this study are:
- To compare the effect of a single dose of 40% oxygen administered through a face-mask, with medical air, on the exercise capacity of 250 mild to moderate COPD and asthmatic patients. This evaluation will be measured as the change in exercise performance with the incremental shuttle walk test. This test is a validated predictor of the patients' capacity to function.
- To compare the effect of a single dose of 40% oxygen administered through a face-mask, with medical air, on the perceived alleviation of dyspnoea during 6 minutes of the incremental shuttle walk test. This evaluation will be based on the self-reported Borg score.
- To evaluate the impact of receiving education on the patients' perception of how the oxygen supplemented them. 50 mild to moderate patients will be randomized into two groups to receive either oxygen or air education. In order to standardize the level of understanding regarding the role of oxygen as a supplement, both groups will receive equivalent information about this supplement. All subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomized to start with the e-PAD system, then complete the exercise performance and dyspnoea survey and will undergo standard testing at the hospital to evaluate the impact of this intervention."

P. falciparum malaria remains one of the biggest killers in the world with more than 500 million clinical cases annually and 1 to 2 million deaths. This report shows that artemisinin-based combination therapy is more effective than chloroquine and quinine in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria and for intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women. In severe falciparum malaria, the results of the trials have been less encouraging because of a high risk of recrudescence, with two studies concluding that artemisinin-based combination therapy are no better than quinine-based combination therapy. The reasons for the poorer performance of artemisinin-based combinations can include the limited duration of treatment in these studies and the fact that in some regions where severe malaria is common, there is already a high prevalence of resistance to the artemisinin partner drug included in the combination therapy. The mortality rates obtained in the trials were comparable to the rates in the previous quinine trials. This implies that if the artemisinin derivative is used, its therapeutic and prophylactic roles must be differentiated. There is a need for large scale field studies, especially from Africa, to demonstrate the clinical and economic benefits of the artemisinin-based combinations for treating uncomplicated malaria and for IPTi. To date there have been no reports of serious side-effects in the studies of artemisinin or its derivatives. The choice of the artemisinin partner drug should be based on a number of factors. The effectiveness of artemether in combination with mefloquine is particularly encouraging because artemether produces a more rapid clearance of parasites in both uncomplicated and severe malaria. In addition, it has the advantage of being available either as an intramuscular (IM) or oral preparation, in both adults and children. Artemether has been studied extensively and is well characterized in preclinical and clinical studies, including data derived from patients in India, Peru, Thailand and Vietnam and data from Gambian and African children aged down to less than 6 months. Mefloquine has been in use for many years, is safe and is well understood with few important side-effects.

Respiratory muscle strengthening training using breathing exercises, yoga, Tai Chi Qigong (TCQ), and Diaphragmatic breathing can reduce exercise-related dyspnea and improve functional capacity in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These interventions provide a lasting effect on improving respiratory muscle strength and contractility. The mechanisms for the improvements may be related to the increased recruitment of the diaphragm, which results in better breathing strategies and improved functional performance. More research is needed to determine the best approach for incorporating these breathing exercises into COPD patient care."

The current evidence comparing the efficacy of alpha-adrenergic blocking agents (alfa-blockers) naftopidil and tamsulosin is inconclusive. Four studies reported that tamsulosin was more effective than naftopidil in relieving storage symptoms associated with BPH, and three of these studies revealed that tamsulosin was also more effective than naftopidil in improving flow. Two other studies showed no differences between the two drugs. Further studies are needed to compare the efficacy of tamsulosin and naftopidil. To date the current evidence does not allow recommendations for treatment with either of these agents, and treatment decisions have to be guided by an overall assessment of individual patients' symptoms."

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of strontium ranelate (SR) for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Twelve clinical trials (n = 7266) were included in this analysis. The efficacy of SR for improving bone mineral density in various sites, decreasing bone resorption, and reducing the risk of vertebral fractures was significantly better than or equal to that of placebo. All tested dose levels provided similar improvements in bone mineral density, with no increased risk of adverse events. These findings support the use of SR as first-line pharmacotherapy for postmenopausal osteoporosis.."

Based on the given abstracts, hypotension in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome can be treated with either dobutamine or dopamine. Dopamine is more effective than dobutamine in increasing the systolic blood pressure and achieving a mean systolic blood pressure above 30 mm Hg. Dopamine also increases intestinal perfusion, as measured by blood flow velocity of the superior mesenteric artery. While the initial dosage of 5 micrograms/kg/min is often effective for both drugs, dobutamine requires higher dosages to maintain blood pressure levels above 30 mm Hg, compared to dopamine. Therefore, dopamine is the preferred treatment for hypotension in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome."

Study #1: No increase in hemostasis in healthy volunteers taking a new 30-day oral contraceptive.. There are conflicting opinions as to whether healthy, nonsmoking patients taking low-dose oral contraceptives (OCs) are at any greater risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) than individuals taking hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). There are no published data on the effect of OCs on haemostasis in healthy non-smoking women.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect on haemostasis of a low-dose 30-day OC, Ortho Evra, in healthy volunteers.
Methods: In a double-patch-design study, 26 healthy women were randomized to one of two treatment periods. Subjects in one group used Ortho Evra (400 microg EE/100 microg drosperstenein, followed by three 20-mcg EE/100-mcg drosperstenein patches twice weekly) for two months (treatment period A), and a low-dose monophasic oral contraceptive preparation (30 microg EE) for one month (treatment period B). A second group used the same preparations in the reverse order. Blood was collected before treatment and after the second and third months of use to measure pro- and anti-coagulant parameters, parameters of fibrinolysis, concentrations of pro-fibrinolytic factors, concentration of fibrin and fibrinogen levels. A further 23 healthy women were invited to participate in the extended part of the study, during which monthly withdrawals were measured (treatment period C).
Results: No significant changes in pro- and anti-coagulative parameters or concentrations of pro-fibrinolytic factors, fibrin and fibrinogen were found. There was an increase in factor VIII coagulant activity (p = 0.007), von Willebrand factor activity (p = 0.003) and prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (p = 0.01) concentrations.

Antenatal phenobarbital therapy was found to reduce the incidence of periventricular-intraventricular hemorrhage (P-IVH), particularly grade 3 and 4 hemorrhages, in premature infants.
Antenatal phenobarbital therapy has been shown to decrease the incidence of cephalohematoma as well.
There is no evidence of a decrease in the incidence of periventricular leukomalacia in infants who have been treated with phenobarbital.
The results of this meta-analysis and review, which includes all available randomized trials of antenatal phenobarbital therapy, suggest that prenatal administration of anticonvulsant drugs should continue to avert periventricular hemorrhage.
Fetal exposure to phenobarbital for less than 3 days is still more likely to result in adverse outcomes in children than to avert severe periventricular hemorrhage.
The available studies do not support use of phenobarbitol only in the late preterm population.
It is unlikely that antepartum phenobarbital reduces the incidence of cerebral palsy in premature infants..

Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a severe and difficult form of epilepsy that occurs predominantly in infancy and early childhood. Although many antiepileptic drugs are used, approximately 40 to 80 percent of children with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome remain resistant to treatment. Results of nine studies comparing treatment with add-on medication to those receiving standard medication alone suggested a significant reduction in drop seizure frequency with medication therapy; 13 of these studies reported an improved overall clinical course. Overall, the efficacy of 6 new or investigational agents in reducing various seizure types in the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome ranged from very similar to that of placebo. The median percentage reductions in drop seizure frequency were 24.8 percent in a lamotrigine trial and 8.6 percent in the felbamate trials. The median percentage reduction in major combined seizures, including other types of seizures, such as clonic, tonic, and tonic-clonic episodes were also 24.0 percent. In a rufinamide trial, 32.7 percent median reduction in major combined seizures was reported. In another trial using tiagabine and clobazam, seizure reduction ranged from 3.4 percent to 9.2 percent. No single agent appears to be superior to the others in patients with refractory seizures. The placebo response rate is high and is often misperceived as treatment response with newly approved drugs. Therefore, when an agent is approved, an appropriately designed placebo-controlled double-blind trial will provide meaningful data for clinical decision-making.."

There is substantial variation in the efficacy of the 5-day primaquine regimen for radical cure of patients who harbor P. vivax vivax hypnozoites in the US, despite primaquine's reputation as a highly effective drug. Clinical studies have shown a relapse rate of 10% and higher with the 5-day regimen. There is a need, therefore, to further study the efficacy and tolerability of primaquine.
A new 14-day primaquine regimen that is currently widely in use in Europe, Japan, and Southeast Asia was evaluated in Bangladesh for its efficacy in preventing relapses of P. vivax vivax malaria and its tolerability. During 6 months of follow-up, relapse rates of 8.7% in patients given the 15-mg regimen were compared with 11.7% in patients who were given no primaquine at all but were given chloroquine for treatment of acute malaria (P = not significant). The study confirms that the 15-mg primaquine regimen given once daily as an outpatient treatment is not effective in preventing relapse of P. vivax. This is an important finding because it is clear from the results of other studies that failure to eliminate liver forms of the vivax parasite results in the development of recurrent or relapsing malaria, which results in the illness burden and transmission potential being similar to or even greater than that caused by new attacks.
An alternative to the 14-day regimen might be to administer the 15-mg daily regimen only during the acute attack and then administer primaquine during recurrent attacks; however, the results of this study do not support the use of primaquine as an outpatient anti-relapse treatment. If primaquine is to be used, new strategies that combine different drugs and/or dosing regimens should be examined.
The 14-day primaquine course was found to prevent relapse of P. vivax in Mumbai, India.
Several studies demonstrated that the 14-day primaquine regimen does not prevent relapses of P. vivax in some locations (Southern Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand) and thus primaquine resistance has developed"

There are multiple treatment options for blepharitis, ocular rosacea, and dry eye diseases. Treatment options vary from over-the-counter treatments, lubricating ocular drops, to warm compresses. When a patient presents with symptoms of dry eye, blepharitis, or ocular rosacea, it is essential to establish a diagnosis before determining the appropriate treatment. In cases of posterior blepharitis, eyelid gland hyposecretion, meibomian gland dysfunction, inflammation or lipid accumulation within the eyelids can occur. Treating this clinical condition using warm compresses and topical ocular drops can be beneficial to improving the quality of eyelid secretions and tear film functionality. Warm compresses and topical ocular drops used individually or in combination with lid rubs can provide symptomatic relief and improve lid cleanliness and eyelash health. A new warm moist air device also provided symptomatic relief of ocular fatigue and improvement of tear stability in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction or blepharitis. In summary, there are multiple treatment options for blepharitis, ocular rosacea, and dry eye diseases. The diagnosis of lid margin disease or inflammation should be established prior to initiating therapy. Treatments may include warm compresses, lubricating ocular drops, topical anti-inflammatory ophthalmic solutions, and ophthalmic antibiotic solutions. Treatment should be continued until the specific condition is resolved and there is a normalization of ocular surface symptoms and findings."

No interventions have been adequately studied to improve medication adherence among people living with HIV/AIDS who have high levels of substance use and little social support. Most studies have limited generalizability, with few examining HIV-specific issues. Studies with adequate generalizability suggest that interventions are ineffective at increasing HIV medication adherence and improving health-related outcomes. However, some interventions may be effective in certain populations and settings under ideal conditions, and more rigorous research is needed before programs are expanded, especially since few effective alternative interventions are available..

Pregnancy-induced hypertension is common in pregnancy and is associated with maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Despite there being evidence to suggest that hypertension may affect fetal growth, whether or not treatment has a positive effect on fetal outcome is still uncertain. There is little difference in the efficacy of the four agents studied (methyldopa, diazoxide, oral hydrallazine, or labetalol). Intrauterine growth retardation may occur following treatment of either labetalol or methyldopa, but propranolol appears to be the best beta blocker for controlling high blood pressure in pregnancy. Labetalol significantly reduced blood pressure, prevented proteinuria, reduced the need for hospital admission, and increased fetal weight. Labetalol with hospitalization or low-dose aspirin alone appears to be the best treatment for mild hypertension in pregnancy. Methyldopa significantly reduces the risk of pre-term delivery, but does not improve neonatal outcome.

In summary, based on the available evidence, the management of preeclampsia and pregnancy-induced hypertension is controversial, and there is no evidence that treatment of mild hypertension reduces maternal or perinatal morbidity or mortality. More information is needed on the management of severe hypertension in pregnancy, and on the risks and benefits of tocolysis in pre-eclampsia and treatment of hypertension in pregnancy with more potent drugs or beta blockers..

Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is strongly associated with endothelial dysfunction and inflammation, which portend a high cardiovascular risk. Fish oil dietary supplementation reduces plasma soluble thrombomodulin in PAD patients and improves endothelial function. The effect of fish oil on the blood rheology is not clarified. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate whether fish oil improves the blood rheology in PAD patients.
                One hundred and ten patients with stable intermittent claudication completed a prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study. They were treated with a fish oil preparation containing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, 2.7 g/d given as fish oil, or as an isocaloric and isoenergetic placebo in an amount of 2.7 g/d of soy oil for 6 months. The ankle-brachial index, walking distance, blood pressure, lipid profile, plasma levels of adhesion molecules, and plasma markers of rheological function were measured.
                The fish oil group reduced plasma total cholesterol levels from median of 189 mg/dL to 182 mg/dL (-1.3%; p<0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from 130 mg/dL to 124 mg/dL (-4.3%; p<0.05) and triglycerides from 185 mg/dL to 163 mg/dL (-11%; p<0.01). The walking distance increased from 83+/-28 m to 91+/-33 m (+8.2%, p<0.05) in fish oil supplemented group and from 84+/-28 m to 92+/-27 m (+7.5%, p<0.05) in the placebo group.

This is a summarization of the key findings from a collection of studies related to calcium supplementation during pregnancy.

1. Calcium supplementation starting before 24 weeks of gestation reduced the rate of fetal death and the incidence of preterm birth.
2. Calcium supplementation in both high and low calcium intake women resulted in a lower rate of preterm birth and a higher birth weight than in control groups.
3. Calcium supplementation in women with low calcium intake did not have significant effects on pregnancy outcomes.
4. Calcium supplementation is associated with decreased rates of preeclampsia in high-risk women, but the evidence is not strong due to methodological limitations of the studies.
5. Calcium supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with long-term effects on the child's health.
6. There is currently no solid evidence that calcium supplementation in women with low calcium intake is associated with benefits for pregnancy outcomes.
7. Calcium supplementation in pregnant women with low plasma levels of calcium and phosphorus is associated with a lower rate of pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia than in women not receiving calcium supplementation.

There are two main techniques used to treat trochanteric hip fractures: the intramedullary nail and the sliding hip screw (SC) system. Both are biomechanically and technically sound, and neither technique has any proven clinical advantages over the other. The sliding hip screw (SC) system provides rapid post-operative mobilization and functional ambulation. These studies show SC is probably the better operating approach. This study also adds to the mounting evidence that intramedullary nailing offers no clinical advantages over the sliding hip screw in trochanteric fractures.
Study #1 to 6: Results with the dynamic hip screw support the notion that SC devices represent the standard for the treatment of trochanteric fractures.
Study #7 to 16: The studies on intramedullary nailing (IMN), however, fail to demonstrate any clear advantage for the intramedullary nail. Study #7 shows improved fracture healing with the IMN. A study by Klaushoell et al. supports these findings and adds to the evidence from previous studies. In this series of 49 patients, we also observed that the patients treated by intramedullary nailing had a lower mortality rate than with the SC system. Therefore, this advantage over the SC system may outweigh the disadvantages of longer operative times and fluoroscopy times, but more studies that compare the IMN and SC system in a more uniform way are needed to evaluate this adequately.

The present study shows that the treatment with metformin together with GnRHa antagonist improves the outcome of IVF treatment as compared to GnRH agonist in women with PCOS. Metformin significantly decreases the number of ampoules of rFSH and estradiol blood levels without increasing the incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (2 versus 4 cases in both groups, respectively, P > 0.05). We conclude that the addition of a low dose of metformin in the daily routine of these women could be useful in the treatment of PCOS without risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome..

Combining the insights from the provided abstracts, we can summarize that the use of metformin during gonadotropin stimulation for ovarian stimulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome has shown to be beneficial as it has significantly reduced the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. However, there has been no significant improvement in the overall fertilization rates and clinical pregnancy rates. More studies are needed to further explore the beneficial effects of metformin in patients undergoing IVF treatment.

IUDs do not cause significant changes in menstrual blood loss or menstrual frequency. However the insertion of some intrauterine devices, mainly those coated with copper, may lead to abnormal endometrial bleeding and pain during and after insertion. Pain at insertion is due to mechanical trauma to the endometrium and cervical canal during manipulation, which may result in vasodilatation. In addition, intrauterine devices may cause vasodilatation of the endometrium, which may increase the number of uterine arterial vessels. Bleeding following insertion may be due to mechanical trauma caused during insertion of the device. Excessive bleeding after insertion may be due to a combination of factors, such as an increased number of arterioles, increased platelet activity induced by the insertion, and increased capillary permeability following copper contact with the endometrium. Other findings of IUD-related disorders include abnormal coitus-induced bleeding and a syndrome consisting of symptoms such as dyspareunia and pelvic pain that persists a few days after menses terminate.

Two drugs with anti-prostaglandin and anti-fibrinolytic activities are used to treat excessive bleeding after insertion of IUDs. Paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid and ibuprofen are used for pain relief during and after intrauterine device insertion. However, they do not significantly affect the total amount of menstrual blood lost.

Indomethacin (PGE1, PGE2 inhibitor), naproxen and aspirin may decrease the amount of blood lost. Indomethacin may also be helpful in controlling IUD-induced dysmenorrhea. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, naproxen and mefenamic acid decrease and/or stop the excessive bleeding in most women. The effect is most marked in the first 2 weeks of treatment. It has been suggested that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs reduce the amount of menstrual blood lost by blocking prostaglandins responsible for vasodilatation of the uterine vessels, and by causing a local antifibrinolytic effect."

Oral treatment appeared to provide similar clinical benefits as intravenous treatment, but was associated with a higher risk of gastro-intestinal side effects and discontinuation of erythropoiesis.

The majority of evidence was supportive of the efficacy of IV iron, although there were insufficient data to exclude potential harm. No serious AEs were reported with IV iron.

The review by Kostis et al. 2012 and that by Pugliesi et al. 2017 found that there was no significant difference in the efficacy of oral vs. intravenous iron as the initial treatment strategy in patients with chronic kidney failure (CKD) and iron deficiency anemia (IDA). Based on the available evidence, it does not seem that iron supplementation improves outcomes in patients with anemia in CKD as it does not improve the proportion of patients receiving erythropoietic stimulating agents who achieve desired haemoglobin levels at the end of six months."

Self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes has mixed results in randomized clinical trials, and has not been shown to reduce the risk for complications. However, it may be beneficial for patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. To date, studies have not shown any additional benefits beyond blood glucose lowering, self-efficacy or self-management skills. Therefore, self-monitoring of blood glucose should be prescribed after careful consideration about its potential benefits for each patient."

The combination of 250 micrograms ipratropium bromide administered through a nebulizer and mask, in addition to 625 micrograms fenoterol, appears to be superior to both ipratropium and fenoterol given independently. The addition of ipratropium to albuterol did not significantly improve flow in the patients who received the combination of fenoterol and ipratropium. In conclusion, the addition of the combination of fenoterol and ipratropium to albuterol provides the most effective treatment of the patients enrolled in the study and results in an improvement of pulmonary function when compared with albuterol alone or with ipratropium and fenoterol given independently."

While social support plays a significant role in smoking cessation, evidence from randomized controlled trials suggests that social support interventions are not consistently effective for improving quit rates. Nonetheless, a variety of social support interventions for smoking cessation have been developed and implemented, with findings generally indicating that higher level of social support is significantly associated with higher quit rates. Findings have also suggested modest effect sizes in support interventions for increasing quit rates. Social support interventions tend to be relatively simple, feasible, and cost-effective. There is a need for the development of more intensive social support interventions or interventions targeting specific social support needs identified by smokers."

Guided Tissue Regeneration (GTR) with bioabsorbable collagen or non-resorbable membranes has had excellent clinical results for the treatment of moderate to deep periodontal intrabony defects. GTR with nonresorbable membranes appears to be as effective as GTR with a resorbable membrane, but requires a more complex surgical procedure. GTR is less predictable in deep vs. shallow defects and in presence of furcation involvement. GTR with or without the addition of enamel matrix proteins appears to have comparable clinical outcomes. Guided tissue regeneration using a resorbable membrane, such as collagen or bioresorbable membranes, is often preferable to traditional flap technique, since it is faster, easier and less invasive, and has comparable short-term clinical results. The present protocol will be a valuable tool to help train future practitioners in periodontics to provide best practice to their patients."

This review provides evidence in favour of the hypothesis that most patients derive symptomatic benefit from dual-chamber (DDD) pacing in terms of patient-related outcome measures, including symptoms, exercise testing and health perception. These pacing techniques were superior to single chamber (VVI, VVIR) pacing. Based on these studies, there are only two contraindications to dual chamber pacing as a pacing mode to reduce symptoms: 1) The presence of permanent atrial fibrillation; and 2) Unacceptable symptoms during atrial synchronous (DDD) pacing."

The integrated treatment approach for dual diagnosis patients was more effective than standard treatment in one study that used motivational interviewing following intensive case management in an outpatient setting for adults with severe mental illness and substance abuse disorders. This study is the first to provide evidence of the successful use of motivational interviewing for treating substance abuse among the dually diagnosed. The authors also noted that integrated treatment was successful when provided in less intensive community settings when intensive case management was not available. More aggressive efforts to screen and refer substance abusing patients to integrated treatment programs are likely to prove useful.

Studies involving motivational interviewing with psychoeducation, support groups, cognitive behavioral skills training or case management have found that these treatments are as effective as or more effective than standard drug abuse treatments but that standard inpatient and outpatient treatment programs have not consistently improved drug abuse outcomes in dual diagnosis patients.

Although integrated treatment programs for severe mental illness and substance abuse patients appeared to provide some improvement in drug abuse and treatment adherence, no differences in outcome were detected between standard inpatient and outpatient services and these programs. However, the integrated treatments were found to be more effective than a control condition when standard follow-up services were not provided. Treatment was most effective when both outpatient substance abuse and community mental health services were continued at the same time after discharge from inpatient care.

Studies involving case management, support groups, family intervention, skills training, group therapy or cognitive behavioral interventions for severe mental illness and substance abuse patients found that none of the intervention approaches was statistically significantly different from a control condition.

Treatment results were most promising where treatments were delivered in a variety of formats that included brief interventions through community mental health centers, residential settings, or as components of intensive case management services.

There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of screening programs for older people in general practice settings. While some studies find improvements in psychological morale, there is little evidence for improved physical functioning or better management of chronic health conditions. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence for the potential risks associated with systematic screening programs, such as increased rates of diagnostic procedures and admissions.

Weight loss programs have been shown to be effective and feasible in a clinical setting, however, evidence shows that these treatments have not increased knowledge, changed health beliefs, or improved weight loss and weight loss maintenance. Online interventions have been found to be effective at achieving weight loss, maintaining weight loss, and may even be more cost-effective than traditional face-to-face programs. Despite positive outcomes in some studies, the effectiveness of online interventions has not exceeded face-to-face programs. Future research on online weight management programs is necessary to determine the impact of these programs on behavior change and to optimize these programs."

Although results from controlled clinical trials are not consistently supportive of the role of statins in MS, some studies document moderate effectiveness of statins in MS. As there is a paucity of studies on the benefit of statins in MS patients responding inadequately to IFN beta, we thought of a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial to clarify the role of atorvastatin as add-on therapy to IFN beta in relapsing-remitting MS patients on standard dosage of this medication. A placebo-controlled clinical trial is not necessary due to ethical and safety reasons as there is not indication for double-blinding in this setting. Patients with clinically-stable relapsing-remitting MS, with or without ongoing treatment with glucocorticoids, are eligible for entry. Subjects will be randomized to atorvastatin or placebo addition to their treatment. After a pre-randomization therapy-free period, patients will start 10 mg atorvastatin or placebo daily for 3 weeks, and then increase the dosage to 20 mg daily for 24 weeks. Therapy will be discontinued if a relapse or an adverse event occurs, or if an adverse event suggests the need for immediate discontinuation. Evaluation will include adverse event recording, neurological examinations, and brain MRI.
                In addition we plan a double-blind phase to study the effect of simvastatin on biologic events in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It will help us to understand how the treatment influences the inflammatory disease mechanisms in peripheral blood and to clarify whether the lack of effect of atorvastatin in our previous trial is due to methodological inadequacies or to statin's inability to modify MS.
                We aim to enroll more than 300 relapsing remitting patients: this will let us complete the planned parallel treatment arms within the 18-months follow-up period, while the planned double-blind phase will be possible with the enrollment of at least 20 patients. This is a small and feasible step forward in understanding whether statin treatment added to IFN beta could represent an additional disease-modifying option in MS..

Current smoking cessation interventions are largely ineffective when used by smokeless tobacco (ST) users. Evidence that ST use constitutes a risk factor for a range of cancers and other diseases is accumulating, and smokeless tobacco cessation must be incorporated into tobacco treatment practice guidelines. Interventions must be developed that will be efficacious in encouraging and helping ST users to quit. The available evidence indicates that pharmacological therapies are more effective than minimally effective behavioral interventions. The combination of medication (e.g., bupropion) with group behavioral treatment should be a high priority for further research. As little as 14% of ST users seek help in cessation, a major challenge to successful treatment is the identification of motivated individuals who would benefit from tobacco treatment programs (i.e., prevention of ST initiation and promotion of cessation among ST users). Further research is needed to help identify these individuals. In addition, there are other barriers to intervention that we cannot measure easily in studies, such as the availability of ST and the attitudes of the person’s family and peers to quit. In the US, most states prohibit the sale of tobacco products to minors and other populations, while some states also prevent Internet and mail order sales of ST. The current and proposed tobacco control efforts may also have an impact on ST use, in that they limit the availability of ST in general, as well as its availability to specific individuals (e.g., military personnel who cannot currently buy ST on base). These prevention efforts provide additional opportunities for intervention that can be targeted to groups that are at high risk for ST use."

The majority of randomised controlled trials comparing CSII with MDI have favourable effects for the CSII group on HbA1c and reduced hypoglycaemia. However, these benefits are small and are not always clinically significant. Although they have no long-term safety concerns, the introduction of CSII is still debated, due to these limited benefits and the associated high costs as compared to MDI. Further studies on different treatment groups such as duration, type of insulin, settings for alarms, and the combination of CSII with closed loop systems are necessary to clarify the clinical benefits of this treatment modality."

GAPN postacute care coordination improves hip fracture outcomes. Studies found that a psychiatric intervention has no statistically significant benefits in treating depression for older women post-hip fracture. All three treatment groups (exercise only, plus only, and exercise plus) increased exercise outcomes compared to usual care. A discharge planning intervention improved several outcome measures for older people with hip fractures, but the interventions were not examined for their effectiveness in improving functional recovery or quality of life.  Although only one intervention was identified as effective, the GAPN postacute care coordination interventions had a positive impact at reducing hip fracture related morbidity in older women. Future studies should examine more comprehensive interventions in older populations."

The research supports the use of IVIG in preventing infections in preterm infants. A single dose of 1000 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg of IVIG administered to preterm newborns with birth weight 750-2000 grams or 500-1499 grams, respectively, during the first 12 hours after birth is effective in preventing infections. The decrease in infections appears to be closely related to the serum IgG levels in the IVIG group. Septicemia is reduced with IVIG. No evidence of deleterious effects was seen. Further studies are needed to verify these findings in other centres and to determine whether this decrease in infections will ultimately reduce the overall morbidity of these preterm infants."

Data from clinical trials show that donepezil is effective in improving cognitive performance and slowing deterioration in functional skills and global outcome in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Donepezil is well tolerated with no significant effects on laboratory tests or vital signs. Donepezil treatment in patients with moderate to severe AD demonstrated a significantly slower decline than placebo in instrumental and basic ADLs. Donepezil was associated with lower levels of caregiver stress and less caregiving time spent assisting patients with ADLs as compared to placebo. Data from independent, open-label, safety studies suggest that long-term donepezil treatment continues to improve cognitive function and that a possible dose response exists. No convincing evidence exists for a plateau effect of donepezil on cognition or a significant reduction in donepezil-associated plasma acetylcholinesterase inhibitor levels during long-term treatment. While donepezil is well tolerated without significant laboratory or physiological abnormalities, transient nausea and diarrhoea were the most frequent adverse events and the possible but uncommon effects of a seizure, pancreatitis and syncope must be considered in patients presenting with these symptoms. These trials confirm that the cholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, is a valuable component of the pharmacological treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Despite improvements in cognitive and functional status, donepezil monotherapy is not a cure for Alzheimer's disease. There is a need for the development of safe and effective therapies that have a more direct impact on disease pathology.."

This collection of empirical studies demonstrates the significant positive effects of tailored, evidence-based programs implemented in the community or with persons with HIV disease. These programs were effective, had wide appeal, addressed the specific needs or interests of their target populations, engaged local opinion leaders and social networks, and were delivered in ways that fostered their adoption and sustained use. Despite our limited understanding, a few things are clear. First, effective HIV prevention strategies can make a significant difference in behavior and reduce HIV risk. Second, these strategies should be developed in collaboration with the population they will serve, adapted for local culture and practice, and supported by the social networks of individuals within the communities they serve. Unfortunately, funding for prevention programs is scarce, and there is a continuing public health need to further develop, refine, and disseminate existing programs, as well as to develop new ones."

The effectiveness of cyproterone acetate, a pure antiandrogen, in women with idiopathic hirsutism treated for 9 months has been compared with that of either flutamide, another pure antiandrogen, or spironolactone plus oral contraceptive pills.

                Treatment of hirsutism and endocrine profile and its effect on sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG).
                This multicenter, open-labelled study evaluated 100 patients with mild, moderate or severe hirsutism of idiopathic, hyperandrogenic origin.
                To determine if treatment with cyproterone acetate (CyA) at a dose of 100 mg daily improves both biochemical and clinical efficacy and is better tolerated than flutamide (FliA) (500 mg/day) in hirsutism.

Sponging, antipyretic medications, and unwrapping a febrile child may all be effective treatments for controlling fever. Of these interventions, the use of oral antipyretics provided the most rapid temperature reduction; however, when antipyretics were used alone, unwrapping was shown to provide some additional benefit. The use of antipyretics was seen to be superior to sponging which results in a more rapid fall in temperature. The antipyretic efficacy of acetaminophen and ibuprofen were shown to be significantly more than the antipyretic efficacy of paracetamol. Oral paracetamol is effective for fever control in children. The safety and antipyretic efficacy of acetaminophen, ibuprofen and tepid sponging were demonstrated in febrile children. The findings suggest that routine sponging without an antipyretic agent is not useful to reduce a fever in a febrile child. Paracetamol is clearly more effective than tepid sponging in reducing body temperature in febrile children in a tropical climate. Despite this, there was no reduction in fever between sponging and use of antipyretic therapy at the 60' mark. Acetaminophen and ibuprofen were both shown to be effective antipyretics in reducing the duration of high-grade fever by approximately half an hour. Paracetamol and acetaminophen had a similar antipyretic efficacy when used in conjunction with sponging."

Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can prolong the resuscitation of patients who collapse suddenly in the street, or in a hospital. Because it involves vigorous pressing of the breastbone, patients often develop bruising and broken ribs, which may lead to more complications in hospitals.
Active compression-decompression CPR is an alternative method of chest compression, which allows the patient's lungs to be inflated with more air, while minimizing the pressure on the heart. This technique improves the function of the heart during CPR. A recent US study reported that patients in hospital who received this alternative technique were 2.8 times more likely to survive a collapse and go home alive, while a European study in the streets reported no benefit. But, when the technique was used as the first method of CPR, it seemed most likely to help patients who had collapsed suddenly. There have been very few reports of research from this country. A study in the streets of Oxford reported no benefit as the first treatment, but a recent study of 181 patients in Oxfordshire hospitals that also looked at the long-term benefit of the alternative CPR method also reported no benefit.
In summary, in adults over the age of 40 years with sudden collapse, active compression decompression CPR seems to be most effective when used as the first method of CPR as soon as possible after collapse. This method of resuscitation appears to help about one in seven survivors to recover enough to return to work or to the activities they were doing before the collapse. This figure includes only those people who recovered their health before collapse or those people who were healthy before collapse. Those people who use this method of CPR and still survive, or those people who were healthy before collapse, will probably be able to live a normal life expectancy. This method of CPR should be used as soon as possible and is best carried out by a hospital doctor, paramedic, nurse, or police officer."

This systematic review and meta-analysis sought to determine the efficacy of wearing orthotics. In the six studies, a total of 556 adults with various foot pathologies received orthotics as treatment compared with no treatment.
                Pain (standardised mean difference -2.23, 95% CI -3.16 to -1.29) and biomechanical function (SMD -1.41, 95% CI -2.28 to -0.55) showed significant improvements favouring orthotic wear. Foot orthoses produced small short-term benefits in function and may also produce small reductions in pain for people with plantar fasciitis, but they do not have long-term beneficial effects compared with a sham device. Overall, orthotics are more effective than simple sham insoles or supportive athletic shoes worn alone in treating pain and improving foot function in the short-term when compared to an inactive control treatment, although improvements may not last in the long-term.. This review suggests that custom foot orthoses are a very promising treatment for plantar fasciitis both in the short-term and the long-term..
                The evidence in favour of foot orthosis as an effective treatment for foot and ankle pain and disability has strengthened since the completion of the previous systematic review in 2000. The review included 8 trials enrolling 448 participants. The available evidence supports that custom made orthoses are beneficial and should be recommended as a first line treatment for plantar fasciitis, although future research is necessary in order to determine the optimal type and design of orthoses and to optimise long-term treatment compliance.
                Overall, the quality of evidence was low or very low for all outcomes.. The review demonstrates that further studies are required to provide firm conclusions to inform clinical practice. One major limitation on the evidence presented within this review was the lack of high-quality RCTs that are well-powered and have used appropriate masking procedures. Therefore future trials are necessary to confirm or refute current results.."

There is some evidence that the active management of labour approach, which includes early amniotomy, early diagnosis of slow progress in labour, and the use of higher doses of oxytocin when indicated in a labouring woman, may shorten labour and reduce the risk of instrumental delivery or caesarean section without increasing the risk of maternal or neonatal infection, although the evidence is not consistent.

To summarize, fluoroquinolone antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and gatifloxacin are effective in treating uncomplicated enteric fever caused by Salmonella Typhi and Paratyphi A, which includes nalidixic acid-resistant and MDR strains. Due to the high rates of resistance to many antibiotics, particularly chloramphenicol and TMP/SMX, a short course (5 days) of fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, or ofloxacin may be a good alternative treatment due to better efficacy, safety, and convenience. A minimum duration of treatment of 7 days is recommended due to a higher likelihood of treatment failure with early discontinuation. As a result, for unsupervised treatment of patients who self-present at ambulatory clinics, a 5-day treatment with oral ofloxacin (400 mg daily) would be an appropriate regimen. Furthermore, the addition of probiotic Bifidobacterium longum strain LPC0078 helps accelerate the treatment and ensures a safe eradication of S. typhi bacteria in the body of patients."

Effective transitional care after an acute hospital stay is crucial for positive patient outcomes. Several studies have shown improved outcomes for patients when they receive transitional care interventions. Studies reviewed in this report concluded that transitional care interventions can reduce rates of emergency department visits, readmissions, and even death. For future research directions, it will be valuable to determine the components of transitional care interventions that are most effective and in what settings they work best. Transitional care interventions are more effective when an interdisciplinary team of professionals work to coordinate care, when patients are actively involved in their care, and when communication with primary care providers is enhanced. Additionally, the use of mobile health applications could improve transitional care outcomes by providing patients with a secure and convenient way to access medical information and communicate with their care team."

Thyroid goitre is associated with moderate to severe iodine deficiency, which occurs particularly during infancy and childhood when the thyroid's size is rapidly increasing. In order to prevent thyroid enlargement in iodine deficient areas, supplementation of iodized salt has been recommended for many years. This meta-analysis of five studies provides evidence for the effectiveness of iodized salt in reducing the prevalence of goitre in children. The quality of the primary studies is variable, but all except one study report beneficial effects. The majority of the studies included children and found that provision of iodized salt resulted in a reduced prevalence of goitre in children. Children are an important target group for goitre prevention since they have the highest risk of being iodine deficient, their thyroid glands are smaller and more sensitive to iodine deficiency and their increased consumption of salt means they are more at risk from untreated deficiency. Salt is an appropriate vehicle for the delivery of iodine in children since more iodine is added as iodized salt than can be provided by iodized water. Therefore, further research is needed to explore the feasibility of delivering iodine as a salt supplement to children in other deficient countries."

Intermittent pedicle clamping is a highly effective alternative to continuous clamping for managing surgical bleeding during major liver resections in cirrhosis.
Based on research, the most effective method of hepatic vascular occlusion is with intermittent inflow occlusion during liver resections, with longer clamping time of more than 15 minutes and shorter reperfusion time, which can significantly reduce blood loss and postoperative liver function injury, but there is still a high degree of debate about this.

Despite the known health risks associated with exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke, it persists as a common problem for children in many countries. This review sought to identify the impact of parental smoking behaviour on children's respiratory outcomes and the effectiveness of interventions to reduce children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. Seven studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria. We found that parental smoking is associated with increased incidence of asthma, wheeze, recurrent otitis media and impaired pulmonary function. In addition, one study found a relationship between parental smoking and a shorter duration of sleep. The evidence regarding interventions to reduce children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke is limited. Only two studies reported a significant effect on reducing tobacco smoke exposure in the home. However, a recent systematic review found that education and cessation interventions delivered by health professionals or nurses improved cessation rates and smoking restriction at home among pregnant and post-partum women. Further research is needed to determine which interventions are effective in preventing new smoking behaviour among smokers without previous behaviour change, and which strategies are effective for children who present with asthma. Based on the available evidence, it seems that preventing smoking uptake, encouraging and supporting smoking cessation among smokers and restricting smoking activity in households may go a long way in reducing children's exposure to smoking, thus improving respiratory outcomes."

Nine prospective trials involving more than 3000 patients were pooled for meta-analysis. A small but statistically significant decrease in mortality (relative risk, 0.92; 95% confidence interval, 0.86 to 0.98) and a reduced risk of asthma-related hospital admissions (0.90; 95% confidence interval, 0.84 to 0.96) were observed with regular inhaled steroids. No significant effects on quality of life measures, school or work absences, or the general need for health care services were identified. The effects of inhaled steroids are greatest for asthma patients with a lower baseline risk for asthma exacerbations(JAMA. 2006;295:2439-2447).
Inhaled formoterol 12 micrograms twice daily (F) significantly improves lung function and reduces asthma symptoms over inhaled salbutamol 500 micrograms four times daily (T) and placebo (P) in asthmatic patients with asthma control poor (A-FFRING-10).

In contrast, salmeterol (50 micrograms, twice daily) (SALM) is an effective and safe agent for short-term treatment of acute asthma symptoms or for patients with severe persistent asthma. Long-term use of high doses of salmeterol is not recommended.
Long-acting betaagonists like salmeterol offer rapid onset of action comparable with inhaled beta2-agonist and significant improvement of lung function and asthma disease control."

HIV is a major health problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where there are still high levels of HIV disease; sub-Saharan Africa is the most severely affected region in the world where 90% of all new HIV infections that occurred in 2019, occurred. Sex workers (SWs) are a group at higher risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) due to structural forces that put them in high-risk sexual relationships with multiple, often anonymous partners. In addition, SWs face many other challenges such as poverty, low levels of education, stigmatization and exclusion. In this context, HIV prevention interventions are an important part of comprehensive HIV interventions to mitigate the high burden of HIV disease.
We systematically screened 378 citations in five databases for eligibility. Of 16 studies that met our inclusion criteria, we included 11 studies in a systematic review. We used a narrative summary design to describe both the strengths and limitations of each study. We used 2009 and 2010 as benchmark years, and we focused on the effect of the intervention on condom use, STDs, HIV infection as well as possible mediators of behavior change.
In most of the studies, the interventions included peer education and community-based organizations (CBOs). Few studies assessed a gender-transformative framework. The vast majority of the studies were implemented in Asia, predominately in India, Thailand and Nepal.
Economic evaluations are needed to inform the allocation of resources. There is a need for larger trials of HIV prevention interventions for female sex workers. They should include gender transformative and health system strengthening approaches for the most vulnerable subpopulations of female sex workers, including younger sex workers and those working with brothels. There is a need for better and standardized operational definitions of study designs, criteria and outcome measures.
Further research is needed into the implementation of HIV interventions for sex workers, including adherence to recommended strategies, contextual factors and their effects on sustainability. Future studies should investigate the most cost-effective ways of delivering comprehensive, gender-transformative, health system strengthening interventions to maximize their impact."

Cigarettes remain the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, and it is estimated that smoking will take around 5 million American lives during the course of the 21st century. A 2004 U.S. Surgeon General's Report stated that there is no specific form of treatment that can help people quit smoking, as the smoking cessation success rates vary across individuals.
The results of a systematic review of 117 studies of the nicotine gum, patch, and inhaler showed some promising results. On average, smokers using nicotine gum increased their quit rates from 5% while not using the gum, to 8% after 4 weeks. In relation to a placebo, the results were not conclusive. However, smokers who received nicotine inhalers were found to have 10% and 20% higher quit success rates than those not receiving inhalers, or receiving a placebo, respectively.
However, another systematic review of 32 randomized clinical trials focused only on nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) products, such as inhalers, and not on other, non-pharmacological interventions. The study found that the use of NRT, regardless of the type, was associated with a 70% chance of quitting smoking when compared with no use of NRT.
These results have significant implications for both practitioners and tobacco control advocates, and suggest that practitioners in particular should recommend NRT products, and counsel smokers about the available pharmacological, non-pharmacological and behavioural options for quitting. This would help to boost current smoking cessation success rates, which currently only range from 10% to 30%, according to the National Cancer Institute in the US.
The findings provide evidence that can be informative to government officials and tobacco control advocates, as well as practitioners. They will provide them with the knowledge needed to encourage and support evidence-based practices for helping people quit smoking.
In conclusion, while quitting smoking is a challenging but worthwhile goal, there is no single method or approach that will work for everyone, as many factors influence people's ability and willingness to quit. But these results demonstrate the need to be mindful of the different methods and support available for quitters, and they highlight the"

Multiple randomized controlled trials have assessed whether screening for colorectal cancer using a faecal occult blood (FOB) test can reduce mortality. The majority of the trials provide evidence that biennial screening with FOB tests reduces both the incidence and the mortality from colorectal cancer; the annual test is less effective but has lower costs. There are indications that the effects are greater in men than women, and for screening in the age group 50-54 years than in older age groups.
Major issues to be addressed in future trials include the duration of effect over time, the most cost-effective screening interval, whether to test once or twice, the most appropriate age range, and the role of additional tests for those who are positive.
FOB-based screening results in additional mortality compared with usual care and may be associated with over-diagnosis. However, some trials also demonstrated a small absolute but clinically significant reduction in all-cause mortality among those aged 50-59, 60-69, and 70-79 years.
Screening tests should be validated in target populations, and their cost-effectiveness and feasibility assessed in ongoing studies."

In the last few decades, the introduction of neuraxial anesthesia techniques as labor epidural analgesia (LEA) has changed the maternal healthcare practice. LEOA is considered a safe and reliable tool to provide effective analgesia during the whole process of labor. Several studies have shown that LEOA reduces the need for systemic analgesia and improves the outcome of pregnancy. In particular, the administration of a continuous epidural analgesia (CEA) infusion provides continuous pain relief and improved the quality of life during labor.

The benefits of LEOA are not limited only to good pain relief. LEOA administration may result beneficial effects for maternal health, such as improved maternal satisfaction, decrease in the incidence of nausea and vomiting, improved quality of sleep and improvement of maternal cooperation and acceptance of the medical team.

In some cases, the systemic administration of analgesics or the use of spinal techniques may lead to maternal or fetal-neonatal side-effects. For these reasons, many techniques of labor analgesia have been introduced to reduce the incidence of undesirable effects.

In this review, recent studies on LEOA were analyzed and summarized."

Current guidelines on preemptive analgesia in labour recommend early administration of systemic analgesia. Although intravenous or intramuscular administration of analgesics has been used for a long time, it may be preferable to use routes of administration that allow continuous and controlled drug delivery without the need for frequent boluses, which could require the expertise of a particular profession for administration and management.
Epidural and intrathecal analgesia are commonly used for pain relief during childbirth and are considered as “gold standards” of analgesia. However, as epidural placement can be technically difficult and time-consuming, it has been suggested that combining systemic and neuraxial routes of analgesia could provide benefits in terms of a quicker onset of pain relief.
Systemic use of oral or intravenous drug combinations is not common practice in the maternity setting in France or in many other countries and their use is limited to emergency situations in preterm or obese women.
Apart from NSAIDs or paracetamol, most drugs commonly used in labour analgesia are opioids. The use of opioids, in particular oral or intravenous pethidine, is still common practice in the French maternity setting, despite their side effects such as nausea and vomiting, and their lack of safety for women and future child. Recently, intravenous administration of low dose of opioils combined with a low dose of non-steroidal, oral or intravenous, anti-emetic drug has been shown to be an effective analgesic method in the maternity setting. This strategy can prevent the need for a general anaesthetic while preserving women’s rights in the pain relief process.
We have shown that combining systemic with neuraxial analgesia could lead to a faster onset of analgesia and to better pain relief compared to either route of administration alone. The benefits of this combined approach must now be investigated in larger multicentre studies in the French Maternity setting."

After stroke, motor impairments and functional disability significantly impact a person's ability to participate in daily living. A systematic search for randomized controlled clinical trials published within the last five years showed that additional training for upper or lower extremity motor control can further improve motor outcomes and functional independence after stroke. Additional training, when added to usual care, is also effective in improving standing and walking performance. Thus, additional training adds to the recovery of people after stroke. However, in some cases, no significant effect of additional treatment on functional mobility was found.
When additional training had positive effects, these effects varied among studies as well as within subgroups of stroke subjects. The results of individual studies can therefore not be generalized. Further studies with larger sample sizes for the different subgroups of stroke survivors are required before definite conclusions can be drawn. There is also a need for more studies on the effects of additional training on functional outcomes beyond motor impairments and functional independence."

The results of the studies suggest that myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome appears to respond to occlusal splint therapy. This has been demonstrated by several clinical studies. In addition, the results from acupuncture treatment are favourable in one study. The type of splint is not as important as the regular use of the appliance for treatment to be effective. Stabilization splints with a large occluding surface do not seem suitable for patients with pain and tenderness to palpation of the masticatory muscles, since this type of appliance frequently results in an increased pain on biting and an increased hyperactivity of the posterior masticatory muscles. The occlusal splint should therefore interfere as little as possible with patients' existing pain.
The studies used in this review have been conducted before the term facial pain disorders was coined, and it is possible that the results could be the same or even somewhat different if the same samples had been used today when the diagnostic criteria for facial pain dysfunction syndrome have been redefined and the condition is studied under the more general diagnoses of orofacial pain dysfunction syndrome.
A few of the papers have studied the effect of splint therapy in patients with masticatory disfunction who suffer pain in the teeth or periodontal tissues during sleep. It is possible that these studies have not included patients with myofascial pain. The type of splint therapy recommended for these patients in this review may not necessarily be the same as for those with myofascial pain.."

The studies highlighted that training on simulation-based virtual reality endoscopy is an effective method to teach targeted colonoscopy skills and to reduce the time needed to reach technical competency. After simulator training, novice endoscopists performed significantly better and reached the cecum more often than those in the control group, in addition to achieving shorter procedure times and fewer patient discomforts. Simulator training facilitated more complete procedures, required less assistance from instructors, and was performed with fewer procedural-related complications. Simulator training was also an effective method to teach the basic manual skills required for upper endoscopy. As the use of simulation-based training is gaining increasing popularity in many medical specialties, future studies are warranted to evaluate the benefits of this training approach in a larger and varied group of trainees, including different medical specialties."

The addition of prednisone to the standard methotrexate/cyclosporine prophylaxis does not improve prevention of acute graft-versus-host disease. It increases the risk of chronic GVHD. However, the combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine plus prednisone, starting from day 15 post-transplantation, may avoid the interference of prednisone with methotrexate's prophylaxis efficacy while still providing a graft-versus-leukemia effect. Therefore, prophylactic methotrexate and cyclosporine alone would be the recommended prophylaxis for allogeneic marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplants."

This review includes 5 high quality clinical trials related to a randomized phase II trial of all trans Retinal in women with moderate or severe cervical dysplasia. Retinoids have been shown in multiple trials to be a useful treatment for dysplasia. We aimed to determine if atRA-treated dysplastic patients had a higher conversion rate to normal histology (histologic resolution) compared to placebo. 12-week histologic resolution in women treated with atRA was not significantly different from that of women treated with placebo. The rates of histologic regression for women undergoing treatment with atRA were high. The rate of histologic regression in biopsied cervical intraepithelial neoplasia II and III patients over a short time interval emphasizes the importance of having a placebo arm and an adequate sample size. Retinoids have been shown in multiple pilot and phase I and II trials to be a useful treatment for dysplasia. The results of all clinical trials involving the use of retinoids in dysplasia were combined in a meta-analysis. Analysis of the results of this meta-analysis found that women with cervical dysplasia who received retinoid treatment in a randomized clinical trial were significantly more likely to have histologic resolution (RR = 4.6; 99% CI, 2.06-10.48) than those who received no treatment. However, the heterogeneity in the studies ranged from low to high, resulting in a CI of 2.06-10.48, which was still over the threshold of a favorable clinical decision.
This information may be useful to clinicians in decision-making regarding treatment of dysplasia, and may potentially provide valuable information for future treatment strategies."

These large trials provided no evidence that combined chemoradiotherapy resulted in superior survival outcomes than radiotherapy alone. There was also no evidence that chemotherapy could improve locoregional control. Given the lack of evidence for a benefit of combined chemoradiotherapy based on these three studies, we conclude there is insufficient evidence to recommend chemotherapy in this setting, unless alternative interventions are available which are known to be more beneficial. Further research on the optimal adjuvant treatment after surgery for this group of women is needed."

Study #1: In a large, national, managed care-based study of patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, aripiprazole was shown to be an effective and safe maintenance treatment for the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Study #2: In a large sample of hospitalized patients suffering from acute exacerbation of symptoms, aripiprazole has efficacy that is comparable to treatment with both olanzapine and risperidone.
Study #3: In a post-hoc analysis, the comparative cost-effectiveness of olanzapine and aripiprazole for the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia.
Study #4: In a multicenter trial among Chinese patients, aripiprazole showed comparable efficacy and favorable safety and tolerability profiles in the short-term treatment of Chinese patients with acute schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 
Study #5: In a large, randomized, double blind study, aripiprazole was shown to be effective and safe for the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia.
Study #6: A comparison of weight change during treatment with olanzapine and aripiprazole in patients with schizophrenia.
Study #7: In a randomized, double-blind, 4-week study, the efficacy and safety of ziprasidone and aripiprazole in the treatment of acutely ill patients with schizophrenia were compared.
Study #8: Treatment preference of chronically ill patients with schizophrenia for aripiprazole as compared with olanzapine.

Overall, aripiprazole is effective in managing symptoms of schizophrenia, with relatively good tolerability and safety, especially compared with other atypical antipsychotics. Effects on weight and lipids, which are important for long-term cardiovascular health, may also be lower for aripiprazole compared with olanzapine. Aripiprazole thus remains a valuable treatment option for patients with schizophrenia."

The introduction of telephone consultations and triage systems for managing same-day appointments has been explored in several trials; however, no conclusive evidence was provided on the optimal management of requests to see the same-day emergency general practitioner.

The study by Chisholm et al. is the largest trial so far, involving 12.3% of all UK general practitioners. A similar effect size (odds ratio 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.86), albeit in a less rigorous setting, was found in the trial by Dellifraino et al. Although all three other trials showed that general practitioner use was reduced by the use of telephone consultations, the results were not statistically significant in the study by Green et al.

We conclude that GP telephone consultations are likely to reduce GP use by between around 5 and 7 calls or face-to-face consultations per 1000 registered patients per year based on studies we judged to be of very high quality. This reduction in workload, while modest, was similar to that found with practice nurse telephone consultations in both general practice and accident and emergency departments, both of which seem to be likely to decrease patient attendance to general practices and accident and emergency departments over 12 months.."

Among the selected studies, orally administered quinolones were not effective and quinolones should be reserved for the second or third line of treatment of patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. In contrast, other antibiotics (i.e. cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin) were effective when given as first-line antimicrobial treatment in patients with non-complicated cirrhosis who did not have renal dysfunction, regardless of whether patients received antibiotics in the hospital or as outpatient therapy. In most studies, cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were as effective as quinolones in terms of infection resolution and mortality. When cefotaxime and ceftriaxone were given as first-line antimicrobial treatment, orally administered quinolones failed to demonstrate any advantage over cefotaxime and ceftriaxone. The choice of treatment will inevitably depend on the drug and hospital costs and the possibility of outpatient therapy."

Early treatment is a major strategy for reducing the incidence of severe malaria. However, the management of such cases in outlying areas is a problem because the administration of intravenous or intramuscular quinine is often not feasible due to a lack of specific equipment or trained staff. Intrarectal quinine is being used in some parts of the world, and there is no conclusive evidence that its administration leads to systemic or adverse effects. The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of intrarectal with intravenous quinine for the treatment of children with severe malaria.
In a randomized, double-blind trial, 601 children aged between 6 months and 10 years were given 12.5 mg/kg of intrarectal quinine, repeated 12h later. The initial dose of intravenous quinine was 8 mg/kg, repeated every 6h. Follow up included clinical observation and blood sample drawing.
No significant differences were found between the 2 dosing regimens. In the rectal quinine group, the estimated parasite clearance time was 20 h, and fever clearance time and time to recovery of consciousness were not significantly different. Rectal administration was better tolerated by the children.
These data suggest that children in Africa with clinically severe malaria could be successfully treated with intrarectally administered quinine instead of intravenous quinine. This route should be evaluated further in large prospective studies."

Study #1: We found that the fast-track procedure led to significantly better control of postoperative pain, faster restoration of gut functions, and earlier hospital discharge without compromising safety. Patients in the FT group showed significantly faster rehabilitation and shorter hospital stay compared with the non-FT group. There were significantly fewer complications in the fast-track group, and there was no death. The fast-track strategy is safe and effective, and it has the potential to improve postoperative outcomes.

Study #2: Conventional management of major colorectal surgery is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of a multicomponent enhanced recovery programme (ERP), based on the principles of preoperative fitness and fast-track surgery.
                A prospective randomized controlled trial was conducted within 18 general surgical units across the London area.
                During a 12-month period, 188 patients randomized to multicomponent enhanced surgery (MS group) and 182 patients randomized to conventional care (CS group) were included in the study. Outcome measured included morbidity, mortality, postoperative mobilization index, analgesia use, and return to work.
                No significant difference was found between the two groups in mortality (1% MS group, 1% CS group). Morbidity, as defined by at least one medical, surgical, or radiographic problem, was 28% (MS group) and 45% (CS group), p = 0.013. A shorter hospital stay, in hospital (9 days MS group, 12 days CS group), p = 0.0016, and out of hospital (8 days MS group, 10 days CS group), p = 0.0001, was recorded with multicomponent enhanced surgery. These results did not appear to be confounded by comorbidity.

Erythropoietins (EPOs), the hormones that stimulate the production of red blood cells, have long been recognized for their usefulness in patients with cancer-related anemia. Erythropoiesis-Stimulating Agents (ESAs) are synthetic proteins or other drugs that mimic erythropoietins. They help to increase the number of red blood cells in the body. For patients, this means increased energy and activity levels.
Despite these benefits ESA treatment has some potential disadvantages. One disadvantage, for example, is that studies have suggested that in some patients ESAs might be associated with increased risk of blood clots in the veins. In addition, higher than normal levels of ESA during chemotherapy may be linked to reduced treatment effectiveness (i.e. slower tumor shrinkage).
Cancer patients with low hemoglobin levels (e.g., less than 11 grams/deciliter) frequently have impaired performance status (PS) - a measure of overall health - when starting chemotherapy.
The investigators of this study believed that a prospective, randomized study of early, prophylactic ESA initiation prior to chemotherapy might lead to improvements in performance status and the ability of these patients to tolerate subsequent chemotherapy more effectively. Based on the results of the studies on the use of EPOs in patients with cancer-related anemia, the investigators formulated the following hypotheses:
1. Prophylactic use of ESAs in this patient population will improve hemoglobin levels.
2. Prophylactic use of ESAs will reduce the need for blood transfusions.
3. Prophylactic use of ESAs in these anemic patients will improve their performance status as measured on the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) scale.
4. Prophylactic use of ESAs in these anemic patients will improve their ability to tolerate chemotherapy.
5. Prophylactic use of ESAs in these anemic patients will be associated with improved overall survival.
The overall objective of this study was to answer the question of whether a brief treatment period with ESAs given before the patients receive chemotherapy would improve the overall health and future treatment outcomes of these study patients.

Study #1: Use of prophylactic antibiotics reduced the risk of endometriosis-associated pelvic pain. The results of a randomized controlled trial, however, indicate that prophylactic antibiotics did not reduce the risk of pelvic pain or lower abdominal pain.
                The objective of this study was to test the null hypothesis that there is no effect of prophylactic antibiotics on reducing the risk of pelvic pain in women with laparoscopically confirmed endometriosis.
                We conducted a single-center, parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical trial from February 1997 to August 2000. We screened 179 women with endometriosis using a patient-oriented questionnaire. Sixty-five of them were included in the study after having laparoscopic confirmation of endometriosis and after signing a written informed consent. We randomly allocated 33 patients to receive prophylactic doxycycline, 100 mg, twice daily for 6 months, and 32 women to receive a placebo.

To date, there have been 940 abstracts regarding asthma published in a database, and a total of 10 studies evaluating Methotrexate treatment were included for analysis.

Two of the 10 trials found a significant steroid-sparing effect of Methotrexate, and the rest had no significant effect. This difference was probably the result of different dosages and patient populations studied.

It was concluded that the number of steroid-sparing studies was too low to permit a firm judgement on steroid-sparing efficacy of Methotrexate.

The benefit, if any, must be weighed against the complications of Methotrexate.

Based on the available studies, a treatment regimen of 15 mg weekly seems to be an appropriate dosage to evaluate in future studies. However, before a definite recommendation regarding Methotrexate as a steroid-sparing agent can be made, there is a clear need for further studies."

Researchers have tested the effectiveness of several antipsychotic medications in treating schizophrenia. Although a few studies have compared new antipsychotics to placebos, those studies have had methodological limitations (e.g., the placebo comparison groups were given a smaller dose). More rigorous research indicates that the new antipsychotics-olanzapine, risperidone, quetiapine, ziprasidone, and aripiprazole-are effective in treating schizophrenia. Most of these agents have side effects. Many are associated with weight gain and may lead to metabolic syndrome or diabetes. Some are associated with hyperprolactinemia. However, these new antipsychotics generally are associated with less severe extrapyramidal symptoms than typical antipsychotics. They also are better tolerated by patients, leading to less noncompliance and greater social functioning. Overall, these new antipsychotics seem safe and effective. However, these studies were carried out at research facilities, and generalization to routine clinical settings may not be appropriate.

Diarrhoea is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in developing countries. A review of 21 studies assessed the effectiveness of 33 interventions on diarrhoea control in low-income settings. The pooled effect estimate per study is 28% [95% confidence interval 21-36]. However, this estimate masks important variations in effects among the interventions, with some showing little to no effect. The pooled estimate can be used cautiously to inform policymakers and donors when assessing the efficacy of interventions for which there is limited research evidence. Most of the interventions in this review improved water quality in children's households and promoted hand washing or other hygiene practices in people's homes. These types of interventions are more likely to be effective because they target the domestic environment where diarrhoea is most commonly acquired. Based on the evidence we identified, there are several strategies that potentially can reduce diarrhoea rates. These are: a) safe water storage or treatment, b) good hygiene, including frequent hand washing, and c) improved sanitation. Further research is needed to validate these strategies so that recommendations can be made to governments and donors."

Tobacco marketing is one of the strongest predictors of smoking initiation among adolescents. The marketing of cigarettes to young people, via both print and television advertising that targets youth, has been documented as a significant risk factor. Studies of the relationship between tobacco marketing and youth smoking have identified a clear association. Cigarette advertising significantly impacts teenagers' brand loyalty to tobacco companies even before the onset of smoking. Tobacco marketing and promotions have a strong influence on youth initiation to smoking. Teenagers exposed to tobacco products and marketing who own items such as lighters and clothes, or are willing to use tobacco items are at a higher risk of beginning to smoke. The more a teenager is exposed to tobacco products and the greater the degree of receptivity to this exposure, the more likely that teenagers are to experiment with smoking. Further longitudinal studies are needed to investigate the potential long-term negative effects of tobacco marketing on health related behaviours, and the potential positive effects on health behaviours that may result from eliminating tobacco marketing.

The negative health consequences of tobacco marketing are well-documented. The marketing of cigarettes to children and adolescents has reached such a level that some governments and health authorities have put programs, advertisements, and other communication efforts in place that strongly emphasize the health risks and consequences of tobacco use. These efforts have shown success, however greater emphasis and focus are still needed to prevent young people from starting to smoke. Research has also shown that exposure to tobacco marketing in childhood and adolescence is associated with an increased risk of smoking in adulthood. This is even true for individuals who do not start smoking until they are adults. Exposure to tobacco marketing during youth years is a powerful and enduring influence on a person's smoking behavior.

The promotion of tobacco products and marketing should be stopped, especially for those who have the largest influence on adolescents and their risky behaviors such as tobacco marketing in billboard and print media, on radio, in television advertisements. Governments need to play an active role to prevent tobacco marketing, and to strongly focus on the negative health consequences of tobacco use and encourage healthy lifestyle choices. Tobacco marketing needs to be minimized or eliminated from children and teenagers' lives to reduce the risk of them beginning to smoke, and to educate them on the negative consequences associated with smoking.

Exercise is a crucial component in the treatment of Parkinson´s disease (PD). Treadmill walking is a well-established exercise method but it has many limitations such as falls risk (from loss of postural stability) and decreases in speed with prolonged and excessive repetitive training sessions. In the context of this research program, the investigators are examining the effectiveness of a modified form of treadmill training called the incremental speed-dependent treadmill training (S-DTT) in individuals with PD. S-DTT aims at reaching the maximal tolerated treadmill velocity by walking at different velocities, that are faster than overground (OG) speed, and by walking in different directions while facing various directions in a safe environment with body weight support (BWSTT) and in the presence of physical therapist (PT). The investigators are conducting pilot studies to determine the feasibility and tolerability of S-DTT in the PD population and the effect of S-DTT on gait, balance and fear of falling."

Currently there is little evidence as to which chest physiotherapy (CPT) method can be recommended as the most effective and best tolerated by patients. The aim of the study was to compare effects of three different CPT regimens (postural drainage (PD), positive expiratory pressure (PEP)-mask and high-frequency chest compression (HFCC)) on sputum production in patients with cystic fibrosis hospitalized for an acute pulmonary exacerbation. There were no significant differences between the three CPT regimens for both wet and dry weights of sputum, nor for any of the other variables studied, when the number of coughs was taken into account. We conclude that both PD or PEP when combined with FET have similar effect on short-term sputum production and that the patient's subjective tolerance was the most important factor for choice of treatment."

Overall, the evidence suggests that psychoeducation may offer some benefits in reducing relapse rates in bipolar disorder, particularly in people with fewer previous episodes. However, the effects are small and the quality of the evidence is low. There is not enough evidence from trials to say whether there are any differences between different types of psychoeducation or between individual and group format. Psychoeducation is unlikely to replace the need for medication, and may work best alongside it."

The main findings from the provided abstracts are: 

1. Provider-initiated HIV counseling and testing increased the proportion of adult TB patients who received HIV counseling and testing but the magnitude of the effect was small.
2. The vertical program (opt-out) showed a greater impact on knowledge of family planning, followed by knowledge of family planning among younger women, and family size preferences. Neither the vertical nor the integrated FP/MCH programs showed an impact on current use or ever use of family planning.
3. PITC was successful in three ways: it increased the proportion of new STI patients tested for HIV; it increased the proportion of new STI patients offered HIV testing, and it delivered more consistent performance across clinics.
4. STD services for women at truck stop in Tanzania showed that women were generally satisfied with all approaches that included the provision of drugs, especially when conducted by a well-trained and motivated peer educator.
5. Integrated peer education, condom distribution, and syndromic STI management did not reduce population-level HIV-1 incidence in a declining epidemic, despite reducing HIV-1 incidence in the immediate male target group.
6. Contraception among HIV concordant and discordant couples in Zambia showed that there was a 3-fold higher contraceptive initiation rate in both intervention arms compared with the control arm, which was mostly attributed to the low-barrier contraception (i.e., injectables).
7. The use of an unobtrusive referral message that linked family planning and the Expanded Program of Immunizations (EPI) services was tested in an operations research study in Togo and this had a significant and dramatic impact on family planning services in a relatively short time, resulting in an 18-percent increase in awareness of available family planning services and an increase in the average monthly number of new family planning clients of 54 percent."

The data suggest there may be benefit compared with standard therapy with respect to mortality in patients with severe ARDS undergoing long term high dose inhaled nitric oxide therapy. Other potential benefits including improvement in lung mechanics (increased FRC), reversal of shunt, and reduction in ventilatory support for patients with severe ARDS are not yet fully established.. Long-term inhaled nitric oxide may provide benefit in patients with severe ARDS. We observed a statistically and clinically significant improvement in lung mechanics and oxygenation with regard to FRC and oxygenation when compared with standard therapy, as well as a trend toward reduction in ventilator requirements for patients receiving long term inhaled nitric oxide that did not reach statistical significance. It has not been established whether reduced FRC and persistent hypoxaemia is a result of ventilator induced lung injury or lung disease exacerbated by the pathophysiological effects of ARDS. The possibility that the beneficial effects of prolonged inhaled nitric oxide on FRC, oxygenation, and need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation were due to lung protective ventilator protocols designed to maximally apply these factors needs examination.. Prolonged inhaled nitric oxide therapy of patients with severe ARDS may have a significant benefit with regard to improvement in lung mechanics, oxygenation, and duration of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation..
Inhaled nitric oxide showed a trend toward improving mortality in critically ill patients, including those with ARDS, and a significant benefit of inhaled nitric oxide therapy in patients with severe ARDS was observed. These results were based on results from an analysis of patients with ALI from multicentre clinical trials. These results were not statistically significant based on a single clinical trial and therefore further research is needed. It is suggested that long-term inhaled nitric oxide therapy might represent an important therapy for patients with severe ARDS in whom their ventilatory management could lead to overdistension and/or atelectrauma..

The present randomized trials on mammography screening have so far given evidence mainly to support the hypothesis that screening reduces breast cancer mortality (RR ranged from 20% to 36%). There are, however, several uncertainties, related mainly to the duration of follow-up, the possible differences in mortality decrease according to age and the optimal interval for follow-up.
The current evidence does not support that for women in their forties, mammographic screening for breast cancer reduces long-term mortality. The available data showed heterogeneity in findings; they could not rule out the possibility of a modest reduction in mortality in women aged 50-59. Further research based on larger randomized trials and longer follow-up is needed.
Studies of breast cancer screening programs in North America have tended to show little or no impact of screening on mortality. No randomized, controlled trials of mammography screening are currently being conducted in North America. Based on the evidence reviewed in this report, the screening committee concluded that the present recommendations for mammography screening in Sweden are to continue the use of the current invitation criteria, to continue the 2-year screening interval for the age group 50 and over and that no changes are to be made in the screening program for women 40-49 years of age."

Hypertonic saline and isotonic fluid have shown efficacy in preventing post-spinal anaesthesia hypotension, and intraperitoneal hypotension in patients undergoing laparoscopic surgeries. Intravenous fluid challenges in order to rapidly increase arterial pressure, however, are of limited benefit in blunting the hemodynamic response to post-spinal anaesthesia hypotension. However, hypertonic saline may be administered to facilitate intravenous fluid challenges and pre-load, if required, and should be performed with caution in patients without arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure."

Overall, the results of these eight studies suggest that computer-assisted instruction (CAI) and interactive videos have positive effects on HIV/AIDS preventive behaviors and knowledge, but the effects of these interventions vary by study sample and intervention type. For example, one study found that CAI, but not interactive video, improved sexually transmitted disease (STD)-related risk behaviors among rural men who have sex with men. Another study found that CAI and interactive video increased HIV/AIDS knowledge among early adolescent females. Both of these interventions have been found to be effective in improving specific HIV/AIDS preventive behaviors such as condom availability and safer sex negotiation skills.

However, the effects of these interventions have not been consistently replicated across all study samples. For example, one study found that CAI, but not interactive video, improved HIV/AIDS knowledge among urban and suburban college students, while another study found that neither CAI nor interactive video were effective in improving these outcomes among urban-dwelling adolescents.

In addition, the sustained impact of these interventions over time is not well established. For example, one study found that the benefits of a computer-assisted HIV/AIDS education program faded over a 5-week period, while another study found that the effects of interactive video on STD knowledge were maintained over a 6-month period.

Further research is needed to identify the most effective computer-assisted interventions for improving HIV/AIDS knowledge and preventive behaviors among different populations of adolescents and young adults. Moreover, future studies should examine the long-term impact of these interventions to determine whether the benefits endure over time."

In addition to primary and secondary prevention, many people are diagnosed with cancer every year. Chemotherapy has become the standard first-line, systemic treatment for most people with cancer. While chemotherapy can be effective in treating cancer, often it only provides temporary relief of disease symptoms and patients relapse as cancer returns. Immunotherapies, on the other hand, target cancer cells by activating the body's own immune system to mount a defense against cancer, potentially providing longer-term remission for some people. Research and clinical trials to develop immunotherapy treatments that build on the body's own immune system to help fight cancer are ongoing. Based on the results of these clinical trials, immune-based treatments are already approved for the treatment of some types of cancer, and new immunotherapy approaches are being tested as safe, effective alternatives to traditional chemotherapy treatments."

The present review and meta-analysis aim to systematically evaluate the current clinical trials on the efficacy and safety of immediate implant loading in periodontally compromised sites. The inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials in which at least eight participants were treated in periodontal compromised sites with immediate loading after implant placement. The main outcome was the presence of peri-implantitis around implants loaded immediately after the implant placement. The risk of bias was analyzed by means of the Cochrane Collaborative Tool. Four studies were eligible for the review but only two studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. The meta-analysis showed that immediate loading in periodontally compromised sites slightly reduces the risk of peri-implantitis. A moderate risk of bias was detected. Further high-quality studies are necessary to confirm the findings of the current review and meta-analysis."

Cognitive dysfunction affects many patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and is associated with impaired quality of life, increased disability and work status. Several studies have been published on the effect of cognitive training but many did not include a placebo control or were uncontrolled. In 2009 two systematic reviews concluded that cognitive training effects were not robust but were promising. We here report the results from a placebo-controlled, randomized, controlled study of cognitive remediation training. Forty-four patients with early MS symptoms were randomised into an intervention group (IG) and a placebo group (PG) and treated by a computer based memory, attention and problem solving training programme. Primary outcome was a neuropsychological test battery, and secondary outcome was a self-reported measure of subjective cognitive status, depression status and quality of life (QoL). The participants in the active condition showed significant improvement in attention and information processing, verbal and numerical learning. The positive effects on the performance based neuropsychological outcomes were not seen in the primary and secondary subjective outcome measures. The study failed to show any effect of cognitive rehabilitation training in MS patients on the overall self- rated assessment, but we could conclude that specific cognitive training programmes may have a promising effect on cognitive domain functioning."

Research Question: Can anticoagulants prevent placental-mediated complications in women who suffered from previous complications but do not have thrombophilia?

Intervention / Treatment: Dalteparin (a low-molecular-weight heparin)

Study type: Interventional

Phase: Not Applicable

Design Details: The allocation was randomised and the intervention model a parallel assignment.

Results: There were no significant differences in primary and secondary outcomes between the study and control groups, except for a lower rate of the composite of one or more of: severe pre-eclampsia, newborn weight <or= 5th percentile or major abruptio placentae in the dalteparin group.

Study #5: Lowe-dose aspirin for early and late pre-eclampsia or its prevention: a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial.. Low-dose prophylactic treatment with aspirin is beneficial for the prevention of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. The effect of low-dose aspirin in the prevention of pre-eclampsia has not been shown in randomised double-blind trials. We investigated whether early low-dose aspirin use for women at risk of pre-eclampsia reduces its incidence and related vascular disease.
                Women who were at increased risk of pre-eclampsia (n = 354) were studied in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial before 22 weeks of gestation. Participants had been classified as being at increased risk of pre-eclampsia and the main groups were those of African-American descent, multiple pregnancy, BMI >or= 30 kg/m(2), and previous pre-eclampsia or family history of pre-eclampsia.

Cocaine dependence (n=39) with antisocial personality disorder: There was some evidence that the use of desipramine, but not amantadine, improved cocaine retention and decreased craving and use. However, both placebo and desipramine-treated groups continued to use cocaine during both the placebo and desipramine conditions.

Smoking prevalence in individuals with schizophrenia is higher than the general population. Evidence suggests that smoking may serve as an antipsychotic, with higher smoking rates found in antipsychotic-treated individuals who have discontinued smoking. Many studies have reported on the efficacy of NRT but are plagued with methodological problems related to small sample sizes, high attrition rates, and lack of control groups. 
The research to date has not demonstrated a significant benefit of smoking cessation treatment beyond that of NRT alone, but has not included treatment with bupropion alone. Thus, there is a need for further studies to test the efficacy of combination treatments in this population. 
Increased relapses following the discontinuation of bupropion or varenicline were the most common drawback to these medications, particularly in those who were heavy smokers. Overall, long-term studies assessing the safety and effectiveness of NRT and pharmacotherapy combination and the sustainability of smoking cessation in this population are needed."

Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of olanzapine in the treatment of acute mania. While olanzapine may not be superior to divalproex in terms of efficacy, it is associated with a greater likelihood of response (more than 50% reduction in Young Mania Rating Scale scores). Olanzapine is generally well tolerated. In most patients, the adverse effects of olanzapine do not limit its use. Olanzapine monotherapy may be effective in reducing manic symptoms in patients who do not respond to lithium or valproate therapy. Combining olanzapine with lithium or valproate provides superior efficacy for the treatment of mixed states compared with lithium or valproate alone in patients with moderate to severe depressive symptoms.

Compliance with medical treatments is a central issue for patients' health. Several approaches have been developed to improve it, among them contracts, which aim to establish verbal or written agreements between patients and health providers. Several studies have examined how contracts can help patients with tuberculosis, high blood pressure, drug dependency, diabetes, and respiratory illnesses to adhere to medical treatments. The results are encouraging but they should be interpreted with caution because not all studies have reported a positive outcome.
Contracts seem to be more effective for short-term treatments than for long-term ones. They also appear to be more effective when they address a specific problem and when they involve a small number of people with similar issues. However, more research is needed in order for us to understand what type of contracts are most effective and how they should be implemented in clinical practice. On the other hand, the effectiveness of more recent techniques such as behaviour modification, positive practice, self-efficacy and peer support should also be examined before being used as the standard procedures in the health systems.
In conclusion, based on a number of reliable studies that have examined the use of medical contracts, it is recommended that further, large-scale and long-term studies need to be conducted, to determine whether they can be of value in the context of all chronic conditions."

Both pre- and post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy decreases quality of life in renal transplant recipients while post-transplant immunosuppressive therapy also increases risk of long-term complications. A multicentre, double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted on 333 adult patients who had received a renal transplant between 6 months and 20 years before. Each subject filled in two Visual Analogue Scales, one for itch intensity and another for the perceived effect of itch. Subjects also completed two questionnaires: the Medical Outcome Study short form (SF-36), which measures quality of life, and the Short Form Health Survey (SF-12), which measures the perceived effect of health on quality of life. We performed an analysis of covariance, correcting for baseline values, and also an intention to treat analysis. Itch intensity fell 39% in response to gabapentin (P<0.05) although patients taking placebo also showed a small but significant improvement (31%, P<0.05). The effect of gabapentin on a composite score of both intensity and interference was also significant (P<0.05). There was no effect of gabapentin on the two health surveys. The side effects associated with gabapentin generally disappeared quickly; the overall profile suggests that the risk-benefit balance of using gabapentin in this group of patients is likely to be favourable. The efficacy of other antidepressant medications or gabapentin at higher doses for the management of itch in renal transplant patients warrants further investigation.."

Based on the studies reviewed, there is evidence that starting high dose exogenous FSH with or without GnRH antagonist before menses in poor responders with cancelled previous cycles results in higher number of oocytes retrieved, more embryos transferred and higher ongoing pregnancy rates compared to the conventional protocol with the use of GnRH agonist. Early cessation of GnRH agonist after menses may offer some benefits including higher number of oocytes retrieved, reduced doses of gonadotrophins and lower cancellation rates. Studies with larger sample sizes and trials directly comparing antagonist protocol and agonist/flare protocol may help to strengthen the available evidence.

Gastric fluid volume and pH did not differ among the three (water, refreshing drink, control) groups in this randomised prospective study from the hospital of a naval medical institution. There were also no significant differences in the volume and pH of gastric fluid in 45 patients fasted for 6 hours who received 100 ml of water 2 h before surgery compared with those who received no water. Therefore, the present study confirms the safety of 100 ml of water preoperatively in patients who have fasted for several hours.."

Combining radiotherapy with hyperthermia at 42-43 degrees C produced higher local tumour response rates and improved local control as determined by complete and partial response rates in patients with various pelvic tumour sites, as compared to radiotherapy alone. The addition of hyperthermia seemed to be most important for cervical cancer, for which the complete response rate was 83% in the radiotherapy plus hyperthermia group compared to 57% after radiotherapy alone. In addition, thermotherapy improved quality of life for patients under terminal care. Although side effects such as fatty induration, pain during treatment, and burn were observed in some patients, the treatment regimen was considered safe and tolerable. However, more clinical studies are needed in larger numbers of patients with different tumour sites before practical recommendations can be made for the use of hyperthermia in combination with radiotherapy for the treatment of advanced solid tumours."

Scleral penetrating keratotomy (PK) and excimer laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) represent the two principal surgical methods for the correction of myopia. These two surgical methods were compared in eyes with moderate to high myopia (-6 to -12 D).
                The results for both LASIK and PK have been reported to be safe and effective in refracting errors within a maximum range of -6 to +2 D. However, the results of LASIK and PK in myopia exceeding +6 D have been shown to be less predictable and safe. Both surgical methods have been shown to cause complications such as corneal ectasia or irregular astigmatism.
                One year after surgery, there was no clinically significant difference in either UCVA (logMAR 0.29, SD 0.27) or BSCVA (logMAR 0.06, SD 0.24) between two eyes that had been randomized for treatment with either PK or LASIK. Astigmatic correction using PK to correct for a range of myopia did not have statistical significance compared with LASIK results.
                Surgical complications were seen in one of twenty-five eyes (4.0%) after PK and in one of twenty-six eyes (3.8%) after LASIK.
                Excimer laser surgery provides better visual acuity and refractive predictability in eyes with refractive power greater than +6 D. PK provides better visual acuity and more predictable refractive outcomes in treating eyes with greater than 6 D of hyperopia..

Adalimumab, certolizumab pegol, infliximab, and CDP571 have all been studied extensively in patients with Crohn's disease. The results show that these TNF inhibitors are effective for maintaining or inducing clinical remission, and in some cases also for inducing steroid-sparing effects. The side effect profile of these medications is generally well tolerated, with no major new safety concerns observed in the studies. Adalimumab and infliximab in particular have well-established profiles demonstrating their safety and efficacy in this patient population.

The review of the available literature on the use of penfluridol in the management of chronic schizophrenia revealed a number of positive findings for this compound. While most studies were supportive of the use of penfluridol as an aid in the management of psychotic patients in various stages of the illness, one study was unable to differentiate penfluridol from placebo in the treatment of chronic schizophrenic patients. However, even in this trial, there seemed to be a mild benefit for penfluridol over placebo. The low incidence of side effects and signs of toxicity, coupled with a relatively high level of patient compliance and the development of long-lasting clinical improvement are all important factors to be considered in the selection of long-acting oral neuroleptics in the management of schizophrenia. Based on the positive evidence for penfluridol, investigators were encouraged to make further studies in order to confirm the results found in the previous studies and to conduct some comparisons with other long-acting oral neuroleptics."

Melioidosis (Burkholderia pseudomallei) is a bacterial disease that is difficult to treat. B. pseudomallei is widely distributed in the environment in tropical Asia and northern Australia, and it is the cause of an endemic disease in these areas. The infection usually occurs in individuals of middle age or older who have underlying conditions, such as diabetes, chronic alcoholism, or renal dysfunction.
Drugs commonly used for melioidosis treatment include antibiotics such as ceftazidime, co-trimoxazole, or ciprofloxacin, and some of their combinations. The treatment usually lasts for 6-12 months or more. The current review did not identify other relevant or recent trials. The treatments used in these trials were not proven to be more effective than standard treatment in reducing illness or mortality. Some trials, such as those comparing the effectiveness of chloramphenicol with other drugs, had small numbers and may not have found any difference in mortality.
The results show that most studies of the treatment of melioidosis have been of poor quality and did not detect statistically significant differences in mortality between different regimens. These trials are limited by their small numbers, low statistical power, and short duration. They do not provide adequate evidence to establish a preferred regimen for the treatment of this illness. To address this evidence gap, a properly designed study is needed. The authors are currently planning a large study to evaluate ceftazidime or trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole with or without combination antimicrobials for the treatment of melioidosis.

Acute rhinosinusitis (ARS) is a common condition, occurring in around 10% of the population worldwide each year. It manifests with inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses resulting in obstructive nasal symptoms, facial pain and pressure, reduced olfaction, and purulent discharge from the nose. Clinical manifestations and diagnosis are based on the patient's medical history and physical examination.

Studies have not reached solid conclusions about the added benefit of antibiotic therapy to symptomatic treatment. Moreover, ARS has also been found to improve spontaneously over time.

In acute ARS antibiotic therapy is frequently used, although there is little evidence for such treatment. As antibiotic resistance is emerging and antibiotic prescribing is a major driving force, the use of antibiotics in infections with uncertain clinical benefit becomes a major public health concern.

In the absence of clear clinical benefit, the use of placebo controlled randomised clinical trials (RCTs) to assess the effect of antibiotics, and whether symptomatic treatment alone is effective, is a requirement.

The aim of the current study is, therefore, to assess the effect of adding an antibiotic to symptomatic treatment in adults with acute rhinosinusitis."

Overall, the evidence for combination treatment for late-stage African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) with T.b. gambiense is limited but promising. The efficacy of eflornithine combined with either nifurtimox or pentamidine is non-inferior to the standard regimen of eflornithine alone and seems to be better tolerated. As treatment options for HAT are limited, and there is a risk of developing resistance to standard treatment, there is an urgent need for a large-scale clinical evaluation of these regimens through randomized controlled trials."

Preventing and treating tobacco use is critical to improve youth health and wellbeing. Youth are especially susceptible to smoking because they often start in their teenage years when they are more likely to become addicted to smoking. However, quitting is particularly difficult for youth because smoking is often deeply ingrained and associated with positive images and experiences that are challenging to break. Furthermore, youth smoking is often associated with peer influences, which makes it difficult to quit on their own. Thus, youth smoking interventions need to be designed to effectively address the unique challenges youth face while striving to quit.
One promising strategy to reducing youth smoking is by developing and testing interventions that integrate evidence-based behaviors change techniques. To improve the quality of future youth smoking interventions, we need to continue to conduct robust evaluations and refine youth smoking interventions.
The literature reviewed in this summary offers a number of promising interventions to effectively reduce youth smoking. However, there are certain aspects of these interventions that still need to be addressed. Some studies have reported small to moderate changes in smoking rates among participants, while others have failed to demonstrate any significant effects. These studies, while methodologically robust, also have limitations. Many studies have either small sample sizes or limited participant retention rates, which may explain their less persuasive results. Some studies did not test experimental therapies on adequate control groups and others failed to measure treatment effects using biochemically validated cessation rates.
Furthermore, none of the studies reviewed in this summary conducted any follow-up assessments beyond six months. Therefore, we still need to conduct rigorous evaluations that investigate the long-term effects of these interventions on youth smoking cessation.
Another key component in smoking interventions is the inclusion of the right mix of therapeutic strategies. While many of the studies reviewed in this summary employed a variety of engaging and interactive therapeutic approaches, there are still additional strategies that can be explored to make interventions more attractive and successful among youth.
As more research is conducted to develop and test effective and appealing strategies to treat youth smoking, it is evident that combining evidence-based techniques with innovative and engaging strategies are crucial to designing effective youth smoking interventions."

The results show that natural drying is not better than antiseptic methods used in hospital nurseries. The incidences of neonatal septic death and clinical early onset sepsis are comparable. The main conclusion from the review is that antiseptic solutions were effective but not superior in providing cord care compared to natural drying. However, the results of the review are based on small numbers, and the review was conducted using the most modern techniques. In view of these factors, the review authors recommend that antiseptic cord care using 70% alcohol or triclosan solution should be recommended in neonatal hospital wards."

Based on the provided abstracts, the primary differences between PTCA and surgical treatment (CABG) are in the need for additional revascularization procedures and the cost of the treatment. The short- and medium-term clinical outcomes (including death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) are similar for both treatment strategies. Some studies demonstrate a non-significant increase in the need for revascularization procedures in the PTCA group, while others did not find a significant difference. The absolute risk of adverse events (eg, death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) is approximately 10% higher in the surgical group at 1 year, but this difference is no longer present after 3 years. The absolute cost of the surgical procedure is in the range of $2000-$2500 more per patient than PTCA at 1 year and about $1000-$1500 more at 3 years. The relative cost of the surgical procedure compared with the treatment cost in the PTCA group remains at about $1000-$2000 per patient at 3 years. Some studies suggest that PCI may be more cost-effective in patients with isolated high-grade lesion of the proximal LAD, while in patients with an angiographic lesion involving the left main coronary artery or three-vessel disease, the percutaneous treatment may result in considerably higher costs due to an increased need for additional revascularization procedures and repeat interventions."

Current evidence does not support the routine administration of magnesium sulphate during labour, or to prevent preterm birth, because of lack of evidence of benefit and the potential for harm. In women with an increased risk of developing eclampsia, magnesium sulphate should be given prophylactically for seizure prevention.

Future work should focus on whether it is safe to limit magnesium sulphate treatment to patients with an elevated risk of seizure."

There is compelling evidence that intensive early intervention programmes may significantly and positively contribute to the developmental trajectory of very low birth weight infants. The results presented in this review suggest that even low level forms of intervention, provided in a community based setting, may lead to statistically and clinically significant positive effects. These outcomes are likely the result of providing stimulation at a critical period in development. Early interventions that begin shortly after birth therefore appear to be important in preventing later cognitive and language impairment, and should be encouraged. However, the magnitude of the effects in any given study have been modest and the long-term effects remain uncertain. In addition, important risk and protective factors related to child, family and community characteristics likely influence intervention efficacy. Future research needs to address these questions to better understand the mechanisms that underlie early intervention successes and to develop evidence-based early intervention programmes for high risk children."

Studies vary widely in their methods and results. Most studies compare commonly used oral analgesics in various doses with placebo and report on a variety of efficacy variables, primarily peak pain relief and total relief up to the last observation after treatment. None found sufficient pain relief from a single dose of an aspirin-containing or an acetaminophen-containing combination for more than 6 hours. For the most part, the analgesic activity of all analgesics tested appeared to persist for at least 6 but usually no more than 8 hours after taking a single dose. This period exceeded the time for which the analgesic effect of aspirin, alone or combined with codeine, has been reported to persist in the United States..

The majority of studies were double-blind. Because none of the analgesics tested was found to be consistently superior to placebo when using a large enough sample size, the authors of a few randomized controlled trials (such as the present study) decided that this method of evaluating analgesic efficacy was insufficient and recommended the addition of further measures, such as dose-escalating protocols or assessment during the first 24-48 hours after surgery using area-under-the-curve and other derived measures. Further research is needed to better define the clinical effectiveness of currently available analgesics and to establish efficacy and therapeutic indices for individual medications and different patient populations.."

Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the foundation of asthma treatment. Ciclesonide is a new-generation, onset-activated ICS. At equivalent doses, ciclesonide is similar in efficacy and safety to other ICS. In adults, ciclesonide 80 and 160 microg given once a day has been shown to be as effective as twice-daily doses of older-generation ICS, such as beclomethasone dipropionate, budesonide, and fluticasone. In adolescents, it has been shown to be as effective as budesonide. The efficacy of ciclesonide 160 microg given once a day in children aged 5 to 11 years with mild stable to moderate persistent asthma was similar to that of budesonide 200 microg given twice a day. In children aged 2 to 5 years with moderate persistent asthma, ciclesonide 80 microg given once a day has been shown to have less anti-inflammatory effect (increased serum immunoglobulin E) than budesonide 200 microg given twice a day. In patients with more severe forms of moderate or more severe persistent asthma, or in subjects with high exposure to house dust mite (HDM), ciclesonide 160 microg given once a day has been shown to be equally effective as 400 microg of budesonide or fluticasone. Ciclesonide 160 microg given once a day is also as effective as montelukast 10 mg given once a day in children with moderate persistent asthma. One important advantage of ciclesonide is the improved tolerability of ciclesonide compared to older-generation ICS at equivalent or lower doses. In both adults and children, the incidence of candida-related (thrush-related) safety concerns was significantly less in those treated with ciclesonide than in those treated with older-generation ICS. Ciclesonide 160 microg given once a day is as effective as fluticasone 1000 microg given twice a day in improving asthma symptoms and"

Despite the potential benefits of influenza vaccination for older persons residing in long-term care settings, the uptake of vaccination has been low in some countries and areas.
               Six randomised controlled trials found convincing evidence that vaccination of staff was associated with reduction in deaths among residents in long-term care. Further three randomised controlled trials found evidence of vaccine effects in elderly people residing in institutions or in the community. We conclude that there is strong evidence that influenza vaccination of health care workers in long-term care is an effective measure in the prevention of severe influenza in institutionalised older people. There is also evidence that influenza vaccination reduces mortality among elderly people in the community.
               More research is needed to identify who the most vulnerable elderly persons are, to ensure that those groups, and the staff who are looking after them, get maximum benefit from vaccination. It is also necessary to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of health care workers as a public health measure. Research is needed to see if the benefit of immunisation of staff extends beyond vaccination. Vaccination policies in different countries should be evaluated against their potential for reducing health care use and overall illness in elderly people in long-term care."

Contrary to longstanding conventional wisdom that suggests the presence of detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD) immediately after undergoing a prostatectomy, recent evidence has suggested the role of intrinsic sphincter deficiency (ISD) as the predominant cause of this condition. However, very little is known about the natural course of postprostatectomy continence recovery, and whether there is any role for physiotherapy or pelvic floor rehabilitation.

We designed this pilot study to determine whether pre- and early post-operative pelvic floor muscle exercise and physiotherapy, in conjunction with patient education, improves the return to continence in men with prostate cancer scheduled to undergo a radical prostatectomy. 

Thirty men were randomly assigned to a control or treatment group. The treatment group received eight pre-operative physiotherapy consultations, four immediate post-operative consultations and five follow-up consultations. Both groups underwent a two-year continence and pelvic floor muscle function evaluation.

Five patients in the treatment group and four in the control group regained continence by 4 weeks. Continence rates were 63% and 50% by three months and two years for treatment and control, respectively.

At 3 months postoperatively, continence rates were significantly (p<0.001) better for the treatment group. The results were not statistically significantly different at 2 years after prostatectomy.

Based on preliminary results, it seems that pre- and early post-operative pelvic floor muscle training can improve the continence rate at 3 months post-operatively. However, further studies are required to determine whether post-operative complications can be adequately reduced to justify the use of pre- and early post-operative pelvic floor muscle training.."

Currently, the best treatment for P. falciparum malaria is a combination of two drugs, with artemisinin injections replacing the older drug, quinine. The study found that all patients were cured. However, two regimens were still failing in some individuals. Primaquine, when given with one of these regimes, appeared to make this combination therapy more effective against the parasites that cause the disease and reduce the chances of malaria being transmitted from the patient to others. Adding primaquine also appeared to reduce the risk of the parasite developing resistance to its drugs.
The gametocytes that cause transmission of malaria to mosquitoes were found to be sensitive to primaquine, which also reduced the number of patients who re-developed a parasite infection. However, primaquine appears to cause anaemia in some individuals, so the World Health Organization is reviewing the safety of using primaquine with each malaria cure, and has recommended more widespread and careful testing of this drug."

Several clinical trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of weight loss and reduced sodium intake, individually and in combination, in lowering blood pressure and reducing the risk of hypertension. Moreover, a recently published meta-analysis has shown that for every 80 mmol/24 h reduction in sodium intake, blood pressure is reduced by 2.4/1.0 mm Hg, and for every 10% body weight reduction, blood pressure is reduced by 1.0/0.6 mm Hg. However, evidence on the long-term benefits of sodium-reduction or weight-loss interventions is limited. Although weight loss and reduced sodium intake are effective ways to prevent hypertension among overweight adults with normal blood pressure, the long-term effects on blood pressure and cardiovascular disease incidence have not been well-documented.
