0,"[/INST] The studies included in this summary have shown that the use of alteplase, a thrombolytic agent, can effectively restore patency to occluded central venous access devices (CVADs). Several studies have investigated various dosages and time intervals for the use of alteplase in restoring patency to CVADs. One study randomized 150 patients with thrombosed CVADs to receive either 2 mg alteplase, 1 mg alteplase, or placebo . The results showed that the alteplase was more effective in re-establishing patency than placebo, and there were no significant differences between the two doses. Another study compared the efficacy of 2 mg of alteplase to that of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) at a dose of 1 mg/mL in restoring patency to CVADs . The study included 149 patients, with 74 receiving alteplase first and 75 receiving rt-PA first. The study found that the alteplase was more effective in restoring patency than rt-PA, with 74% restored patency in the alteplase group compared to 17% in the rt-PA group. A study compared the efficacy of either a single dose of alteplase at 2 mg or 2 mg of alteplase at two time points between 2 and 48 h . A total of 171 patients were included in the study, which showed that a single dose of alteplase at 2 mg had a 70% success rate, and two doses of alteplase at 2 mg had a 75% success rate. The study resulted in 97.1% of patients regaining patency by 3 days after treatment. These studies demonstrate that alteplase can be used to effectively reestablish patency in thrombosed CVADs, and its dosage can vary depending on the type and location of the occlusion."

2,"[/INST] The present meta-analysis included 8 RCTs (total 2387 patients) to evaluate the comparative efficacy of sodium reduction on systolic blood pressure. The findings indicated low-salt diet was associated with elevated levels of systolic blood pressure without significant effect on the change of systolic blood pressure (WMD = 0.75 mm Hg, 95% CI, −0.42 to 2.24; P = 0.21; I2 = 72%). Sensitivity analysis did not change the results. Therefore, the evidence provided no significant evidence for the effectiveness of low-salt diet in the management of systolic blood pressure. As systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure are often co-occurred, low-salt diet may not apply to all hypertensive patients. This study demonstrated that the combined intervention in diet and physical activity (exercise) is effective for reducing the SBP of patients with hypertension, but it neither reduces TC nor reduces the DBP effectively. In addition, in this study, we summarized the six RCTs that investigated diet, exercise, weight loss, and sodium reduction to improve the prognosis of hypertensive patients. Evidence from this study found that these nutritional interventions are beneficial to reduce the blood pressure of hypertensive patients. However, the results of this study are only applicable to individuals who are overweight or obese. Among the seven trials included in this study, there were only two trials that investigated diet, exercise, weight loss, and sodium reduction combined, which resulted in a long-term decrease in the proportion of people with hypertension in the population. On the other hand, it may also indicate that these interventions could not effectively improve the prognosis of hypertensive patients."

6,"[/INST] Combined, the eight studies suggest that quinolones can be effective in the treatment of osteomyelitis. Study #2  found that ciprofloxacin was as effective as standard parenteral therapy in nonprosthesis osteomyelitis and was found to be effective in two other studies [Study #1 (in prosthesis osteomyelitis)  and #8 (comparing oral ciprofloxacin with parenteral antibiotics in osteomyelitis)] but not as effective as standard parenteral therapy when looking specifically at polymicrobial osteomyelitis . Study #7  found that ceftazidime was less effective than a combination of tobramycin and ticarcillin in cases of gram-negative osteomyelitis but did not find any significant side effects. Study #8  demonstrated the inferiority of ofloxacin compared to a combination of imipenem and cilastatin in the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis. Studies #6 , #3 , and #1  demonstrated the effectiveness of three different quinolones (levofloxain/lomefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ofloxacin) in osteomyelitis treatment. Study #5  recommended that rifampin be added to the antimicrobial regimen for chronic staphylococcal osteomyelitis."

9,"[/INST] The five clinical studies summarized in this brief provide important insights and information about influenza virus. The first study  found that zanamivir prophylaxis was effective in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza infections in households. The second study  found that laninamivir (CS-8958) was effective in treating children with influenza-A virus infection. The third study  found that oseltamivir treatment of influenza in children 1-3 years of age provides modest clinical benefits to children within 48 hours of symptom onset, but the benefits were enhanced when earlier treatment was started. The fourth study  found that zanamivir provided effective symptomatic treatment of influenza in children 5-12 years of age. Finally, the fifth study  found that oseltamivir provided more effective symptomatic treatment of influenza virus in asthmatic children when started < or = 48 h after the onset of symptoms."

11,"[/INST] I have synthesized the study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial. The synthesis focuses on integrating the key findings of the study abstracts, as follows: Dexamethasone significantly reduces interleukin interferon (IL) 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) alpha levels and significantly reduces the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradients compared to controls. The clinical course was also markedly improved after dexamethasone compared to controls. Methyl prednisolone (MP) administered as high dose does not reduce postoperative IL-6 and 8 levels compared to low-dose MP for pediatric patients after open-heart surgery. Dexamethasone prior to paediatric cardiac surgery reduces C-reactive protein (C-RP) concentration, but not release of von Willebrand factor antigen (vWf: Ag) and S100B. MP improved cardiac function and clinical outcomes, including oxygen delivery and postoperative outcomes, by reducing inflammatory mediator expression."

13,"[/INST] Combined, the summaries of the provided abstracts indicate that the provision of contraceptive counseling and educational leaflets to women in a hospital setting led to a statistically significant increase in the prevalence of contraceptive use in the post-partum period. Additionally, women exposed to the intervention were more likely to engage in contraceptive practice, with a statistically significant shift towards the use of long-acting reversible contraception (i.e., injectables, intrauterine devices). Further, there appears to be effectiveness in a community-based model of contraception provision. A community-based study in Iran evaluated the impact of home visits on postpartum outcomes and showed a significant improvement in exclusive breastfeeding rates in study groups receiving home visits. This intervention also increased postpartum health care coverage (i.e., mothers visiting health facilities) and postpartum family planning use compared to the control group. Further, a study assessing a family planning program involving community-based family planning workers in rural Pakistan showed that a decentralized system of care led to improved access to contraceptive methods for women. While there was an increase in contraceptive use for all methods, there was a significant increased uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, highlighting evidence for a shift in contraceptive preference. Additionally, counseling sessions in an antenatal care setting were effective in increasing women and their spouses' knowledge and practice of family planning. The authors recommend integrating family planning counseling into antenatal care in all facilities and involving husbands in contraception counseling. This is indicative of the influence that husbands can exert on their wives' healthcare decision-making, and in turn, their own reproductive health decision-making. These points are summarized in Table 2."
14,"[/INST] The summary of five prospective studies [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] assessing the clinical impact of Y-set versus conventional continuous ambulatory dialysis catheters in adult patients with end-stage renal disease indicates that infections occurred less frequently with the Y-set. The studies [4, 7, 8] reported a significant decrease in the peritonitis rate with the Y-set technique, with one study [4] reporting a decrease from 31 to 11 episodes per 100 patient-years in two groups over 17 years, and another study [8] reporting 3 episodes per 351 months in one group and four episodes per 363 months in another group. In addition, studies showed that Y-set catheters can be secured on the abdomen more quickly and safely [4, 6, 8]; the Y-set was found to be the best for securing the outlet tubing to the catheter [6, 7], and it has been hypothesized that this could help reduce the buildup of debris on the outer surface of the catheter hub, thus reducing the risk of infection ."

16,"[/INST] The effectiveness and benefits of LABAs is clearly highlighted in many studies. The effectiveness of LABAs (salmeterol, formoterol and salbutamol) in increasing FEV1 are evident [Studies 5, 6, 10]. The studies also demonstrate the LABAs ability to improve lung function by reducing the overnight PEF variability as well as improve symptoms of asthma [Studies 5, 6, 7], improve the morning peak expiratory flow variability [Studies 2, 6], improve quality of life by decreasing the frequency of night awakenings due to asthmatic symptoms [Studies 2, 5, 6], reduce the frequency of patients reaching their rescue medication limit in improving lung function, symptoms and quality of life [Studies 3, 5], decrease beta agonist medication use [Study 3], decrease emergency visits and the need for oral glucocorticoids use in the previous year [Study 4]. In addition, a study has demonstrated the ability of inhaled salmeterol to reduce morning asthmatic symptoms than inhaled theophylline (theophylline was the first LABA used to demonstrate the efficacy of LABAs) [Study 5]. Further, in studies involving controlled comparison with placebo groups, it has also been shown that LABAs is more effective in improving respiratory function and relieving symptoms than placebo [Studies 2, 10]."

None of them tested an intervention that took place outside of a physician encounter. Most reported significant intervention effects on smoking behavior outcomes, based on self-report: abstinence from smoking ranged from 1% to 8% of the sample reporting successful quitting. The outcomes of the studies were ascertained through self-report from patients at a follow-up rate that ranged from 59 to 99%. All studies were randomized designs. Although the interventions were implemented by physicians, there was substantial variation in the training provided to doctors or other elements of the intervention (e.g., some were one-time counseling; others, multi-visit or group counseling; others involved training in motivational interviewing)."
23,"[/INST] Study #1 indicated that atomoxetine is effective in reducing tic severity while improving attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, without significant worsening of tic symptoms. Study #2 showed that relatively high doses of methylphenidate can increase tics, although on subsequent use the majority of subjects had improvements in tic symptoms. Guanfacine was seen to have efficacy in treating both tic and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms (Study #3). In Study #4, clonidine and methylphenidate were shown to have the most significant effect on addressing ADHD symptoms in individuals with Tourette syndrome. In contrast, in Study #5, only desipramine had a significant effect on ADHD symptoms but not on Tourette syndrome symptoms. Study #6 suggested that methylphenidate is useful in treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder symptoms, without worsening tic symptoms in children with Tourette syndrome. Study #7 added evidence of desipramine being effective in improving both ADHD and tic symptom severity. Finally, in Study #8, there was no statistical evidence to support the benefit of deprenyl in treating ADHD symptoms in individuals with Tourette syndrome."
24,"[/INST] The abstracts can be combined into a cohesive summary as follows: This study is a systematic review and meta-analysis of 7 articles, which includes a total of 309 patients. The studies were randomized controlled trials comparing one or more control groups with active group. The primary outcomes evaluated in all the studies were improvement in the skin lesions and the effect on articular lesions (pain, joint tenderness, and swelling) during the trial period. All but one study showed improvement of skin lesions in the active group. Four of the studies demonstrated significant improvement in articular lesions in the active group on comparison to placebo. In three studies, an improvement in the skin lesions was noted in the placebo group but to a significantly lesser degree than that in the active group. The most notable improvement in the skin lesions were in the studies where patients were treated with colchicine and Auranofin. Only two studies assessed improvement in arthritis and both were conducted with the same sample size. Both showed a significant improvement in physician's global assessment and joint scores, with decreased number of tender joints, pain scores, functional disability scores, and ESR in the active group on comparison to placebo. With the exception of one study, the safety of colchicine and Auranofin was comparable to placebo. Sulfasalazine was effective in improving skin lesion but ineffective in improving arthritis. All the studies used self reported questionnaires in assessing the treatment efficacy and outcome. This could have introduced recall bias. Despite the small sample size these studies show that the colchicine  and Auranofin  have the potential to be effective therapies in PsA and warrant further long-term trials to assess their efficacy."

28,"[/INST] The first paper, entitled 'Effectiveness of family interventions in schizophrenia: a meta-analytical review,' summarizes the effects of family interventions on symptoms and relapses. Findings are based on results from 42 studies, which were included in the analysis. The paper notes that results show that the overall effect of family interventions is to significantly reduce relapse (P<.001) and significantly improve mental symptoms (P<.01). However, effects appear to vary with study method and duration. Studies based on the 'clinical high risk' group (n=6) indicated effects persisted up to six months, while those involving patients in acute phases (n=11) found effects persisted up to three months, and studies involving patients in chronic stages (n=11) showed effects persisting up to two months. The authors conclude that the benefits of psychoeducational family intervention (which involves the entire family) are similar to those for individual interventions."

31,"[/INST] Five randomized controlled clinical trials investigating the efficacy and tolerability of vigabatrin, a selective irreversible inhibitor of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transaminase enzyme, in reducing seizures were included. Two studies were published as abstracts only. The studies were double blind placebo controlled trials of 3 to 8 weeks duration with a cross-over design. They involved the initial treatment of adults with complex partial seizures, focal seizures, drug-resistant epilepsy, and tonic-clonic seizures due to tuborous sclerosis. All interventions were with vigabatrin in increasing doses, ranging from 0.9 mg/kg to 3 mg/kg/day. These studies concluded that vigabatrin reduced seizures by at least 50% in a higher percentage of patients with complex partial seizures than the proportion receiving similar outcomes with placebo. In addition, patients receiving vigabatrin tended to exhibit a steeper improvement in seizure frequency than placebo. Vigabatrin tended to be associated with an increased risk of adverse events, including the risk of visual perceptual disturbances."

Treatment with low-dose enoxaparin at home may be the preferred treatment in patients with symptomatic deep vein thrombosis. Fixed-dose subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin administered at home appears to be as effective and safe as adjusted-dose intravenous unfractionated heparin administered in the hospital. Clinical outcomes and the cost of hospital treatment were not significantly different between groups. There was a trend towards a reduction in the rate of recurrent deep vein thrombosis with low-dose enoxaparin versus unfractionated heparin.

The results of these studies suggest that different interventions have different degrees of effectiveness in improving pain, function, and gait speed, and reducing disability in patients with knee osteoarthritis. Some studies found that ultrasound applied before isokinetic exercises or integrated therapy had the most significant effect on pain, disability, and functional status of patients with knee osteoarthritis. Meanwhile, several studies reported that transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy, pulsed electromagnetic fields, isokinetic therapy, and integrated therapy may also be beneficial for pain, disability, function, and gait speed improvements. Overall, these studies indicate that physical agents and integrated therapy have beneficial effects in alleviating pain and improving functional status, but ultrasound applied before isokinetic exercises showed the most significant improvements."

The sample sizes ranged from 20 to 84 patients, and the studies compared either a nerve block with a single injection of local anesthetic (lidocaine or bupivacaine) versus a nerve block with repeated injections or different sensory block techniques. For studies on ultrasound, intraoperative sensory testing, and pre-incisional analgesia; and studies on ultrasound and nerve stimulation, the outcomes were sensory and motor block rates; success rates; onset and duration time of block; block quality scores; total morphine consumption over the entire 24-hour postoperative period; and patient satisfaction and analgesia scores. For these studies, the outcomes of success rates, onset time of block, block quality score, and time to perform the block were significantly better with ultrasound-guided nerve blocks. For studies on continuous peripheral nerve blocks, the outcomes were motor and sensory block rates; success rates; onset and duration of block; time to perform the block; total morphine consumption over the 24-hour postoperative period; pain scores; and procedural complications. Ultrasound-guided nerve blocks were associated with a greater rate of success, a lower incidence of motor and sensory block failures, a reduced time to perform the block, and a lower incidence of procedural complications. For studies on continuous trunk blocks, the outcomes were patient satisfaction; sensory block level assessed by pinprick test; total morphine consumption over the 24-hour postoperative period; and procedural complications. Ultrasound guidance was associated with increased patient satisfaction and decreased morphine consumption."

Overall, our summary provides a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and patients seeking information on the treatment of oral leukoplakia."
47,"[/INST] This paper focused on the use of structured education and information programs delivered by nurse specialists to improve knowledge and understanding of epilepsy among adults and children. There are eleven (12) included studies (Table 1), eight (12) of which have reported significant improvement in knowledge and/or understanding of epilepsy. One (11) of these has also reported a statistically significant decrease in the occurrence of seizures after the intervention. Two (11, 12) studies report improvements in patient self-efficacy. The effect of structured education and information programs on understanding of antiepileptic drug therapy and understanding of dietary regimes were reported in five (11, 12, 14–19) studies. In four (11, 12, 14, 18) of these, improvements were reported. Several studies (11, 12) reported improvements in social adaptation and self-esteem. One (11) study examined the effect of psycho-education on depressive symptomatology and reported significant improvements in social adaptation and self-esteem among adult patients with epilepsy. A reduction of antiepileptic drug side effects was reported in one (11) study. Patients reported a statistically significant increase in social adaptation, coping skills, and self-esteem and a statistically significant decrease in fear of seizures and hazardous medical self-management practices. No adverse clinical outcomes were noted in one (11) study. Of note, adverse clinical effects have not been a major primary or secondary outcome of these studies. Most studies have reported that children and caregivers perceive psychoeducation as beneficial (8, 10)."

These 13 studies are summarized according to their focus topic, which consists of the following: The Effects of Different Messages on Mammogram Uptake at Screening, Effects of the Following on Mammography Uptake in the Older Population, The Effects of the Following on Mammogram Uptake at Screening, The Need for Different Messaging Approaches by Race/Ethnicity and Age, and Methods. The purpose of these studies is to review the evidence on the following topics: the effects of messaging strategies on mammogram uptake at screening and their effect on older populations in the areas of recall versus prompting and self- versus physician reminders. They included methods involving the use of different messaging approaches by race or ethnicity and age, a summary of study populations and methods, findings, and limitations for each study, as well as a summary of the findings."

It suggests that studies with a longer follow-up period may be needed to confirm the benefits of EES. The studies that were included in this meta-analysis had several limitations, such as small sample sizes, different study designs, and variations in endoscopic approaches."
50,[/INST] The fourth study was excluded as data was outdated and contained information that was not relevant to the main study hypothesis. The other three studies were comparative studies in which active management of the third stage of labour was used. These trials involved the comparison of oxytocin versus oxytocin plus ergometrine for the prevention of postpartum haemorrhage. Study #1 and #2 had similar results and study #3 compared oxytocin plus ergometrine (Syntometrine) versus oxytocin alone. In study #2 the authors found that the risk of postpartum haemorrhage (defined as >/= 500 ml blood loss at delivery) or >/= 1000 loss after 1 hour for 500 ml loss was similar for both oxytocin alone and oxytocin plus ergometrine. In terms of the incidence of increased systolic and diastolic pressures an increase of 20 (0) mmHg and 30 (0) mmHg respectively was found (Study #2). Study #3 found a significant reduction of blood loss when oxytocin plus ergometrine (Syntometrine) versus oxytocin alone was used. However this was unclear whether the benefit outweighed the side effects. The pooled analysis of the three studies showed that there was no benefit of oxytocin plus ergometrine (Syntometrine) in preventing postpartum hemorrhage when compared to oxytocin alone (study #2). There was no difference in the length of the third stage of labour between the groups (Study #3).

Studies 3, 4, 6, and 7 found that patients treated with eye patches had a lower rate of healing than patients who were not treated with eye patches. Study 8 found that patients treated with eye patches had a similar rate of healing and a similar rate of inflammation and pain compared to patients who were not treated with eye patches."
52,"[/INST] The analysis of the summaries indicates that the first set of results described a randomized controlled trial that showed that the DARE ( Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program is ineffective in reducing the number of adolescents using drugs and other illegal substances. The second study described a longitudinal randomized controlled trial that showed that a family intervention consisting of three combined interventions, which included parent-focused intervention, peer-focused intervention, and other intervention methods, can also be ineffective. The third study was a randomized controlled trial that compared the effects of a universal intervention based on a school-based intervention and a combined school- and family-based intervention and showed that the combined intervention was effective in preventing adolescents' drug and alcohol use at a two-year follow-up. The fourth study was also a randomized controlled trial that showed similar results for a program that combines parenting and parent-child interaction and a community intervention. The fifth study was a randomized controlled trial that showed that a combined parenting, youth skills, and school-based curriculum can be effective in reducing adolescents' drug and tobacco use, but with small effects sizes. The sixth study was a randomized controlled trial that showed that a combined social competence, family skills, and school-based program can have small to medium effects sizes on reducing substance use and other behaviors among African American youth. The last study was a preventive intervention aimed at preventing elementary- and middle school-age youths from using drugs, especially marijuana, alcohol, and tobacco."
53,"[/INST] Four studies were synthesized to summarize the efficacy of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) as a treatment for non-reconstructable, critical lower limb ischemia. Two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two European multicenter studies showed an improvement in limb survival after SCS treatment compared to standard medical care. Patients who achieved adequate pain relief and sufficient paraesthesia coverage had significantly higher limb survival rates after SCS compared to those who did not. Patients in the SCS-no match group (SCS patients who did not meet pain and paraesthesia coverage criteria) had limb survival rates similar to patients not treated with SCS. Despite heterogeneity in patient and study characteristics, the studies concluded that SCS remains an effective therapeutic option for non-reconstructable ischemia."

Artemisinin derivatives have significantly higher cure rates than quinine, but there are no data that artemisinin derivatives are more effective than quinine in children. Rectal artemisinin may be as effective as intravenous quinine in children with severe malaria. Intramuscular artemether may be more effective than intramuscular quinine at clearing parasites. There are no data comparing artemisinin derivatives and intravenous quinine in children."

Four of the studies focused on breathing exercises, including pursed lip breathing, controlled breathing, yoga breathing, and diaphragmatic breathing. One study evaluated the exercise performance of patients with COPD during a 6-minute walk test after undergoing inspiratory muscle training for 12 weeks. The remaining study evaluated the effect of Tai Chi Qigong versus a control on quality of life and perceived social support. Overall, none of the studies found statistically significant improvement on all relevant outcomes. Four studies found some improvement in quality of life but did not find significant improvement in dyspnea, respiratory function, or exercise performance. Two studies found significant improvement in dyspnea, but not in exercise performance or respiratory function. Only one study found significant improvement in respiratory function and functional performance, but it also found higher dyspnea scores at the end of the study than at baseline."

Two abstracts described a crossover between tamsulosin and naftopidil and both demonstrated similar efficacy between the two agents. One compared naftopidil with the herbal combination eviprostat and demonstrated naftopidil to be superior to eviprostat. The final abstract compared combination therapy of tamsulosin and anticholinergics with monotherapy of naftopidil, and both demonstrated similar efficacy with naftopidil monotherapy having better RUV improvement. The meta-analysis compared tamsulosin to naftopidil and demonstrated significant efficacy improvement over tamsulosin. As described, the meta-analysis also demonstrated better QoL improvement and similar improvement in LUTS and the storage symptom score improvement."
60,"[/INST] Overall, most premedications were effective in reducing preoperative anxiety and inducing sedation, but their effects on postoperative recall, sedation, discharge times, and other aspects of patient satisfaction varied. In a systematic review of premedication for day case surgery, oral midazolam, temazepam, triazolam zolpidem, and proppanolol were found to be effective anxiolytics; however, midazolam was the only drug consistently associated with significant improvement in recovery time . Intranasal lorazepam was also found to be effective in reducing preoperative anxiety without significant sedative effects. A number of non-benzodiazepine sedatives have also been investigated as alternatives to oral midazolam, including zolpidem, zopiclone, and eszopiclone. A systematic review found oral zolpidem and eszopiclone to be similarly effective at midazolam, with the addition of being associated with improved memory and recall . Oral lorazepam or alprazolam combined with inhaled anaesthetics were investigated as synergistic agents of premedication, but there was no statistically significant difference between the groups compared to alprazolam alone. Non-benzodiazepine hypnotics may have similar or better effects on preoperative anxiety while preserving cognitive function and reducing recovery times. However, the long-term effects of sedative premedications on developing dependence or tolerance are still unknown . Therefore, the choice of premedication should be individualised, based on the type of operation, patient preferences, and level of anxiety."
61,"[/INST] The collection of abstracts suggests that strontium ranelate, when given to a certain amount, has the ability to prevent bone loss in postmenopausal women. Strontium ranelate reduced the risk of vertebral fractures in the first year of treatment by 49% (relative risk, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.73) compared to placebo . The minimum dose at which strontium ranelate was effective in preventing postmenopausal bone loss was 2 g/day. A dose-dependent relationship between the rate of change in BMD and strontium levels was observed within the first 24 months of treatment. At month 36, the average change in BMD from the baseline level was 18.7% greater than that observed for the placebo-treated patients treated with 2 g/day . Strontium ranelate prevented nonvertebral fractures, which included fractures of the hip, ribs, clavicle, sternum, and pelvis. Strontium ranelate improved vertebral fractures compared to placebo in the first year (38%) . Strontium ranelate prevented new vertebral deformities in the second year of treatment in the highest dose of 2 g/day ."
62,"[/INST] A randomized controlled trial by Tully et al. revealed superiority of dopamine over dobutamine for hypotension treatment in preterm infants. Infants treated with dopamine achieved higher mean blood pressure and lower inotropic infusion rates 3 hours after treatment . In a study conducted by Tierney et al., when dobutamine failed to elevate blood pressure, switching to dopamine effectively corrected it, suggesting a higher efficacy of dopamine over dobutamine . On the other hand, in a prospective study by Takenaka et al., both dobutamine and dopamine exhibited similar efficacy in restoring blood pressure, albeit with slight favoritism towards dobutamine. Moreover, dopamine did not show negative impacts on intestinal blood supply . Similarly, Kjellin et al. observed no significant difference in treatment response between both catecholamines . On the contrary, a study by Kullerstrand et al. demonstrated the superiority of dobutamine over dopamine in maintaining blood pressure and normalizing heart rate in hypotensive infants . Overall, it appears that dopamine is a more effective drug in treating hypotension; however, dopamine can cause tachycardia, which may not be appropriate in premature newborns with impaired cardiac function or coexisting cardiac defects."

Most of the studies were randomized, open-label comparisons in healthy women not seeking contraception or other medical treatment and with a reported menstrual history indicative of regular menstrual cycles (21-32 day durations and 7-10 day intervals). Some comparisons included subjects with longer menstrual cycles (e.g. 25-35 days) suggesting the studies could be conducted with a broader range of subjects. In contrast to the US, studies are conducted across the full age range, with subjects as old as 46 years. The majority of studies presented in this monograph are within a regulatory framework that requires the conduct of an integrated summary of clinical studies referred to as a “user’s manual”. These provide the most common menstrual cycle and bleeding profiles and include a formal comparison with other products."
64,"[/INST] Prenatal phenobarbital use appears to decrease the incidence and severity of preterm intraventricular hemorrhage in those weighing less than 1250 g at delivery . Furthermore, the use of prenatal vitamin K and oral phenobarbital in pregnant women may reduce intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants weighing 1250–2000 g at birth . In contrast, a prospective, randomized controlled trial did not find a significant effect of phenobarbital for the prevention of intraventricular hemorrhage in very premature (28 weeks of gestational age or less) infants . In addition, a meta-analysis of intracranial hemorrhage prevention trials did not find a reduction in mortality among preterm neonates with severe intracranial hemorrhage associated with oral phenobarbital use . Further, although the use of vitamin K and phenobarbital may reduce intraventricular hemorrhage in premature infants, it was not found to significantly reduce mortality . Although the use of vitamin K and phenobarbital together could reduce premature intracranial bleeds, more research is required to determine the safety and effectiveness of this combination. Additionally, further studies are required to identify those who would benefit most from this intervention."

68,"[/INST] This research study compared the effectiveness and pain levels of three different types of nickel titanium archwires used for orthodontic treatment. The three wires included a traditional 0.018-inch diameter, a stainless-steel wire in an extra-flexible medium-strength form known as Hanta, and a superelastic form of 0.0155-inch diameter wire, known as Sendalloy Light. The patients treated with Sendalloy Light reported significantly lower pain levels compared to those treated with traditional stainless steel or Hanta. No significant difference was found in severity of pain experienced by the two other wire types. The tooth alignment in the treatment of first molars and lower anterior teeth with these three wires showed a significant difference between Sendalloy Light and traditional stainless steel and Hanta wires. Significant differences in crowding relief, alignment efficiency, and time to achieve treatment goals were found between the three wires. This study showed that pain levels can be reduced while maintaining the orthodontic arch stabilization of tooth alignment by using the Sendalloy Light superelastic archwire."

Study #6 focused on a comparison of mortality between malnourished AIDS' patients receiving TPN and those receiving a nutritional counsel. Studies #7 and #9 compared an intervention with standard care regarding diarrhea and medical care, respectively. Studies #1, #2, #3, #4, and #5 were conducted in community settings, whereas others were conducted in clinical settings. Five out of eight studies (study #'s. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) measured self-care in AIDS patients, their caregivers, and their community. The rest of the studies examined adherence to medication and nutrition, mortality, and home health care costs related to the care of AIDS patients. Several indicators, including depression and CD4 and viral load measurements, were used to measure the outcomes of the interventions."

The authors identified 20 high-quality randomized controlled trials comparing antihypertensive drugs with placebo in pre-eclampsia and one high-quality trial comparing labetalol with hydralazine in gestational hypertension. Although there was little evidence from randomized trials of propranolol, the evidence base from observational studies was reassuring for the use of labetalol in the treatment of hypertension in pregnancy . The evidence suggests that antihypertensive drug treatment decreases the incidence of serious fetal or maternal complications of pre-eclampsia, accelerates the time to delivery, and may increase the incidence of intrauterine growth retardation."

73,"[/INST] The main finding of this search was that the use of local anesthesia in carotid endarterectomy is safe and provides similar results for perioperative complications compared to general anesthesia. The majority of the studies included in this search evaluated local anesthesia and general anesthesia with thiopental. Thiopental is considered a very good agent for general anesthesia but not available in many countries due to its limited production and therefore high costs. However, it is also important that the included studies also evaluated local anesthesia with epidural anesthesia as well as local anesthesia with plexus anesthesia and plexus block. This is important because the techniques of epidural anesthesia and block require specific education and may only be performed by trained personnel, but in many low and middle-income countries, there is a lack of adequately trained personnel. Therefore, the use of local anesthesia with cervical plexus block or brachial plexus block seems to be a reasonable and safe alternative. However, there are further issues with local anesthesia, including the risk of local anesthetic side effects and perioperative hemodynamic changes due to the block or intravascular injection of local anesthetic, which also need to be considered. In summary, the results of these studies suggest that the use of local techniques for carotid endarterectomy seems to be safe and appropriate, particularly in countries with personnel and/or financial constraints."
74,"[/INST] In the first study, there was a significant difference in the DMFT scores in the groups using fluoride tablets, fluoride drops, and rinsing with sodium fluoride . In the second study, fluoride supplements were also significantly more effective . However, the third study did not find a significant difference between the four intervention groups . In the fourth study, participants in the fluoride tablet group had more caries than those who had been given fluoride tablets and rinsing with fluoride or fluoride tablets alone . These findings highlight the nuanced and heterogeneous effects of fluoride supplements, mouthrinses, and a combination of the two on dental caries prevention in children. However, it is important to note that differences in the methods used to evaluate caries in the studies may have contributed to the heterogeneity in the results."

The studies have a target cooling temperature of 32-37°C in patients with ischemic stroke admitted within 12 hours from onset. The Copenhagen Stroke Study case-control study reported that inducing modest hypothermia in conscious patients with ischemic stroke was feasible and safe, and no patient had poor outcome associated with hypothermic therapy. COOL AID was a pilot RCT conducted on 40 subjects, who were either randomized to hypothermia group or control group. Thirteen patients reached target temperature with a mean time of 77 minutes. It was noted that there was no difference between NIHSS scores at day 3-5 and at discharge. In the CATS study, it was reported that hypothemia was feasible by surface cooling with ""forced air"" methods in conscious patients with ischemic stroke. Hypothermia patients were compared with controls using multivariate analyses on outcome scores, and they found a potential beneficial effect of induced hypothemia on stroke outcome. Acetaminophen for altering body temperature in acute stroke (AFS) was a randomized, placebo-control study conducted on 39 subjects. Acetaminophen (3900 mg/d for 24 hours) was well tolerated and patients receiving acetaminophen had a trend to be less normo-hyperthermic but without statistically significant difference at 5 days. In two other studies, AIPAS and Prophylactic antipyretic treatment with acetaminophen in acute ischemic stroke (APACTS), patients were randomized to groups that either received acetaminophen or received a placebo, and it was noted that patients in acetaminophen group also had significantly decreased body temperature (BT) compared to the group that was given placebo. The other studies did not describe whether or not there was a difference in the outcome between the groups. Notably, in all the studies, the inclusion of the subjects with ischemic stroke started within 6 to 12 hours of onset."
80,"[/INST] Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria: Patients aged 65 years or more underwent treatment by proximal femoral nailing or gamma nail, with follow up from 1 to 3 years. Exclusion criteria mentioned if any. Outcome Measures and Results: The primary outcome measure was the Harris hip score and the secondary outcome was patient satisfaction. The Harris hip score outcomes at 1 year, 2 years and 3 years were statistically similar for the treatment groups. A statistical difference in satisfaction rating was seen in the gamma nail group at 3 years, but did not achieve a statistically significant difference (p > 0.05). The sample size of the present review was not adequately powered to detect outcomes in patient satisfaction. Review-Specific Results: Proximal femoral nailing and gamma nailing in elderly patients is effective, with Harris Hip Score outcomes similar at 1, 2, and 3 years. The use of proximal femoral nailing appears to produce slightly better satisfaction ratings at three years. The review has the standard limitations common to reviews and randomized clinical trials involving the elderly population. Implications for Practice: The evidence supports the effectiveness of the Gamma nail and Proximal Femoral nailing using an intramedullary device for the treatment of intertrochanteric hip fractures in elderly patients. At the present time for elderly patients, proximal femoral nailing appears to yield better patient satisfaction scores. All other outcome measures support the similarity between the treatment groups for elderly patients. The sample size is not powered to detect a significant difference in patient satisfaction measures."

It is generally well tolerated, has tolerable side effects, and can be safely administered for several years. The modified Atkins and classical diets have largely identical seizure-reduction results in children (pooled analysis of over 1000 patients).The Mediterranean ketogenic and low-glycemic diets are also favorable in children with some evidence for greater tolerability and fewer side effects.The Mediterranean ketogenic diet may be the preferred choice to start due to its greater flexibility, ease of induction, and tolerability, particularly for children."
83,"[/INST] The present work performed a systematic literature review, aiming to summarize the published evidence about the association of chiropractic manipulation for the management of cervical spine disorders, with a specific focus on cervicogenic headaches and chronic mechanical neck pain. Initially, we searched the PubMed/MEDLINE and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register over the last 10 years, and selected 19 eligible articles (Table 1). In order to provide a brief and precise description of results reported from each study included, we created a short table (Table 1) summarizing some items for all 19 studies. However, the majority of studies focused mainly on subjective pain scores and did not report any standardized measurement of mobility and strength. We found evidence that chiropractic manipulation techniques could effectively improve pain outcomes in both conditions (cervicogenic headaches and chronic mechanical neck pain). In addition, the included RCTs reported a significant improvement in the short, mid, and long term follow-ups. For instance, a large clinical trial investigating the effects of 9, 12, and 15 chiropractic treatments on cervicogenic headache found that all three doses of treatment reduced the headaches in the fourth week of follow-up, with superior outcomes in those with a higher dose of care (9 to 12 and 12 to 15 sessions)17. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the effectiveness of manual therapy treatment of chronic neck pain comprising high-velocity, low-amplitude joint manipulation reported a significant improvement in pain and disability scores in the short-term and long-term follow-ups18. Finally, a 2013 Cochrane systematic review investigated the relative effectiveness of three manual treatment approaches (cervical spine manipulation, mobilization combined with exercise, and neuro-muscular training combined with exercise) for the management of chronic neck pain, reporting that there is no difference in effectiveness between manual therapy techniques19."

86,"[/INST] This summary reflects our synthesis of the studies, along with our discussion and evaluation of the results and their implications. It is possible to group and integrate the key findings from the seven studies: The review of the 7 clinical trials provides insights into the impact of NSAIDs on menorrhagia. Accordingly, their use may minimize menstrual bleeding, albeit with some side effects such as nausea and dizziness. This is an important point because if clinicians give NSAIDs at correct dosage, women may derive significant benefit due to a reduction in MBL and PID-related pain. However, this review also highlights that NSAIDs are of no benefit to women with normal hemostatic mechanisms. This finding implies that future trials and systematic reviews should give priority to investigations that identify subgroups of patients who would experience the greatest benefit from NSAIDs. These important considerations must be tested first in future studies, as must the role NSAIDs may play in treating chronic primary dysmenorrhoea (CPD) and/or dysmenorrhoea in women with IUDs."

The third paper compared the impact of SMBG in oral antidiabetic agents-treated patients with blood glucose self-monitoring versus non-use of self-monitoring. The fourth paper explored the impact of SMBG in a six-month intervention study based on dietary goals in non-insulin-dependent diabetic patients and compared it to the control group. The fifth paper compared the efficacy and safety of SMBG in subjects with diabetes with non-insulin-based antidiabetic treatment in which the addition of SMBG to diet alone or to sulfonylurea and metformin was tested and compared to diet alone and combination with metformin. The sixth paper studied the efficacy of SMBG as the adjunct to an oral antidiabetic agent therapy (gliclazide-MR) in a non-insulin-dependent diabetic patient randomized with an SMBG-based educational program versus a non-SMBG-based patient.

The majority of the trials found that the combination of ipratropium and fenoterol was significantly more effective in improving lung function compared to the other control treatments. However, the authors of these trials noted that the combination therapy was associated with increased adverse effects and should be used cautiously."
90,"[/INST] Nonsmokers are part of the social support network and can have an impact on smokers' efforts to quit. Two studies (7, 10) indicate that social support from partners can provide some beneficial effects in smoking cessation. One study showed that social support from partner was positively associated with smoking relapse in women . However, social support provided by family and friends did not have a significant impact on a smoking quit attempt. Moreover, one study  provides evidence that the level of support from their partner at the early stage of quitting was beneficial for quitters in sustaining their abstinence. In addition, one study (8) showed that negative non-supportive behaviors from others and low levels of social support were predictors of relapse . Another study (5) demonstrated the importance of including adolescent nonsmokers in smoking cessation interventions. Therefore, interventions that target nonsmokers and emphasize promoting support for smokers may be beneficial in smoking cessation."

The current study is a prospective, randomized, split-mouth, split-patient clinical trial of patients affected by multiple periodontal infrabony chronic periodontitis defects, who were treated with either flap surgery and coronally advance the flap following collagen matrix alloplastic material implantation (test group) or flap surgery only (control group)."
92,"[/INST] The studies reviewed show that single-dose antimicrobial treatments are effective for the treatment of acute uncomplicated urinary tract infections. However, the studies differ in the choice of drug used, the dosage, and the definition of cure used. The results across various studies vary in terms of the percentage of cured patients and the relapse rates. The definition of cure and relapse is not standardized across studies, making it difficult to directly compare the efficacy of single-dose treatments. Some studies use a clinical and microbiological cure definition, while other studies use a strict microbiological cure definition. The percentage of patients cured after a single dose in the studies reviewed ranged from 11%  to 86% . The relapse rates in the studies vary from 25%  to 30%  to 8% . The definition of relapse is subjective and difficult to standardize. Some studies defined relapse as a positive urine culture after three days of follow-up, while other studies only count relapse if the patient has symptoms of urinary tract infection."
93,"[/INST] Studies #2-7: These 6 studies are difficult to evaluate individually. A total of 718 patients were enrolled in the 6 studies. The average age of the patients in the 6 studies ranged from 42 (study #2) to 66 (study #3). The proportion of males among patients ranged from 49% (study #5) to 80% (studies #3 and 4). Permanent single-chamber ventricular pacing was the mode of pacing for the comparator pacing group in 4 studies (studies #4, 5, 6, and 7) and dual-chamber pacers were used in only 2 studies (studies #2 and 3). The average length of dual-chamber pacing ranged from 94 (study #4) to 237 days (study #2). The proportion of patients with CRT devices ranged from 0% to 49%. In all six studies, exercise capacity improved, NYHA class either improved or was unchanged, and quality of life improved in patients on DDD pacing."
94,"[/INST] In the context of the use of creams for the management of chronic ulcers, the authors provide evidence on the analgesic effects of anesthetics, either topical or in dressing form, on chronic leg ulcers. Of the five articles analyzed, only one is related to EMLA, anesthetic cream used on the first debridement and compared to placebo cream. The latter did not prove to be statistically significant compared to EMLA in terms of pain relief. However, four articles from more recently suggest that topical anesthetic creams, such as lidocaine, ibuprofen, EMLA, have analgesic effects in chronic leg ulcers during the debridement process and reduce pain during the treatment period."
95,"[/INST] These 17 abstracts all pertain to substance abuse in persons with Severe Mental Illness. The first abstract is a review of integrated treatment approaches, and highlights two randomized controlled trials of assertive community treatment compared to standard outpatient treatment (Sorkin et al. 2003; Sorkin et al. 2010). The next five abstracts examine different aspects of treatment, including case management (Gordon et al. 2005; Fua et al. 2006), motivational interviewing (Gordon et al. 2005; Fua et al. 2006; Scott et al. 2007), a brief treatment intervention (Sullivan et al. 2007), and a study of motivational interviewing and cognitive behavior therapy for comorbid alcohol, cannabis, and amphetamine use in psychosis (Mack et al. 2007a; Mack et al. 2007b). The three studies next all focus on caregiver interventions (Mack et al. 2009a; Mack et al. 2009b; Zhang et al. 2009). The last two abstracts focus on outcomes at the end of treatment (Freyd et al. 2012; Schenklow et al. 2011). There is broad support across all domains that integrated approaches are feasible and result in better outcomes. The review emphasizes the utility of both motivational interviewing and cognitive behavioral approaches. While this review included a broad array of studies, it is limited by the exclusion of non-randomized controlled trials."
96,"[/INST] 23 articles were found and included in the final review. Eleven studies examined the efficacy of thymosin in combination with chemotherapy for patients with lung cancer or colorectal cancer. One study examined whether preoperative treatment with immunocytokine thymosin combined with chemotherapy would increase the quality of surgical margin among patients with locally advanced gastric carcinoma. Another study examined to identify the potential benefit of immunotherapeutic agent thymostimulin in patients with breast cancer. Two studies investigated the use of thymosin alpha 1 for patients with ovarian cancer and resectable pancreatic cancer. The other five studies examined the combination of thymosin for hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Ten studies compared the efficacy of chemotherapy and thymosin-combined cancer therapy. The remaining two studies were a clinical study of the immunomodulation in cancer therapy. The conclusion of these studies was that thymosin has a synergistic effect with chemotherapy drugs such as oxaliplatin, carmustine, and cyclophosphamide. In addition, some of these studies pointed out that thymosin has the effect of increasing the expression of cytokines such as IFNγ and IL-2."

99,"[/INST] Acute bacterial conjunctivitis, commonly known as pink eye, is a common eye infection in all age groups around the world. It can be caused by a variety of bacteria, most commonly Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydophila, and Haemophilus influenzae. Signs and symptoms of acute conjunctivitis include redness or swelling, red eyes, discharge, itching, tearing, pain, burning sensation, blurred vision, increased sensitivity to light, and feeling like something is in the eye. Symptoms typically last 7–10 days. The treatment of acute bacterial conjunctivitis typically involves antibiotics, over-the-counter treatments, or home remedies. Antibiotic eye drops, such as chloramphenicol, fluoroquinolones (e.g. levofloxacin), and azithromycin are the primary treatment options for acute bacterial conjunctivitis. Oral antibiotics are also available."

In this study, the total attack number in the simvastatin group was significantly lower than the placebo group (moderate effect size r = 0.29; p = 0.01). Study #2 examines the effect of adding high dose atorvastatin to standard high dose subcutaneous interferon beta-1a in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) patients. The combination of interferon plus atorvastatin resulted in increased MRI and clinical disease activity. Study #4 describes a phase 4 (post marketing) double blind placebo-controlled trial of simvastatin as an add-on therapy to interferon beta for RRMS. It found no evidence of beneficial effect of simvastatin as an add-on therapy to interferon beta compared with placebo."

103,"[/INST] Study #1 combined both quantitative and qualitative methods to evaluate the effectiveness of post-acute care programs for hip fracture in elderly patients. They found that the intervention group had better functional outcomes in a variety of activities and instrumental activities of daily living (AADL) and depression scores after 12 months compared to the control group. This suggests that post-acute care programs can improve a patient's overall health and independence after a hip fracture. The study also examined the costs and benefits of interventions, finding that the intervention group had lower costs and improved health outcomes compared to the control group. This information can be useful for policymakers making decisions about healthcare resources."
104,"[/INST] The main finding summarized from the provided abstracts is that first trimester vacuum aspiration (D & C and electronic vacuum aspiration) is an effective and preferred option for pregnancy termination. The efficacy and acceptability appear to be similar, but some of the techniques have potential for complications. These findings suggest that manual vacuum aspiration may be the most effective and accepted procedure and may have lower complication rates. The studies highlight the importance of assessing patient perception of pain and discomfort, as well as the safety and effectiveness of each procedure. The studies also suggest that physician experience and patient education may affect patient pain levels. These findings contribute to a greater understanding of the effectiveness of these techniques and highlight potential areas for research and improvement in this field."

107,"[/INST] Here is a summary of the abstracts:Study #1: The efficacy of donepezil (5mg or 10mg daily) for moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease patients was investigated in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. After 24 weeks of treatment, patients taking donepezil showed significant improvement on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale compared to placebo. However, no significant difference was found in the scores on the Clinician's Interview-Based Impression of Change with Caregiver Input.Study #2: A randomized clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of donepezil (5mg or 10mg daily) for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease patients in a multicenter setting. The results showed that treatment with donepezil was associated with improved cognition and global function compared to placebo. No significant differences were found in the scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination or the Activities of Daily Living scale. The most common adverse event was gastrointestinal, and the discontinuation rate was low.Study #3: In an 8 week-long randomized, placebo-controlled trial, treatment with donepezil (5mg or 10mg daily) was found to result in significant improvement in both cognition and global function compared to placebo in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with donepezil was associated with an increase in cerebral blood flow in the caudate nucleus, which is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.Study #4: To investigate the long-term benefits of donepezil for Alzheimer's disease, a 2.5-year open-label phase 3 extension study was conducted. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either 5mg or 10mg donepezil per day for up to 3 years. During the first year, patients were blinded to which treatment they received, and then they continued receiving the same treatment for up to 2 years. The results showed that both the 5mg and the 10mg donepezil doses were associated with statistically significant improvement in cognition and global function compared to placebo at the 3-year time point. Patients who received the 10mg done"

109,"[/INST] Based on the abstracts provided, the evidence synthesis is as follows: Patients with various psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, acute psychiatric symptoms, and neurosis, may be effectively treated in day hospitals, which can be a cheaper and a preferred alternative to inpatient care. This is based on studies from the USA and Europe assessing the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of day hospitals compared to inpatient care. Effectiveness is measured by clinical outcomes such as psychopathology symptoms, quality of life, and social functioning; patient and carer satisfaction; and treatment intensity. The comparison between day hospital and inpatient care found mixed results, but the majority of the studies revealed at least equal effectiveness of day hospital care. The studies also report similar rates of hospitalization and medication use and a lower average length of inpatient stay. The cost-effectiveness studies suggest that day hospitals can result in cost savings, as well as longer-term care-related cost savings, despite the initial cost of restructuring. Further evidence on day hospital effectiveness compared to inpatient care is needed to support this recommendation."
110,"[/INST] The literature suggests that the inhaled tobramycin, colistin, and aztreonam were well tolerated and had no significant side effects.

112,"[/INST] The HIV/AIDS research we reviewed was generally encouraging. Although different studies varied in their methodologies and results, all of them were able to show some positive effect of their interventions with gay men. In particular, many interventions were able to help gay men reduce their risky sexual behaviour, which was their main goal. Furthermore, some interventions even targeted other factors such as substance abuse, depression and anxiety. Overall, the interventions that showed more success seemed to be those that were peer delivered, interactive and engaged gay men in social activities that helped them develop a sense of community and identity. Although the included studies all had positive results, it is difficult to say which type of intervention could be the most effective, but from the results, it was clear that peer-delivered interventions helped more than those that were not peer delivered, those that were also social seemed more effective in influencing behaviour changes and those that were multi-session and multi-modal interventions seemed to have the best long-term outcomes for both behavioural changes and the psychological well-being and treatment adherence of their participants."

114,"[/INST] A number of studies have been conducted to investigate the role of vitamin C, selenium, acetylcysteine, Vitamin E, CoQ10, N-acetylcysteine, ALS extender and selegiline as potential therapies for ALS. These studies have produced mixed and inconclusive results, with some showing efficacy in ALS, and others showing no benefit or even harm. The use of multiple interventions in each study may have confounded the results. While the CoQ10 and N-acetylcysteine trials were halted due to inadequate efficacy, one trial is ongoing for Vitamin C. The vitamin E results are conflicting, with some studies showing no effect, and one showing a possible benefit. The combined effect of these potential therapies still needs to be established before their effectiveness can be determined."
115,"[/INST] This is a synthesis of systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) intervention in terms of mortality, morbidity, growth and breast feeding in preterm LBW infants. We also assessed hospital stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, duration of nasogastric tube feeding, length of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), time required for KMC, mortality including Neonatal Mortality Ratio (NMR), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Mortality (NICUM), Sepsis, Neonatal jaundice, Intracranial hemorrhage, Neonatal Encephalopathy, Asphyxia, Necrotizing enterocolitis, Retinopathy of prematurity, Nosocomial Infection, Apnea, Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), duration of total parenteral nutrition (TPN), duration of supplemental oxygen, Home oxygen, Weight gain (g/day), Exclusive breastfeeding, Total breastfeeding. From the extracted data 7 out of 8 reviews recommended KMC intervention to be used for preterm LBW infants. 2 reviews highlighted on the difficulty of KMC (due to limited space, equipment, lack of maternal motivation, social support, and cultural factors) and 1 review reported on the feasibility issue of KMC. This synthesis on the effectiveness of KMC intervention shows a clear benefit in terms of mortality, morbidity (sepsis, jaundice, neonatal encephalopathy, apnea, necrotizing enterocolitis, nosocomial infection, retinopathy of prematurity, intracranial hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, home oxygen and total breastfeeding."
116,"[/INST] There are a number of pharmacological treatments available for the treatment of hirsutism, including antiandrogenic medications, cyproterone acetate, spironolactone, oral contraceptives, flutamide, oral contraceptives, and triptorelin, a long-acting GnRH agonist. Each of these medications has been shown to be effective in reducing hirsutism scores, although some medications have also been shown to be more effective than others. For example, in a randomized control trial of patients with idiopathic hirsutism, Finetti et al. found that cyproterone acetate (CPA) showed greater hair reduction compared to spironolactone and oral contraceptives over a 9-month period (Finetti et al., 2008). In contrast, in a larger randomized control trial of patients with idiopathic or functional hirsutism, Tugrul et al. found that spironolactone and CPA were equally effective in reducing hirsutism scores over a 9-month period (Tugrul et al., 2013). Similarly, in a comparative study of patients with PCOS, Tang et al. compared the effect of D-trp6 (GnRH) against CPA on hirsutism and found that while both treatments were effective, D-trp6 (GnRH) produced a greater reduction in hirsutism scores (Tang et al., 2007)."
117,"[/INST] Several studies were identified that compared the effects of different dopaminergic therapies on the progression of Parkinson's disease and/or the risk of developing complications such as dyskinesia and involuntary movements. Two studies [19, 20] compared levodopa-carbidopa (1995), levodopa-carbidopa and deprenyl (1992), and levodopa-carbidopa and selegiline (1996) to placebo. The results showed that levodopa alone delayed the time to the onset of complications in Parkinson's disease (study ID's [19, 20]. Another study found that a combination of levodopa and deprenyl delayed the onset of motor complications for longer than levodopa alone (study ID 21). Moreover, a 5-year study reported that combining selegiline with levodopa and carbidopa delayed the time to the onset of complications (study ID 3). On the other hand, a randomized trial revealed that long-term levodopa treatment prevented the development of Parkinson's disease complications (study ID 22). Furthermore, a Cochrane review found that long-term levodopa treatment was more effective than dopamine agonist treatment in preventing motor complications (study ID 23). Overall, the findings of these studies suggest that levodopa-carbidopa (carbidopa is an inhibitor of amino acid decarboxylase, which helps preserve levodopa in its inactive form and reduces the dopamine-releasing effects of levodopa) and levodopa-carbidopa-selegiline may be more effective in preventing the onset of complications in Parkinson's disease when used over long periods."
118,"[/INST] Based on the analysis of the article abstracts, it can be concluded that there is ongoing debate surrounding the use of paracetamol for fever therapy. Some studies suggest that paracetamol, ibuprofen, and aspirin are effective in reducing fever in young children. However, the findings differ in terms of the effectiveness of the different antipyretic agents. Additionally, the long-term consequences of paracetamol use in children have not been thoroughly examined. The findings from various studies have been inconsistent regarding the use of sponging as a method of reducing fever in children, with some studies reporting beneficial effects, and others reporting no benefits or even harmful effects. Additionally, there are discrepancies among the studies regarding the use of tepid sponging vs acetaminophen for antipyretic therapy in children, with some studies reporting that paracetamol is safer than tepid sponging. As a result of the inconsistencies among the studies, there is a lot of debate over the benefits and drawbacks of using paracetamol for fever therapy in children. The inconsistency among the studies is due to several factors, including differences in study design, the dosage of the antipyretic agents, the initial temperature of the children, and the criteria for inclusion and exclusion of children from the studies. It is clear that further research and a clearer understanding of the factors that determine the effectiveness of antipyretic agents and therapies are required to establish an effective management strategy for fever therapy in young children."

The settings in which studies of transitional care interventions were conducted include primary care centers, skilled nursing facilities, and rehabilitation/convalescent facilities. [48, 51, 58, 62, 97] Other settings include hospitalized patients' homes, community-based rehabilitation centers, physician offices, and nursing home facilities [55, 59, 87, 90, 105]. The type of patients that generally benefit from transitional care interventions are those with advanced age, multiple chronic conditions, and history of hospitalization.

127,"[/INST] The provided study abstracts outline findings from various clinical trials examining the benefits of early vs late tracheotomy in patients needing mechanical ventilation support. The overall consensus from these studies is that early tracheotomy (within 48 hrs) is associated with lower mortality, lower incidence of pneumonia and accidental extubation, and a lower amount of time spent in intensive care units compared to delayed tracheotomy (after 14 - 16 days). There is also an increased risk of injury to the mouth, lips, larynx, and trachea with prolonged intubation, which is reduced by early tracheotomy. It is of particular note that the study results are consistent despite differences in demographics, ventilation history and injury types among patients in the respective trials. While the results are clear for the aforementioned outcomes, there is one trial that found no statistical significance in risk of pneumonia among patients undergoing early vs late tracheostomy. The sample size of this trial was notably smaller than others, which may explain the lack of significance."

In 1996, Burrell et al. proposed the idea of major liver resection as total removal of three liver segments (including both left and right hemiliver), which was first used in the literature in 1976 26. The first segment to be removed using laparoscopic liver resection was segment VI 27. It is important to understand that the current standard non‐anatomical nomenclature was only established in the last five years, with the right hemisegment including segments V (posterior), IV (anterior), and VII (superior) as well as the left hemisegment including segments II (posterior) and III (anterior), as opposed to two hemilivers. To be considered a major right/left lobectomy, three or two segments of each lobe, respectively, need to be removed 28."
131,"[/INST] The included studies focused on examining the efficacy of various antibiotic treatments for lower UTIs or pyelonephritis during pregnancy. The effectiveness of treating patients' lower UTI with fosfomycin-trometamol was compared to ceftibuten, and cefuroxime; curing acute pyelonephritis using oral and parenteral antimicrobial treatments; and treating patients for acute cystitis with nitrofurantoin and ampicillin . The efficacy of three antibiotic treatments was examined for the patients diagnosed with pyelonephritis, with one group receiving ampicillin plus gentamicin as the first course, a second group was given cefazolin, and the last group receiving ceftriaxone as the initial treatment . One study examined the effectiveness of outpatient versus inpatient management of pyelonephritis in pregnant women who were more than 24 weeks pregnant . Treatment with fosfomycin-trometamol was equally effective as ceftibuten for lower UTI , and patients with more severe pyelonephritis were treated with cefuroxime . A randomized trial found that three antibiotic treatments were effective for treating pyelonephritis .

Insulin resistance as measured by hyperglycemia and reduced endogenous insulin secretion induced by intra venous hyperglycemia. 11 patients ( 10-18 years) . Oral glucose tolerance test (165 g of glucose load). Basal insulin at fasting blood glucose of 2.5 mmol/L was 20 units ( NPH ) + 4-20 units (regular) /day. A total of 53 patients completed the study. 16 patients were treated with regular human insulin alone 37 with both regular and NPH regular human insulin. Insulin doses were lower with human insulin (14.3 and 17 units/day) than with porcine insulin (22.7 and 29.1 units/day) in the fasting and postprandial states. 24-hour total insulin doses were, 24.8 and 28.5 units; 7.5 and 19 units/day respectively. There was better normalization of post prandial blood glucose with human insulin (120 and 160 mg/dl vs 155 and 242 m g/dl ) and HbA1c ( 7.64% and 10.24% vs 8.32% and 11.8%).

134,"[/INST] This cohort of studies suggests that prism correction does not improve reading speed or functional ability among people with macular degeneration, and that magnifying visual materials comes with tradeoffs. These may include obstructions of other information, added weight or size of glasses/magnifiers, and difficulty reading smaller fonts on computer screens. Electronic text-to-speech software is effective for people with macular degeneration but may be expensive to buy and cumbersome to use, especially if internet access can vary. Eyeglass-mounted cameras and stands may be helpful but have limitations. There are tradeoffs between cost, field of view, distance, and readability, especially under poor lighting conditions. Optical devices, while most similar to glasses, are harder to customize, tend to add significant bulk to the frame, and may impair reading of small fonts. Head-mounted closed circuit television (CCTV) allow for customization but can add bulk and blind spots to the wearer's field of view. Low-vision specialists (optometrists, low-vision opticians) are still the most important guides, especially as they have been shown to possess best knowledge on the range of visual impairment. Optical devices, while most similar to glasses, are harder to customize, tend to add significant bulk to the frame, and may impair reading of small fonts. Head-mounted closed circuit television (CCTV) allow for customization but can add bulk and blind spots to the wearer's field of view. Handheld magnifiers offer advantages of portability, but they tend to add visual strain if used for longer periods of time. The choice of low-vision devices must be made through a process of shared decision-making by specialists, patients, patients' families, and caregivers. Patient preference is an important element, especially when considering whether to invest in electronic devices, which are often more expensive. While research continues to explore how to develop more cost-effective, easy-to-use eyeglass-mounted CCTV, patients may benefit from a thorough discussion with their specialist on the advantages and disadvantages of these currently available devices, and the role that each of these devices can play in their everyday life."
135,"[/INST] There is a high likelihood of exposure to tobacco smoke among infants, children, and adolescents who reside with adult smokers. Infants, who are more likely to be exposed to second-hand or environmental tobacco smoke, are at high risk of developing acute bronchitis, chronic respiratory symptoms, asthma, and sudden infant death syndrome. Some studies have shown that children who were exposed to tobacco smoke during prenatal, childhood, and adolescence have increased risks of having respiratory-related comorbidities (e.g., lower respiratory infections, asthma, impaired pulmonary function, and sudden infant death syndrome) and other health outcomes (e.g., mental and behavior problems, impaired cognitive development, and other chronic diseases). Smoking in the workplace also produces negative health effects, such as respiratory symptoms and diseases. Prenatal exposure to second-hand smoke can lead to impaired pulmonary function and other comorbidities in infants, children, and adults. Smoking during pregnancy can have adverse health effects such as a higher risk of asthma in early childhood."

Study #2 found that misoprostol showed higher cervical ripening effect than isosorbide mononitrate, but it had higher incidence of side-effects also. Study #3 found that isosorbide mononitrate was less effective than misoprostol in cervical ripening before suction termination of pregnancy. In Study #4, although the efficacy in terms of reaching a cervical dilatation of 8 mm was not statistically significant, isosorbide dinitrate seemed to be as effective as misoprostol in cervical ripening and was associated with a significantly lower rate of severe side effects. Study #5 reported misoprostol to be significantly more effective than sodium nitroprusside for cervical ripening. Study #6 found that nitric oxide donors, such as isosorbide mononitrate and glyceryl trinitrate could effect cervical ripening, similar to the prostaglandin analogue gemeprost. Study #7 found that combination therapy with isosorbide mononitrate and misoprostol has similar efficacy to either agent used alone for cervical ripening in first trimester.

Simulation training has been implemented to enhance the trainees' learning curve, which is steep and requires significant practice . The application of simulation in laparoscopic and surgical training has been well validated , but simulation training in endoscopy has not been studied extensively . The role of simulation has gained more acceptance in the wake of the global pandemic COVID-19, where the availability of patients was reduced and simulation training can be beneficial for the skill upgradation in endoscopy . Table 1 summarizes the characteristics, methodology, and main results of the included studies. The number of studies published on this subject is high, i.e., 13 articles in the last five years. We can appreciate the increasing relevance of this subject. All 13 studies are conducted from developed countries. The number of studies is highest from South Korea with three studies [11, 15, 16]. The number of subjects involved in the study is quite large in most of the studies, i.e., 30 or more subjects, except one study  with six subjects for assessment of the endoscopic skills in laparoscopic training. The type of methodology is mainly randomized controlled trial, i.e., 12 studies [9, 13, 14, 16-26], except one study  with pre and post-test observations for endoscopic skills in laparoscopic training. The methods of assessment of endoscopic skills are mainly the performance and satisfaction of patients. The patient satisfaction surveys are recorded in the form of standard questionnaires used in gastrointestinal endoscopy [9, 11, 16, 19, 20]. The performance of endoscopic skills is assessed through various endoscopists as expert assessors, i.e., 10 studies [9, 11, 13-19, 21, 23, 26, 27]; seven studies [9, 11, 15-18, 21, 26] have recorded the simulation scores through computer simulation.

The main limitation of the studies is that they were not designed to compare the clinical effectiveness of the different regimens, and the included studies differ in terms of the participants, inclusion criteria, study design, and outcomes. The findings of the studies were also different. For instance, while three studies [1, 2, 5] found no difference in clinical outcomes between the combination and the zidovudine treatment groups, one study  found that combination therapy delayed the development of zidovudine resistance compared to zidovudine monotherapy. However, another study  reported that combination therapy delayed disease progression and decreased viral load. Therefore, additional research is required to determine the most effective treatment option."

These studies investigated the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole in the treatment of schizophrenia, compared with placebo, risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone. All the studies found that aripiprazole had a similar or better efficacy compared with other antipsychotics in reducing positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, as well as global assessments of functioning. Furthermore, the studies generally reported a lower risk of relapse of schizophrenia for aripiprazole compared with placebo. Aripiprazole was also associated with lower rates of EPS, but showed a higher risk of weight gain compared with placebo. Regarding other AE, some studies reported lower rates of akathisia and increased prolactin levels for aripiprazole compared with other antipsychotics. Long-term aripiprazole treatment demonstrated sustained improvement in psychiatric symptoms, but no significant changes in cardiovascular risk factors were reported. Overall, most studies considered aripiprazole an effective and safe treatment for schizophrenia."

Three primary care sites in York. 4685 patients: 1233 in standard management, 3452 in the triage system. All patients requesting same day appointments during study weeks were included in the trial. Type of consultation (telephone, appointment, or visit), time taken for consultation, presenting complaints, use of services during the month after same day contact, and costs of drugs and same day, follow up, and emergency care. Findings: Triage resulted in an increase in telephone contact, but these calls were shorter. Telephone care became the predominant patient management style following triage introduction; the percentage of consultations classified as telephone compared to all same day appointments increased from 6.9% to 29.5% by month 12. The mean time spent managing each call decreased from 14.9 minutes for standard management to 4.3 minutes for the triage system, but the mean duration of a same day consultation increased by 2.39 minutes from standard management to triage by month 12. The mean number of GP and nurse appointments fell following the introduction of triage by month 12. Mean GP time per appointment fell by 1.56 minutes from 7.92 minutes to 6.36 minutes. There was no significant change in costs. Conclusion: Triage reduced the number of same day appointments with GPs but resulted in busier routine surgeries, increased nursing time, and a small but significant increase in out of hours and accident and emergency attendance. Triage does not reduce overall costs per patient for managing same day appointments..

155,"[/INST] Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is an infection of the peritoneal fluid that commonly occurs in patients with cirrhosis who have a high concentration of ascitic fluid, and can be associated with high morbidity and mortality . SBP in cirrhosis arises when enteric bacteria translocate through the intestinal wall to the peritoneal cavity, causing infection . The ascitic fluid supports the growth of Gram-negative bacilli, which is the most common microorganism associated with SBP. If left untreated, SBP can lead to serious complications such as sepsis and further loss of sodium. Treatment options for SBP include antibiotics, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS), percutaneous drains, paracentesis, or emergency transplantation [14–17]. The antibiotics used to treat spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis are classified in 4 ways: 1) a β-lactam antimicrobial, commonly ampicillin or a third-generation cephalosporin; 2) an aminoglycoside, commonly gentamicin; a quinolone, commonly ciprofloxacin; or 3) penicillin-tobramycin .

There is an advantage for the use of erythropoietin (EPO) in preventing or managing chemotherapy-induced anemia in patients with solid tumors or lymphomas. However, data are limited for hematological malignancies. Pegylated and non-pegylated forms of rhEPO and darbepoetin beta (Aranesp) demonstrate efficacy for chemotherapy-induced anemia.

RhEPO products have similar effectiveness for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced anemia in nonmyeloid cancers , and rhEPO and pegylated rhEPO have demonstrated efficacy in improving hemoglobin levels in patients with lymphoma . There is limited evidence indicating the use of rhEPO in breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and melanoma patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia . In breast cancer and head and neck patients (not anemic), rhEPO demonstrated no improvement in chemotherapy effectiveness [40, 42, 78].

163,"[/INST] Here is the summary of the first task: The second research task of Table 11 shows the search query performed to retrieve relevant clinical evidence, ""Quetiapine"" OR ""Seroquel"", for antipsychotic treatment of schizophrenia, ""depression"" OR ""mood disorder"". The clinical evidence retrieved is a systematic review comparing quetiapine with haloperidol (Table 12; Evidence No. 2). The review concluded that the efficacy of quetiapine in the treatment of schizophrenia was higher than that of haloperidol but the adverse effects of quetiapine were greater. The results of this research task show that, in terms of the clinical domain defined as ""depression"" OR ""mood disorder"", the retrieved review ""Quetiapine for the treatment of depression"" did not provide any comparable evidence (Table 13, No. 1). However, another clinical review ""Long-term treatment of schizophrenia"" (Table 12, No. 2) was obtained that discussed the efficacy of ""atypical antipsychotics"" including quetiapine. The latter review stated that quetiapine is the least effective agent among all atypical antipsychotics studied. The results of the review ""Quetiapine for the treatment of bipolar disorder"" (Table 12, No. 3 and No. 4) also provided information that supported this finding that quetiapine is the least effective agent among all atypical antipsychotic agents studied (Table 13, No. 1). Additionally, the same reviews stated that the efficacy of quetiapine is not higher than that of haloperidol (Table 13, No. 2). This indicated that quetiapine does not possess a treatment benefit over haloperidol when used to treat schizophrenia. The results of this research task show that any evidence showing the ""preference"" of quetiapine over haloperidol, as suggested by the guideline recommendations, does not exist, which would justify the use of quetiapine as the preferred first-choice anti-psychotic agent for the treatment of schizophrenia. Moreover, the retrieved review ""Long-term treatment of schizophrenia"" (Table 13,"

In summary, the 5 experimental designs all indicated that some form of chest physiotherapy was useful and effective in the clinical management of patients with cystic fibrosis. The physiotherapy measures consisted of chest physiotherapy regimens such as combination of postural drainage and forced expiratory technique (Ebenstein, 2003) or the application of interventions including postural drainage and positive expiratory pressure (Sandhaus et al., 1991) techniques. Additionally, self-administered chest physiotherapy such as self-administered high-pressure PEP (Ebenstein, 2003) and autogenic drainage (Sciurba & Peterson, 1992) were identified as being effective in mucus clearance and lung function. Interestingly, PEP has been shown to produce significantly more sputum than self-administered techniques; however, the investigations indicated that the PEP-induced positive effect was not statistically different in relation to lung function than that of self-administered techniques. Furthermore, PEP may potentially lead to airway hyperreactivity, and may thus be less ideal for patients with such susceptibility. The combination of autogenic drainage and high pressure PEP, on the other hand, did not indicate significantly lower positive effect on lung function, and may be considered as a useful technique for both physiotherapy and treatment for patients with airway hyperreactivity."
172,"[/INST] Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is effective for patients with bipolar I disorder in their early phases who are in remission and have few relapses and good medication compliance. Patients who were treated with 22 sessions of group psychoeducation and medication had fewer recurrences and shorter times to relapse and fewer recurrences of depression and hypomania with an initial episode or relapse. Psychoeducation seems to work even in patients who have low adherence to medications. Identifying and treating manic episodes in patients can reduce relapses, improve their quality of life, and increase the amount of time until their next relapse. This conclusion emphasizes the importance of recognizing manic episodes and treating them as soon as possible. Studies should test the impact of cognitive behavior therapy versus other interventions such as medication switching or increased frequency of clinical visits and consider measuring the impact of psychosocial functioning rather than merely the time gap between episodes. Future studies may incorporate social support for patients and their families or use mobile applications or virtual reality technologies to enhance their effectiveness. These methods should be combined to improve long-term outcomes and reduce the risk of relapse in patients with bipolar disorder. Studies should examine the benefits of personal and interpersonal education programs, such as encouraging the pursuit of higher education, job training, or job placement programs.

The results from the first study conducted showed that G-CSF does not accelerate neutrophil recovery, reduce time spent in the hospital, alleviate toxicity, or improve treatment outcomes . However, the second study presented contradictory results, indicating that G-CSF may be beneficial and reduces the risk of infections . The third study reported that G-CSF significantly shortens the duration of febrile neutropenia, severe neutropenia, duration of antibiotic use, and duration of hospitalization, but none of these outcomes showed a significant correlation with the number of days in remission or other outcomes such as survival . The fourth study's findings showed that r-metHuG-CSF reduces febrile neutropenia occurrences (0.15 vs 0.40), infections (0.08 vs 0.15) and hospital stays (19.5 +/- 12.3 days vs 10.3 +/- 10.9 days).

Nine were clinical trials that were mainly published 10 or more years ago and did not meet our criteria for inclusion based on updated guidelines [13, 14]. Three additional papers were found through reference searching [7, 11, 12]. Three other papers appeared to be relevant but were not available in our library . In 10 of the 6 published clinical trials, inhaled NO was found to have no significant benefit. In the remaining 3 papers [7, 11, 12],  positive benefits of inhaled NO was reported. While there is no consensus on optimal timing for NO therapy, three of the six trials utilized NO prior to randomization. As noted above, a major concern is that all but one of the published studies pre-date the updated and revised definition of ARDS. The heterogeneity of design, inclusion criteria and outcomes makes definitive conclusions challenging. One of the largest multi-institution trials, the “NO INHALE” study which included only ARDS patients who met ATS/ERS definition, found no benefit . There was an increased number of adverse events in the NO group compared to control. These include increased pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary edema and need for NP . One smaller trial also noted an increase in adverse events and mortality in the inhaled NO group ."
176,"[/INST] 1. 10 papers were reviewed, all of which were published within the past 20 years. Of the 10, 2 were published by the same team. Four out of 10 included randomized clinical trials, 3 were observational cohort/cohort studies and 3 used administrative databases. All studies were conducted in English-speaking countries (UK, Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia). None included non-English studies. 2. Five papers reported data before 1990. 3. 5 papers were methodologically high quality, 3 moderate and 2 low. 4. Overall, there was no evidence that breast screening reduced breast cancer mortality. All 5 papers (4 papers with data before 1990 and 1 from an RCT) reporting a difference in survival were low quality. There was only 1 instance among papers published more recently (Houssami 2016) of data suggesting a potential increase in breast cancer mortality among screened women. The conclusions in 5 papers published more recently (Fitzpatrick 2011, Houssami 2016, Wolfram 2017, Schmidt 2017, Smith 2017) that mammography screening reduces breast cancer mortality were felt to be inadequately substantiated, especially in the light of results from the recent Danish RCT data on the same topic. 5. The reasons for the differing conclusions offered in the studies reporting different results on breast cancer mortality and breast cancer screening are likely to be multifactorial, but it was felt that 2 studies (McCowan 2016 and Smith 2017) in particular were problematic. McCowan et al used uncorrected prevalence/incidence methods when comparing early vs later breast cancers, which was thought likely to result in overestimation of their RRs. The authors had acknowledged this limitation themselves. Smith et al's results should also be viewed very cautiously for several reasons: a) their results were driven by overdiagnosis of nonpalpable lesions in the screening group, which could not be included in breast cancer survival data and were classified as being detected elsewhere in the body; b) their RRs would rise above 1 in a larger dataset."
177,"[/INST] 1. Studies 1, 2, 3 and 13 show that hypertonic saline infusion in the dose used in this study was not harmful to the patients; studies 6, 7, 8 and 9 show that it was as efficient as isotonic saline infusion in avoiding hypotension during epidural or spinal anaesthesia. Study 11 demonstrated that HS is useful in preventing hypotension when rapid fluid preloading is desired, in situations where excess free water administration is not desired. Study 12 compared the effects of 7.5% HS and 0.9% NS on perioperative weight gain and showed that HS had less effect on body weight increase than isotonic saline infusion. Study 15 compared the effects of HSL and RL on the operation time and showed that HSL was more efficient than RL in keeping up the cardiac output during operation without increasing oedema. Studies 4, 5 and 10 showed that the patients did not suffer adverse effects although the concentration of HS was much higher than those used in the studies discussed above. Therefore, it is assumed that the HS (7.5% sodium chloride) used in this study was safe enough even in patients with hyponatremia."
178,"[/INST] The summary of the above studies highlights a range of technologies being used to educate and encourage positive sexual health behaviour among adolescents. These include traditional classroom-based lectures, interactive computer games, computer-assisted instruction, video and interactive video lessons, as well as internet-based interventions delivered via computer or mobile phone apps. One particular study assessed 3D holographic simulations of male genitalia to encourage decision-making and condom use among adolescents."
179,"[/INST] A group of phase II clinical trials of therapeutic vaccines against ovarian and breast cancer has demonstrated modest evidence of anti­tumor activity. For example, a CDX-011 vaccine designed to target the MUC1 antigen in advanced ovarian cancer showed anti­tumor responses in 15% of the 32 vaccine­treated patients as compared with only 4% in the 56 placebo treated patients. Similarly, a Phase II clinical trial of a Trovax vaccine targeting the NY-ESO-1 antigen in metastatic breast cancer demonstrated that 63% of the 18 vaccinated patients had stable disease as compared with only 7% of the 10 placebo patients at 6 months. While neither of these trials are likely to move forward in standard therapeutic settings due to inadequate efficacy, they provide validation of the concept that therapeutic vaccines can have some benefit as a component of cancer treatment in certain settings."
180,"[/INST] From a large study with 760 randomly selected remitted 1-year patients with schizophrenia, it was concluded that 50% of these patients can be considered to be in remission . The authors have defined the term ""remision "" as: Absence of residual psychotic symptoms as defined by both patient and rater, which may endure for months and which may be confirmed by a second interview. A substantial decrease in the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, as measured by the scales of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANNS) and the Scale for Outcome in Psychosis (SOP) has been observed in this study , ."
181,"[/INST] The purpose of this paper is to integrate the findings of studies assessing the effectiveness of various orthodontic interventions for Class II malocclusion, as described in peer-reviewed published literature. After reviewing the literature, we found that most studies assessed the effectiveness of early Class II treatment in an attempt to avert more extensive and invasive treatment later. Various methods were used to treat Class II malocclusions, including the following: functional appliance (Herbst, Twin-Block and Bionator), fixed appliances (fränkel and Harvold appliance), headgear, or a combination of these. Despite the differences in treatment types, the findings consistently highlight the significant changes in the hard and soft tissues that occur with early intervention, such as anterior mandibular growth, anteroposterior and vertical maxillary improvement, incisal mandibular inclination, and dental changes. However, when it comes to long-term outcomes, the results of studies assessing the effectiveness of various treatment methods are mixed. Some studies report improvements in the sagittal dimensions of the maxilla during puberty, while others suggest possible relapses and deterioration of treatment results. These conflicting results can be explained by the complexity of developmental mechanisms occurring during puberty. Moreover, the studies were designed to compare the effectiveness of early and late treatment, potentially leading to differences in the age of the subjects included. This highlights the importance to carefully review each case and consider individual factors such as growth potential, skeletal maturity, and patients' motivation."
182,"[/INST] This systematic literature review included six articles (Fickl et al., 2007; Brull et al., 2009; Schmidt et al., 2011; Borgonovo et al., 2013; Kern et al., 2014; Eren et al., 2019) that evaluated bone resorption in immediate and delayed implants in the anterior maxillary region."
183,[/INST] - Seven studies were excluded from meta-analysis due to lack of information on dietary fat intake in the intervention and the control/comparison arm. Two studies were excluded from meta-analysis due to lack of information on the impact of interventions on any lipid measure.
184,"[/INST] After synthesizing the key findings of the provided abstracts, the following summary was generated: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic and disabling condition. MS-related disability can affect patients with even mild cognitive impairment, and even individuals without obvious impairment may still have clinically significant problems in memory, attention, and executive functioning (Marder, 2006). Therefore, neuro-rehabilitation services are important for MS patients, focusing on reducing long-term disease impacts and improving quality of life (Jenkins et al., 2007). Cognitive impairments should always be considered in the design of rehabilitation efforts (Jones, 2010), and psychological interventions can help alleviate MS-related mental health issues (Walton et al., 2015; Kylman et al., 2016). Neuropsychological-based cognitive rehabilitation has been proposed as a potential treatment for patients with mild to moderate cognitive impairment associated with MS (Dams et al., 2021). Several randomized controlled trials have indicated that cognitive interventions can be beneficial in reducing cognitive impairments and improving neuropsychological outcomes (Lam et al., 2014; Schnur and Kutner, 2009; Schnur et al., 2017). A study assessing computer-based cognitive training in MS patients found improvements in memory and reduced fatigue (Vidal-Ribas et al., 2014), while another study suggested that cognitive training could improve mood and depression in patients with MS (Jenkins et al., 2007). Studies have also demonstrated the effectiveness of using compensatory strategies in alleviating cognitive disabilities associated with MS (Jenkins et al., 2007)."
185,"[/INST] The results of this study suggest that participation in an aerobic exercise program may have a positive impact on health-related fitness, psychological well-being, body cathexis, and self-concept. Specifically, the studies included in our summary found that participation in an aerobic exercise program was associated with increased self-concept, physical fitness, creativity, and self-esteem, as well as decreased body cathexis. These findings suggest that participation in an aerobic exercise program may have a positive impact on various aspects of psychological and physical health. However, the impact of aerobic exercise programs on health-related fitness, psychological well-being, body cathexis, and self-concept was small. Further research is needed to fully understand the impact of aerobic exercise programs on these areas. In general, the findings of our study suggest that participation in an aerobic exercise program may have positive impacts on health-related fitness, psychological well-being, body cathexis, and self-concept, and should be considered when designing physical education programs."
186,"[/INST] The study abstracts describe three trials that explored the effectiveness of heparin treatments on the prevention and reduction of pre-eclampsia. Heparin was administered at different doses and methods such as low-molecular-weight heparin subcutaneous injection or intravenous infusion. The clinical indicators such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure variants, pulse index, and resistance index of uterine, umbilical artery flow in the utero, and hematological index (thromboxane, 6-keto PGF1 alpha, PLT, PT, APTT, Apgar score, body weight, gestational age of neonate, etc.) were investigated before and after the intervention."
187,[/INST] The five summaries above describe studies comparing the effectiveness of chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for the treatment of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Study #1 is a meta-analysis of two clinical trials comparing chemoradiotherapy with radiotherapy alone for the treatment of advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
188,"[/INST] In summary, anticonvulsants such as phenytoin, carbamazepine, valproate, and divalproex have shown promising results in treating impulsive aggression, particularly when used for outpatients with impulsive aggressive disorders such as antisocial personality disorder. A randomized controlled trial of 59 cocaine-dependent methadone patients found that the antipsychotic drug desipramine did not have any significant effects on the primary outcome measures for cocaine dependence and that those with antisocial personality disorder did not respond favorably to this drug. Phenytoin, valproate, and naltrexone have shown effectiveness in reducing cocaine cravings in cocaine-dependent patients with antisocial personality disorder and in reducing impulsive aggression in a sample of predominantly male inpatients with ASP or impulsive aggressive personality disorder. However, there was no evidence that naltrexone improved drinking outcomes in alcohol-dependent individuals with comorbid mental illness."
189,[/INST] In this section we present a brief outline of the key results emerging from the 24 studies selected for inclusion in our study. The outcomes of the studies were extracted and summarized using the following descriptors which represent the categories considered for selection.
190,"[/INST] In reviewing each of the 18 reports, it is clear that the effects of cranberry on UTIs (or more globally bladder infections) remain somewhat controversial. A number of studies clearly indicated benefit, and some indicated none. The effect of cranberry preparations on non-infectious conditions such as lower recurrence rates of UTI, or other urological symptoms was limited."
191,"[/INST] Study #1 compared the effectiveness of low-dose AAS to triflusal in the prevention of cerebral infarction, ischemic cardiopathy, and vascular death . The study included 217 patients with a first ischemic stroke, of whom 106 were assigned to triflusal and 111 were assigned to AAS. The study found that AAS was significantly less effective than triflusal in reducing the combined risk of cerebral infarction, ischemic cardiopathy, and vascular death (OR 0.61; 95% CL 0.30-0.90) ."
192,"[/INST] In the studies ""Tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets for the treatment of chronic lower back pain: a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient study"", ""Treatment of chronic low back pain with long-term tramadol use"", and ""Analgesic efficacy and safety of tramadol/ acetaminophen combination tablets (Ultracet) in treatment of chronic low back pain"" (Study #1, Study #2 and Study #3 respectively) the treatment effects of the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen were examined in a group of individuals with chronic lower back pain, as well as the safety of this combination. The study was a 91-day, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled outpatient trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets or a placebo treatment. The results showed that the combination of tramadol and acetaminophen was effective in reducing pain and increasing quality of life. Tolerability of the combination was also demonstrated. The findings of Study #2 were similar to those of Study #1. Study #3 also examined the safety profile of tramadol/acetaminophen combination tablets. Study #4 is a randomized controlled study that compared the safety and efficacy of opioid therapy to that of naproxen for the treatment of chronic non-cancer back pain. The opioids compared were set-dosed oxycodone and titrated-dose opioids of oxycodone and sustained-release morphine sulphate. No significant differences were found in the safety or efficacy of the opioids for the treatment of chronic back pain. The results demonstrated better pain reductions and improved mood in patients receiving opioid therapy."
193,"[/INST] Based on an aggregate of 4 randomized clinical trials in acute bipolar mania, olanzapine demonstrated efficacy as a monotherapy and in conjunction with lithium or valproate. Significantly more improvement in manic symptoms from baseline to endpoint was observed on the primary outcome measures that were used in the study abstracts, including the Young Mania Rating Scale total score, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (clinical global impression), and Bipolar Mania Scale. Olanzapine's superior clinical response to mania was evident in three of four studies based on the clinical impression of improvement and criteria defined a priori. On the Hamilton Depression Scale, olanzapine cotherapy improved depressive symptoms compared to monotherapy (22773820). In a post-hoc analysis of one study, olanzapine cotherapy for bipolar depression showed a response rate of 51.4%, which was greater than valproate alone (32%)(22773820). Olanzapine (22 mg/day) also showed greater efficacy than haloperidol (12 mg/day) on the Hamilton depression scale(23386995). On the Simpson-Angus Scale, olanzapine cotherapy had significantly more extrapyramidal symptoms compared to monotherapy (.025). Olanzapine cotherapy demonstrated a higher remission rate compared to monotherapy in studies when different remission definitions were used: over 50% improvement from baseline YMRS (54.4% vs. 42.3%) and responder definition defined in the text (47.2% vs. 34.1%)(23081060)."
194,"[/INST] In this review, 24 RCTs in the domain of clinical practice guidelines adherence were conducted from 1995 to 2012 for a total of 590 individuals and 6388 sessions of application. The studies employed self-reports, clinical observations, or both to determine adherence."
195,"[/INST] Studies 2, 3, and 8 describe positive effects of increased dosage or frequency or type of physical therapy exercise in older persons with hip fracture - see Table 2. All 3 studies included some resistance type training in their program. The studies had significant methodologic flaws that limit the ability to make any evidence-based generalizations. The positive effects of the type and frequency of the exercises described in the studies would be expected in any population."
196,"[/INST] The majority of the abstracts [#2, #3, #5, #8, #9] in the group discuss the effect of acid secretion suppression on respiratory function. In one, the effects of omeprazole, a potent acid secretion inhibitor, were investigated in asthmatic patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux (GER) on their respiratory function and PEFR [#5]."
197,"[/INST] - The summary indicates that a swimming intervention may have beneficial effects on lung function, the severity of asthma (as measured by lung function, such as PFT tests and PEF), and exercise-induced bronchospasm in children with asthma through improving lung elasticity. This review found that the intervention group showed a decrease in PEF and the severity of asthma in the past month, and a significant increase in PC₂₀. The decrease in PEF may not be clinically significant, but a significant improvement in PC₂₀ indicates a decrease in the severity of asthma. These changes may indicate a shift in ventilatory capacity from hyperventilation to euventilation, resulting in decreased respiratory acidosis and bronchiolar instability."
198,"[/INST] We can conclude that endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) and drugs are effective options for primary prophylaxis in high-risk esophageal variceal bleeding. However, whether there is any difference in therapeutic effect and which method has better long-term protective effect remains to be discussed."
199,"[/INST] Study #1: Immediate versus delayed umbilical cord clamping in premature neonates born < 35 weeks: a prospective, randomized, controlled study.. The purpose of this study was to test whether delayed versus immediate cord clamping would result in higher blood pressure and hematocrit, and to assess its clinical effects on the neonatal course in premature neonates (< 35 weeks). The results of the study found that delayed clamping tended to increase initial diastolic blood and hematocrit, although no significant differences were found in the other clinical outcomes assessed. The authors concluded that the lack of statistically significant differences with larger and masked samples of both groups may have been due to the heterogeneity and small size of the sample."
200,"[/INST] Acute, severe pulmonary embolism (PE) can be a life-threatening condition that requires urgent anticoagulation. The study results show that heparin plus tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) was superior to heparin alone, with a 30-day event-free survival probability of 90% compared to 57 percent in the heparin-only group (p=0.007). Alteplase, a more potent thrombolytic agent, also demonstrated superiority with a rate of 95% event-free survival compared with 68 percent in the heparin-only group over 30 days. Heparin was associated with a higher rate of bleeding compared to the thrombolytic modalities."
201,"[/INST] The study is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, single-blind, controlled, clinical trial investigating the effects of montelukast compared to placebo in patients with chronic hemodialysis itch.  Patients were assigned to receive 10 mg/day of montelukast or placebo for 4 weeks. The pruritus was assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS) . The primary endpoint is the change in VAS score from baseline to four weeks. The montelukast group exhibited statistically significant reductions in pruritus scores. The safety evaluation revealed that montelukast had a lower incidence of adverse events than placebo. In conclusion, montelukast is a safe and effective treatment option for treating hemodialysis-related pruritus. The study provides valuable insights into the management of pruritus in hemodialysis patients by demonstrating the efficacy of montelukast in the treatment of pruritus."
202,"[/INST] Table 2 shows nine trials comparing 5-FU and cisplatin combination (FP) to 5-FU alone or a combination including mitomycin. The overall response rate (RR) for each study was extracted and synthesized. These trials (with patients in advanced or metastatic digestive cancer) have shown that the FP combination was associated with significantly increased RR as compared with 5-FU alone or non-platinum regimen (RR = 1.11, 95% CI 1.03, 1.18; p = 0.007). Furthermore, two trials (with patients in advanced digestive cancer) indicated that RR of the FP combination was higher than non-platinum combination, the FP and FAMI regimens, which was associated with significantly increased RR (RR = 1.04, 95% CI 1.03, 1.06; p = 0.001). The effect of platinum combination is better than single fluoropyrimidine. In a multicenter randomized trial, Bleiberg et al.  assessed the efficacy of infusional 5'FU and cisplatin (FP). The infusional FP regimen offered significantly improved efficacy and is less toxic than a bolus FP treatment, the response rates for the FP treatment were 57.5% and 42% in the advanced gastric cancer group and 53% and 23% in the bile duct/cancer of the esophagus group. Also, a recent phase II trial  evaluated the efficacy of infusional UFT and cisplatin (UFT-C) as first-line treatment for elderly (> 70 years) patients with unresectable or metastatic gastrointestinal malignancies. The 141 mg/m2 dose of UFT was administered daily on either consecutive or alternate days with cisplatin on days 1 and 8 of a 14-day cycle. Thirty-three patients were recruited. The response rate was 52% (complete: 18%). The median survival was 24 months."

Five articles describe laparospic and open colectomy for CRC [37, 38, 41, 48, 49,] and one describes LPR for CRC . There is one article examining outcomes of laparoscopically-assisted colorectectomies, two articles examining lapraoscopically-assisted colorectal resection for cancer and one article examining laparoscopy for left-sided colon cancer . Outcomes examined included complications, long-term survival and oncological outcomes. There are no randomized controlled trials regarding the effects of laproscopy in rectal cancer."
204,"[/INST] Magnesium sulfate is a mineral and, like other minerals, has many physiological functions in the body. In the brain, it affects nerve cells, and it affects muscle, and it is sometimes used in the treatment of eclampsia and subarachnoid hemorrhage. In addition, nimodipine, which is a calcium antagonist, was shown to improve blood flow in the brain by dilating blood vessels and reducing vasospasm. In this meta-analysis, magnesium sulfate and nimodipine treatment was effective in preventing cerebral infarction and cerebral vasospasm. Magnesium sulfate treatment was effective in improving neurological outcomes. In this study, nimodipine was effective in preventing cerebral infarction. However, in the study, there was no significant difference in the incidence of cerebral vasospasm, although nimodipine was effective in improving neurological outcomes."
205,"[/INST] It is believed that the nose may serve as an entry point for SARS-CoV-2, via the ACE-2 receptor expressed in the nasal epithelium. However, the clinical and radiological characteristics of nasal involvement in COVID-19 are not well known. Some studies have found evidence for viral shedding in the nasal or pharyngeal mucosa and have suggested that the nasopharynx is a potential reservoir of infection. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in the stool and respiratory samples of some asymptomatic people. SARS-CoV-2 can be isolated for up to 2-3 days, as reported in a study from Germany, where asymptomatic patients were hospitalized and followed closely by a research team. The study concluded that viral shedding lasted for 20-21 days and that asymptomatic patients can be potential virus transmitters. This suggests that there may be a period of presymptomatic infectiousness during which the virus is no longer replicating and the person may not be ill, but virus is still being shed. Moreover, these asymptomatic patients may be more infectious because they do not practice social distancing, making them potential high-risk spreaders of the virus. These findings also raise questions about when the transmission risk ends for people who have tested negative for COVID-19 and highlight the importance of public education on personal protective measures, physical distancing, and contact procedures."
206,"[/INST] The selected studies investigated the use of local anesthetic techniques for pain relief during manipulation or reduction of distal radial fractures. Bier's block, as discussed in six of the studies, is a technique used to achieve regional anesthesia by injecting local anesthetic into the forearm of the ipsilateral side near the brachial artery . The effectiveness of Bier's block was compared with other local anesthetic techniques, such as intravenous regional anesthesia with haematoma block  or a distal forearm perineural block . Studies [Study #6, Study #7, Study #8] reported greater effectiveness in pain relief as well as lower complication rates associated with Bier's block technique. The modified technique to perform Bier's block mentioned that the injection site of Bier's block should be changed from the dorsum of the hand to the antecubital fossa, which could reduce the risk of affecting subsequent plaster application and local anesthetic administration from vascular punctures . Studies also compared Bier's block with other local anesthetic techniques like cubital nerve block  and combination of local anesthetic . The cubital nerve block technique was less effective and had a higher complication rate compared to Bier's block . The use of local anesthetic can be increased by using various drugs like Bupivacaine , prilocaine , and clonidine [Study #10]. Some studies investigated the use of sedatives like midazolam in addition to local pain relief with local anesthetics , which showed that the use of sedatives was more comfortable during manipulation but did not shorten the length of manipulation or provide effective analgesia. The use of antipyretics like acetaminophen has also been investigated. The results showed that acetaminophen and diclofenac did not reduce the rate of skin reactions in patients with concomitant radiopharmaceutical therapy . Other drugs such as Atracurium [Study #11], and hyaluronidase [Study #14] were also added in local anesthetic. Their effects were minimal and of no clinical significance."
207,"[/INST] Five clinical studies were included in the summary. In all studies, the focus was on inflammatory bowel disease, especially ulcerative colitis. The five studies were divided into four studies of infliximab use, and one study of adalimumab use. The study of the adalimumab was added to the summary as an additional study to compare with the infliximab studies. In the infliximab studies, infliximab was tested in a different type of ulcerative colitis patients, including: Mild to moderate ulcerative colitis (2 studies), severe to moderate ulcerative colitis (1 study), and severe steroid-resistant ulcerative colitis (2 studies). In the adalimumab study, it was tested in steroid-dependent ulcerative colitis. In both infliximab and adalimumab studies, the primary outcome was clinical response. In all five studies, clinical response was reported as remission achieved. In the infliximab studies, the rate of clinical response ranged from 35% to 100%. In the adalimumab study, the rate of clinical response was 64%."
208,"[/INST] The systematic review aims at addressing two clinical questions regarding hemiarthroplasty versus total hip arthroplasty or fixation for displaced femoral neck fractures: I. The short-term outcomes (up to two years) of the different treatments (hemiarthroplasty, total hip arthroplasty, and internal fixation) of displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly. II. The long-term outcomes (three years and above) of the different treatments of displaced femoral neck fractures in the elderly. The objective of the systematic review was to compare the outcomes of the different treatments of displaced femoral neck fractures in terms of short-term and long-term complications, functional scores, and mortality at the different time points."

Post partum contraception, counseling and adherence: A meta - analysis  of interventions on post partum contraception counseling showed improvement on self reported contraceptive use but did not include assessment of adherence. In addition, they focused on facility rather than individual based interventions. Authors in  suggested that counseling (for up to six months post partum) improved postpartum knowledge and contraception use. The same systematic review showed improved adherence to post partum family planning with postpartum home visit, peer support or education sessions. However, a subsequent Cochrane review  showed that community-based health education interventions to increase contraceptive knowledge and uptake were not effective and suggested that home visits were not suitable for counseling."
210,"[/INST] A literature search generated eight clinical studies in which omega-3 PUFAs were used to treat schizophrenia, which were included in the report.

211,"[/INST] A randomized controlled trial that included a placebo arm was reviewed by Yerevanian and Geller . The study evaluated the efficacy of citalopram compared with placebo in the treatment of depression in children and adolescents. The study found that citalopram was slightly more effective than placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents. Additionally, the study concluded that both citalopram and placebo were associated with several mild to moderate adverse effects."
212,"[/INST] These eight studies are all about comparing two different approaches for IVF treatment in poor responders patients. One approach was using GnRHa as the long protocol, which involved using short-term daily subcutaneous injections of gonadotropin releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) to suppress a woman’s ovaries, followed by gonadotropin stimulation. The other approach was using GnRHa as the short protocol, which involved using daily injections of gonadotropin (FSH or LH) during ovarian stimulation without using GnRHa to suppress the ovaries. Several outcome measurements were used to compare the two protocols, including the number of oocytes retrieved, duration of the stimulation protocol, dose of exogenous gonadotropins, implantation rate, and pregnant rates per cycle."
213,"[/INST] The articles were mostly non-randomized control trials looking at the effect of catheter fixation on outcomes (1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8&9). Two studies were randomized controlled trials, one comparing insertion technique (3), the other comparing the standard catheter type with a “new” flexible design (10). Of the nine non-randomized studies, eight reported a difference in the incidence of catheter related complications with catheter fixation. Overall, the method of fixation, timing of fixation and choice of fixation technique had little impact on catheter related complication rates."
214,"[/INST] All three articles are related to the effect of steam inhalation on the common cold. The two articles found no effect on symptom severity or length (Study #3 and # 4). The third article found a significant beneficial effect of steam inhalation on symptom severity on some isolated days during the treatment period, but the differences disappear after the treatments ended (Study #5)."
215,"[/INST] These study abstracts describe trials of various treatments for depression, including clinical and biological effects of mifepristone, ketoconazole, and hormones such as dehydroepiandrosterone, hydrocortisone, and metyrapone. These drugs were tested for effects in treatment-refractory major depression, and bipolar disorder. The treatments had some significant positive effects in reducing depression and improving cognitive function, but further large-scale studies are required to determine the safety and efficacy. The study summaries suggest that multiple factors, such as glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, may be involved in depression, and that there is room for exploration of new treatment options for this condition."

Although clear fluid can promote gastric emptying, however, they can cause mucosal injury, if the volumes of fluid were exceeded (Friedman, 1992)."
217,"[/INST] Hyperthermia was added to radiation therapy to improve local treatment of cervical cancer and locally advanced rectal and bladder cancers, with positive results being reported for cervical cancer. A possible benefit of hyperthermia for local treatment was reported for advanced rectal and bladder cancers, without clear evidence for survival benefit, and therefore needs further assessment."
218,"[/INST] The summary is a 300-word synthesis of the key findings from a collection of study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial research question. The output should provide a high-level overview of the key findings and maintain the scientific integrity of the original sources, but also be accessible and informative to a wider audience than just healthcare professionals. This is a relatively high-level synthesis that is intended to be useful to both the general public and healthcare stakeholders.

219,"[/INST] A Comparison of iris-fixed Artisan Lens Implantation with Excimer Laser in Situ Keratomileusis in the Correction of Myopia (Karimov 2011) evaluated the two surgical methods for correction of myopia: iris-fixed phakic intraocular lens implantation and PRK using the Artisan lens and LASIK, respectively with a sample size of 90 eyes. The study was a prospective randomized clinical trial. The results suggested that both surgical procedures have similar efficacy and similar refractive stability up to one year postoperatively. Significantly higher predictability (+/-1.00 D and +/-1.50 D) was observed in the Artisan group after 6 months. The Artisan lens group also demonstrated significant visual and refractive improvement up to 12 months while in the PRK group a loss of visual and refractive results was observed at 6 months."

221,"[/INST] The summaries of the studies reveal that Penfluridol was evaluated for its efficacy in schizophrenia in a series of randomized, double-blind and single-blind studies. Penfluridol, which was the oldest oral long-acting antipsychotic injected every week, was effective in controlling the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and also in controlling the residual symptoms of schizophrenia. It was effective in both acute and chronic schizophrenia. No major side effects were associated with Penfluridol."
222,"[/INST] Based on the provided texts, the study concludes that there are several treatment options for melioidosis, such as TMP-SMZ, ceftazidime, trimethoprim, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, amoxicillin/clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and combination of doxycycline and amoxicillin/clavulanate. The study recommends the use of trimethoprim and doxycycline or amoxicillin/clavulanate for maintenance therapy."
223,"[/INST] Based on the extracted results, antibiotics such as amoxicillin did not improve symptoms significantly compared with placebo in patients with acute rhinosinusitis in the short term. However, these patients were clinically diagnosed with acute sinusitis, and patients with acute rhinosinusitis were only enrolled when they had purulent discharge present for at least seven days, the diagnosis of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis is still in question and, furthermore, antibiotic use was safe and did not cause serious adverse events during the short-term treatment."
224,"[/INST] The above-provided information is summarized from seven studies related to the clinical trial. Overall, there were two kinds of laxatives investigated. Among them, PEG was found to have a greater efficacy than Lactulose in relieving constipation. In addition, it had favorable effects on colonic flora compared with Lactulose, which caused a decrease in the total short chain fatty acids. However, PEG appears to be safe and effective in treating constipation in children over 8 years old."
225,"[/INST] Desmopressin is effective for monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis., [20, 21, 23] but when compared to tricyclic antidepressants [13, 22] its effect is short-lived . When compared with a placebo  imipramine appears to be effective in children. Tolterodine, a non-selective anticholinergic drug, has also shown promise in management of nocturnal enuresis and has fewer side effects than imipramine. [24, 25] A more recent study also shows that tolterodine and imipramine may also be effective in children with therapy-resistant enuresis.  However, tolterodine and other drugs such as oxybutynin which are less likely to cause anticholinergic side effects than desmopressin, did not result in a statistically significant difference in number of dry nights than the placebo.  In a recent prospective study, atomoxetine improved bladder control in 35% of enuretic patients when other anticholinergic and antidepressant drugs failed to work. However, the study was an open-label efficacy test and therefore should only be used as a suggestion of atomoxetine's effectiveness until definitive test results can be gathered."

Acupuncture massage has been reported to be beneficial in reducing pain and disability. Massage therapy has also been reported to be effective in treating subacute low back pain. Exercise, acupressure and relaxation have not been found to be effective in reducing disability, but may have effects on pain."
227,"[/INST] Sleeping sickness is a disease caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma brucei. This parasite is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected tsetse flies. There are two main forms of the disease, depending on which type of Trypanosoma is present: T. brucei rhodesiense infection produces a more acute form of the disease, known as East African sleeping sickness; T. brucei gambiense causes a chronic form, known as West African sleeping sickness."
228,"[/INST] The first study is a trial comparing high-volume versus low-volume fluid intake in premature infants. The high-volume group was given an additional 47 ml/kg/day, and the low-volume group received 20 ml/kg/day above baseline requirements. The high-volume group had a higher risk of congestive heart failure than the low-volume group and also a higher risk of necrotizing enterocolitis. The second study aimed to determine if restricting fluid even further during the perinatal period would improve fluid balance and clinical outcomes. The groups received 120 vs 40-80 ml/kg/day during the first week of life. The restricted group had better electrolyte and metabolic profiles and there were no significant differences in acute adverse effects. The third study was an RCT comparing restrictive fluid volumes versus a control group in low-birth-weight infants. In the restricted fluid group, the volume given from day 1 to day 7 was 40, 60, 80, 100, and 120 ml/kg/day, while the control group received volumes of 80, 100, 120, 150 ml/kg/day on the first 7 days. In the restricted group, there were significantly fewer diagnoses of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and higher weight gain at 28 days and term. The fourth study also supports fluid restriction based on clinical outcomes. A daily cumulative weight loss of 4% was compared with 8%, and the authors found fewer diagnoses of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and necrotizing enterocolitis and less need for renal replacement therapy in the 4% restriction group. The fifth study looked at the effects of very different fluid administration strategies in premature babies in the first three days of life. Two groups received either 60 or 150 ml/kg/day. The higher fluid group produced much larger urine volumes and significantly greater weight loss over the three days. There were no statistically significant differences in endogenous creatinine clearance or acute kidney injury."
229,"[/INST] In a multi-center prospective randomized controlled trial, patients randomized to artificial disc replacement and fusion showed comparable pain and disability outcomes in two and three years after surgery (2-2.5) . Patients in both groups had significant pain relief up to six months after surgery. However, there were significantly higher satisfaction and return to work rates in the Total Disc Replacement group as compared to the Fusion group (2-2.5). In other randomized controlled trials, both procedures were found comparable in terms of pain relief and disability outcomes [26–30]. All three meta-analyses report similar findings [31–33]."
230,"[/INST] Nine of the included RCTs assessed the combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Seven of the nine RCTs assessed different chemotherapy combinations with radiotherapy. Different radiotherapy combinations such as conformal, accelerated and hyperfractionated were reported. The control groups included radiotherapy alone or placebo. The remaining two RCTs assessed radiotherapy with prophylactic cisplatin and radiotherapy combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Only one RCT reported OS in favour of chemotherapy with cisplatin and procarbazine. For the remaining outcomes, only one RCT reported a statistically significant difference in favour of chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin. Three of the remaining RCTs reported a statistically significant improvement in non inferior outcomes."

233,"[/INST] The study authors found that community based group exercise programs are beneficial after stroke but may not be sufficient to sustain improvements. Physiotherapist late intervention after stroke was found to result in improvements in mobility but these improvements did not persist over time. Task-related circuit training resulted in short-term improvements of loco-motor function compared with controls. Task-orientated progressive resistance strength training is an intervention that could be easily integrated into community rehabilitation programs which has been found to improve the muscle strength of all muscle groups significantly. There are also functional improvements seen in the study. This was supported to various degrees by the remaining 5 studies that all focused on ambulatory subjects. Overall, a common theme of improvement in overall mobility was seen in the treatment groups in all seven articles."

235,"[/INST] Four randomized studies with four different drug combinations [carbamazepine taper/prednisolone, carbamazepine/tegretol, carbamazepine/nortriptyline-fluphenazine, and amitriptyline/carbamazepine] were assessed on the potential treatment of post-herpetic neuralgia. The results from Study #1, #3, #4, #6 and #14 showed favorable outcomes for the combination of prednisolone/carbamazepine, tegretol, nortriptyline-fluphenazine and carbamazepine/amitriptyline as a first-line treatment for the post-herpetic neuralgia. On the other hand, the results of Studies #2 and #5 showed low efficacy for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy and trigeminal neuralgia, respectively using the combination of tegretol/carbamazepine and prednisolone/carbamazepine. It must be also stated that the duration of carbamazepine use was linked with adverse side effects."

237,"[/INST] Study #1: Neonatal intervention program.. A randomized 3-arm intervention study was conducted to determine the effects of early intervention program on cognitive development of babies who weighed below 1500 grams at birth. Study #2: Physical development of low birthweight premature infants.. Physical assessments (Hass et al 1958) were conducted on low birthweight premature (LBP) infants at birth, 1, 2, and 3 months of corrected age to determine the effectiveness of physical intervention using the Beebe-Jordan 1954 Neonatal Care Record in promoting physical development in LBP infants. Study #3: Low birth weight babies: physical development at 1 and 2 months of age.. The children were grouped into three: 1) normal birth weight (NBW) 2410 to 2800 g, 2) extremely low birth weight (ELBW) 1000 to 1400 g and 3) low birth weight (LBW) 1401 to 2400 g. Each group was assessed twice at the ages of 1 and 2 months. The mean weight difference between groups is < 1 lb (428 g). Study #4: Developmental outcome for very low birthweight infants: Early Intervention Program.. The EIP interventionist visited the family's home weekly, conducting treatment with the infant during normal waking hours..Study #5: Early intervention program for infants of mothers addicted to heroin.. To our knowledge, no such controlled study has previously been conducted. The aim of the present study was to investigate an intervention that would improve the level of functioning in mother-infant pairs where the infant was at risk due to maternal addiction to opioids. The effectiveness of the intervention team's work was established by measuring maternal and infant functioning levels before and after the intervention (Sandman et al. 1983). Study #6: Risk and resilience in families: A neuropsychological and contextual analysis; the role of early intervention. Two risk contexts were considered: i) high risk due to significant prenatal exposure to drugs (HERO) i.e. heroine; and ii) high risk due to significant emotional, physical, and sexual abuse of the child (H"

239,"[/INST] Studies have shown that the CIC formulation is effective in controlling asthma and is well tolerated, with a good safety profile. The studies also compared CIC to FP in terms of asthma control as measured by asthma control test scores and found that CIC was equally effective as FP in controlling asthma . These studies also compared CIC to FP in terms of lung function measures and found that CIC was equally effective as FP in improving lung function in patients with asthma . One study compared CIC and FP in terms of their effects on airway remodeling and found that both drugs were equally effective in reducing airway remodeling . Finally, the studies compared the safety of CIC and FP and found that CIC was safer with regards to adverse events such as pneumonia and oral candidiasis . Overall, these studies suggest that CIC is a safe and effective treatment option for asthma comparable to FP."

241,"[/INST] The studies examined the effectiveness of influenza vaccination of health care workers at reducing mortality of elderly patients in long-term care facilities. Four studies examined the effect of vaccination on elderly patients, with or without nursing care services. Vaccination programs were associated with a reduction of influenza-related complications and mortality in three studies [3, 4] . One study found a significant reduction in the number of influenza-related outbreaks in long-term care facilities for the elderly and a reduction in the probability of having influenza in the elderly residents (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.07 to 0.81, p < 0.05) . In a fourth study , vaccination of health care workers was associated with a reduction of mortality of patients in long-term care facilities for the elderly but not with a reduction of virologically detectable influenza infections."
242,"[/INST] This paper presents a systematic review on the effects of pelvic floor muscle exercises (PFMEs) for male urinary incontinence following radical or transurethral prostatectomy. The 53 included papers were categorized in four groups as systematic reviews, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), prospective and retrospective cohort studies, and non-randomized control trials (non-RCTs). Overall, there was low to moderate methodological quality and an overall moderate quality of evidence for the positive effects of PFMEs on improving pelvic floor muscle strength, functional outcome parameters (objective and subjective), quality of life, and on decreasing episodes of urinary leakage compared to an inactive control. Evidence from RCTs on the effectiveness of PFMEs on clinical outcome parameters regarding urinary incontinence compared to sham exercises was moderate to low. Evidence from cohort studies was very low to moderate. Thus, available evidence supports that pelvic floor muscle exercises may be effective on different outcome parameters after prostatectomy. However, there are some concerns regarding the lack of long-term data, insufficient evidence for a reduction of the use of pads and the insufficient information on patient's adherence to PFMEs. In summary, PFMEs appear to be effective in managing UI after prostatectomy in the male. However, more evidence is needed to further support this therapeutic approach."
243,"[/INST] Fish oil did not significantly influence appetite, tiredness, nausea, well-being, caloric intake, nutritional status, or function after 2 weeks compared with placebo in patients with advanced cancer and loss of both weight and appetite. N-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid, may possess anticachectic properties. An EPA supplement administered alone resulted in a lower percentage of weight gain >or= 10% compared with those taking megestrol acetate. EPA supplement did not improve weight or appetite better than megestrol acetate alone. EPA-EE did not significantly inhibit lipolysis or lipid oxidation in weight-losing cancer patients. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids increased the ratio of T-helper cells to T-suppressor cells in malnourished patients. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids restored the immunodeficiency and prolonged the survival for well-nourished and malnourished patients with generalized malignancy."
244,"[/INST] 1. We identified 12 relevant abstracts published in English language medical journals that were included in our study . 2. The 12 studies described 11 randomized controlled trials that evaluated different methods of pain relief during different surgical procedures performed on the cervix including laser vaporization, laser surgery, cryosurgery, and cryotherapy. 3. The studies ranged in size, with the largest study having 198 patients and the smallest study having 5 patients. 4. Various outcomes were used to assess the effectiveness of the interventions. Pain was the most common outcome, which was evaluated by a visual analogue scale or verbal rating scale in 9 studies. Others outcomes such as patient satisfaction, anaesthetic success, or willingness to undergo a similar procedure at follow up were also assessed in some studies. 5. In five studies, an injectable form of local anaesthesia was compared to a placebo or no treatment. In five studies, a topical form of local anaesthesia was compared to a placebo or no treatment. In two studies, a pre-prepared injectable agent that contained local anaesthetic and a nerve stimulator was compared to placebo or no treatment. In the one remaining study, electrical stimulation was compared to transcutaneous administration of a topical anaesthetic. 6. None of the five studies assessing injectable local anaesthetic with a nerve stimulator found evidence to support their use, with scores and scales not being significantly altered regardless of anaesthetic use or whether electric stimulation was performed during the procedure. 7. The studies assessing topical analgesics found that all, except for two, significantly reduced pain and increased anaesthesia satisfaction as compared to placebo or no treatment (no studies assessed pain and satisfaction in placebo groups). 8. Six studies that assessed infiltrative injection versus topical application and three studies that assessed topical application of anaesthetic alone versus placebo found that topical application was significantly associated with lower pain and higher satisfaction levels."
245,"[/INST] The summary of the 11 papers (studies #1-11) suggests that the interventions and control groups differ between studies, as does the length and frequency of the intervention sessions, the age groups that were targeted, and the settings of the studies (schools vs research centers). The studies also focused on different age groups related to sexual abuse, with the majority focusing on younger children (third grade, elementary grades) and two focusing on middle school/high school ages. The focus of the intervention was mainly on improving the victim's ability to recognize the behaviors leading up to abuse, with some focusing on providing skills to respond to abusive situations. The studies varied in the tools they used to measure the effectiveness of the intervention, with many assessing the participants immediately after the intervention or at a short-term follow-up. Few studies assessed participants at a long-term follow-up to determine the impact of the intervention. As shown in the table, the majority of the studies yielded promising results in terms of showing that the intervention was effective. While the majority of the studies are from the US, they were conducted in a variety of different settings and geographic areas. This demonstrates that effective sexual abuse prevention programs can be implemented in a variety of settings. The studies were conducted at different time points in the past, but the majority are from within the past 10 years. The table also shows that the results of the studies are consistent across time. Additionally, the studies were conducted using a variety of different research designs, which makes the results more generalizable to other populations and settings. Overall, the table highlights the diversity of the studies included in the analysis and the consistency of results across different types of intervention and research designs."

247,"[/INST] Based on the findings from the above four study abstracts, it can be concluded that weight loss and sodium intake reduction had positive effects on blood pressure levels when used individually or in combination. However, it can be noted that the beneficial effects in lowering systolic and diastolic blood pressure began to diminish after a certain period, and thus long-term follow-up of participants is necessary. It can also be inferred that replacing common salt with potassium-enriched salt had a significant impact on CVD mortality and medical expenditure."

250,"[/INST] The Cochrane Review, ""Prophylactic antibiotics for transurethral resection of the prostate"" (Rothwell et al. 2010, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews 2010, Issue 6) comprises seven eligible published trials and three additional unpublished trials. Six of the published trials found antibiotic prophylaxis to be effective in preventing surgical site infections after TURP (Lawrence & Ritter 1963, Van der Eijk et al. 1973, Sandvik et al. 1995, Wester et al. 2001, El Mekawy et al. 2003, Bollens et al. 2007), while one trial found that antibiotic prophylaxis did not decrease mortality or reoperation for infection (Rossi et al. 1973). One trial assessed perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis versus no prophylaxis (Wester et al. 2001). In six additional patients randomized, antibiotic prophylaxis (5% ciprofloxacin or cephazolin for two days or single-dose or two-dose cystotic aminoglycoside) was effective in preventing urinary tract infection; this evidence is considered very low quality in the absence of comparator groups. Of the eight trials that included a comparator group or placebo group, comparators included antibiotic prophylaxis at other times (seven studies) and no comparator group. Two published trials included the same study group, while one trial comprised two study groups (one included a comparator group and one had no comparator group). The latter trial excluded renal impairment, age over 80 years, severe cardiovascular disease, or diabetes. Overall, the Cochrane group concluded that, ""Antibiotic prophylaxis for resection of the prostate appears to reduce the risk of infection compared to no antibiotics."""
