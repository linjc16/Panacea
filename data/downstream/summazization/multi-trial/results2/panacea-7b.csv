Alteplase is a genetically modified variant of the metalloproteinase, fibrolase, that has the potential to restore function to occluded central venous access devices rapidly and safely. It has been shown to dissolve thrombi more rapidly than the standard dose previously studied, but it is still not completely clear what dose of alteplase achieves the best balance between efficacy and safety. Another study suggested that recombinant urokinase (r-UK) 5000 IU/ml was superior to placebo in restoring total catheter patency to occluded CVADs. Urokinase was significantly better than placebo in restoring catheter function. It is recommended for future clinical use.
Moreover, low-dose urokinase infusions can restore function to the majority of catheters occluded by fibrin sleeves. Adding heparin to the urokinase does not enhance the efficacy of the infusions. The restored function often persists until the VADs are removed.
Therefore, a single 1-, 3-mg dose of low-dose alteplase will be compared with 320 U of heparin. If the efficacy of these two doses is equivalent, the dose-response curve of alteplase can be defined, which can help clinicians achieve the best balance between efficacy and safety. In addition, future studies are recommended to investigate the effect of intracardiac injection of thrombolytic drug for clot removal in the catheterization laboratory of hospital."

Antibiotic prophylaxis significantly reduces the incidence of peristomal wound and systemic infections associated with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The evidence is strongest for prophylaxis with single-dose antibiotics prior to percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. The effect of postoperative antibiotics is unclear as most of these trials were underpowered to detect an effect and future trials will need to adequately address this methodological limitation."

In summary, the effectiveness of low sodium diets in the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension has been widely studied. Contrary to expectations, the overall results have been equivocal and there is a lack of conclusive evidence to support the use of low sodium diets in this group of patients. There are a number of possible explanations, including the small size or under powering of trials, and the variability of the interventions (doses, duration, adherence and compliance of diet, monitoring, feedback, training, etc). Most trials lacked appropriate controls, randomisation, proper blinding, and masking. Furthermore, the magnitude of the effect on blood pressure is small and unlikely to provide a clinically important benefit, and has not been sustained over the long term. There are studies that showed significant reduction in blood pressure from low sodium diets, but none of those have shown a sustained effect beyond 3 years. There are no clearly defined criteria or guidelines for the diagnosis or management of dietary induced hypertension. Although patients with mild hypertension could benefit little or nothing from a low salt diet, the general population could gain from it, but it requires a substantial reduction of the dietary sodium intake across the whole population. Large scale community-based studies are necessary to determine the long-term effects of a low sodium diet in treated or untreated hypertensives."

The results of the RCTs suggest that using GnRH antagonists alongside a GnRH agonist protocol or starting stimulation with agonist alone instead of hMG is more effective. The use of GnRH antagonists could reduce the risk of early luteinisation in IVF cycles by half. However, there is only limited evidence that any type of GnRH agonist protocol is superior to others.
Some studies suggest decreasing the duration of agonist treatment improves outcome. However, the evidence is inconsistent.
There is no benefit for reducing agonist dose, increasing frequency of administration or reducing the cycle interval.
The evidence for the use of GnRH agonists in IVF cycles is inconsistent. However, it is unlikely that there would be an improvement in outcome by stopping the agonist treatment."

The use of a distal vein or cuff during bypass in the infragenicular segment has been reported frequently in the vascular literature. Different results have been published, but most of these reports do not allow us to draw definitive conclusions regarding this intervention. We therefore undertook this prospective, randomised, multicentre trial to assess the impact of a distal vein cuff during infragenicular infrainguinal bypass. 1318 patients with a distal vein cuff and 1344 patients without a distal vein cuff were followed for 1 yr or later. At 1 yr, 84% and 80% of the bypasses in the cuff and no-cuff groups, respectively, were still patent (P = .7). The same percentage of patients survived in the two groups during the follow-up period (93% vs 96%). The same results were found at 2 yrs and 3 yrs. These results indicate that the use of a distal vein cuff during an infrainguinal bypass does not improve the primary patency rate or limb salvage.."

Antibiotic therapy is an effective treatment for chronic osteomyelitis in adults. Both oral and parenteral routes of delivery of antibiotics are effective in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. Oral ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin monotherapy appear to be as effective as standard parenteral therapy due to cefazolin or nafcillin plus aminoglycosides. However, caution is needed regarding resistance to this class of drugs. Adverse reactions are rare, even though an isolated drug-related neutropenia occurred in one of seven patients treated with fluoroquinolones. The combination of oral ciprofloxacin plus rifampin is worthwhile further study since it does significantly increase cure rates when compared to standard therapy alone.."

The potential benefits of acupuncture in the context of stroke treatment have been the subject of numerous studies. However, the results remain inconclusive. Some studies have reported that acupuncture may have additional value to standard stroke rehabilitation, while others have found no significant differences between the two treatment approaches. The evidence is currently insufficient to establish the efficacy of acupuncture in improving functional outcome and quality of life after stroke. Furthermore, the findings of several trials suggest that the placebo effect might play a role in the reported benefits of acupuncture. Further high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to provide reliable evidence for or against the use of acupuncture in the treatment of stroke patients.."

Zanamivir prophylaxis for influenza type A and B was found to be very effective, achieving 81% protective efficacy against development of symptoms among family members exposed to an index case.
Three trials that tested early treatment with oseltamivir among children found that the medication reduced symptom duration and improved symptom severity in children with symptomatic influenza. Treatment of household contacts with zanamivir or oseltamivir when given as soon as possible, either as prophylaxis after exposure to an index case or treatment initiated as soon as possible after symptom onset, was effective in reducing illness among household contacts and also reduced the likelihood of illness transmission to other family members. In addition, the medication was safe and well tolerated."

For all procedures, the catheter should be removed 18-24 hours after the operation so that the patient can start voiding spontaneously. In all cases, the catheter should be left for at least 4 hours following surgery. Patients who have incontinence should not have the catheter removed until they are able to void spontaneously. If the catheter is not removed at the correct time, problems with voiding are likely to manifest themselves and result in an increased risk of urinary tract infection as well as prolonged hospital stays."

There are several psychological treatments currently available for children and adolescents with anxiety disorders. These include cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT), family therapy, exposure and relaxation, school-based interventions, and others. However, a growing body of evidence in the U.S. and abroad has demonstrated the effectiveness of various drug treatments for anxiety disorders, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and various tricyclic and heterocyclic antidepressants. Therefore, clinicians may at times recommend a combination of medication and psychotherapy.
It remains unclear which medication, psychotherapy or combination is most effective. The investigators proposed to conduct a randomized controlled trial in which they compare two medications to a placebo, and to examine whether the combination of medication and psychotherapy is more efficacious than medication alone.
The investigators sought to recruit 200 patients with anxiety disorders and to include in the study at least 100 patients younger than 10 who meet the criteria of separation anxiety disorder."

Overall, the studies suggest that palliative hepatic artery infusion of floxuridine is an effective treatment for improving survival in patients with colorectal liver metastases. Other chemotherapies such as 5-FU and capecitabine were also found to improve survival, albeit to a lesser extent. The studies show mixed results on the benefit of primary versus delayed chemotherapy, with no clear consensus on the best approach. Oral flucytosine after tumor resection improved disease-free survival in one study, but not in another. Quality of life may be improved by hepatic artery infusion of chemotherapy, but this could not be established in all studies. More research is needed to determine the most effective and cost-effective treatment approaches for patients with advanced gastrointestinal malignancies."

Acupuncture without needles is gaining interest as a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain.
                STUDY OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of subcutaneous injections of sterile water in relieving lower back pain during labor in Japanese women.
                DESIGN: A randomized, double-blinded, and placebo-controlled trial.
                SETTING: An international maternity hospital with 300-400 deliveries and 400-600 postpartum admissions annually.
                SAMPLES: This study included 100 consecutive parturients who delivered vaginally.
                INTERVENTIONS: Acupuncture-like injections of 0.5 mL sterile water or normal saline were administered subcutaneously to the lumbosacral area. Assessments were made for pain before and after the injections using an 11-point graded horizontal line. All assessments were done by the obstetrical nurse who was unaware of whether the patients received sterile water or saline.
                MAIN RESULTS: The mean pain score was significantly reduced in both groups, from 6.9 (SD = 2.04) to 2.6 (SD = 1.39) in the sterile water group and from 6.6 (SD = 2.07) to 2.2 (SD = 1.67) in the saline group.
                CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous sterile water injection provided a temporary but significant decrease of pain in laboring women..

Study #8: Labour pain treated with subcutaneous injections of sterile water, acupuncture or intracutaneous injections of sterile water: a randomized, controlled study.. It is unclear if the effects of sterile water injections, which have been shown to be an effective treatment for a variety of clinical conditions, including labour pain, is due to placebo, the intracutaneous acupoint mechanism or the substance itself. The aim of this study was to investigate the analgesic effect of the intracutaneous and subcutaneous method of administering sterile water compared with conventional acupuncture.

In general, smoking cessation programs delivered by physicians in routine settings can be useful. Brief interventions based on relapse prevention principles and minimal interventions appear to be the most promising. The results indicate that minimal interventions, with advice supported by a booklet, were more effective than advice alone in stopping smoking. Incorporating nicotine gum into brief interventions is an approach that could increase the number and success rate of smoking cessation attempts among smokers.
Further research is needed to examine the most effective and least burdensome approaches to delivering physician-based smoking cessation interventions. However, existing evidence from this review suggests that even brief interventions that deliver support and advice may be beneficial."

There is no consensus as to the most effective second-line treatment for patients with psoriatic arthritis who fail to respond adequately to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs. Although a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of sulphasalazine versus placebo showed no significant difference in disease activity in patients with this condition, both therapies were found to be safe. The other trials examined in this article show variable results, with one or two trials for each therapy demonstrating a clinically meaningful response. The available evidence suggests that all therapies except auranofin are potentially beneficial in patients with psoriatic arthritis, although none is consistently effective. Few or none of the studies evaluated the efficacy of these therapies in a homogeneous subpopulation of patients with psoriatic arthritis. Further studies on therapies in subgroups of patients and also in patients who have progressed to deforming arthritis are urgently required before firm conclusions can be drawn on optimal therapy."

Substantial progress has been made over time in identifying drug abuse treatment components that enhance treatment outcomes. Nonetheless, research indicates that many more of these dually dependent patients are needed, and that it remains a significant challenge to develop an effective maintenance intervention for these patients.
This protocol is a randomized clinical trial for methadone-maintained cocaine dependent patients that compares the efficacy of two forms of abstinence reinforcement. One treatment group receives reinforcement for both cocaine abstinence and opioid abstinence, and the other group receives reinforcement only for cocaine abstinence. Both treatments will be provided in weekly counseling sessions for 12 weeks, along with other counseling interventions that are part of the standard methadone treatment program. At baseline and at the end of 12 weeks, urinalysis results, psychosocial functioning, and counseling attendance are measured. After a 3-month extension phase, participants will receive incentives for providing cocaine-negative urine samples for another 12 weeks. During Weeks 3- through week 12-of the 12-week treatment phase, participants will be randomly assigned to receive an additional voucher for cocaine-free urine samples. Incentives are provided in the form of prepaid phone cards and personal electronic banking accounts (E-bank). E-bank has the advantage of allowing reinforcers to be immediately transferred to voucher holders, to help reduce impulsivity and delay future drug use.
Methadone maintenance clinics in Baltimore, Chicago, Lexington, Minneapolis, New York, and New Haven were selected for the study.
For this study, a positive urine test is defined as:
- A benzodiazepine positive specimen with a cocaine-negative specimen during the prior period.
- A benzodiazepine and a cocaine-positive specimen.
Urinalysis specimens that are negative for cocaine, benzodiazepines, and opiates are defined as drug-free specimens.
- Combined opiate and cocaine-free urine sample.

Several studies have addressed the effect of aldosterone blockade on proteinuria, blood pressure, and renal function in diabetic nephropathy. This study was designed to test whether adding spironolactone to standard treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II (AngII) receptor blocker would bring further benefit. In 2 multicentre, parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials we assessed the effects of this strategy by performing a 1-year follow-up.
                Addition of spironolactone to treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an AngII receptor blocker was associated with a marked reduction in proteinuria by 30-35%. The observed reduction is larger than the reduction of proteinuria seen in patients who receive an ACE inhibitor or an AngII receptor blocker alone. Addition of spironolactone also induced a significant reduction in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 3-6 ml/min over the 1-year follow-up. However, this reduction remained below the mean rate of decline seen in patients with diabetic nephropathy who receive treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an AngII receptor blocker alone. This rate of decline in eGFR was reduced in patients who received spironolactone compared with patients who received placebo.
                Adding spironolactone to treatment with an ACE inhibitor or an AngII receptor blocker is associated with a consistent and significant reduction in proteinuria, even when patients are already receiving their maximum tolerated dose of these drugs. The magnitude of reduction in urinary protein excretion seen in these studies is similar to that seen in previous interventional studies with ACE inhibitors and AngII receptor blockers. We did not observe an increase in serum potassium during the 1-year follow-up when taking maximum care for safety. A modest decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate was observed, but the average decline in renal function was lower in patients who received spironolactone than in those who received placebo. This strategy, which was very well tolerated, is highly appealing as a treatment for diabetic neph"

The use of antenatal corticosteroids to promote fetal lung maturation remains standard; thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), however, has remained controversial because of lack of consensus on its value and the limited number of infants included in the meta-analyses to assess its true mortality benefits. Here we provide the outcome of a meta-analysis of the recently completed TRH Study and a second planned analysis of the two completed TRH trials and the previously published meta-analysis to assess the effects of antenatal TRH on mortality.
                In the original meta-analysis, we determined that in the absence of random effects, the relative risk (RR) for death of the TRH-treated infants versus controls was 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.61 to 1.06; p = 0.12). This analysis, which included 2553 infants delivered from 1058 women at 24-plus-6/7 to 33-plus-6/7 weeks from a meta-analysis of four randomized trials in the general preterm population, showed a trend toward a reduction in deaths because of early TRH treatment. In the second planned analysis, which included 3239 infants delivered from 1192 women at 24-plus-6/7 to 33-plus-6/7 weeks, we found no significant difference between TRH-treated infants and controls (RR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.65 to 1.10). The mortality rates for deaths of any cause (13.6 percent versus 15.9 percent), air bubble-related deaths (1.8 percent versus 2.3 percent), and deaths related to the use of norepinephrine therapy (2.8 percent versus 2.6 percent) were not significantly different.
                In our original and second planned meta-analysis, including studies before March 2000, we identified a highly significant reduction (RR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61 to 0.91) in infant death among preterm infants exposed to antenatal TRH. However, after March 200"

The summary of these studies suggests that diflunisal is an effective analgesic in the relievement of moderate to severe pain in various post-operative settings. Its duration of action varies from 4 to 12 hours depending on the study. Comparison with other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, acetaminophen, and suprofen indicates that diflunisal is as effective or even more effective in relieving pain.

The antiepileptic effects of vigabatrin as add-on therapy have been evaluated in randomized multicentre clinical trials in adults. Vigabatrin 1-6 g/day is as effective as other standard antiepileptic agents in seizure reduction in patients with drug-resistant partial seizures, and is safe and well tolerated. The higher the dose, the greater the potential to control seizures. Vigabatrin has no interaction with other commonly used antiepileptic drugs, and increases the efficacy of carbamazepine as assessed by reduction in seizure frequency. Vigabatrin is the first and only known GABAergic anti-epileptic drug. Gamma-Vinyl GABA might be suitable for use in patients with a high risk of relapse. In a number of large clinical trials, Vigabatrin has been approved as an antiepileptic drug in many countries.

Caveats:
Some side effects are more pronounced than those traditionally noted with antiepileptic drugs. The adverse reactions are of minor significance and do not lead to any serious medical conditions. In clinical trials, the incidence of mild side effects increases according to the daily dose of Vigabatrin."

When patients show inadequate control of their asthma, current guidelines recommend either increasing the dose of inhaled corticosteroids or adding long-acting β2 adrenoceptor agonist. Long-acting β2 agonist therapy is clinically superior to additional ICS and increases the risk of exacerbation compared to the reference treatment. It may be an effective treatment option for patients who do not respond to added medium to high dose ICS and has more advantages than higher dose ICS when it comes to tolerability and convenience.
No clinically relevant adverse effects of added long-acting β2 agonist therapy have been observed compared with higher dose ICS. Long-acting β2 agonists offer effective and safe treatment for patients who do not achieve sufficient asthma control after increasing the dose of ICS."

Elderly patients with hip fractures have poor outcomes, regardless of treatment used. This is the conclusion of a systematic review of 27 randomised trials involving 3,133 patients, published in The Lancet in 1994. The review found that all three treatments studied--internal or external fixation and hemiarthroplasty--are associated with a high risk of reoperation and with only a short increase in pain-free range of hip motion. There is no evidence to suggest that one type of treatment is superior to the others. In the same year, an analysis of the Cochrane database summarises nine trials on the treatment of hip fracture, comparing hemiarthroplasty and internal fixation. The review concludes that the results of trials published since 1986 show hemiarthroplasty is preferable to internal fixation."

Short-term oxygen therapy (1-4 hours) is a widely accepted and effective treatment of hypoxaemia during rest and activities in COPD patients. It significantly improves oxygenation in non-hypoxaemic COPD patients and may improve their symptomatic status, exercise tolerance and health related quality of life. However, the results of randomised controlled trials are conflicting, as exercise tolerance is not consistently and significantly improved. The efficacy of short-term oxygen therapy needs to be evaluated on an individual patient basis to identify the subgroups who benefit to a greater extent from this treatment. Several studies have shown, that COPD patients develop exercise tolerance during physical therapy and short-term (2 or 4 hours) oxygen therapy is not likely to increase their exercise tolerance substantially. Several methods to avoid and decrease exercise induced dyspnoea by pharmacological intervention prior exercise in COPD patients are currently investigated. They may be also effective to reduce dyspnoea during short-term oxygen therapy.
Oxygen concentrations of less than 1% are not effective in increasing oxygenation in COPD patients and are therefore unlikely to be effective in the treatment of dyspnoea and improving exercise tolerance in well-oxygenated patients walking for daily activities. In well-oxygenated patients walking for longer distances oxygen concentrations less than 5% of compressed air may have similar or even greater effects. In the past, portable oxygen therapy has been used for several hours a day when walking, eating, taking medication, and sleeping. The oxygen concentrations used for oxygen therapy usually range between 24 and 50%. The maximum benefit in terms of improvements in dyspnoea and exercise tolerance may be achieved by oxygen concentrations of less than 40%.
               In conclusion, oxygen during activities may be clinically effective in COPD patients, but individual patient assessment for an optimised symptom management is necessary."

Home-based interventions in the management of HIV have been supported through studies showing that they improve clinical outcomes and may be cost-effective. Improvements in quality of life can be seen across different aspects of home-based interventions. These include medication adherence, nutrition, and psychological aspects. The effect of interventions on mortality has been inconclusive. Further research is needed to explore mechanisms of action and to understand the effect of time in the management of HIV. The long-term impact of home-based care interventions on clinical outcomes and costs of treatment remains to be defined.

It seems that beta blockers (metoprolol, atenolol, pindolol), alpha-methyldopa and calcium channel antagonists (nifedipine) have similar advantages in the prevention of maternal and fetal effects of pregnancy-induced hypertension, although there is a need for more controlled and larger randomized trials to define the most effective therapy. A recent review concluded that methyldopa may be a useful alternative to beta blockers in the treatment of mild hypertension in pregnancy, especially at an earlier stage of pregnancy than beta blockers. There is also a need for further trials comparing the effects of methyldopa and beta blockers in the development of severe hypertension in pregnancy. A recent study comparing the effects of methyldopa, beta blockers and labetalol in the treatment of severe preeclampsia found no differences in the incidence of perinatal morbidity and mortality between the groups. In addition, several studies indicate that alpha-methyldopa and beta blockers may have unfavourable effects on fetal outcome (e.g. intrauterine growth retardation) compared to the use of no or minimal antihypertensive therapy. Based on current evidence, calcium channel antagonists (in particular nifedipine) seem to be a safe and effective treatment for hypertension in pregnancy. However, there is a need for further controlled trials. We have previously reviewed the effects of magnesium sulphate in the treatment of eclampsia and severe hypertension of pregnancy. Magnesium appears to be effective in reducing the risk of subsequent seizures in women with eclampsia. However, there is insufficient evidence to show that magnesium can reduce the incidence of maternal or fetal morbidity or mortality.."

In peripheral arterial disease (PAD), n3 PUFAs induces a marked improvement in endothelial function. However, they do not affect the inflammatory status. In future, large, prospective studies are needed to investigate whether n3 PUFAs, by improving endothelial function, would reduce the incidence of ischemic events in a population at high risk.. Fish oil supplementation does not significantly improve walking distances in patients with stable claudication. Randomized controlled trials of fish oil supplementation in patients with PAD are required.. In contrast to the studies demonstrating significant increases in treadmill performance with dietary EPA and DHA, the studies focusing on fish oil supplementation in patients with PAD reported only limited or no significant effects of eicosapentaenoic acid. The limited studies in patients with intermittent claudication and PAD found no improvements of treadmill or laboratory performance.. A prospective randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial was undertaken to examine the effect of fish oil supplementation on markers of atherosclerosis in patients with intermittent claudication. Sixty-six patients aged over 59 years were randomized to a dietary supplement of fish oil (6 g/day) or soybean oil for 12 months. There were no differences between the groups with regard to walking distance, brachial artery diameter and flow-mediated dilation, intima-media thickness, mean arterial pressure, lipid profile, lipoprotein(a) and homocysteinemia, or clinical events. Fish oil supplementation for 12 months does not appear to exert any significant effects on endothelial function or arterial stiffness, or to prevent clinical or subclinical events in patients with intermittent claudication (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS).. The results of short-term trials of dietary supplementation with fish oil and/or PUFA are generally positive but need to be supported by longer term data.

Based on the available studies, telephone-delivered interventions have shown mixed results in terms of their impact on adherence to antiretroviral treatment, medication adherence, and depression outcomes among HIV-infected individuals.

Further, the studies varied in terms of the outcome measures used, including adherence rates, improvement in medication adherence using data from biweekly unannounced pill counts, and improvements in depressive symptoms and overall levels of psychiatric distress. Despite the differences in the studies, the results suggest that some interventions may have an impact on adherence and depression outcomes.

Cinacalcet is a promising medication for the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on hemodialysis. It effectively reduces parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels and improves calcium-phosphorus homeostasis in hemodialysis patients with uncontrolled secondary hyperparathyroidism. These effects occur with or without concomitant use of vitamin D sterols and can be initiated by an intravenous infusion at times of hospitalization. Furthermore, cinacalcet provides a novel treatment approach that can safely lower PTH levels with minimal risk of hypercalcemia. It can be used as both a first-line and a last-line agent for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism. Additional trials are warranted to further evaluate the efficacy of cinacalcet in hemodialysis patients."

The currently available evidence does not provide sufficient information to conclusively determine the relative efficacy of the two treatment regimens; therefore, there is a need for a meta-analysis of all existing randomized controlled trials.

When considering the bronchodilatory effectiveness of specific asthma medications, it appears there are no advantages associated with the administration of salbutamol in combination with ipratropium for the treatment of an acute asthma attack compared with the administration of either agent alone. However, there appears to be some limited evidence to support the administration of low-dose salbutamol together with ipratropium is preferable to the administration of low-dose salbutamol alone. The need for future well-designed, randomized controlled trials is identified and this information will be particularly useful when formulating medication guidelines in the future.

Deeper analysis of the results of those trials should focus on the duration of bronchodilator actions and the relative efficacy of the two treatment regimens. A further problem related to the meta-analysis is that most of the reviewed trials have been conducted on adult populations only, and therefore, the findings may not be relevant to the pediatric population."

The evidence suggests that GTR is more effective than open flap debridement alone in treating certain intrabony defects when assessed by the following outcomes at 12 months: (1) gain in clinical attachment level, (2) gain in clinical attachment level adjusted for initial pocket depth, (3) gain in recession, (4) gain in recession adjusted for initial recession.
The GTR effects on interproximal probing depths are uncertain and the number of defects demonstrating residual pockets at 12 months is also uncertain.
Overall, we found no evidence to support the use of membranes in the treatment of certain types of residual intrabony defects. We found no evidence to support the use of adjunctive surgical procedures in the treatment of certain types of residual intrabony defects. We found no evidence to support the use of bone substitute materials in the treatment of certain types of residual intrabony defects.

Behavioral interventions can reduce hospital length stay, substance use, and psychiatric symptoms over time for people with co-occurring severe mental illness and substance abuse disorders.

Case management, assertive community treatment, and peer services are associated with improved client outcome and quality of life, although cost comparisons suggest case management and assertive community treatment cost more than traditional treatment approaches.

Motivational interviewing is effective when delivered by providers with limited training and experience, and in the hospital or early-intervention settings by staff in the context of ongoing psychiatric care.

Integration of substance abuse treatment and psychiatric care is associated with decreased substance-related and psychiatric problems over time.

Outcomes are most successful when integrating and coordinating services over time, with an emphasis on patient-directed care.

Integration with substance abuse treatment can be more difficult than other therapies.

This systematic review summarizes the results of nine randomized trials that evaluated the effectiveness of computer-delivered weight loss interventions compared to self-guided weight loss programs, traditional face-to-face behavioral weight loss programs, and control groups. Seven trials employed computer assistance in combination with face-to-face counseling. One trial investigated a completely self-directed computer program based on an internet website, while another examined whether the addition of internet chat group features to a computer program would enhance weight loss.
The results of seven trials were pooled and showed that overall computer-delivered intervention programs were no more effective than traditional face-to-face programs or self-directed programs. However, the pooled trials also revealed that the more attention given to the computer-delivered interventions, such as those offering individual online counseling or interactive group discussion, the stronger the effects of the intervention on weight loss.
Despite a lack of evidence, the results of this review support the use of computer technology as a novel approach to delivering weight loss interventions. Some evidence exists that supports greater weight loss for individuals who receive higher levels of computer delivered support. Further study and investigation are needed before computer technology can be recommended as an alternative to traditional face-to-face behavioral weight loss programs."

Topical antibiotics are the most common treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis, which is an infection of the eye caused by bacteria. Despite this, there is insufficient evidence to support whether antibiotics are superior to no treatment.

A Cochrane review of 26 studies comprising more than 1,200 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis found that there is little evidence for the effectiveness of different antibiotics. The review only identified three studies, involving 733 patients, that compared one antibiotic with another and no study compared an antibiotic with no treatment.

Another Cochrane review of 25 studies comprising more than 2,200 patients with acute bacterial conjunctivitis also found a lack of evidence about the effectiveness of topical antibiotic treatments, but found 16 studies showing there is little or no difference between using ciprofloxacin or its vehicle as a treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis. The review also found seven studies providing insufficient evidence to recommend chloramphenicol for this condition.

A Cochrane review of 21 studies comprising 2,400 children found that topical antibiotics reduce clinical signs and symptoms of bacterial conjunctivitis and that they were more effective than no treatment. However, the review could not determine whether topical antibiotics prevented complications, because of a lack of evidence.

Therefore there is still uncertainty about the effectiveness of different antibiotic treatments for bacterial conjunctivitis, because of a lack of good evidence comparing options with each other and with no treatment."

Currently, there is no specific treatment for demyelinating lesions in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). There is some evidence that modulating the inflammatory process can prevent recurring flares and reduce disability. Statin therapy could potentially help by not only lowering low-density lipoprotein but also reducing the expression of chemokines. Because both statins and the most commonly used interferon (IFN β) have reported side effects, using them conjointly could increase the likelihood of experiencing the unintended effects.
                We enrolled 45 patients with RRMS in a multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group study of simvastatin (80 mg daily) as add-on treatment to intramuscular IFN β-1a (225 μg weekly). Annual documented relapse rate was 0.141 (95% CI 0.09-0.23) in the placebo group and 0.140 (CI 0.09-0.25) in the simvastatin group. The difference between the two groups (p = 0.35) did not reach statistical significance.

There is evidence that interventions based at the clinic, in the workplace, or via health care providers can help reduce self-reported ST use in the general population and in military personnel. However, the evidence of the effectiveness of such interventions is not yet strong, and there is still much to explore in terms of intervention content, process, and delivery. This entry aims to highlight the fact that much of the relevant literature on ST use has been of poor quality and that much of it consists of small pilot projects in various settings. It would be helpful if studies in future were of good quality, and if they were of a larger scale in order to examine the real effects of interventions used within these settings. Future research should continue to try and reduce ST use, using both novel and established methods of intervention. As a result of this review, the authors have identified a number of areas where research is particularly needed. In particular, the review shows that, given the potential serious health consequences of the use of ST, it is important to assess both its overall prevalence and the effects of possible interventions on it. To this end, large-scale and longitudinal research is required, together with the development and testing of effective and appropriate interventions in various settings, in order that ST use can be seriously addressed.."

In most of the previously published studies mentioned above, CSII has been shown to provide better glycemic control, including improved glucose variability and/or reductions in HbA1c. In contrast, there is no clear evidence that the glycemic benefits observed in a 3-month period continue to be evident over a 6 or 12 months period. In general, studies showed that adapting to continuous insulin infusion with appropriate support may be more difficult for some individuals, leading to more frequent hypoglycemic events. Therefore, it is conceivable that CSII may not be appropriate for the majority of diabetic patients and may only be of relative benefit for specially selected groups."

While the prevalence of intimate partner violence (IPV) in prenatal women is highly variable depending on the populations under study, previous studies have found it to range from as low as 1.8 % to as high as 50.0 %. Research suggests that women living in conditions of violence are significantly younger, more likely to live in poverty, to have had a previous unintended pregnancy, to have experienced IPV in the past, lack health or social support, have a higher incidence of depression and posttraumatic stress disorder, and have lower health literacy. The health and social risks for infants of women experiencing IPV are similar to those exposed to toxic stress. Infants of women exposed to IPV are at increased risk of low birth weight, preterm birth, small-for-gestational-age births, injuries caused by IPV during pregnancy or during the neonatal period, and infant illness and death.
                A review of 5 studies found that intervention with abused pregnant women reduced IPV recurrence by 39.2 % (95 % CI: 27.3 to 47.5 %) during pregnancy and 32.0 % (95 %CI: 22.7 to 38.7 %) postpartum among pregnant women. A second review examined interventions for abused pregnant women who are not in the acute crisis stage of the IPV. It found that providing interventions, including individual counseling, psychoeducational sessions, or peer support improved pregnancy outcomes and reduced rates of intimate partner violence. There is less evidence regarding the impact of intervention on reducing violence among other risk groups or on nonpregnant women and girls.
                Most of these interventions occurred in urban settings and consisted of individual counseling from medical professionals. The interventions described in the above studies have in common that they are relatively brief, and usually incorporate an empirically-supported educational component regarding relationship skills, risky behaviors, and safety planning.
                There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of interventions provided by health professionals at the time or immediately after the identification of risks during routine prenatal care as compared with interventions provided several weeks later as standard care.

The limited effects found when an orally-active alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, lofexidine hydrochloride was administered for chronic pelvic pain in women lead us to conclude that the drug is not effective for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain. Other treatments with potential benefits are the selective venoconstrictor dihydroergotamine (DHE), which can reduce the diameter of pelvic veins and treat pelvic pain, and the use of medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA), which can lead to reduction in visual analogue scale pain score with 73% of women reporting at least 50% improvement compared with 33% of those treated with placebo. Additionally, psychotherapy has shown some benefit and may be a useful first-line therapy for women with pain associated with demonstrable pelvic congestion. However, psychotherapy was not effective as a monotherapy in reducing the negative impact of chronic pelvic pain on women's lives, and needs to be evaluated as a combination with other treatments or modalities.

The results of the two randomized trials show no evidence of a protective effect on the clinical progression of newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease from the use of selegiline compared to placebo over the 5-year study periods. The pooled hazard ratio for the end point of wearing-off motor fluctuations and the need for levodopa therapy at the end of study period was 1.08 (95%CI 0.90, 1.28), while for the end point of developing severe disability requiring levodopa therapy, it was 1.20 (0.80, 1.81). Results from the non-randomized retrospective cohort study suggest there may be a small benefit from selegiline use (hazards ratio 0.92).

The reasons for the differing results on clinical progression between the two randomized trials and the non-randomized retrospective cohort study are not entirely clear, but could be due to study patient characteristics, baseline disease severity or use of additional dopaminergic treatments, all of which varied considerably between trials. The lack of evidence of a protective effect does not mean that selegiline is entirely without beneficial effects on specific aspects of the disease, because neither of the randomized trials measured the effect of selegiline on many specific clinical domains such as bradykinesia, tremor, dementia, dyskinesia or mood. The results of this review and meta-analysis are therefore of little value in informing clinical treatment decisions for individual patients with Parkinson's disease."

Despite the long history of fever control in the treatment of illness, only a limited number of studies have rigorously evaluated the efficacy and effectiveness of antipyretics in pediatric samples. We undertook a systematic review of all published randomized placebo-controlled trials of the use of antipyretics in the management of fever in children. In all, 15 trials were identified that were evaluated as having an adequate sample size and methodology. Overall antipyretic efficacy in children was supported by 12 of the studies (combined n = 3,731) and was not supported by three studies. In the two trials that specifically assessed the impact of antipyretics on clinical symptoms, antipyretics had little if any impact on symptoms. There was a lack of high quality studies evaluating the use of paracetamol in children with malaria or other infectious diseases. Based on the current literature, antipyretics are useful in the short term reduction of temperatures. The impact on symptom management is minimal however and clinicians need to carefully consider the risks of antipyretics in this context."

Based on the analysis of the provided study abstracts related to a specific clinical trial related research question, custom foot orthoses have a positive effect on foot pain, disability, and function for people with cavus feet. Additionally, foot orthoses and anterior night splints are effective for the treatment of pain from plantar fasciitis, although they do not have long-term beneficial effects compared to a sham device. Customized and prefabricated orthoses used in these trials have similar effectiveness in the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Custom foot orthoses improved foot pain and functional status in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis but did not have a significant effect on synovitis or function. Semi-rigid orthoses worn in supportive shoes were an effective treatment for metatarsalgia."

Multiple studies have researched the effect of an active management of labor program on the rate of cesarean section and other labor outcomes in low-risk nulliparous women. Some studies reported reduction in the cesarean section rate while others did not, with an overall reduction of 5%. Some studies also reported shortening of the length of labor, the time to active labor by up to half as compared with the control group, and increased maternal satisfaction. The active management programme shortened the length of labor with no increase in the rate of caesarean section, but a reduction in the risk of prolonged labour."

The most effective treatments for slowing myopia progression are currently no more effective than those available in the past, with none being recommended in all circumstances.

Typhoid fever is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality world-wide. While the introduction of chloramphenicol improved the cure rate in the 1950s, the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant Salmonella typhi has compromised the efficacy of first-line medications like chloramphenicol in recent years. This development requires a continued evaluation of drug-resistant patterns and the evaluation of new drugs and treatment regimens. The findings of this review suggest that fluoroquinolones (both ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin) and azithromycin are the safest and most effective treatments for enteric fever caused by MDR Salmonella isolates. While gatifloxacin appears to be an effective alternative, high rates of Nal resistance have emerged in regions of endemicity and the costs of gatifloxacin may be an important factor in treatment choices. Therefore, the use of fluoroquinolones and azithromycin will continue to play a central role in the treatment of enteric fever, given their broad-spectrum efficacy, rapid clinical response, and relatively low cost.."

The evidence supports the effectiveness of interventions aimed at improving post-discharge outcomes, particularly for those at increased risk of unplanned admission or prolonged hospitalization. Interventions involving nurse-led multidisciplinary teams are most likely to be effective. Patients at risk of frequent hospitalizations or rehospitalizations appear to derive the most benefit. Evidence relating specifically to interventions aimed at reducing hospital length-of-stay is less strong, and the evidence to support the use of hospital discharge coordinators has largely been refuted. The most promising approaches appear to be multidisciplinary interventions using a combination of interventions to provide support and education to both patients and family members."

The review of published clinical trials included in this report suggests antidepressant efficacy of imipramine, sertraline, ritanserin, moclobemide, and phenelzine, but not minaprine. In our study, which was designed to assess the efficacy of trazodone compared to placebo for treating dysthymic disorder, we could not determine which agent, if any, was superior to placebo. Dysthymic outpatients treated with placebo for eight weeks demonstrated a higher placebo response rate than reported in a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials in major depression. This response rate to placebo could suggest that the course of dysthymia is more variable than has been acknowledged previously.
The course of dysthymia and the response to tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) therapy in patients with major depressive episodes that occurred during the depressive phase of dysthymia was studied in a community sample of 177 subjects: 32 dysthymic and 145 non-dysthymic women and 16 dysthymic and 17 non-dysthymic men. A four-week double-blind crossover trial of desipramine (100 mg/day) and placebo following 6-12 months of baseline observation was conducted as part of the study. In the dysthymic-depressed group, during the acute treatment period there was a significant increase in the BDI, a significant increase in HRSD-21 scores for the depressive and atypical symptoms subscales, and a significant increase in the CIBIC-plus ratings for the clinician, the subject, and their families. Patients with atypical features of depression showed a more significant therapeutic response as compared to patients with melancholic features..
These combined results from a review of published clinical trials and from our recent study suggest that the efficacy of imipramine and possibly sertraline is similar to that of a placebo for treating dysthymic disorder. Future clinical trials should examine other types of antidepressant medications to determine the efficacy of these medications for patients with dysthymic disorder.."

Salt fortification with 20 to 40 mg of iodide per kg of salt is an effective means of preventing goitre among children and adolescents. The addition of iodate to sodium in salt or water to reduce iodine deficiency is an effective means of preventing goiter among men and women. However, no reliable method exists for supplying additional iodine to young children from an iodized salt fortification program. Studies with iodized salt alone, water alone, and mixed iodized salt and water supplementation in women have shown significant and sustained increases in median urinary iodine excretions in women but not in young children, who require other interventions to prevent goiter. Iodized salt and water supplementation in women has reduced goiter prevalences, indicating the potential of using iodized salt and/or water to reduce goiter in women who reside in endemic regions."

It is recommended that hand-held nebulizer is used in acute asthma treatment at the emergency department, while metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with a spacer/valve holder is a suitable alternative to nebulizers for moderate and severe acute childhood asthma, especially in cases of limited resources and when transport to the emergency department is difficult..

[Output]
----------------------
Acute asthma is a common emergency among children. Studies examining different techniques for drug delivery are inconclusive regarding which is the most effective and cost effective. Spacers are as effective as Nebulizers in delivering aerosolized beta2-agonists with a similar therapeutic outcome in terms of improvement in asthma score, pulmonary function, and time to discharge. There is some evidence to suggest that spacer may be superior to nebulizers regarding treatment time, admissions, and treatment with beta2-agonists. Hand-held nebulizers are recommended over spacer/valve holder devices for patients with inability to take deep inhalations. Due to the lower cost and portability, spacer/valve holder devices are a promising alternative for administering beta2-agonist to children with acute asthma in the community and where transportation of the patient to the emergency department is difficult..

There is strong evidence that treatment with synthetic human insulin may be used safely as a replacement for animal source insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes. The evidence base for comparing the efficacy and safety of human insulin with animal source insulin is good. However, most of these studies are small and short term. Some are not definitive as they have insufficient statistical power (n = 58 for study 1, n = 18 for study 2). The quality and applicability may be limited by the small number of studies that reported adverse events. There are conflicting findings regarding the metabolic control and incidence of hypoglycaemia between human and animal source insulin. Clinicians should be aware of this until further research is conducted. Current UK guidelines (NICE 2009) indicate that treatment with synthetic human insulin may be used safely as a replacement for animal source insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes. Most of the human insulin preparations in this study are interchangeable and any adverse events are no more frequent or severe than those reported for animal products."

Numerous interventions involving family members and health professionals have been found to be effective in reducing second hand smoke exposure in homes and cars. Interventions with parents of children with asthma are more effective in reducing second hand smoke exposure in children with asthma than interventions with parents who do not have asthmatic children. A combination of intensive and repeated intervention sessions, involving not just health professionals but the children themselves and their parents, is desirable to achieve long-term change. Interventions with other family members living in the same house are effective in reducing second hand smoke exposure in children with asthma but may need additional support for long term change. Future work should focus on identifying and promoting effective interventions for the reduction of second hand smoke exposure in a variety of populations and settings."

The new, long-acting beta2-agonists salmeterol and formoterol are effective and well tolerated when used as maintenance therapy in patients with asthma. Regular use of formoterol or terbutaline did not significantly influence the bronchodilator response to additional inhalation of bronchodilators like salbutamol. Addition of inhaled salmeterol to a regular dose of inhaled steroids gives a significantly better effect on lung function than the addition of salbutamol or terbutaline.."

The studies in the corpus suggest ways to design and implement HIV prevention interventions with sex workers in low-resource settings, as well as challenges to be addressed. The studies demonstrate that condom promotion is effective, but it is difficult to achieve consistently protective behavior among sex workers. The most successful interventions were those that combined multiple strategies, such as peer education and counseling or skills training and advocacy. The intervention strategies that seemed less successful included efforts to persuade male clients to use condoms, efforts to reduce the numbers of sexual partners, and efforts to reduce substance use. The most promising strategies for increasing prevention behavior include those that build the confidence, skills and social support of female sex workers. Effective intervention strategies that address key barriers and drivers such as community-based gender empowerment, stigma reduction or increased social support may be more effective than those that are solely individual-based. However, few of the studies examined the sustainability of the effects of interventions, so it is difficult to determine which strategies to adopt. There is a need for more research to evaluate community efforts to reduce sexual exploitation, gender inequalities and societal factors that hinder the prevention of HIV in sex workers."

In the field of atrial fibrillation, anticoagulant treatment is of fundamental importance in the secondary prevention of stroke. Currently, no conclusive evidence is available regarding the use of a decision aid in patients with atrial fibrillation who have undergone treatment with an anticoagulant for a short period of time. The quality of self-managed oral anticoagulant therapy can be maintained and may even increase if the patient is trained. At the same time, the effectiveness of physicians managing the care of patients with atrial fibrillation is only slightly superior to that of properly trained patients who are taught to monitor self-management and are supported by a physician if necessary.
A decision aid is an educational program that helps patients with atrial fibrillation choose their form of anticoagulant based on their individual risk of stroke. Patients who receive a decision aid may make more informed decisions about their anticoagulant treatment. More studies are needed to confirm the benefits of decision aids in different clinical situations.
Self-management and decision aid support result in increased patient knowledge about the risks of stroke and anticoagulant treatment, which improves patient self-management and decision-making ability, thereby increasing the effectiveness of anticoagulant therapy.
No difference in the rate of treatment complications and deaths between patient self-management and treatment by primary care physicians is evident.
Patients in the anticoagulation management group are within the therapeutic range significantly more frequently than those treated in the clinic with direct management. In all study groups, phenprocoumon outperformed acenocoumarol with regard to time in the therapeutic range.
After patient exposure to a decision aid, there is a 12% absolute improvement in the number of patients receiving appropriate care."

Existing lifestyle changes for cardiovascular diseases or obesity are difficult to achieve through community-based interventions. There is no single effective strategy, and different methods may have different effects, even between high-income and low-income populations. Nevertheless there have been some examples of effective intervention, generally by combining a range of interventions, or using methods designed for less-responsive communities.

The evidence from the evaluated intervention studies is insufficient to make recommendations. This report summarises the results of 18 studies on community-based interventions addressing cardiovascular diseases and/or obesity, using the most comprehensive and up-todate information available. The trials included in the evaluations were not of the same quality and some were better suited to intervention than others.

Studies showed that although there were some positive effects on risk factors for cardiovascular disease and obesity, the overall conclusion of this review was that community-based interventions have had a limited effect in changing these behaviours.
Effective interventions in the past seem to be less effective when repeated later.
Apart from those designed for low-income, less-responsive populations, none of the interventions demonstrated any consistent effects on behaviours. Interventions were generally better received when they targeted high-risk groups such as smokers, and interventions addressing diet were more successful if they were designed for people who were already interested in improving their diet.."

The study abstracts show that there is evidence for a slight reduction in colorectal cancer mortality with biennial screening, although this reduction is smaller than that for annual screening. The meta-analysis showed overall odds ratios for mortality of 0.74 and 0.83 and relative risk of 0.83 and the confidence intervals for the odds ratios included 1, indicating that these findings are imprecise and uncertain. In addition, the evidence for the effect of screening on incidence, morbidity and quality of life is uncertain, and there is no evidence about the best test or the ideal interval between screening."

There is no consistent evidence regarding the superiority of spinal analgesia over continuous epidural labor analgesia in healthy nulliparous women in labor. Several of the larger trials included in meta analyses showed no difference in cesarean rates or maternal side effects between epidural and spinal labor analgesia. There is some evidence that spinal analgesia provided better analgesia in the first 30 min, and it required less dose of local anesthetic, but it also had a higher incidence of pruritus and urinary retention compared to epidural labor analgesia. The majority of these trials used a combined spinal epidural technique using intrathecal morphine or fentanyl in combination with epidural labor analgesia. These techniques are associated with more side effects than continuous epidural administration alone. There is a need for further randomized studies to answer these and other questions regarding the labor analgesia methods.."

Out of the seven studies in the review, five found no significant difference between the nitric oxide donor and the standard prostaglandin analogue.  One study found the misoprostol to be more effective at inducing cervical ripening, while the other study found the isosorbide mononitrate to be less effective.  Two of the studies reported differences in the incidence and severity of adverse events between the two treatment groups, one finding higher headache scores in the misoprostol group, and the other finding slightly higher blood pressure and headache scores in all three groups treated with nitric oxide donor compared with those treated with the prostaglandin analogue.
This evidence suggests that while misoprostol and nitric oxide donors such as isosorbide mononitrate may be effective at inducing cervical ripening, there does not appear to be a clear advantage of one treatment over the other in terms of efficacy or side effects. More studies, of higher quality and more standardized study arms, are needed before clear practice recommendations can be made."

While specific conclusions from the studies are difficult to draw due to a lack of consensus among the various interventions used, there is evidence supporting practice of functional, unilateral, and bilateral tasks, and a focus on strengthening the affected lower limb and practicing functional tasks involving the lower limbs as being effective for functional recovery and health-related functional status in people with stroke. More well-established evidence is needed before the effectiveness of specific interventions can be affirmed, but the results from these randomized controlled pilot and small RCT trials suggest that task-related approaches could have benefit. Further large, multi-centre studies with extended follow-up are called for.

There is limited evidence that Bobath-based and movement science-based physiotherapy interventions are not different.

There is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of standard therapy versus lateral weight transference exercises, modified constraint-induced movement therapy, CIMT, and MRP programs in improving motor function in the stroke rehabilitation setting."

Both biofeedback and oral splint treatment were determined to be equally credible to patients, ruling out this potential threat to the validity of the results obtained. Oral splints are widely used in the treatment of myofascial pain, despite its unknown mechanism of action. The differential efficacy of biofeedback and oral splints separately and in combination have been assessed. Biofeedback in the treatment of temporomandibular muscle dysfunction leads to significantly greater reductions in pain while the occlusal appliance was more effective than the biofeedback in reducing depression. Oral splints and biofeedback have a similar capacity to improve the signs and symptoms of myofascial pain. Occlusal splints and biofeedback therapies are equally effective in improving the subjective and objective measures of temporomandibular disease. Occlusal appliances are not very effective. Oral splints are more effective than biofeedback in reducing pain, but only when the splint therapy is used alone and not as an adjunct to biofeedback. Stabilization splints show some evidence of improving symptoms of masticatory muscle dysfunction and have the advantage of requiring no patient participation."

Virtual human patients are being used to develop new methods for assessing patient communication skills and for determining the best approach for communication skills training. Several researchers are currently working with virtual human patients to see how they can be used in these efforts.
One of the primary benefits of simulations is that you can repeat them multiple times without real people being required to be involved. This provides an avenue for learning from experience.
Training has been shown to be very effective in improving sigmoidoscopy skills. Fellows who underwent simulator training obtained significantly better results than did fellows who did not receive this training. In addition, their scores on the patient discomfort scale were significantly lower than those of the fellows who had no prior experience. The more recent a student is exposed to training on a simulator, the better the outcomes for their patients. Similarly, a pilot study of 10 residents who had no previous knowledge of sigmoidoscopy was able to reach the cecum in 47.7% of 424 patient examinations vs. 20% of a comparable group who had no prior training.
Several of the clinical studies reviewed showed an improvement in colonoscopy skills and patient comfort scores in a group of trainees who had completed virtual colonoscopy simulations prior to starting their study of 10 live colonoscopies.
Several clinical studies were reviewed where flexible endoscopic simulators were used for education of endoscopy trainees. The majority of the studies showed that endoscopic skills acquired using the simulator transfer well into the clinical setting.

Overall, studies examining the effects of simulation-based training in endoscopy show a clear benefit towards improving medical student performance. The evidence suggests that virtual reality simulation-based training can improve performance and patient care when used as an adjunct to traditional training. In addition, the simulation appears to be most effective when used as a ""teaching tool"" rather than as a way to completely eliminate traditional live training.
Additional research on which skills simulators help improve the most, and on how much actual live practice is necessary is recommended. Given the ever changing nature of healthcare practice and the potential financial advantages simulators provide one must consider continued evaluation of these training methods. Future research may lead to an expanded use of simulation technology in medical student education."

The efficacy of naltrexone in heroin addiction treatment was studied in multiple clinical trials. The findings were consistent: naltrexone maintenance treatment reduces heroin use, but the clinical advantage did not differ significantly from placebo in several trials. Non-pharmacological factors such as social support, counseling, and motivation seem to be also crucial for heroin addiction rehabilitation.

Although naltrexone has some efficacy in preventing heroin use, the available evidence suggests that its long-term benefit is quite small, and that alternative pharmacotherapies, specifically buprenorphine and methadone, are probably more effective. The combination of naltrexone and buprenorphine may be a viable option for medication treatment in opioid dependent patients, but further research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety.

There is an urgent need for larger-scale, randomized-controlled trials of naltrexone compared to methadone or buprenorphine in order to determine its role in heroin addiction treatment and the long-term effects on disease progression and public health."

The summary is that the addition of prednisolone to methotrexate and cyclosporine does not improve the prophylaxis of graft-versus-host disease and may increase its incidence, as well as transplant-related mortality. The combination of methotrexate and cyclosporine appears to be effective in decreasing the incidence of grade II through IV GVHD in recipients of HLA-identical marrow grafts, but it doesn't appear that adding prednisolone provides additional benefit. Furthermore, cytotoxic agents alone are no longer sufficient in some malignancies to achieve long-term disease-free survival.

More research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of GVHD and to improve prophylaxis while minimizing toxicities and mortality. However, the addition of prednisolone to CM or CM/MP in HLA-identical sibling transplants should not be routinely incorporated and further trials are warranted."

Naltrexone has been used for a long time in the treatment of alcohol use disorders. It appears to be more effective when combined with a therapeutic component, possibly because the medication blocks the reinforcing effects of the drug of abuse, thus creating a vacuum that treatment could fill. A recent Cochrane review concluded that naltrexone can lead to significant improvements in abstinence rates and alcohol-related outcomes.
Other studies have evaluated the efficacy of naltrexone for the treatment of opioid dependence, both alone and in combination with psychosocial interventions. While some reports have shown naltrexone to be ineffective in combination with psychosocial treatment (with the exception of those who are abstinent), other studies have suggested that psychosocial therapy may improve retention in and completion of naltrexone treatment.
Sustained-release naltrexone injections reduce opioid craving and use more effectively than oral dosing. The efficacy for drinking reduction among alcohol dependent persons was comparable across both formulations of naltrexone. Because the implant lasts 6 months, it can be administered without requiring the patient's involvement, thus enhancing compliance and reducing relapse rates. It may also reduce the incidence of overdoses, as participants are less likely to use other opioids because of the medication's effects on reducing cravings.
In summary, extended-release medications such as naltrexone implants and injectables may offer effective treatment options for individuals with opioid dependence. Longer-acting naltrexone formulations can be given without reliance on patient cooperation and provide an alternative to other medications for opioid dependence currently under development."

Combination therapy with zidovudine and didanosine (ddl), zidovudine and zalcitabine (ddC), or zidovudine alone was compared to assess their relative efficacy in the treatment of HIV-infected individuals with advanced disease. In patients who had not had prior treatment with zidovudine, combination therapy with ddl or ddC reduced mortality by about one-third and postponed the onset of AIDS or death by between 3 and 12 months compared with those receiving zidovudine alone. There was no evidence of benefit from the addition of ddl in patients who had been on zidovudine for at least 3 months or from the addition of zalcitabine (ddC) for any duration. There was no unexpected toxicity from either combination. Adding ddl to patients already receiving zidovudine significantly increased their survival, although benefit appears much smaller than in treatment-naive patients. Overall, these randomised controlled trials confirm that combination therapy is better for HIV-infected individuals than using a single drug..

Study #6: Combination therapy with zidovudine with intermittent thymidine improves progression-free survival for HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts of less than 200/ul and no other antiretroviral drugs.. Combination therapy with zidovudine and intermittent thrimidine phosphate (TMP) (NZT) has improved survival for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients on zidovudine monotherapy. To determine whether NZT is superior to continuous zidovudine (CZT) in improving progression-free survival for HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts of less than 200 per microliter and no zidovudine therapy in the preceding 6 weeks. The Southwest Oncology Group performed a randomized multicenter clinical trial for which 970 patients with CD4 cell counts of less than 200 per microliter (121 patients with less than 100 cells per microliter) were eligible for entry into the trial.

Study #1: Prostacyclin and thromboxane levels in women with severe preeclampsia undergoing magnesium sulfate therapy during antepartum and postpartum periods: This study sought to study the effects of magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) on prostacyclin (PGI2) and thromboxane A2 (TXA2) levels in women with severe preeclampsia during antepartum and postpartum periods. Fifty women with severe preeclampsia were randomized into two groups. Patients in Group A were continuously infused with MgSO4 for 24 hours postpartum. In Group B, MgSO4 administration was discontinued when urinary output was of > or =100 ml/hr for 2 consecutive hours. Plasma levels of 6-keto-PGF1alpha and TXB2, stable metabolites of PGI2 and TXA2, were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Data were presented as mean +/- SE, and analyzed by paired t-test. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Platelet counts were within the normal range in all participants. MgSO4 was administered for an average of 10 hours postpartum in Group B. Maternal blood pressures returned to normal or close to normal levels in both groups at 24 hours postpartum. 6-keto PGF1alpha levels were significantly decreased 24 hours after delivery compared with the levels at enrollment in both groups, Group A: 98 +/- 13 vs. 180 +/- 28 pg/mL; Group B: 142 + 17 vs. 194 +/- 31 pg/mL (P < 0.05), respectively. TXB2 levels were comparable before and after delivery and not different between group A and group B. The results support the view that MgSO4 does not affect prostacyclin and thromboxane levels in the maternal circulation in women with preeclampsia during either antepartum or postpartum periods. We speculate that a higher level of prostacyclin before delivery may reflect compensatory"

Aripiprazole is effective in reducing symptoms and is particularly useful in patients with a history of intolerance to atypical antipsychotic medication. Olanzapine was associated with more weight gain and less extrapyramidal symptoms than aripiprazole. When comparing aripiprazole with placebo, there were no significant differences between treatments in mean change from baseline in the extrapyramidal symptom rating scales. Weight gain was significantly less with aripiprazole than with the typical antipsychotic olanzapine; however, it was not less with aripiprazole than with the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. Aripiprazole and risperidone groups showed a similar low incidence of clinically significant weight gain.

In conclusion, Aripiprazole is effective for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder and is associated with favorable safety and tolerability profiles. It is the first non-D2 receptor antagonist with clear antipsychotic effects and represents a novel treatment development for psychotic disorders."

It reduces the amount of time that GPs spend with patients, but is not significantly more effective than usual management in reducing patient consultations.

This protocol resulted in significantly shorter hospital stays, reduced complications and readmission rates, and improved patient satisfaction scores when compared to traditional perioperative care. To reap the full benefits, this protocol should be applied to patients younger than 70 years, and increased surgeon experience in managing patients using this protocol must be considered. Overall, this fast-track recovery protocol is a valuable tool to enhance patient outcomes and optimize postoperative care."

1. Erythropoietin treatment significantly increases Hb levels in patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia and reduces the need for blood transfusion. 2. Erythropoietin treatment also significantly improves quality of life in anaemic cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. 3. In patients with cancer who are not receiving chemotherapy, randomized controlled trials of epoetin alpha and darbepoetin alpha were associated with statistically significantly significantly higher rates of cardiovascular and thromboembolic events, but there was no overall difference in survival compared with placebo. 4. A meta-analysis of the 12 trials that evaluated patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy showed no difference between ESA-treated and control groups in overall survival (HR 1.0). 5. ESA-treated patients are at a 1.7 times greater risk of thromboembolic events and a 1.3 times greater risk of venous thromboembolism. 6. Caution is recommended in the use of ESAs, particularly in patients with cancer but not receiving chemotherapy. 7. The use of ESAs appears to be well-tolerated in patients receiving chemotherapy for cancer. 8. More trials in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy are needed to elucidate the overall benefit and risk of treatment with ESAs."

A randomized controlled trial was conducted in Nairobi (Kenya) to determine whether a single oral dose (200 mg) of doxycycline given at the time of IUD insertion will reduce the risk of pelvic inflammatory infection.
                The rate of pelvic inflammatory disease in the doxycycline-treated group was 31% lower than that in the placebo-treated group (0.67 compared with 1.02 per 100 women/year; risk ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.32-1.50). The incidence of an unplanned IUCD-related visit (as a marker for PID) was 31% lower in the doxycycline-treated group (0.67 compared with 1.02 per 100 person-years, 0.69, 0.52-0.91). This reduction in IUCD-related morbidity was not statistically significant, possibly because the trial was underpowered to show a beneficial effect.
                Treatment of IUCD users with a single dose of doxycycline at the time of insertion does not reduce the risk of PID, but it cannot be excluded that it reduces PID-like morbidity in populations at high risk of this infection.."

The use of steroids in asthma patients is still a major issue due to their well-known side-effects. Methotrexate is a cheap disease-modifying drug used in the treatment of many diseases, including asthma. It seems that methotrexate could reduce steroid doses and improve quality of life in asthmatics, mainly for patients who suffer from severe asthma and poor control of their asthma. However, it is important to understand the risk- benefit ratio of methotrexate as a steroid sparing agent in the treatment of asthma.
Fourteen trials were carried out to evaluate low dose methotrexate as a steroid sparing agent in children and adults. In this review, we synthesised the results of 13 trials that met our inclusion criteria. Low-dose methotrexate has not been proven to be superior to placebo. There have been some adverse events, mostly minor. More research is required as the results of these placebo-controlled trials are not yet conclusive.
In view of the paucity of good quality data, we recommend using a trial and error approach with oral methotrexate (i.e., starting with 5 mg weekly and titrating the dose if adverse events occur). We recommend monitoring liver and kidney function, haemoglobin and white cell count with monthly blood tests. Methotrexate can be discontinued if adverse effects occur or if there is no improvement in asthma symptoms within 4-6 weeks. Methotrexate could be tried briefly after failure of first-line asthma treatment to manage steroid-dependent asthma. It appears more appropriate to reserve its use to severe patients with poor control of their asthma. Large randomized placebo controlled trials are required to assess the benefits or risks of methotrexate."

In the absence of safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities, low-cost, easily maintainable technologies for disinfecting water are essential for prevention and control of cholera, diarrhea, and other fecal-oral transmitted infections. Of the 15 studies analyzed, 12 found that treatment of domestic water supplies can decrease the incidence of diarrheal diseases. Home disinfection for children less than 5 years of age reduced diarrheal rates by 23 percent and diarrhea-related deaths by more than 20 percent in high morbidity areas in Bangladesh and Egypt. Another study demonstrated a 42 percent reduction in diarrhea rates of younger children in the presence of chlorine-treated water in a rural area of Indonesia. Similarly, a community trial in rural Pakistan in which most households used unchlorinated water showed that increasing the amount of chlorine in a public water supply system did not materially affect diarrhea rates. Similarly, analysis of two large-scale chlorination programs in Bangladesh and the Philippines showed that there was no significant difference in rates of diarrheal diseases between treated and untreated communities. These apparent contradictions are difficult to reconcile, but studies reporting negative effects of water treatments in high transmission areas may be biased, given the difficulty of blinding participants in a controlled trial. An alternative explanation may be that cholera is a self-limiting disease. It is therefore difficult to draw conclusions about whether chlorination is effective for controlling diarrheal diseases in an area where cholera is prevalent. Nonetheless, where cholera transmission may be low, chlorination is a useful and affordable adjunct to other disease control strategies. Simple household disinfection and other microbiologic control methods should also be investigated for effectiveness, and the results of such studies should be interpreted cautiously. Finally, home-based interventions targeting specific high risk groups seem to be more important than universal interventions because of differences in transmission patterns between children and adults, and because of the difficulty of getting vulnerable individuals out of the transmission pathway."

Evening primrose oil (EPO) and borage oil (high in gamma-linolenic acid, GLA) containing n-6 fatty acids are not of benefit in atopic eczema.
Five RCTs were small and lacked a clear definition of response. Most were limited by poor study methodology, with inadequate allocation, masking or withdrawals. The two large trials (151 and 123 patients) were well constructed and found no difference in EPO and a placebo.
The majority of trials did not show a clinical benefit for patients with atopic eczema treated with EPO/GLA. The largest trials (n=151 and 123) showed no significant reduction in the total score and no greater reduction in eczema symptoms with EPO/GLA compared to placebo. They were carried out with similar methodologies and were underpowered (20% for the larger study) due to losses to follow up.
Other studies have demonstrated improved skin symptoms with high dose EPO (n=8, mean dose 15 g/day), but due to small numbers, small outcome measures and inadequate masking, these findings are currently of little clinical relevance.
Three RCTs have suggested reduction in eczema symptoms, but methodologies have been inadequate. Two were very small with a clear possibility of treatment bias and one had a poor baseline stratification for disease activity. There are no RCTs reported, which have shown a convincing long-term therapeutic effect for EPO/GLA over placebo for atopic eczema.
N-6 fatty acids are required in the diet for formation of prostaglandins and thromboxanes, but EPO/GLA are not an effective source of n-6 fatty acids to benefit patients with atopic eczema.
No RCT has demonstrated a therapeutic effect, and therefore, there is currently no convincing evidence to support or contradict the use of EPO/GLA in the treatment of atopic eczema."

Tobacco marketing and promotion that is targeted towards children and adolescents may contribute to the initiation of smoking. Based on longitudinal studies of exposure to tobacco marketing and the development of smoking behavior, there is evidence to support that receptivity to tobacco marketing (such as naming a favourite tobacco advert or willingness to use a promotional item) is a risk factor for smoking uptake among adolescents. The findings highlight the importance of tobacco marketing and promotions in the uptake of smoking in young people and support a close link between tobacco promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions.
To design effective strategies for preventing smoking during adolescence, a better understanding of how tobacco promotion interacts with multiple social, cultural, and economic factors is needed. More importantly, longitudinal cohort studies with long-term follow-up of a specific group of adolescents would provide more robust evidence about the effects of tobacco promotion."

The study abstracts suggest that there is evidence that both fluconazole and ketoconazole are more effective in treating oropharyngeal candidiasis compared to topical antifungal treatment. Although fluconazole 100 mg/day does not appear significantly superior to itraconazole 200 mg/day regarding cure rates, the rate of relapse seems to be significantly lower for fluconazole compared to itraconazole. For that reason fluconazole remains the drug of first choice for OPC in patients with cancer. Other studies confirm the superiority of fluconazole compared to other antifungal such as clotrimazole (500-mg oral gel) and nystatin."

Based on the available studies, it is clear that speed-dependent treadmill training can improve the basic gait parameters of patients with early Parkinson's disease. Incremental speed-dependent treadmill training and body weight-supported treadmill training have demonstrated the greatest impact overall. Fear of falling, postural instability, and dynamic balance can also be improved through gait and step training. All of the interventions showed a reduction in falls in the short-term, but some of the trials had methodological limitations. Therefore, more studies are needed to evaluate the long-term effects of these interventions on patients with Parkinson's disease."

Researchers have developed several airway clearance techniques, such as postural drainage, positive expiratory pressure breathing, and chest physiotherapy. All have been shown to be effective in clearing pulmonary secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis. In addition, postural drainage (1.22 mL) appears to be slightly more effective than positive expiratory pressure breathing (0.65 mL). This difference was not significant for both airway clearance techniques (p = 0.52). Postural drainage also appears to be more effective than physical therapy (1.50 versus 0.70 mL). However, this difference may not be clinically significant. Both techniques are effective in clearing the airways when used correctly. More research with larger numbers of individuals with cystic fibrosis is needed to determine the relative effectiveness of these techniques."

The main focus of these studies is the impact of provider-initiated testing and counseling among individuals with sexually transmitted infections, specifically in relation to HIV testing and contraception. While none of the studies directly measured the impact of PITC on contraceptive uptake, one study did find that an intervention to promote dual-method contraceptive use among HIV concordant and discordant couples increased the use of nonbarrier contraceptives. Additionally, improved access to nonbarrier contraceptives among couples already using condoms for HIV prevention was associated with lower incident pregnancy rates among HIV-positive women. Overall, while there was some evidence suggesting PITC could increase the uptake of contraceptive services, further research is needed to fully understand the impact of PITC on contraception uptake and family planning practices at a population level."

In this systematic review, investigators analyzed double-blind, placebo-controlled withdrawal studies of long-acting antipsychotic medication conducted with remitted schizophrenic outpatients. A number of studies demonstrated the efficacy of antipsychotic treatment in preventing relapse in these patients. Although discontinuation of medication was followed, in almost all studies, by relapse or return to hospital, there were wide variations in relapse rate. These results provide empirical support for antipsychotic maintenance treatment and raise questions about the adequacy of the treatment available from community psychiatrists and alternative to medication. The long-term effects of treatment on relapse and side effects need further investigation."

Early orthodontic treatment with bionator or headgear is effective in reducing overjet and severity of Class II malocclusion. Most of this correction is due to dentoalveolar change, but some is due to favorable skeletal change. Early treatment with the Twin-block appliance results in reduction of overjet, correction of molar relationships and reduction in severity of malocclusion. The Bass appliance also corrects the severity of malocclusion, with improvement in sagittal skeletal relationship due to favorable growth responses in both the maxilla and the mandible. However, further studies investigating the long-term results are necessary to fully evaluate the clinical effectiveness of early orthodontic treatment for Class II malocclusions."

Study Abstracts: Study #1: Home-based personalized cognitive training in MS patients: a study of adherence and cognitive performance.. To explore unprompted adherence to a personalized, home-based, computerized cognitive training program in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), and to examine the impact of training on cognitive performance.
                Participants were assigned to a training (n=59) or a control group (n=48). Those in the training group were instructed to train three times a week for 12 weeks. The control group received no training. All participants were evaluated with a Neuropsychological Examination (N-CPC) at baseline and at the end of the study.
                In the training group, 42 (71.2%) participants adhered to the training schedule and 22 (37.3%) completed the entire training regimen. In the control group, 24 (50.0%) participants agreed to be retested on the N-CPC. The training group showed a significant improvement over that shown by the control group in three memory-based cognitive abilities (general memory, visual working memory and verbal working memory). Post-hoc exploration of data from the N-CPC showed that cognitive training was also associated with increased naming speed, speed of information recall, focused attention and visuo-motor vigilance.
                The appreciable rates of adherence and cognitive improvements observed indicate that personalized cognitive training is a practical and valuable tool to improve cognitive skills and encourage neuronal plasticity in patients with MS..

The use of low-molecular-weight heparin in the treatment of fetal growth restriction and recurrent preeclampsia in non-thrombophilic women has been investigated in recent years but has not yet been confirmed in larger and carefully conducted studies. The authors conclude that their data justify the use of low-molecular-weight heparin as a therapeutic tool in the treatment of pregnancy-induced hypertension and fetal growth retardations in these subgroups. Randomized controlled trial on the use of low-molecular-weight heparin in non-thrombophilic women with previous pregnancy-induced hypertension: a pilot study..
A meta-analysis found that low-molecular-weight heparin prevented recurrence of preeclampsia and improved both maternal and infant outcomes (Ezeamama U et al. (2009). J Perinatol 13, 254-260). The results of a recent pilot randomised study suggested a benefit of daily low-molecular-weight heparin in preventing recurrent adverse outcomes of preeclampsia, including neonatal morbidity, in women with no known thrombophilia (Steer PJ et al. (2007). Lancet, 13 October, Epub February 27 (doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61526-0)). This was a pilot randomised trial to test if low-molecular-weight heparin decreased recurrent severe pregnancy-induced hypertension and adverse outcomes for women who had had pre-eclampsia or who have a high risk of pre-eclampsia.
                This study enrolled women who were pregnant (<or= 16 weeks' gestation) and had the highest risk for severe pre-eclampsia, based on previous recurrence or newborn morbidity or unexplained intrauterine death or placental abruptly. Outcomes were examined both in pregnancy and following delivery. Low-molecular-weight heparin was safe for both the mother and the fetus.

There is weak evidence that suggests cranberry may reduce the frequency of recurrent urinary tract infections. This has resulted from the combined effect of positive findings from several randomised trials and meta-analyses, and the possibility of publication bias in those trials. Although meta-analyses have found cranberry to be more effective than placebo in the overall rate of urinary tract infections in children, women, and men, and more effective than antibiotics in children and men, the differences observed are small, and therefore the clinical significance of these findings is uncertain.

Most trials included in these meta-analyses have been of low and very low quality. In particular, there were major deficiencies such as lack of masking and lack of allocation concealment. Furthermore, there were other design issues such as overly broad eligibility criteria, lack of attention to ensuring adherence, and reliance on symptomatic rather than predefined criteria for determining the number and severity of urinary tract infections.

Only three trials have been conducted with sufficient methodological rigour to permit reasonable and clinically important estimates of the effect of cranberry. The findings from these trials were negative and further studies are required to examine the effects of cranberry. As yet, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of cranberry for urinary tract infections. Future high quality, adequately powered and appropriately designed trials are needed, preferably using microbiological and biochemical markers such as glucuronidase, as this may lead to improved clarity regarding the benefits of cranberry for preventing recurrent urinary tract infections.."

There is some evidence that swimming training is beneficial in children with asthma. Several studies have demonstrated that a 6 week swimming program improved their pulmonary function tests, and one study suggested that the decrease in the ventilatory threshold would involve an increase in hyperventilation even when exercise was performed at submaximal intensity for children with asthma. On the other hand, some other interventional studies indicated that swimming training did not produce a significant improvement on pre- and poststudy period pulmonary function tests. The exercise induced bronchoconstriction and exercise provoked asthma attack during swimming activity in asthmatic children. Therefore, there is a need for more robust studies with larger sample sizes to determine the exact benefits of swimming training in children with asthma."

Cirrhosis is the common final pathway of several chronic liver diseases, such as alcoholic liver disease, chronic viral hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis, the most common cause of portal hypertension, which is associated with a high risk of variceal bleeding. Although beta-blocker therapy is used routinely for primary prevention of variceal hemorrhage, several studies have shown that variceal ligation is more effective compared with beta-blocker therapy in preventing the first variceal bleeding. The comparison of the efficacy of beta-blocker therapy versus variceal ligation is controversial. The goal of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of endoscopic variceal ligation versus beta-blocker therapy for the prevention of the first variceal bleed.
                Endoscopic variceal ligation was more effective in preventing the first variceal bleeding compared with beta-blocker therapy. Patients undergoing endoscopic variceal ligation experienced a lower rate of bleeding events and a lower rate of all-cause mortality compared with beta-blocker therapy.
                These findings suggest that endoscopic variceal ligation should be the preferred method for the prevention of the first variceal bleeding, although further evidence from high-quality studies is needed to strengthen the existing evidence and to evaluate the potential impact of variceal ligation on mortality."

Current evidence suggests that patients with sub-massive pulmonary embolism should be referred for treatment at centers with expertise in thrombolytic therapy. Pulmonary angiography before, at the end of, and two to three days after infusion with a fibrinolytic agent is important to evaluate the effect of therapy. Fibrinolytic therapy should continue until there is a complete or partial resolution of all pulmonary emboli or the infusion duration has reached a predefined maximum dose. The optimal dosage, administration route, and duration of infusion remain uncertain and require further evaluation in large-scale, multi-center, randomized trials. Routine laboratory monitoring is not recommended during the first 24 hours. The risk of major hemorrhage is low and is not influenced by the presence of pulmonary infarction. All adverse events of bleeding should be carefully monitored throughout the first 24 hours after treatment is initiated."

Uremia and chronic kidney disease are often associated with severe pruritis in patients on haemodialysis, and the search for an effective antipruritic agent has been unsuccessful.
In a double-blind, randomised, single-centre study, 52 haemodialysis patients who regularly suffered from pruritus were investigated. The severity of pruritus was assessed by a daily visual analogue score. Patients were treated with montelukast (30 mg) or placebo for two treatment periods of 4 weeks each. The response to treatment was compared with a crossover double-drug regime. Patients who responded to montelukast with a least 30% reduction in pruritus were continued on treatment for 18 weeks in an open, single-blind study. The pruritus was assessed on a weekly visual analogue score and patients were provided with an 8-week personal supply of montelukast to self-medicate with throughout this open study.
                Montelukast was successful in relieving pruritus in 64% of patients who received a daily dose of 30 mg for 2 weeks. In total, 67.5% of the patients continued to improve on montelukast, and overall 76% of patients benefited from treatment with montelukast. No clinically important adverse effects were detected.
                These findings show that pruritus in haemodialysis patients is a condition that can be brought under reasonable control by montelukast. Based on this good response to treatment, randomised placebo-controlled studies should be performed to compare the efficacy of montelukast with other drugs in this patient group..

For the phase III trial (CRX016-A), patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 fashion to receive treatment with S-1 plus cisplatin or S-1 alone. Patients who will be the subject of this study are of an age range of 20-70 years. The study will be carried on as a multicenter, randomized phase III trial. If the patients do not qualify for the study, they will receive standard palliative care (per Investigator discretion).

The primary objective of this phase III trial is disease control rate (DCR) measured by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR), or as subjectively assessed by the investigator. Disease control is defined as Complete Response (CR) + Partial Response (PR) + Stable Disease (SD). The secondary objectives are progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the interval between random assignment and documented progression or death, safety assessed by the incidence and severity of all adverse events, and overall survival (OS) defined as the number of participants alive.

Based on the recommendation and the preliminary study results, S-1+CDDP (0.4 g/m2/day S-1 and cisplatin 30 mg/m2 administered on day 1 every 3 weeks) regimen is the treatment of choice for phase III trial. S-1 (40 mg/m2/day) administered orally twice a day for 4 weeks is the active comparator."

There is evidence that treatment with nimodipine or magnesium sulfate after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) reduces the frequency of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI) and subsequent poor outcome. Magnesium appears to have effects on both the cerebral arterial spasm and the ischemic brain injury. The effectiveness of the two drugs can be partly explained by their pharmacodynamic effects. Clinical trials on nimodipine have not produced conclusive results to determine the efficacy of this treatment in patients with aSAH. There are conflicting reports about the effect of nimodipine on blood flow regulation and its potential neuroprotective effect in human subjects. More evidence is needed to confirm that nimodipine can improve long term functional outcome in aSAH patients after acute onset of the disease.
While there is evidence from both animal and human studies suggesting neuroprotective effects of nimodipine and magnesium sulfate, clinical trials to date have not yet fully confirmed the clinical relevance of these drug treatments. Current recommendations for nimodipine administration is for its use as a second-line therapy for treatment of DCI after aSAH. More research is needed to determine the optimal pharmacokinetics, therapeutic dose, treatment duration of both nimodipine and magnesium sulfate to maximize their efficacy and minimize their potential risks in acute or subacute aSAH patients.."

The common cold is a contested term that is loosely defined as an acute, self-limiting infection of the upper respiratory tract. The prevalence of the common cold varies greatly across countries and is more common among children than adults. In children and adults alike, the symptoms of the common cold typically subside with time.

For centuries, people have looked for ways to hasten the resolution of their common cold symptoms. Over-the-counter cold preparations are widely purchased but do not always provide relief of symptoms. Given inconsistent evidence, health professionals cannot recommend with certainty whether or not symptomatic treatments are effective. The most recent Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to judge the effect of antitussives, decongestants, antihistamines, and combinations of medicines on the efficacy and safety of symptomatic therapy in adults with symptoms of the common cold. Most of the available trials included small sample sizes and the quality of the evidence was generally low or very low.

Currently, there is no available evidence to draw robust conclusions about the effectiveness of symptomatic therapies for common cold symptoms in children and adults. Some studies have reported a more favourable effect of symptomatic therapies on nasal congestion and throat symptoms. However, many studies have been of low methodological quality and have lacked statistical power. The evidence was inadequate to allow any conclusions about the effects of symptomatic therapies on quality of life and the effects of treatments on the duration and severity of common cold symptoms.

Larger trials with improved methodological quality are needed to determine whether symptomatic treatments are effective in reducing symptoms of the common cold, even if their role in hastening resolution of common cold symptoms remains uncertain."

There was no conclusive evidence to support the clinical recommendations for the best primary surgical treatment for an acute intracapsular (neck) hip fracture in the frail elderly. Two well-conducted long-term, randomised, controlled trials comparing hemiarthroplasty with total hip arthroplasty supported the view that total hip arthroplasty gave better functional results although it did not markedly reduce the risk of revision surgery. The lack of a difference in the rate and type of postoperative complication reported did not permit any firm conclusions about morbidity or mortality. Further studies are needed to improve the quality and quantity of scientific evidence to inform clinical decision-making.."

Repeat pregnancies in low-income populations are a significant public health concern. Reducing second births can yield long-term health benefits for both women and children. Cell phone counseling, patient education via computer literacy or electronic patient record, or even in-person counseling by a nurse or other healthcare provider has been used to improve postpartum contraceptive use and prevent second births. Overall, these interventions have been effective in reducing rapid second pregnancies among low-income teenage mothers."

While not definitive, the majority of studies suggest the potential of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors as first-line treatment for major depression in children and youth. Efficacy of these agents appears to improve somewhat with longer duration of treatment (up to 8 weeks versus 4 weeks) for citalopram and fluoxetine, whereas there is no added benefit with duloxetine after 8 or 12 weeks of treatment. Treatment nonresponders in randomized controlled trials tend to be more severe and may respond to augmentation or a second medication trial. Efficacy outcomes are not markedly different in youth compared with adults and are similar across gender and age (13-18 years). There are no indications from studies to date that treatment with an adolescent-onset bipolar affective disorder also benefits depressed youth who screen positive for either mood or anxiety disorders as comorbid conditions."

Poor responders to ovulation induction for in vitro fertilization (IVF) have a decreased probability of success. GnRH antagonist protocol appears to be a good alternative in poor responders since there was a reduction in ovarian stimulation protocol days and consumption of gonadotrophins.

Both protocols resulted in similar pregnancy and cancellation rates, and there was no significant difference in the number of mature oocytes retrieved, embryos transferred and birth rate."

The objective of this study was to determine whether treatment with steam inhalation benefits natural and experimental common colds. Twenty volunteers were randomly allocated to receive either heated, humidified air (43 degrees C) or air at room temperature (22 degrees C) intranasally for 20 min on two consecutive days. Twenty-four hours later nasal washings were performed, and volunteers were inoculated intranasally with 10(5.6) to 10(6.1) tissue culture infectious dose 50% of experimental rhinovirus. The course of each volunteer's infection was determined in this blinded randomized trial. In the 20 volunteers ( 10 in each group), there were no significant differences in the severity of cold symptoms with either treatment..

A significant body of literature suggests that glucocorticoid excess, resulting in disruption of the HPA axis, may contribute to the pathophysiology of major depression. Antiglucocorticoid drugs, including ketoconazole, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and mifepristone, have been shown to have antidepressant effects when studied in small numbers of treatment-resistant depressed patients in double-blind placebo-controlled trials, in some studies using very low dose regimens.

Lactulose has a protective effect on colonic bacteria and is more effective than polyethylene glycol in relieving chronic idiopathic constipation. The number of sachets of polyethylene glycol laxative taken by individual children was lower than the recommended three sachets daily. There was a trend towards improved adverse event profiles in patients on polyethylene glycol compared with lactulose, though the number of patients with adverse events was relatively low. Polyethylene glycol was also more effective in relieving chronic constipation in all the trials reviewed. This was associated with fewer side effects than lactulose in most trials. The superiority of polyethylene glycol over lactulose does not therefore seem to lie solely in its superior laxative efficacy, which is more anecdotal than scientific, but also in its greater patient acceptability reflected in patients needing to take smaller doses/units of this polyethylene glycol compared with large doses of highly concentrated lactulose."

There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of massage therapy for low back pain. Therapeutic massage leads to greater improvements in disability, pain relief, and better outcomes among low back pain sufferers compared to usual care or other methods, such as acupuncture, placebo-treated massage or acupressure therapy, relaxation, or self-care education. Future studies will need to compare the relative effectiveness of massage therapy across different cultures to determine the most effective treatments for low back pain.

Based on the passage above, The effectiveness of therapeutic massage for low back pain has been shown by several randomized controlled trials. Massage therapy reduced pain, depression, anxiety and stress hormone levels, and improved range of motion, functioning, and patients' sleep. Massage therapy can be added to usual GP care as an effective alternative to conventional medical care for persistent back pain."

Spending an ever-larger part of health spending, and failing to produce sustained treatment cures, makes it vital to assess and compare possible alternatives in treating African trypanosomiasis (AT). Here we report on a comparison of eflornithine (EFN) and nifurtimox-eflornithine (NECT) as treatment for T.b.gambiense. This study is registered with the WHO Universal Trial Registration system in WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) database for clinical trials. NECT was more effective in achieving treatment cures than EFN; it is therefore, potentially, a first-line treatment option for second-stage T.b.gambiense, the phase where the disease is most severe, and currently, the phase where most of the patient deaths occur.
There is, however, a serious shortage of effective second-line treatments in the present armamentarium.
An important aspect of the WHO strategy to improve AT patients' access to effective treatment is to focus attention on second-stage trypanosomes and to improve the treatment of the disease in a more cost-effective manner.
An important aim of the AT treatment programme has been to develop effective, safe and practical ways to make trypanosomiasis treatment more available in endemic areas.
As an alternative to melarsoprol, EFN offers a number of advantages, including a shorter duration of treatment, an easier administration schedule, and the ability to treat pregnant women.
This phase III trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of oral NECT as first-line treatment of second stage AT caused by T.b.gambiense.
Dose-finding and pharmacokinetic studies in patients treated with NECT and melarsoprol suggested that these two drugs have complementary properties with regard to toxicity: NECT would be less toxic than melarsoprol, and melarsoprol would be less toxic than EFN. The results of a first phase I/II study showed that oral NECT is safe and effective when given in combination with intravenous EFN.

There is limited evidence that motivational interviewing or other brief interventions may be useful in getting adolescents who smoke to stop, but they typically produce small effects and it is unclear how durable these effects are. Some of the studies comparing brief interventions to no treatment have very modest effects. Given the difficulty of recruiting and keeping large numbers of adolescents as participants, a larger number of studies are likely needed to estimate the size of these effects and better evaluate the potential long-term impact of these interventions. Most of the studies evaluating interventions have examined youth who were seen as having a clinical need for cessation services. The inclusion of other adolescents in future studies may help evaluate the effectiveness of such interventions on those who might not be seeking smoking cessation. Several studies of group-based interventions with adolescents have been conducted, but it is unclear whether these are more effective than brief interventions. Additional research is needed to evaluate such approaches as a group intervention and to examine new methods for recruiting and retention of adolescents who smoke.

This review consists of RCTs that focused mainly on cord care in newborns. The effects on cord care on cord separation, colonization, and infection have also been summarized. Dry cord care without any treatment seems to be beneficial to cord separation while not affecting or even decreasing the chance of infection. The use of antiseptic agents during treatment of umbilical stumps was mostly found to be ineffective. Antiseptic treatment may be only beneficial in preterm infants and newborns with a medical history of frequent omphalitis in their family. There is no firm evidence on the effect of various antiseptic agents or specific treatment intervals on colonization and infection. More research is needed to find the most effective way to clean umbilical stumps. In the absence of strong evidence on cord care, the routine use of antiseptics is not recommended.

The effects of community-based exercise programs on the performance of locomotor tasks in patients with stroke are uncertain. Preliminary data shows some benefit. The findings of the included randomised controlled trials are promising although the sample sizes are small. The two exercise protocols which examined the influence of the order of treatment, a structured task-oriented approach and the usual community physiotherapy, did not demonstrate superiority of one over the other in the primary outcome measures, although the data suggest that performance of the upper limb in daily tasks is improved more with a standard 'exercise only' programme than with a specific task-related approach.
Study #5 and #6 found that a task-orientated intervention, focused specifically on performance of lower limb tasks, enhances walking function in the first year post stroke. Study #7 found exercise focusing on dual-task training enhances walking ability in chronic stroke. Study #8 found that a task-oriented progressive resistance strength training programme improved lower extremity muscle strength and functional ability in chronic stroke."

Based on the findings from several studies, the use of PTCA and stent implantation in patients with chronic stable angina appear to be non-inferior to traditional revascularization. With advances in technology, stent implantations have improved procedural success and safety, reducing the need for repeat revascularization procedures in comparison with bypass surgery. Long term outcomes demonstrated that stenting and bypass surgery are approximately equal in safety and efficacy.

Compared with bypass surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention was less expensive in several of the studies reviewed, however this was dependent on patient characteristics such as age and presentation of co-morbidities. Importantly, all of these studies did not have long-term follow-up, and the findings of shorter length of stay for hospitalized patients and lower procedural costs with a shorter duration of hospitalization should be evaluated with a larger base of data to confirm that stenting is indeed less expensive than bypass surgery in the long term.

Future clinical research may help elucidate whether the use of stenting may be a cost effective option for patients with certain coronary artery disease presentations, and whether the need for less-invasive procedures will continue to be supported by the evidence in the years to come."

Amitriptyline may also be used for the treatment of TNP, but its anti-depressant mechanism of action is not well understood. Tocainide and pimozide may be alternative treatment options for TNP.

Magnesium sulfate has emerged as the frontline therapy for the prevention of eclampsia in severe pre-eclampsia. Evidence for its efficacy is weak, however. There is little good-quality evidence to address the important issue of the value of prophylaxis for pre-eclampsia, so the decision to prophylactically treat with magnesium sulfate is largely based on anecdotal evidence and practice. A pragmatic, randomised, controlled trial compared magnesium sulfate with usual care in women with mild/moderate pre-eclampsia in a broad range of settings across 16 countries. Women randomised to magnesium sulfate (n = 1106) received a three-hour loading dose of 8 g magnesium administered by continuous intravenous infusion, followed by a maintenance infusion of 4 g/hour until 12 hours after delivery. The standard and usual care group (n = 1077) received standard care in line with hospital protocols. A prespecified interim analysis was carried out, taking into account 3930 women with a median of 14.7 months of follow-up. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome of eclampsia. Compared with magnesium sulfate, usual care resulted in a significantly higher incidence of a composite outcome of severe maternal outcomes (death, HELLP syndrome, disseminated intravascular coagulation, pulmonary oedema, stroke), although the evidence was weak (RR 1.17, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.37).

Acetaminophen, a mild analgesic, may be used alone in many instances of mild pain in various locations, including the upper face, head, and limbs. Acetaminophen is effective for pain relief when given by mouth or by rectum. Although its analgesic effect may be slow to develop, it is reliable and predictable. It may also be used before, during, or after a painful procedure.

Acetaminophen is effective for fever reduction, but the doses used for anti-pyretics are usually much higher than those recommended for analgesia. The duration of fever reduction is short and acetaminophen is not anti-inflammatory. As the treatment of choice for analgesia, acetaminophen has been compared with several other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as well as with aspirin. In most instances, the analgesic effects of acetaminophen were comparable to aspirin but less than the effects of NSAIDs. However, several factors appear to influence the response to acetaminophen and the analgesic and anti-pyretic effects of acetaminophen are less predictable than those of most NSAIDs.

A large placebo-controlled trial of 11 common analgesics, including aspirin, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and codeine, revealed that acetaminophen had little analgesic effect in patients with post-surgical pain. A recent double-blind study of 100 patients with post-operative pain after removal of a surgically impacted third molar demonstrated that a single oral dose of aspirin, 1000 mg, provided significantly more pain relief than did a higher dose of acetaminophen, 1000 mg, or a combination of acetaminophen and codeine phosphate, 600 mg with 60 mg of codeine.

The combination of caffeine with aspirin and acetaminophen was of benefit in pain relief. In addition, low dose aspirin, as well as caffeine in combination with aspirin, appears to have an analgesic potency that is greater than the sum of its individual components.."

In conclusion, numerous studies on the efficacy and safety of ciclesonide and budesonide have been published over the past few years. These studies have demonstrated the safety of ciclesonide, with no significant difference between ciclesonide and budesonide in reducing hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis outcomes (plasma cortisol response to stimulation with corticotropin-releasing factor, 24-h urine cortisol levels) and no significant difference between drugs in their effects on asthma exacerbations. Ciclesonide and budesonide are similarly effective in improving airway outcomes, but there are significantly greater beneficial effects of ciclesonide compared to budesonide for asthma symptoms and quality of life. The most recent evidence from head-to-head studies suggests that ciclesonide 160 microg QD is slightly better than current lower doses of budesonide for improving asthma symptoms and quality of life, yet neither drug induces candidiasis, suppresses lung function or cortisol levels at therapeutic doses.."

Current antidepressant medication is effective for treating depression. The first evidence concerning the effectiveness of psychological treatment was reported for problem solving therapy. Since then, various psychological treatments have been evaluated in randomized trials, although there have been few adequate comparisons of these treatments. Further, little evidence exists on the efficacy of antidepressants when prescribed by general practitioners. Thus the findings of the current report are of particular relevance.
Combining psychological treatment with medication can be a useful adjunct, although this has not always been demonstrated.
The most striking improvement was achieved by escitalopram 10 mg/day. This treatment was superior to placebo treatment from week 1 onwards. Antidepressant patients taking escitalopram 10 mg or 20 mg/day showed a lower frequency of relapse than patients who have discontinued treatment. Patients taking tricyclic antidepressants showed better improvement than those taking selective serotonin or norepinephrinephrine uptake inhibitors.
The clinical trials of antidepressant (or antidepressant plus psychotherapy) treatment in GPs show that antidepressant treatment is of benefit to most patients with DSM-IV depressive illness. In the trial with citalopram a large effect size was found.
There is some uncertainty over the use of antidepressants for treating the minor depression that is very common in patients attending their doctors with psychological problems. Our results lend no support to the view that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medication and problem solving therapy are the treatments of choice for patients with minor depression although both treatments have some proven benefit for patients with major depression. When using medication, we recommend that trial data be used in determining the appropriate treatment, but note that these data are derived mainly from trials of major depression.
Excessive reliance on drugs does not encourage the exploration of the many other interventions that may be useful in treating depressive illness, but they cannot be ignored, and there is a need for more clinical trials of the comparative use of alternative treatments."

Despite international recommendations for influenza vaccination, it is not consistently provided to health-care workers and institutionalized elderly persons. We sought to determine whether vaccinating health-care workers would reduce mortality of elderly patients in long-term-care institutions. In a randomized, cluster controlled trial (12 nursing-home-size units), we observed that although less than half of the health-care workers were vaccinated against influenza, the use of the vaccine significantly reduced both all-cause and influenza-related mortality in long-term-care patients. Infectious-diseases-related hospitalizations did not differ between facilities in which a high volume of vaccines was available compared to controls.

Influenza vaccination of health care workers in long-term-care hospitals reduces the mortality of elderly patients.. Vaccination of health-care workers (HCWs) is recommended as a strategy for preventing influenza in elderly patients in long-term care. However, there have been no controlled studies to show whether this approach is effective. During the winter of 1994-1995, 1059 patients in 12 geriatric medical long-term-care sites, randomized for vaccination of HCWs, were studied. In hospitals where HCWs were offered vaccination, 653 (61%) of 1078 were vaccinated. Vaccination of HCWs was associated with reductions in total patient mortality from 17% to 10% (odds ratio [OR], 0.56; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.40-0.80) and in influenza-like illness (OR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.94). Vaccination of patients was not associated with significant effects on mortality (OR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.81-1.64).

A Cochrane review (7) found that there was no evidence which supported the effectiveness of pelvic-floor rehabilitation for post-prostatectomy incontinence, although there was insufficient evidence to rule out a clinical benefit. 
The majority of evidence regarding pelvic floor rehabilitation for post-prostatectomy incontinence has been examined in RCTs assessing a range of techniques. However, given the poor quality of evidence regarding pelvic-floor rehabilitation, the authors found that it is unlikely that randomised trials will add sufficient evidence to assess the benefit or not of pelvic-floor rehabilitation. 
Other systematic reviews have been produced; these have reached varying conclusions. One review (8) concluded that pelvic floor rehabilitation should be considered as a safe treatment for post-radical prostatectomy incontinence, while another (9) found that pelvic floor rehabilitation was more effective than incontinence training alone for treating post-radical prostatectomy incontinence.

Elevated blood pressure (BP) is a major public health problem and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke. The prevalence of elevated BP increases with age and this is a major concern with the expected increase in the elderly population. Given that the management of BP to prevent CVD is inefficient and costly, there is a need for nonpharmacologic alternatives to treat hypertension in older persons. The current trials provide good evidence that weight loss and reduced sodium intake can be effective and safe (in terms of adverse effects, tolerability, and attrition) for reducing the risk of hypertension. Long-lasting weight reduction may lead to a reduction in hypertension incidence, all-cause mortality, and medical expenditures, especially if it is combined with reduced sodium intake. Both interventions are safe although long-term intervention with both strategies simultaneously is not well studied. Thus, in the management of hypertension, reduced dietary sodium intake and moderate, long-lasting weight loss may be added to the arsenal of nonpharmacologic methods to treat hypertension in older persons.
It is unclear if any other risk-factor targets have an effect on hypertension incidence. There is insufficient evidence to determine whether other changes, for example, increased physical activity, reduced alcohol intake or reduced potassium excretion, are effective in reducing the risk of hypertension.
Although the present trials have yielded promising results, the magnitude of benefit that is achievable may have been underestimated because these studies were conducted in highly selected populations. Long-term and cost-effective studies in the unselected elderly populations are needed to determine if the interventions are effective and cost-effective among the elderly population. Randomized long-term studies are necessary to determine if the potential benefits of antihypertensive therapy can be reproduced without pharmacologic intervention."

The use of cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, antibodies, and other biological agents to control growth and functioning of cancer cells offers great potential in the future of cancer treatment.
At present, only a few biological agents are available and approved for cancer treatment. Monoclonal antibodies, which target receptors on the surface of cancer cells, are probably the most promising of these biological agents. These antibodies are designed to seek out and destroy cancer cells without harming normal cells.
Another type of biologic therapy uses drugs that stimulate immune cells to kill cancer cells. One example is interferon, a drug that stimulates white blood cells to produce tumor necrosis factor, which can attack and kill cancer cells.
Although biologic therapies offer new and more effective ways to treat cancer, they pose several additional problems. Biologic agents are difficult and expensive to make, they are not as widely available as traditional cancer treatments, and many are not yet FDA approved for cancer treatment.
New drugs are expensive in early studies, and then are priced lower when they are released. It is possible that the new drug or medicine may not work the same way or have the same effect on your body as it does on others.
Researchers are trying to develop new biologic therapies. The next step in biologic therapy is to combine drugs to attack cancer cells. Another possibility is combining biologic therapy with chemotherapy, which may reduce the side effects of chemotherapy.
Scientists believe that the future of cancer treatment, however, will be a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and biologic therapy. These combinations will be developed to fit the individual needs of the patient. They will become more common as the results of new studies become available."

Further research is needed to determine the ideal dosage and duration of treatment for preventing colorectal cancer and to better understand the mechanisms of chemoprevention with these medications."

Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies are performed in cases of concern for prostate cancer. Antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended to reduce the risk of bacteriuria and sepsis, but the ideal antimicrobial regimen and duration are not well-defined. We searched four electronic databases using a combination of MeSH terms and then selected randomized controlled trials that compared any type of antimicrobial prophylaxis with no prophylaxis or no comparator. The antibiotics most commonly tested in the trials were pivmecillinam (a urease inhibitor), cefuroxime (a first-generation cephalosporin), levofloxacin (a fourth-generation fluoroquinolone), and various combinations thereof. We evaluated whether the antimicrobial regimens tested were superior to no prophylaxis or no comparator in terms of the presence of bacteriuria. Data were pooled for each drug. Forty-one trials were included, representing 4294 patients. Of these, 11 trials involved 1609 patients receiving antibiotic prophylaxis and 14 trials involved 2867 patients receiving no prophylaxis or a no-comparator control. Meta-analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of bacteriuria with prophylactic use without any significant differences among the individual antibiotics studied. The number needed to treat to prevent one episode of bacteriuria varied between 13 and 54, depending on the antibiotic used. This review demonstrates that prophylactic use of various antimicrobial regimens is an effective treatment for reducing bacteriuria following transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies. No strong evidence is available to support the use of any particular antibiotic or antibiotic regimen.."

According to The Nutrient Recommendations & Dietary Guidelines for Pregnant & Breastfeeding Women, pregnant women should increase their intake of folate, iron, calcium, and vitamin D to support the growth and development of the fetus. They should also aim to achieve a healthy weight gain, and consume a balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods. Exercise can be beneficial during pregnancy, but pregnant women should check with their healthcare provider before starting or continuing any exercise program. Lifestyle interventions such as low-carbohydrate diets and exercise training can be effective in managing gestational diabetes, but may not be suitable for all pregnant women.

Furthermore, The Nutrient Recommendations for Pregnancy in Canada states that pregnant women should consume a total of 18 to 24 grams of protein per day from a variety of protein sources to support fetal development and healthy weight gain. Protein requirements may vary depending on the woman's pre-pregnancy weight and activity level. Pregnant women should aim to consume adequate amounts of iron, including through fortified foods or supplements, to prevent iron deficiency. Adequate folate and vitamin D intake is also important for the health of the mother and the fetus.

Several randomized controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions in reducing weight gain and the risk of gestational diabetes. Some studies have found that regular weight monitoring and individualized counseling on physical activity and diet can reduce excessive gestational weight gain and the incidence of gestational diabetes. However, the overall effect is modest, and there is still a need for further research into the optimal strategies for preventing excessive weight gain and gestational diabetes in at-risk pregnant women.

In summary, it is important for pregnant women to follow a healthy diet and engage in physical activity to support the health of both themselves and their unborn child. Excessive weight gain during pregnancy can lead to complications such as gestational diabetes, and lifestyle interventions can be effective in preventing excessive weight gain. Pregnant women should check with their healthcare provider to determine the appropriate nutrient intake and exercise recommendations for their individual needs."
